Item 1. BUSINESS
Company Background.
 
Focus Universal Inc. (the “Company”, “we”, “us” or “our”) is a Nevada corporation that is a provider of handheld sensor devices and wholesaler of various air filters.
 
We are based in the City of Ontario, California, and were incorporated in Nevada in 2012. In December 2013, we filed an S-1 registration statement that went effective on March 14, 2014. Since then our securities have been trading in the OTCQB Market.
 
Our website is www.focusuniversal.com. Our website and the information contained therein or connected thereto are not intended to be incorporated into this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 
Focus Universal Inc. is a universal smart instrumentation platform developer, developer of instrument sensors, and creator of a universal smart device called the Ubiquitor universal smart instrument (the “Ubiquitor”). We are also a wholesaler of various air filtration systems, though filtration system wholesaling is no longer our primary focus. We are currently in the process of researching, developing, and assembling a universal smart instrument device and working on specializing in the development and commercialization of such universal smart technology and instruments. We define universal smart technology as commercial technology with an integrated platform, which provides a unique and universal solution for test and measurement made up of off-the-shelf parts. We are working on developing a universal sensor node and gateway system that uses the data processing capabilities of a smartphone to display readings of multiple probe modules. 
 
Our universal smart instrumentation technology features a Universal Smart Instrumentation Platform (“USIP”) generalizes instruments into a reusable foundation representing a majority part of the instruments, and architecture-specific components (sensor modules), which together replaces the functions of traditional instruments at a fraction of their cost. The USIP has an open architecture incorporating a variety of individual instrument functions, sensors and probes from different industries and vendors. The platform features the ability to connect thousands of sensors or probes. This technology addresses major limitations with traditional hardware and represents another technological advancement in the Internet of Things marketplace. We call this device the “Ubiquitor” because it can be used to wirelessly measure and test a variety of electrical and physical phenomena such as voltage, current, temperature, pressure, sound, light, and humidity.
 
The Ubiquitor, which we have created and assembled in limited quantities, utilizes a standard desktop computer with Mac OS, Windows OS, an Android-based or iOS-based smartphone, or mobile tablet device as a platform that communicates with a group of sensors or probes manufactured by different vendors in a manner that requires the user to have little or no knowledge of their unique characteristics. The data readout is displayed on the computer, smartphone, or tablet display in a program or application we have created for Windows PC and are creating for MacOS. We are designing the application software (the “App”) to have a graphical representation of control and indicator elements common in real instruments such as knobs, buttons, dials, and graphs, etc. Our developers are designing and implementing a soft control touch screen interface which supports real-time data monitoring and facilitates instrument control and operation.

Scientific Instrument Research, Development and Sales
 
Industry Background and Overview. 
 
Universal Smart Technologies
 
Through our acquisition of Perfecular Inc., we entered into the scientific instrument industry, specifically the instrument sensor industry. Instrument sensors are devices specifically designed and constructed for sensing and measuring physical variables that are useful in: (i) industrial operations; (ii) environmental, commercial and medical applications; (iii) research and development in a variety of industries; and (iv) the daily lives of electronics consumers. Our research and development of the Ubiquitor and accompanying application is an instrument that will have several instrument sensor applications.
 
We believe that instrument sensors are important in modern science, having applications in both the industrial and educational fields. In recent years, significant progress has been made in instruments and instrumentation systems. The performance of measuring and monitoring instruments has improved considerably in the computer age. Analog instruments are used to indicate the magnitude of the quantity in the form of pointer movements. Digital instruments, on the other hand, specify the quantity in a digital readout format, they can be read easily, and are more accurate than the analog multi-meters because the pointer movements can be easily misread and are often not permanently stored, reducing interpolation and reading errors. Digital instruments offer significant advantages over analog devices. The auto-polarity function of digital devices prevents various problems. Parallax error which occurs when the pointer of an analog instrument is viewed from a different angle, which may cause users to see and read a different value are eliminated as well. Digital instruments are free from wear and potential shock failures because they have no moving parts. With the advancements in technology of integrated circuits, digital instruments are becoming increasingly compact and accurate. Key market players of analog and digital instruments include Thermo Fisher Scientific, Danaher Corporation, Mettler Toledo, Metrohm USA, Hanna Instruments, Agilent Technologies, and Perkin Elmer.
 
Most modern instruments are digital. They are designed for measuring various physical quantities in objects; and consist of the following functional components:
 
Data acquisition: This is the process of sampling signals that measure real world physical conditions and converting the resulting samples into digital numeric values that can be manipulated by a microprocessor. The components of data acquisition systems include:
 

a. | Sensors, to convert physical parameters to electrical signals.
---+---------------------------------------------------------------


b. | Signal conditioning circuitry, to convert sensor signals into a form that can be converted to digital values.
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


c. | Analog-to-digital converters, to convert conditioned sensor signals to digital values. It normally operates on conditioned signals, that is, signals that have already been filtered and amplified by analog circuits.
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Storage and communication components:
 

i. | Application-specific input/output (I/O) components. In digital instrumentation systems, the transmission of data between devices is realized relatively easily by using serial or parallel transmission techniques.
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


ii. | Ancillaries such as displays and power supplies and application specific software.

Traditional hardware-centered instrumentation systems are made up of multiple stand-alone instruments that are interconnected to carry out a determined measurement or control an operation. They have fixed vendor-defined functionality, are very powerful, large, expensive and cumbersome. They also require a lot of power and often have excessive amounts of features that are not user friendly. Users generally cannot extend or customize them easily. The knobs and buttons on the instrument, the built-in circuitry and the functions available to the user, are specific to the nature of the instrument.
 
Virtual instruments represent a fundamental shift from traditional hardware-centered instrumentation systems, to software-centered systems that exploit the computing power, productivity, display, and connectivity capabilities of popular desktop computers and workstations. The functionality of these stand-alone instruments can be implemented in a digital environment by using computers, plug-in data-acquisition boards, and support software to implement the functions of the system. The plug-in data acquisition boards enable the interface of analog signals to computer, and the software allows programming of the computer to look and function as an instrument. The major advantage of virtual instrumentation is its flexibility. Changing function simply requires a modification of the supporting software. Whereas the same change in a traditional system may require adding or substituting a stand-alone instrument, which is more difficult and also more expensive. Virtual instruments also offer advantages in displaying and storing information. Computer display can show more colors and allow users to quickly change the format of displaying the data that is received by the instrument.
 
Instrument inter-operability and connectivity allow devises to communicate and work with other instruments manufactured by different vendors, in a manner that requires the user to have little or no knowledge of the unique characteristics of those instruments. Traditional instruments, including traditional hardware-centered instrumentations and software centered virtual instrumentations, are specifically designed, constructed and refined to perform one or more specific tasks. When manufacturers develop these instruments, they naturally seek ways to differentiate their products from those of their competitors. Most of the instruments on the market come with a variety of connectivity technologies and do not have the built-in firmware and software to support the connectivity and inter-operability of instruments. Even instruments within in the same class, from different vendors, are not compatible. In 1998, National Instruments, along with other companies including Agilent, Advantest, Anritsu, Ascor, BAE systems, Boeing, Ericsson, Genrad, Honeywell, IFR, Keithley, Lecroy, Nokia, Northrop Grumman, Racal, Ratheon, Rohde & Schwarz, Smiths, Tektronix, Teradyne, and Wavetek formed the interchangeable virtual machine foundation. Interchangeable Virtual Instruments (IVI) is a revolutionary standard for instrument driver software technology. It attempts to standardize the commands to which specific kinds of instruments respond, and also makes it possible to interchange instruments in a test system without drastically revising the application software and maximizing interchangeability across instrument brands. Unfortunately, while the instrument driver did simplify software development and maintenance, it didn’t address hardware obsolescence as each manufacturer had their own and none were compatible. Current applications are limited to large, expensive test and measurement instruments.
 
A universal instrument is a versatile device which combines many individual instrument functions, sensors and probes in a single unit. It has a primary purpose, but also incorporates other instrument’s functionalities. One instrument could perform many different measurements and control and substitute many other instruments. It utilizes a variety of probes to connect to the device for a wide variety of process measurement and control. A universal instrument offers superior sensor or probe compatibility, versatility, inter-operability, connectivity and scalability. Theoretically, it is feasible to design a universal instrument which is compatible with all sensors or probes on the market, and capable of monitoring and controlling any combination of sensors or probes.
 
Despite the undoubted usefulness of the universal instruments, one of the major obstacles that prevent the universal instruments from being adopted by end users is their cost. The end user who just needs a $10 traditional instrument for his applications certainly does not have the motivation to spend $1,000 for functions he does not need. Functionality always needs to be balanced against cost. The knobs and buttons on analog instruments, the built-in circuitry, and the functions available to the user, are specific to the nature of the instrument, making them very expensive and hard to adapt.

Smartphones and tablets have been considered recreational devices for communicating, playing games and streaming videos, but they are also one of the most powerful tools engineers use for designing, validating, and producing products. These ubiquitous smartphones perform better than most instrumentation in many fields. Because of their network connectivity, smartphones and tablets are great tools for remotely viewing measurements. In addition, the processing capabilities have exploded in recent years with processors and data capability rivaling that of very recent laptop computers. Thus, their small size and processing power also makes them effective for portable measurements. The ubiquity of wireless connectivity, unlimited data plans, and more powerful cellular networks combined with increasing functionality and the speed of connected devices and mobile networks will further drive consumer demand for more cost-effective wireless smartphone-based instruments. Building an application for a smartphone or tablet and turning a smartphone or tablet to an instrument is not a trivial task. Many of the industrial instrument manufacturers have limited or no expertise programming for mobile platforms and designing wireless hardware. To help industrial instrument manufacturers take advantage of these smart devices, Perfecular Inc., has dedicated many years of research and development efforts into designing, assembling, marketing and promoting wireless smart technology and products for industrial measuring instruments.
 
Our universal smart development protocol focuses not only on the design of the hardware and software modules, but also on the design of the overall universal smart instruments system, guided by the structured, universal and modular principles. We make our development open to industrial instrument manufacturers, software, and hardware developers.
 
Compatibility: The compatibility in universal smart instrument system refers not only to the compatibility between the same types of industrial sensor instruments from different manufactures, but also to the compatibility between various industrial instrument types. The full inter-operability and absolute instrument interchangeability is constantly addressed in our development protocol.
Universality: It is our goal to incorporate as many functionalities of the traditional industrial sensor instruments into a single unit, allowing different data acquisition sensor modules to execute on the same mobile platform. Thus, the interoperability between various sensors or probes can be achieved.
Upgradeability: Most traditional industrial instrument sensor interfaces are unidirectional applications, meaning the instrument performs its task and transmits results to the interface device in one direction only. They only perform monitoring tasks and share a majority of functions of the bi-directional controlling instruments, however, they cannot be upgraded to controllers. End users have to purchase a new controlling instrument for their applications. Taking advantage of the secure bi-directional wireless communications and interface supported by smartphones or mobile devices, universal smart instruments, which deliver data back-and-forth between the smartphones and industrial sensors, can be readily modified or upgraded by adding the corresponding actuators for controlling applications. Sensors or probes measure the output performance of the device being controlled and give feedback to the input actuators that can make corrections towards the desired performance. 
Expandability and Scalability: Similar to existing sensor network technology, our universal smart instruments are more flexible than sensor networks. They can currently monitor and control hundreds of different sensors or probes. They automatically identify and configure the corresponding graphical user interfaces that are connected to the Universal Smart Instruments. End users are free to add or removes sensors or probes from the universal smart instruments. All communication protocols supported by smartphones are integrated in the software design including WI-FI, blue tooth, cellular network technology and wired form through the audio port on the smartphone.
Security: Universal smart instruments have the sensor security built-in data acquisition module and help companies meet sensor security requirements, preventing unauthorized users from accessing the sensor measurements and control. Unauthorized access of the universal smart instruments sensors is forbidden.

Modularity: Increasing instrument complexity is driving instruments to become more modular. The knobs and buttons on the instrument, the built-in circuitry, and the functions available to the user used in traditional stand-alone instruments duplicate these components for each instrument, adding cost and size. Universal smart instruments divide all instruments into three parts: (i) smartphones including their application software, (ii) wireless communication module (we called it universal smart device), which is not needed in the wired form, and (iii) task-specific data acquisition module. Our universal smart devices were developed and assembled by us with parts that were shipped to us from China. Both hardware and software, including wired or wireless communication protocols, were developed and well tested. The only work needed to be done are the design and manufacture of the task-specific data acquisition, which is just a fraction of the traditional stand-alone instrument design. The high degree of modularity saves a lot of time in development, maintenance, and support. Modular hardware and software limit the time needed to test products so developers can spend more of their energy on innovation.
 
Universal smart instruments share many similarities, in terms of functionalities and advantages, with virtual instruments. They are both soft-centered technologies. However, developing the software for virtual instrumentation is not trivial, a programming language or special software can be used. Professional software engineers with virtual instrument expertise are needed. A virtual instrument consists of an industry-standard computer or workstation equipped with powerful application software, cost-effective hardware such as plug-in boards, and driver software, which together perform the functions of traditional instruments. Its primary focus is on large, expensive, testing and measurement instruments, not portable devices. Because of the unique nature of the smartphone operating systems such as iOS or Android, which are significantly different from those used in industry-standard computers or workstations, the migration of virtual instrument technology from industry-standard computers or workstations to mobile devices such as smartphones is not straight forward. Virtual Instrument Software Architecture, commonly known as VISA is a comprehensive package for configuring, programming, and troubleshooting instrumentation systems comprised of GPIB, Serial, VXI, PXI, Ethernet, and USB interfaces which are wired forms of communications and widely used in traditional instruments. Universal smart instruments adopt ubiquitous wireless connectivity for communications between a sensor and the smartphone. The wired form communications used in virtual instruments cannot be applied to wireless communications supported by smartphones. Industry-standard computers or workstations have more powerful computational capability, memories and storage to deal with demanding applications in modern industrial measurement systems than those found on smartphones. The software architecture designed in universal smart instruments is significantly different from that of virtual instruments. There are many applications running on smartphones. Universal smart instrument software should not interfere with other software. Mobile application programming and wireless communication technologies are the major holdup for instrument engineers who do not have the mobile application programming and wireless communication expertise.
 
Focus Universal Inc. provided a comprehensive package including both universal instrument application software for smartphones or mobile devices, and hardware for wireless communications between smartphones and sensors, called universal smart device. These technologies, including instrument protocol, completely eliminate those holdups. No smartphone programming and/or wireless communication knowledge are required, instrument engineers just use their traditional embedded programming and spend a small fraction of their time coding the instrument specification into the data acquisition modules including sensors or probes according to the universal smart protocol, and then enjoy the huge hardware reduction and more functionalities provided or supported by the smartphone. The instrument design was simplified to the data acquisition design; all other functions were achieved by the universal smart instrument software. Universal smart technology offers the potential to standardization of the instrument design.
 
Universal smart technologies are designed so that a single software package and hardware support all instrumentation applications, no new software and hardware is needed. Traditional instrument manufacturers still migrate from their traditional instruments to the state-of-the-art universal wireless smart instruments seamlessly. Instrumentation is a huge industry which covers a variety of industry fields including commercial, industrial, military, medical, healthcare, scientific and daily life. It is very difficult to estimate its market value; Bain & Company issued a report predicting that the impact of the Internet of Things market on the global economy might be as high as $520 billion by 2021, more than double the $235 billion spent in 20171. The Internet of Things is just a fraction of the instrumentation market.

Our Approach to Measurement and Sensing
 
We hope to offer a different approach that links handheld devices and instrument sensors with the computing power that is available on common smartphones through a mobile application on the smartphone in both iOS and Android devices. Tapping into the computing power of a smartphone enables a standard measurement device to increase its capabilities—yet, we believe very few scientific instrument sensor platforms are harnessing this power. The application instantly measures the instrument readouts from the Ubiquitor through a Wi-Fi or Bluetooth connection.
 
We also offer an array of traditional handheld meters through our wholesale distribution platform. The design, development, and use of these products have led us to look for more robust handheld digital sensor concepts, which eventually led us to develop the Ubiquitor Wireless Universal Sensor Device.
 
Ubiquitor Wireless Universal Sensor Device
 
Our “Ubiquitor,” device is a handheld fully modular system with a universal sensor node and gateway system that uses a smartphone as the output display module that displays the readings of various probe modules. We have completed and initial production run of prototype devices and intend to develop them into full-scale production. The Ubiquitor is a wireless sensor device that combines measuring tools with smartphone technology to quickly deliver sensor node data on desktop and mobile phone screens. The Ubiquitor’s sensor analytics system integrates event-monitoring, storage and analytics software in a cohesive package that provides a holistic view of sensor data it is reading.
 
The physical hardware consists of:
 

1. | The sensor probes, which come in hundreds of different varieties of sensor instruments in the form of a USB stick, with both male and female ports; and
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | The main hardware gateway, a small cell phone size device with integrated circuits.
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
This device can connect up to 2,500 sensor instruments, and integrate data using embedded software to display the data and all analytics onto a digital screen (desktop or mobile displays) using a Wi-Fi connection. Most types of probes can connect to the hardware. If the sensor size is bigger than the standard probe size, it is possible to simply use a USB cable to connect the probe and the hub. All data and analytics are displayed on a single screen, with tools that record and keep track of all measurements, and sort and display analytic information in easy to read charts.
 
The Ubiquitor is a general platform that collects data in real time, up to 100hz per second, and thus is intended to be adapted to many industrial uses.
 
The Ubiquitor is a multipurpose wireless intelligent sensor device. Its greatest advantage is universal compatibility. Currently, the Ubiquitor device could simultaneously accommodate more than 256 different types of sensor heads. Users could use their smartphones to simultaneously operate and monitor over 256 kinds of sensor readings. With our technology, users only need to obtain the sensor heads, facilitating ease and convenience of use. Using a smartphone, users can collect and analyze data in real time.
 
By using the smartphone as a substitute platform, we believe we will achieve the following efficiencies:
 

1. | Cut production costs. Smartphone technology will advance and become more widely used than the vast majority of products available on the small sensor device market. By utilizing smartphone technology, the Ubiquitor will add superior functionality and performance, improve the product’s quality and cut production costs
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Reduce the effort required to develop a new sensor product. With the Ubiquitor, we believe that there will be no need for device manufacturers to research and develop the new monitoring and operating components because they will just need to develop new sensor heads based on our software technology.
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | Reduce clutter. It is anticipated that the Ubiquitor dispenses with the hassle of hooking up cables, since it is based on wireless transmission of data.

Other Traditional Handheld Meters
 
We also offer an array of traditional handheld meters through our wholesale distribution platform.
 
Filter and Handheld Meter Wholesaler
 
We are a wholesaler of various filtration products and digital meters. We source our products from various manufacturers in China in bulk and then sell to a major U.S. distributor who resells our products directly to consumers through retail distribution channels.
 
Specifically, we sell the following products:
 
Fan Speed Adjuster device. We provide a fan speed adjuster device to retailers and distributors. Designed specifically for centrifugal fans with brushless motors, our adjuster device helps ensure longer life by preventing damage to fan motors by adjusting the speed of centrifugal fans without causing the motor to hum. These devices are rated for 350 watts max, have 120VAC voltage capacity and feature an internal, electronic auto-resetting circuit breaker.
 
Carbon filter devices. We also sell two types of carbon filter devices to distributors. These Carbon filter devices are professional grade filters specifically designed and used to filter air in greenhouses that might be polluted by fermenting organics. One of these filters can be attached to a centrifugal fan to scrub the air in a constant circle or can be attached to an exhaust line as a single pass filter, which moves air out of the growing area and filters unwanted odors and removes pollens, dust, and other debris in the air. The other filter is designed to be used with fans from 0-6000 C.F.M.
 
HEPA filtration device. We provide an organic air high efficiency particulate arrestance (“HEPA”) filtration device at wholesale prices to distributors and retailers. Manufactured, tested, certified, and labeled in accordance with current HEPA filter standards, this device is targeted towards greenhouses and grow rooms and designed to keep insects, bacteria, and mold out of grow rooms. We sell these devices in various sizes.
 
Digital light meter. We provide a handheld digital light meter that is used to measure luminance in fc units, or foot-candles. The meter we sell is designed to be full cosine corrected for the angular incidence of light (meaning if you are not holding the sensor perpendicular to the light source, the sensor will still read the light correctly). The meter has a built-in low battery indicator and is designed to accurately measure to 40,000 FC.
 
Quantum par meter. We provide a handheld quantum par meter used to measure photosynthetically active radiation (“PAR”). This fully portable handheld PAR meter is designed to measure PAR flux in wavelengths ranging from 400 to 700 nm. It is designed to measure up to 10,000 umol.
 
Strategy
 
Strategy and Marketing Plan
 
We have successfully designed, assembled, marketed and distributed our electronic measurement devices, such as temperature humidity meters, digital meters, quantum PAR meters, pH meters, TDS meters and CO2 monitors, for many years through Hydrofarm, our sole distribution platform. The universal smart technology has been applied to our existing traditional devices and demonstrated functionality and hardware cost savings. We believe we have achieved hardware cost savings in the range of 70% to 90%. Prototypes were sent to certain test consumers for demonstrations and evaluation. We completed the production of certain pilot assembly runs. The first round of pilot production was completed in May 2016. The second round of pilot production was completed in July 2016. We are continuing our future strategic and marketing plans by thoroughly testing the products produced in these assembling runs, however, the products from our first and second pilot productions may still be offered for sale in the future.

Smartphones are an integral part of our wireless universal smart technology system. Both wireless and wired communication connectivity are used and targeted on different applications. In wired connectivity, the data acquisition module is connected through the audio port in the smartphone. The smartphone is used to replace a traditional instrument. Compared with the wireless solution, the wireless communication module or even the power supply used for data acquisition module are eliminated in the design, as a consequence of this some hardware costs are saved. End users are not able to access the sensors or probes remotely. We believe that the instruments based on wired universal smart technology are not as convenient as their wireless counterparts. Currently, in the industry, however, wired instruments are cheaper.
 
We believe that being the first ones in the market could provide a significant and sustained market-share advantage over later competitors because we can update our product based on user applications that will become apparent after we have a critical mass of users. We are attempting to convert our existing instruments to universal smart Ubiquitor devices and market the Ubiquitor to our existing customers and hopefully gain new customers.
 
We are putting together an internal sales team in order to establish and optimize our marketing efforts.
 
We believe that wireless universal smart technology will play a critical role for traditional industrial instrument manufacturers, as it is too expensive and difficult to develop industrial instrument sensors for medium or smaller companies. The cost factor is the first consideration when deciding whether a company wants to develop smart wireless technologies and implement them in their products. There are hundreds of thousands of instrument manufacturers and hundreds of billions of dollars of revenue for this manufacturing industry in China.1 We plan to open a sales department in China dedicated to promoting our technologies to local instrument manufacturers.
 
Smartphones have been seamlessly integrated into our daily life. A large number of functions and services have become accessible to the masses through the use of smart phones. The proliferation of the smartphone and its user-friendly interface, which allows access to digital information, will cause these devices to become a crucial part of our wireless universal smart instruments.
 
Our goals over the next three years include:
 

· | Raise capital to move to full assembling and production for our Ubiquitor device;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Partner with instrument manufacturers and promote the adoption of our Ubiquitor platform by actual instrument manufacturers, who we think will be the biggest adopters of our Ubiquitor product;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Launch a direct-to-consumer sales and distribution effort for the Ubiquitor;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Continue to develop market share in our wholesale distribution of sensors and filters by adding another customer, hopefully one with a robust distribution platform; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In order to achieve these goals, we intend to focus on the following initiatives:
 

· | Position the Ubiquitor product as the industry standard in universal wireless sensor reading technology;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Establish strategic supply chain channels to facilitate efficient production operations; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Communicate the product and service differentiation through direct networking and effective marketing.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Distribution Method
 
We intend to continue to engage in relationships with Chinese manufacturers and then distribute our products to distributors and retailers directly from the Chinese manufacturers and then we intend to distribute the Ubiquitor by selling directly to traditional instrument manufacturers. We believe that traditional instrument manufacturers will adopt this technology because it will be so cost-effective compared to what they are using and also since the Ubiquitor device will consolidate various other sensors into one single device.
 
We intend to manufacture and market the Ubiquitor and sell it directly to consumers or distributors using internet marketing and also using channels such as Amazon.com and to launch the product through direct-to-consumer platform sites that pre-sell products like indiegogo and kickstarter.com. We also intend to establish a marketing department overseas in China.
 
Raw Materials
 
The electronic components used in the Ubiquitor are common and can be easily purchased through a variety of suppliers with little advance notice. Production and assembly lines are also available worldwide, though we complete our assembly in our Ontario, California facility. On October 1, 2018 we entered into an agreement with Beijing Hengnar Technology Development Co., Ltd., to develop certain infrared online gas analyzer products that detect O2, CO, CO2, H2, Nox, SF6 and other gases.
Manufacturing and Assembly
 
We currently have a third party manufacture our Ubiquitor device and have an assembly facility in California where we assemble the Ubiquitor. However, within the next three years, the Company expects to cancel their third-party manufacturing relationship and reevaluate the volume of assembly of the Ubiquitor product. If the volume of assembly becomes too much to do all assembly of the Ubiquitor in California, then it may be necessary to convert both manufacturing and assembly to a large-scale facility in China. We believe we will gradually transfer assembly to a Chinese facility by assembling part of the Ubiquitor orders in California and part of the orders in China and gradually transfer until all of the assembly and manufacturing is done in China (this assumes high quality control levels for assembly in China). The Company has key strategic relationships with manufacturing facilities, such as Tianjin Guanglee Technologies Ltd., in China and believes that eventually converting all manufacturing and assembly of the Ubiquitor device, in China, will lead to reduced production costs and greater profits.
Competitors
 
There are several competitors we have identified in the wireless sensor node industry, including traditional instruments or devices manufacturers such as Hanna Instruments or Extech Instruments.
 
Hach developed and launched SC1000 Multi-parameter Universal Controller, a probe module for connecting up to 8 SC sensors and their products are not compatible with smart phones yet and we believe their price-point is still prohibitive to consumers.
 
Monnit Corporation offers a range of wireless or remote sensors. Many of Monnit’s products are web-based wireless sensors usually are not portable because of the power consumption. Also, the sensors real-time updates are slow, and we believe security of the web-based sensor data acquisition also may be a concern. In addition to purchasing the device, consumers usually have to pay monthly fee for using web-based services.
 
We are not trying to compete with traditional instruments or device manufacturers because we utilize our Ubiquitor universal smart device in conjunction with our generic instrument’s smartphone application, which we believe will be a completely different product category.
 
Patent, Trademark, License and Franchise Restrictions. Contractual Obligations and Concessions
 
On March 5, 2018, we issued a press release announcing that the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office had issued an Issue Notification for U.S. Patent Application No. 9924295 entitled “Universal Smart Device,” which covers a patent application regarding the Company’s Universal Smart Device. The patent was granted on March 20, 2018.

Pursuant to recent research and development efforts, we recently received an issue notification from the USPTO for an application filed on June 2, 2017 that is a process for improving a spectral response curve of a photo sensor. The small and cost-effective multicolor sensor and its related software protected by the potential patent we believe could achieve a spectral response that approximates an ideal photo response to measure optical measurement. The patent was issued on February 26, 2019.
 
In addition, we have been awarded a notice of allowance for a patent from the USPTO for a patent application we filed on March 12, 2018 as application No. 15/925,400. The patent title is a “Universal Smart Device” which is a universal smart instrument that unifies heterogeneous measurement probes into a single device that can analyze, publish, and share the data analyzed. The issue fee must be paid no later than May 12, 2019.
