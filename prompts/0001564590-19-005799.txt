 3


•Internet of Things, or IoT. 
 Design, Modeling & Visualization 
 Altair’s design, modeling & visualization tools under the HyperWorks and solidThinking brands allow for advanced physics attributes to be modeled and rendered on top of object geometry in high fidelity. These tools are becoming more design-centric and relevant earlier in the development process. Our industrial & concept design tools generate early concepts to address requirements for ergonomics, aesthetics, performance, manufacturing feasibility, and cost. These tools are all driven by simulation and machine learning algorithms. We believe these products are emerging as a market force with the potential to eclipse traditional computer-aided design, or CAD.
Physics Simulation
 At the core of Altair’s simulation software portfolios under the HyperWorks and solidThinking brands are mathematical software “solvers” that use advanced computational algorithms to predict physical performance. Optimization leverages these solvers to derive the most efficient solutions to meet desired complex multi-objective requirements. 
 Altair’s solvers are a comprehensive set of fast, scalable and reliable physics algorithms for complex problems in linear and non-linear mechanics, fluid dynamics, electromagnetics, motion, systems and manufacturing simulation. 
 
Altair’s optimization technology combined with superior multi-physics and multi-domain simulation is a key differentiator and spans our product offering. We believe customers using our technologies gain a sustainable competitive advantage by developing better products in less time. 
Data Intelligence 
 Altair’s data intelligence offering under the Knowledge Works brand includes market leading data preparation, data science and visualization solutions that fuel engineering, scientific, and business decisions. Our data preparation tools allow users to import, clean and organize structured and unstructured data for use in reporting and in data science applications. Our data science solutions allow users to develop machine learning work flows with best-in-class decision tree technology and scoring algorithms, and our visualization tools allow users to gain deep insights quickly with both live-streamed and historical data.
 Today, Altair’s data intelligence tools are extensively used by banks, credit unions, health care, and other financial services organizations. They are also used in finance departments across many industries, including manufacturing.
 There is growing demand for this technology in engineering to improve designs and processes, and to manage sensor data coming from live physical assets in the field. Going forward, development lifecycles will include digital replicas of complex processes, services and physical assets and systems, or what is known as “digital twins”. Use of digital twins will enable developers to integrate simulation and data intelligence to optimize product design and in-service operational performance. The convergence of simulation and machine learning is essential to creating better products, marketing them efficiently, and optimizing their in-service performance.  
 High-Performance Cloud Computing 
 Altair’s High-Performance Cloud Computing software applications, under the brand PBS Works, are designed to maximize the efficient utilization of complex compute resources and streamline the workflow management of compute-intensive tasks. Applications include data intelligence, modeling and simulation, and visualization in fields such as financial services, weather prediction, bio-informatics, electronic design analysis, product development and lifecycle management. 
 As predictive modeling and analysis are increasingly computationally intensive, and as computing environments become a mix of on-premise and cloud resources, Altair’s high-performance tools to manage and optimize where and when jobs are running are essential for customers and research organizations. Our powerful and easy to use solutions help IT administrators and business decision makers maximize throughput and minimize costs by leveraging sophisticated scheduling algorithms, enabling bursting to the cloud (or enabling applications to run on external data center resources to supplement internal data center capabilities), shifting workloads between different cloud providers depending on cost or resource availability and managing spot computing purchases.

We believe Altair’s digital twin solutions are unique for their openness, usability, and ability to develop signal-based controls, mixed physics models, and electronics all within one environment and at varying levels of fidelity to support decision making in each stage of a product’s lifecycle. To support this, models need to be multi-disciplinary and may include mechanics, fluids, electronics, and software among other technical elements, and must encompass a scope of products ranging from components to IoT-enabled “systems of systems”. Varying degrees of fidelity aid the modeling process where computational requirements or data availability might otherwise prove to be obstacles. 
 We believe a key strength to Altair’s math and systems solutions is allowing development organizations to move seamlessly in this multi-discipline, multi-component, multi-detail space while integrating models from various authoring tools. With a broad range of multi-physics solvers based on an open-system approach, a strong set of model reduction techniques can be employed toward IoT-enabled product development which can then be carried forward into device management and application development.

 Our research and development efforts are focused on enhancing the functionality, breadth and scalability of our software, addressing new use cases, and developing additional innovative simulation technologies. Timely development of new products is essential to maintaining our competitive position, and we release new versions of our software on a regular basis.
 Customer feedback, combined with our roadmap, enables us to deliver long-term value and stay ahead of market trends. The majority of product enhancements and new capabilities added to our platform over the years have been developed internally, with acquisitions used to augment our capabilities with strategic technology.
 From time-to-time, we incubate related technologies developed by our employees. For example, we developed and patented next-generation solid-state lighting technology as a result of an internal initiative. We commercialized this technology under our toggled subsidiary, which generated $7.5 million in revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018. WEYV, a mobile application that brings our patented units-based business model to digital content distribution and delivery, was released commercially in December 2017. 
 Our research and development initiatives foster a culture of innovation within the organization, helping us attract and retain a highly motivated team. Altair’s research and development team consists of approximately 1,050 people worldwide. We maintain research and development centers with specific technical expertise in several geographies throughout the Americas, Asia-Pacific, Europe, the Middle East and Africa. 
 Our research and development efforts relating to our software focus on five areas:
  
• | Design, Modeling & Visualization: The graphical applications used to construct and visualize simulation models require continuous R&D in the areas of data structures, computational methods, graphics, geometric modeling, mesh generation, and user interface design. Altair’s modeling tools are becoming more design-centric and are adopting some of the capabilities of traditional CAD while leveraging simulation and optimization technology to drive design decisions rather than just simulate designs. Specific areas of R&D include handling large scale models of highly detailed and complex products, developing new methods to derive design geometry from optimizations, and unifying the modeling environment for multi-physics simulation. Adapting modeling and visualization technology for cloud deployment is also an area of active development as is supporting virtual and augmented reality hardware. Simulation-driven design requires tools to generate early concepts addressing requirements for ergonomics, aesthetics, performance, and manufacturing feasibility. We believe these tools are emerging as a market force eclipsing traditional CAD, and are key to the democratization of simulation capabilities across large groups of designers and engineers who are not simulation specialists.

medium enterprises. Approximately 10% of our 2018 software revenue was generated through our growing network of indirect channel partners and resellers.
 Knowledge Works 
 There is segmentation in the data intelligence space by industry verticals where specific domain expertise is important for success.  Altair’s primary data intelligence customer base is banks, credit unions, health care, and other financial services organizations along with finance departments across most industries including manufacturing. As we cross sell into Altair traditional manufacturing customer accounts, we are targeting both the finance departments, leveraging the expertise of our financial markets sales and technical teams, as well as engineering departments looking to apply data intelligence to improve designs, manufacturing, and in-service operations. We intend to leverage our existing direct and indirect sales channels in order to support greater market opportunities.
High Performance Cloud Computing Solutions 
 Altair’s HPC solutions are sold by our global strategic sales force with sales overlay support from Altair HPC sales specialists and application engineers. We have original equipment manufacturer, or OEM, arrangements for these solutions with most of the major hardware companies when they sell new computer systems. We believe these arrangements reduce competition, grow our market share and improve sales efficiency. 
 We offer Altair PBS Professional as both an open source and a commercial solution. Commercial sites generally license the commercial version along with support. However, many universities, government agencies and small commercial sites prefer the open source version as their work often needs to be freely available for societal benefit. Large government and research installations generally still purchase support and often pay for specific development. 
 Licensing 
 There are two licensing methods we employ to deliver our software solutions:  
  
• | Most products are available under our unique, patented units-based licensing model.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | A small subset of our products is available on a node-locked, or hardware specific, and named-user basis. This is especially true for our data intelligence solutions.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Altair pioneered a patented units-based subscription licensing model for software and other digital content. This units-based subscription licensing model allows flexible and shared access to our offerings, along with over 150 partner products. Our HyperWorks customers license a pool of units for their organizations giving individual users access to our entire portfolio of software applications as well as our growing portfolio of partner products. Our primarily mid-market solidThinking customers have access to a subset of the portfolio at a lower price point. We believe our units-based subscription licensing model lowers barriers to adoption, creates broad engagement, encourages users to work within our ecosystem, and increases revenue. This, in turn, helps drive our recurring software license rate which has been on average approximately 88% over the past five years. Each year approximately 60% of new software revenue comes from expansion within existing customers.
 Marketing
 Altair’s global marketing team of approximately 70 people is focused on generating new business opportunities by driving awareness, deepening customer engagement, and developing content specific to technical fields and industry verticals. Our corporate marketing programs include social media, earned media, publications, blogs, white papers and case studies.

Billings consists of our total revenue plus the change in our deferred revenue, excluding deferred revenue from acquisitions during the period, and is discussed under Key metrics included in Part II, Item 6, Selected Financial Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 For a summary of our financial information by geographic location, see Note 20 of Notes to consolidated financial statements in Item 15, Part IV of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which is incorporated by reference.
 Competition
 The market for simulation software is highly fragmented but has been undergoing significant consolidation. Our primary competitors include Dassault Systèmes, Siemens, Ansys and MSC Software, a Hexagon company. All are large public companies, with significant financial resources. Dassault and Siemens have historically focused on CAD and product data management and have been investing in simulation software via acquisitions. Ansys and MSC are focused on simulation. In addition to these competitors, we compete with many smaller companies offering simulation software applications. 
 The market for data intelligence is large and generally very horizontal in nature. The company to whom Altair’s data intelligence solutions are most often compared to is Alteryx, a publicly traded company. There are other competitors in the data preparation and data science markets including SAS and several who received significant venture capital infusions.  
 We believe the breadth and depth of Altair’s software offering is unique and no single competitor addresses our entire solution set. The units model further extends this advantage with a growing APA marketplace of third party software. 
 Our simulation solutions including modeling, visualization and solvers are noted in the market for their ability to handle large and complex models. Our software applications deliver high performance and high scalability, including massive parallelization, which is extremely important in the high-end simulation market. Altair is a leader in integrating optimization technology across all our products, including multi-disciplinary applications. 
 We believe our solutions for data preparation are extremely strong and broadly adopted and have several unique capabilities including handling large, complex data sets coupled with our ability to intelligently import unstructured data. Our data science solutions are also considered easy to use and powerful. The market is converging toward integrated data prep and data science solutions, and we are well positioned for this future.   
 To ensure customer success and deepen our relationships with them, we engage with our customers to provide consulting, implementation services, training, and support, especially when applying optimization. We believe these services, combined with our ability to leverage HPC as the industry transitions to cloud computing, positions us for future success.
 We compete on a variety of factors including the breadth, depth, performance, and quality of our technical solutions. We believe our patented units-based subscription licensing model provides us with a competitive advantage by lowering barriers to adoption, creating broad engagement, and encouraging users to work within our ecosystem.

Intellectual property
 We believe that our intellectual property rights are valuable and important to our business. We actively protect our investment in technology through establishment and enforcement of intellectual property rights. We protect our intellectual property through a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret protections, confidentiality procedures, and contractual provisions. The nature and extent of legal protection associated with each such intellectual property right depends on, among other things, the type of intellectual property right and the given jurisdiction in which such right arises.
 As of December 31, 2018, we have 209 issued patents and more than 76 published patent applications worldwide. These patents and patent applications seek to protect proprietary inventions relevant to our business. We intend to pursue additional patent protection to the extent we believe it would be beneficial and cost effective. Additionally, we are the registered holder of a variety of trademarks and domain names that include “Altair” and similar variations.
 Nonetheless, our intellectual property rights may not be successfully asserted in the future or may be invalidated, circumvented or challenged. In addition, the laws and enforcement of the laws of various countries where our products are distributed do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as United States laws. Our inability to assert or enforce our intellectual property rights could harm our business.
 From time to time, we receive claims alleging infringement of a third party’s intellectual property rights, including patents. Disputes involving our intellectual property rights or those of another party have in the past and may in the future lead to, among other things, costly litigation, diversion of time, money and resources to develop or obtain non-infringing products, or delay product distribution. Any significant impairment of our core intellectual property rights could harm our business or our ability to compete.
 Our products are licensed to users pursuant to signed license agreements or ‘click through’ agreements containing restrictions on use, duplication, disclosure, and transfer. Cloud based products and associated services are provided to users pursuant to online or signed terms of service agreements containing appropriate restrictions on access and use.
 We are unable to measure the full extent to which piracy of our software products exists. We believe, however, that software piracy is and can be expected to be a persistent problem that negatively impacts our revenue and financial results. We believe that our predominant subscription based business model combined with the change from desktop to cloud based computing will shift the incentives and means by which software is pirated.
 In addition, through various licensing arrangements, we receive certain rights to intellectual property of others. We expect to maintain current licensing arrangements and to secure additional licensing arrangements in the future, as needed and to the extent available on reasonable terms and conditions, to support continued development and sales of our products and services. Some of these licensing arrangements require or may require royalty payments and other licensing fees. The amount of these payments and fees may depend on various factors, including but not limited to: the structure of royalty payments, offsetting considerations, if any, and the degree of use of the licensed technology.
 Employees
 As of December 31, 2018, we had over 2,500 in-house employees and over 350 on-site Client Engineering Service employees globally. Over two-thirds of our employees are located in the United States, India, France, Germany and China. None of our employees in the United States are represented by a labor organization or are party to any collective bargaining arrangement. In certain of the European countries in which we operate, we are subject to, and comply with, local labor law requirements in relation to the establishment of works councils. We are often required to consult and seek the consent or advice of these works councils. We have never experienced a work stoppage and we believe our employee relations are good.

 Seasonal variations
 We have experienced and expect to continue to experience seasonal variations in the timing of customers’ purchases of our software and services. Many customers make purchase decisions based on their fiscal year budgets, which often coincide with the calendar year. These seasonal trends materially affect the timing of our cash flows, as license fees become due at the time the license term commences based upon agreed payment terms that customers may not adhere to. As a result, new and renewal licenses have been concentrated in the first and fourth quarter of the year, and our cash flows from operations have been highest late in the first quarter and early in the second quarter of the succeeding fiscal year.
 Backlog
 We generally enter into single year term-based software licensing subscription contracts for our solutions. The timing of our invoices to the customer is a negotiated term and thus varies among our subscription contracts. For multi-year agreements, it is common to invoice an initial amount at contract signing followed by subsequent annual invoices. At any point in the contract term, there can be amounts that we have not yet been contractually able to invoice. As we generally enter into single year subscription contracts for our platform, backlog is not significant.
