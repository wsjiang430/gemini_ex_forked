Item 1. Business
General
Bain Capital Specialty Finance, Inc. (the “Company”) was formed on October 5, 2015 (“Inception”) as a Delaware corporation structured as an externally managed, closed-end, non-diversified management investment company. The Company commenced investment operations on October 13, 2016 (“Commencement”). The Company has elected to be treated as a business development company (“BDC”) under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”). In addition, the Company has elected to be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a regulated investment company (a “RIC”) under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). As a RIC, the Company will not be taxed on its income to the extent that it distributes such income each year and satisfies other applicable income tax requirements.
On October 6, 2016, the Company completed its initial closing of capital commitments (the “Initial Closing”) and subsequently commenced substantial investment operations. On November 19, 2018, the Company closed its initial public offering (the “IPO”) issuing 7,500,000 shares of its common stock at a public offering price of $20.25 per share. Shares of common stock of the Company began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “BCSF” on November 15, 2018.
The Company is managed by the Advisor, an investment adviser that is registered with the SEC under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the “Advisers Act”). The Advisor also provides the administrative services necessary for the Company to operate (in such capacity, the “Administrator”). Company management consists of investment and administrative professionals from the Advisor and Administrator along with the Board of Directors (the “Board”). The Advisor directs and executes the investment operations and capital raising activities of the Company subject to oversight from the Board, which sets the broad policies of the Company. The Board has delegated investment management of the Company’s investment assets to the Advisor. The Board consists of eight directors, five of whom are independent.
Our primary focus is capitalizing on opportunities within Bain Capital Credit’s Senior Direct Lending Strategy, as defined below, which seeks to provide risk-adjusted returns and current income to investors by investing primarily in middle-market companies with between $10.0 million and $150.0 million in annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”). However, we may, from time to time, invest in larger or smaller companies. We focus on senior investments with a first or second lien on collateral and strong structures and documentation intended to protect the lender (including “unitranche” loans, which are loans that combine both senior and mezzanine debt). We generally seek to retain effective voting control in respect of the loans or particular class of securities in which we invest through maintaining affirmative voting positions or negotiating consent rights that allow us to retain a blocking position. We may also invest in mezzanine debt and other junior securities, including common and preferred equity, on an opportunistic basis, and in secondary purchases of assets or portfolios, but such investments are not the principal focus of our investment strategy. We may also invest, from time to time, in distressed debt, debtor-in-possession loans, structured products, structurally subordinate loans, investments with deferred interest features, zero-coupon securities and defaulted securities. Our investments are subject to a number of risks. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Investments.” Leverage may be utilized to help the Company meet its investment objective. Any such leverage would be expected to increase the total capital available for investment by the Company.
We may invest in debt securities which are either rated below investment grade or not rated by any rating agency but, if they were rated, would be rated below investment grade. Below investment grade securities, which are often referred to as “junk,” have predominantly speculative characteristics with respect to the issuer’s capacity to pay interest and repay principal. They may also be illiquid and difficult to value.
We may borrow money from time to time within the levels permitted by the 1940 Act. On November 28, 2018, the Board approved the reduction of the Company’s asset coverage requirements in Section 61(a)(2) of the 1940 Act to 150% and recommended the stockholders to vote in favor of the proposal at the special stockholder meeting on February 1, 2019. On February 1, 2019, the Company’s stockholders approved the application of the reduced asset coverage. Effective February 2, 2019, the Company is permitted to borrow amounts such that its asset coverage ratio is at least 150% after such borrowing (if certain requirements are met), rather than 200%, as previously required. In determining whether to borrow money, we will analyze the maturity, covenant package and rate structure of the proposed borrowings as well as the risks of such borrowings compared to our investment outlook. The use of borrowed

funds or the proceeds of preferred stock offerings to make investments would have its own specific set of benefits and risks, and all of the costs of borrowing funds or issuing preferred stock would be borne by holders of our common stock. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business and Structure—Our strategy involves a high degree of leverage. We intend to continue to finance our investments with borrowed money, which will magnify the potential for gain or loss on amounts invested and may increase the risk of investing in us. The risks of investment in a highly leverage fund include volatility and possible distribution restrictions.”
The Investment Advisor
The Company’s investment activities are managed by the Advisor, an investment adviser that is registered with the SEC under the Advisers Act. The Advisor is responsible for originating prospective investments, conducting research and due diligence investigations on potential investments, analyzing investment opportunities, negotiating and structuring our investments and monitoring our investments and portfolio companies on an ongoing basis. More information regarding the Advisor and its business activities can be found on its registration under Form ADV located on the Investment Adviser Registration Depository website of the SEC.
The Advisor has entered into a Resource Sharing Agreement (the “Resource Sharing Agreement”) with Bain Capital Credit, LP (“Bain Capital Credit”), pursuant to which Bain Capital Credit provides the Advisor with experienced investment professionals (including the members of the Advisor’s Credit Committee) and access to the resources of Bain Capital Credit so as to enable the Advisor to fulfill its obligations under the Amended Advisory Agreement. Through the Resource Sharing Agreement, the Advisor intends to capitalize on the significant deal origination, credit underwriting, due diligence, investment structuring, execution, portfolio management and monitoring experience of Bain Capital Credit’s investment professionals. There can be no assurance that Bain Capital Credit will perform its obligations under the Resource Sharing Agreement. The Resource Sharing Agreement may be terminated by either party on 60 days’ notice, which if terminated may have a material adverse consequence on the Company’s operations. See “Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence.”
About Bain Capital Credit
Bain Capital Credit was established in 1998. Bain Capital Credit and its subsidiaries (including the credit vehicles managed by its Alternative Investment Fund Manager affiliate) had approximately $60.0 billion in assets under management as of December 31, 2022. To date, Bain Capital Credit has invested across the credit products and fixed income universe, including performing and distressed bank loans, high yield bonds, debtor-in-possession loans, senior direct lending, mezzanine debt and other junior securities, structured products, credit-based equities and other investments. Bain Capital Credit has invested over $20.0 billion in the Senior Direct Lending Strategy since 1999 (of which approximately $4.5 billion has been invested within the 12-month period ended December 31, 2022) and has an extensive track record as a non-traditional lender in the middle market. The Senior Direct Lending Strategy is defined as primarily consisting of investments in secured debt in companies with EBITDA of $10.0 million to $150.0 million.
Bain Capital Credit is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Bain Capital, LP (“Bain Capital”) and the Advisor is a majority-owned subsidiary of Bain Capital Credit. As a diversified private investment firm, Bain Capital and its affiliates, including Bain Capital Credit and the Advisor, engage in a broad range of activities, including investment activities for their own account and for the account of other investment funds or accounts, and provide investment banking, advisory, management and other services to funds and operating companies.
The Board of Directors
Our business and affairs are managed under the direction of the Board. The Board consists of eight members, five of whom are not “interested persons” of the Company, the Advisor or their respective affiliates as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act. We refer to these individuals as our “Independent Directors.” The Independent Directors compose a majority of the Board. The Board elects our officers, who serve at the discretion of the Board. The responsibilities of the Board include quarterly determinations of fair value of our assets, corporate governance activities, oversight of our financing arrangements and oversight of our investment activities.
Investment Decision Process
The Advisor’s investment process can be broken into four processes: (1) Sourcing and Idea Generation, (2) Investment Diligence & Recommendation, (3) Credit Committee Approval and Portfolio Construction and (4) Portfolio & Risk Management.

7



Sourcing and Idea Generation
The investment decision-making process begins with sourcing ideas. Bain Capital Credit’s Private Credit Group interacts with a broad and deep set of global contacts, enabling the group to generate middle market investment opportunities. Our Advisor also seeks to leverage the contacts of Bain Capital Credit’s industry groups, Trading Desk, and Special Situations team, including private equity firms, banks and a variety of advisors and other intermediaries.
Investment Diligence & Recommendation
Our Advisor utilizes Bain Capital Credit’s bottom-up approach to investing, and it starts with the due diligence performed by its Private Credit Group. The group works with the close support of Bain Capital Credit’s industry groups. This diligence process typically begins with a detailed review of an offering memorandum as well as Bain Capital Credit’s own independent diligence efforts, including in-house materials and expertise, third-party independent research and interviews, and hands-on field checks where appropriate. For deals that progress beyond an initial stage, the team will usually schedule one or more meetings with company management, facilities visits and also meetings with the sponsor in order to ask more detailed questions and to better understand the sponsor’s view of the business and plans for it going forward. The team’s diligence work is summarized in investment memoranda and accompanying credit packs. Work product also includes full models and covenant analysis.
Credit Committee Approval and Portfolio Construction
If the reviewing team deems an investment worthy of serious consideration, it generally must be presented to the credit committee, which is comprised of at least three experienced credit professionals, who are selected based on strategy and geography. A portfolio manager leads the decision making process for each investment and engages the credit committee throughout the investment process in order to prioritize and direct the underwriting of each potential investment opportunity. For middle market holdings, the path to exit an investment is often discussed at credit committee meetings, including restructurings, acquisitions and sale to strategic buyers. Since most middle market investments are illiquid, exits are driven by a sale of the portfolio company or a refinancing of the portfolio company’s debt.
Portfolio & Risk Management
Our Advisor utilizes Bain Capital Credit’s Private Credit Group for the daily monitoring of its respective credits after an investment has been made. Our Advisor believes that the ongoing monitoring of financial performance and market developments of portfolio investments is critical to successful investment management. Accordingly, our Advisor is actively involved in an on-going portfolio review process and attends board meetings. To the extent a portfolio investment is not meeting our Advisor’s expectations, our Advisor takes corrective action when it deems appropriate, which may include raising interest rates, gaining a more influential role on its board, taking warrants and, where appropriate, restructuring the balance sheet to take control of the company. Our Advisor will utilize the Bain Capital Credit Risk and Oversight Committee. The Risk and Oversight Committee is responsible for monitoring and reviewing risk management, including portfolio risk, counterparty risk and firm-wide risk issues. In addition to the methods noted above, there are a number of proprietary methods and tools used through all levels of Bain Capital Credit to manage portfolio risk.
Environmental, Social and Governance
Our Advisor believes that environmental, social, and governance (ESG) management helps to create lasting impact for all of its stakeholder groups, including investors, portfolio companies, employees and communities. ESG risks can have a negative impact on an issuer’s ability to meet its financial obligations. Therefore, strong ESG management aligns with our Advisor’s goal to seek and generate attractive risk-adjusted returns with the capital it invests. Our Advisor considers ESG factors throughout its investment decision-making process. These factors include, but are not limited to, applying a negative screen to avoid investing in companies with outsized ESG risks; examining the impact a company has on society and the environment during the diligence process; seeking to consider ESG factors from a company-specific and sector-wide perspective; and engaging companies via corporate actions and board seats, where applicable.
​

Investment Strategy
The Advisor, through the resources and personnel provided by Bain Capital Credit through the Resource Sharing Agreement, uses detailed business, industry and competitive analyses to make investments. In evaluating potential opportunities, Bain Capital Credit’s investment professionals typically complete market analyses to assess the attractiveness of a given industry and a specific investment and monitor, on an ongoing basis, financial performance and market developments. The Advisor’s approach to making investments generally involves evaluating the following business characteristics: market definition, market size and growth prospects, competitive analysis, historical financial performance, margin analysis and cost structure, quality of earnings, capital structure, access to capital markets and regulatory, risk analysis, tax and legal matters. Additionally, the Advisor places significant emphasis on the quality and track record of the controlling stockholders and management team as well as careful consideration to the underlying deal structure and documentation. When considering an investment that meets the Company’s return objectives, the Advisor seeks to mitigate downside risk.
We seek to create a broad and varied portfolio of investments across various industries as a method to manage risk and capitalize on specific sector trends, all concentrated in a small number of industries.
Investment Focus
Our primary focus is capitalizing on senior middle market lending opportunities. We seek to provide risk adjusted returns and current income to investors by investing primarily in middle market companies with between $10.0 million and $150.0 million in EBITDA. However, we may, from time to time, invest in larger or smaller companies. We focus on senior investments with a first or second lien on collateral and strong structures and documentation intended to protect the lender. We generally seek to retain effective voting control in respect of the loans or particular class of securities in which we invest through maintaining affirmative voting positions or negotiating consent rights that allow us to retain a blocking position. We may also invest in mezzanine debt and other junior securities, including common and preferred equity, on an opportunistic basis, and in secondary purchases of assets or portfolios, but such investments are not the principal focus of our investment strategy. We may also invest, from time to time, in equity securities, distressed debt, debtor in possession loans, structured products, structurally subordinate loans, investments with deferred interest features, zero coupon securities and defaulted securities. Leverage is expected to be utilized to help the Company meet its investment objective. Any such leverage, if incurred, is expected to increase the total capital available for investment by the Company. As a BDC, we may also invest up to 30% of our portfolio opportunistically in “non qualifying” portfolio investments, such as investments in non U.S. companies.
We may invest in securities that are rated below investment grade by rating agencies or that would be rated below investment grade if they were rated (i.e. junk bonds). See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Investments—The lack of liquidity in our investments may adversely affect our business.” Our investments also may include non-cash income features, including PIK interest and OID. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Investments—Our investments in OID and PIK interest income may expose us to risks associated with such income being required to be included in accounting income and taxable income prior to receipt of cash.”

----+-----------------------------------

The Advisor monitors our portfolio companies on an ongoing basis. It monitors the financial trends of each portfolio company to determine if they are meeting their respective business plans and to assess the appropriate course of action for each company. The Advisor has several methods of evaluating and monitoring the performance and fair value of our investments, which may include the following:

● | assessment of success in adhering to the portfolio company’s business plan and compliance with covenants;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | periodic or regular contact with portfolio company management and, if appropriate, the financial or strategic sponsor to discuss financial position, requirements and accomplishments;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | comparisons to our other portfolio companies in the industry, if any;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


● | attendance at and participation in board meetings or presentations by portfolio companies; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | review of monthly and quarterly consolidated financial statements and financial projections of portfolio companies.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Advisor rates the investments in our portfolio at least quarterly and it is possible that the rating of a portfolio investment may be reduced or increased over time. For investments rated 3 or 4, the Advisor enhances its level of scrutiny over the monitoring of such portfolio company. Our internal performance ratings do not constitute any rating of investments by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization or represent or reflect any third-party assessment of any of our investments.

● | An investment is rated 1 if, in the opinion of the Advisor, it is performing above underwriting expectations, and the business trends and risk factors are generally favorable, which may include the performance of the portfolio company or the likelihood of a potential exit.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | An investment is rated 2 if, in the opinion of the Advisor, it is performing as expected at the time of our underwriting and there are generally no concerns about the portfolio company’s performance or ability to meet covenant requirements, interest payments or principal amortization, if applicable. All new investments or acquired investments in new portfolio companies are initially given a rating of 2.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | An investment is rated 3 if, in the opinion of the Advisor, the investment is performing below underwriting expectations and there may be concerns about the portfolio company’s performance or trends in the industry, including as a result of factors such as declining performance, non-compliance with debt covenants or delinquency in loan payments (but generally not more than 180 days past due).
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

10




● | An investment is rated 4 if, in the opinion of the Advisor, the investment is performing materially below underwriting expectations. For debt investments, most of or all of the debt covenants are out of compliance and payments are substantially delinquent. Investments rated 4 are not anticipated to be repaid in full, if applicable, and there is significant risk that we may realize a substantial loss on our investment.

Competition
Our primary competitors in providing financing to middle-market companies include public and private funds, other business development companies, commercial and investment banks, commercial financing companies and, to the extent they provide an alternative form of financing, private equity and hedge funds. Some of our competitors are substantially larger and have considerably greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. For example, we believe some competitors may have access to funding sources that are not available to us. In addition, some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments and establish more relationships than us. Furthermore, many of our competitors are not subject to the regulatory restrictions that the 1940 Act imposes on us as a BDC or to the distribution and other requirements we must satisfy to maintain our qualification as a RIC.
We expect to use the expertise of the investment professionals of Bain Capital Credit to which we have access to assess investment risks and determine appropriate pricing for our investments in portfolio companies. In addition, we expect that the relationships of Bain Capital Credit will enable us to learn about, and compete effectively for, financing opportunities with attractive middle-market companies in the industries in which we seek to invest. For additional information concerning the competitive risks we face, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business and Structure—We operate in an increasingly competitive market for investment opportunities, which could reduce returns and result in losses.”

Investment Advisory Agreement; Administration Agreement
Our investment activities are managed by the Advisor, which is responsible for originating prospective investments, conducting research and due diligence investigations on potential investments, analyzing investment opportunities, negotiating and structuring our investments and monitoring our investments and portfolio companies on an ongoing basis. We have entered into an Amended Advisory Agreement with the Advisor, pursuant to which we have agreed to pay the Advisor a base management fee and an incentive fee for its services. The cost of both the base management fee and the incentive fee will ultimately be borne by our stockholders.
The base management fee is calculated at an annual rate of 1.5% of our gross assets, including assets purchased with borrowed funds or other forms of leverage but excluding cash and cash equivalents. For services rendered under the Amended Advisory Agreement, the base management fee is payable quarterly in arrears. The base management fee is calculated based on the average value of our gross assets at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters, and appropriately adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the current calendar quarter. Base management fee for any partial month or quarter will be appropriately pro-rated. For purposes of the Amended Advisory Agreement, cash equivalents means U.S. government securities and commercial paper instruments maturing within one year of purchase. Effective February 1, 2019, the base management fee has been revised to a tiered management fee structure so that the base management fee of 1.5% (0.375% per quarter) of the average value of the Company’s gross assets (excluding cash and cash equivalents, but including assets purchased with borrowed amounts) will continue to apply to assets held at an asset coverage ratio down to 200%, but a lower base management fee of 1.0% (0.25% per quarter) of the average value of the Company’s gross assets (excluding cash and cash equivalents, but including assets purchased with borrowed amounts) will apply to any amount of assets attributable to leverage decreasing the Company’s asset coverage ratio below 200%.
We will pay the Advisor an incentive fee. The incentive fee will consist of two parts—an incentive fee based on income and an incentive fee based on capital gains—which are described in more detail below.
Pre-incentive fee net investment income means interest income, dividend income and any other income (including any other fees such as commitment, origination, structuring, diligence and consulting fees or other fees that the Company receives from portfolio companies but excluding fees for providing managerial assistance) accrued during the calendar quarter, minus operating expenses for the quarter (including the Base Management Fee, any expenses payable under the Administration Agreement, and any interest expense and dividends paid on any outstanding preferred stock, but excluding the incentive fee). Pre-incentive fee net investment income includes, in the case of investments with a deferred interest feature such as market discount, original issue discount (“OID”), debt instruments with PIK interest, preferred stock with PIK dividends and zero-coupon securities, accrued income that the Company has not yet received in cash.
Pre-incentive fee net investment income does not include any realized or unrealized capital gains or losses or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation. Because of the structure of the incentive fee, it is possible that the Company may pay an incentive fee in a quarter where the Company incurs a loss. For example, if the Company receives pre-incentive fee net investment income in excess of the Hurdle rate for a quarter, the Company will pay the applicable incentive fee even if the Company has incurred a loss in that quarter due to realized and unrealized capital losses.
The incentive fee based on income is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears based on the aggregate pre-incentive fee net investment income in respect of the current calendar quarter and the eleven preceding calendar quarters (the “Trailing Twelve Quarters”). This calculation is referred to as the “Three-Year Lookback.”
With respect to any calendar quarter that commences on or after January 1, 2019, pre-incentive fee net investment income in respect of the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters is compared to a “Hurdle Amount” equal to the product of (i) the hurdle rate of 1.5% per quarter (6% annualized) and (ii) the sum of our net assets (defined as total assets less indebtedness and before taking into account any incentive fees payable during the period) at the beginning of each applicable calendar quarter comprising the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters. The Hurdle Amount will be calculated after making appropriate adjustments to our NAV at the beginning of each applicable calendar quarter for our subscriptions (which shall include all issuances by us of shares of our Common Stock, including issuances pursuant to the Company’s dividend reinvestment plan) and distributions during the applicable calendar quarter.
Commencing on January 1, 2019, the quarterly incentive fee based on income is calculated, subject to the Incentive Fee Cap (as defined below), based on the amount by which (A) aggregate pre-incentive fee net investment income in respect of the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters exceeds (B) the Hurdle Amount for such Trailing Twelve Quarters. The amount of the excess of (A) over 

12



(B) described in this paragraph for such Trailing Twelve Quarters is referred to as the “Excess Income Amount.” The incentive fee based on income that is paid to the Advisor in respect of a particular calendar quarter will equal the Excess Income Amount less the aggregate incentive fees based on income that were paid to the Advisor in the preceding eleven calendar quarters (or portion thereof) comprising the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters.
The incentive fee based on income for each calendar quarter is determined as follows:

(i) | No incentive fee based on income is payable to the Advisor for any calendar quarter for which there is no Excess Income Amount;

Incentive Fee Cap
With respect to any calendar quarter that commences on or after January 1, 2019, the incentive fee based on income is subject to a cap (the “Incentive Fee Cap”). The Incentive Fee Cap in respect of any calendar quarter is an amount equal to 17.5% of the Cumulative Net Return (as defined below) during the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters less the aggregate incentive fees based on income that were paid to the Advisor in the preceding eleven calendar quarters (or portion thereof) comprising the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters.
“Cumulative Net Return” during the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters means (x) the pre-incentive fee net investment income in respect of the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters less (y) any Net Capital Loss, if any, in respect of the relevant Trailing Twelve Quarters. If, in any quarter, the Incentive Fee Cap is zero or a negative value, the Company will pay no incentive fee based on income to the Advisor in respect of that quarter. If, in any quarter, the Incentive Fee Cap for such quarter is a positive value but is less than the incentive fee based on income that is payable to the Advisor for such quarter calculated as described above, the Company will pay an incentive fee based on income to the Advisor equal to the Incentive Fee Cap in respect of such quarter. If, in any quarter, the Incentive Fee Cap for such quarter is equal to or greater than the incentive fee based on income that is payable to the Advisor for such quarter calculated as described above, the Company will pay an incentive fee based on income to the Advisor equal to the incentive fee calculated as described above for such quarter without regard to the Incentive Fee Cap.
“Net Capital Loss” in respect of a particular period means the difference, if positive, between (i) aggregate capital losses, whether realized or unrealized, in respect of such period and (ii) aggregate capital gains, whether realized or unrealized, in respect of such period.
Annual Incentive Fee Based on Capital Gains
The second part of the incentive fee is a capital gains incentive fee that will be determined and payable in arrears in cash as of the end of each fiscal year (or upon termination of the Amended Advisory Agreement, as of the termination date), and equals 17.5% of our realized capital gains as of the end of the fiscal year. In determining the capital gains incentive fee payable to the Advisor, we calculate the cumulative aggregate realized capital gains and cumulative aggregate realized capital losses since our inception, and the aggregate unrealized capital depreciation as of the date of the calculation, as applicable, with respect to each of the investments in our portfolio. For this purpose, cumulative aggregate realized capital gains, if any, equals the sum of the differences between the net sales price of each investment, when sold, and the cost of such investment. Cumulative aggregate realized capital losses equals the sum of the amounts by which the net sales price of each investment, when sold, is less than the cost of such investment. Aggregate unrealized capital depreciation equals the sum of the difference, if negative, between the valuation of each investment as of the applicable calculation date and the cost of such investment. At the end of the applicable year, the amount of capital gains that serves as the basis for our calculation of the capital gains incentive fee equals the cumulative aggregate realized capital gains less cumulative aggregate

realized capital losses, less aggregate unrealized capital depreciation, with respect to our portfolio of investments. If this number is positive at the end of such year, then the capital gains incentive fee for such year will equal to 17.5%, of such amount, less the aggregate amount of any capital gains incentive fees paid in respect of our portfolio in all prior years as calculated in accordance with the below.

Example of Capital Gains Portion of Incentive Fee:
Assumptions

Year 1: | $25.0 million investment made in Company A (“Investment A”), $35.0 million investment made in Company B (“Investment B”) and $30.0 million investment made in Company C (“Investment C”)
--------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Year 3:Fair value of Investment B determined to be $34.0 million and Investment C sold for $35.0 million
Year 4:Fair value of Investment B determined to be $45.0 million
Determination of Incentive Fee based on capital gains
The Incentive Fee based on capital gains, if any, would be:
Year 1:None
Year 2:$0.875 million
The portion of the incentive fee based on capital gains equals (A) 17.5% of our realized capital gains, if any, on a cumulative basis from inception through the end of the fiscal year, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis, minus (B) the aggregate amount of any previously paid capital gain incentive. Therefore, using the assumptions above, the incentive fee based on capital gains equals (A) 17.5% × ($10.0 million-$5.0 million) minus (B) $0. Therefore, the incentive fee based on capital gains equals $0.875 million.

Year 3: | $1.575 million, which is calculated as follows: The incentive fee based on capital gains equals (A) 17.5% × ($15.0 million-$1.0 million) minus (B) $0.875 million. Therefore, the incentive fee based on capital gains equals $1.575 million.
--------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Year 4:$0.175 million, which is calculated as follows:
The incentive fee based on capital gains equals (x) (A) 17.5% × ($15.0 million-$0.0 million) minus (B) $2.45 million. Therefore, the incentive fee based on capital gains equals $0.175 million.
The Board will monitor the mix and performance of our investments over time and will seek to satisfy itself that the Advisor is acting in our interests and that our fee structure appropriately incentivizes the Advisor to do so.
We have also entered into an Administration Agreement with the Administrator, pursuant to which the Administrator will provide the administrative services necessary for us to operate, and we will utilize the Administrator’s office facilities, equipment and recordkeeping services. Pursuant to the Administration Agreement, the Administrator has agreed to oversee our public reporting requirements and tax reporting and monitor our expenses and the performance of professional services rendered to us by others. The Administrator has also hired a sub-administrator to assist in the provision of administrative services. We may reimburse the Administrator for its costs and expenses and our allocable portion of overhead incurred by it in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including compensation paid to or compensatory distributions received by our officers (including our Chief Compliance Officer and Chief Financial Officer) and any of their respective staff who provide services to us, operations staff who provide services to us, and internal audit staff, if any, to the extent internal audit performs a role in our Sarbanes-Oxley internal control assessment. Our allocable portion of overhead will be determined by the Administrator, which expects to use various methodologies such as allocation based on the percentage of time certain individuals devote, on an estimated basis, to the business and affairs of the Company, and will be subject to oversight by the Board. The sub-administrator will be paid its compensation for performing its sub-administrative services under the sub-administration agreement. The Company incurred expenses related to the sub-administrator of $0.6 million, $0.5 million and $0.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, which is included in other general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statements of operations. The Administrator would not seek reimbursement in the event that any such reimbursements would cause any distributions to our stockholders to constitute a return of capital. See “Fees and Expenses.” In addition, the Administrator is permitted to delegate its duties under the Administration Agreement to affiliates or third parties and we will reimburse the expenses of these parties incurred and paid by the Advisor on our behalf.
Both the Amended Advisory Agreement and the Administration Agreement have been approved by the Board. Unless earlier terminated as described below, both the Amended Advisory Agreement and the Administration Agreement will remain in effect for a period of two years from their effective date and will remain in effect from year to year thereafter if approved annually by (i) the vote of the Board, or by the vote of a majority of our outstanding voting securities, and (ii) the vote of a majority of our Independent Directors. The Amended Advisory Agreement and the Administration Agreement will automatically terminate in the event of assignment. Both the Investment Advisory Agreement and the Administration Agreement may be terminated by either party without penalty upon not less than 60 days’ written notice to the other. Upon termination of the Amended Advisory Agreement, the Company will be required to change its name which may have a material adverse impact on the Company’s operations. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business and Structure—We are dependent upon key personnel of Bain Capital Credit and our Advisor.”
Under the Amended Advisory Agreement, the Advisor has not assumed any responsibility to us other than to render the services called for under that agreement. It will not be responsible for any action of the Board in following or declining to follow the Advisor’s advice or recommendations. Under the Amended Advisory Agreement, the Advisor, its officers, managers, partners, agents, employees, controlling persons, members and any other person or entity affiliated with the Advisor, and any person controlling or controlled by the Advisor will not be liable to us, any subsidiary of ours, our directors, our stockholders or any subsidiary’s stockholders or partners for acts or omissions performed in accordance with and pursuant to the Amended Advisory Agreement, except those resulting from acts constituting gross negligence, willful misfeasance, bad faith or reckless disregard of the duties that the Advisor owes to us under the Amended Advisory Agreement. In addition, as part of the Amended Advisory Agreement, we have agreed to indemnify the Advisor and each of its officers, managers, partners, agents, employees, controlling persons, members and any other person or entity affiliated with the Advisor, from and against any claims or liabilities, including reasonable legal fees and other expenses reasonably incurred, arising out of or in connection with our business and operations or any action taken or omitted on our behalf pursuant to authority granted by the Amended Advisory Agreement, except where attributable to gross negligence, willful misfeasance, bad faith or reckless disregard of such person’s duties under the Amended Advisory Agreement. These protections may lead the Advisor to act in a riskier manner when acting on our behalf than it would when acting for its own account.

To the extent that expenses to be borne by us are paid by BCSF Advisors, we will generally reimburse BCSF Advisors for such expenses. To the extent the Administrator outsources any of its functions, the Company will pay the fees associated with such functions on a direct basis without profit to the Administrator. We will also reimburse the Administrator for its costs and expenses and our allocable portion of overhead incurred by it in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including certain rent and compensation paid to or compensatory distributions received by our officers (including our Chief Compliance Officer and Chief Financial Officer) and any of their respective staff who provide services to us, operations staff who provide services to us, internal audit staff, if any, to the extent internal audit performs a role in our Sarbanes-Oxley internal control assessment and fees paid to third-party providers for goods or services. Our allocable portion of overhead will be determined by the Administrator, which expects to use various methodologies such as allocation based on the percentage of time certain individuals devote, on an estimated basis, to our business and affairs, and will be subject to oversight by the Board. The sub-administrator is paid its compensation for performing its sub-administrative services under the sub-administration agreement. We incurred expenses related to the sub-administrator of $0.6 million, $0.5 million and $0.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, which is included in other general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statements of operations. BCSF Advisors will not be reimbursed to the extent that such reimbursements would cause any distributions to our stockholders to constitute a return of capital. All of the foregoing expenses are ultimately borne by our stockholders.
All of the foregoing expenses are ultimately borne by our stockholders.
From time to time, the Administrator or its affiliates may pay third-party providers of goods or services. We will reimburse the Administrator or such affiliates thereof for any such amounts paid on our behalf. The Administrator will waive its right to be reimbursed in the event that such reimbursements would cause any distributions to our stockholders to constitute a return of capital.
The Advisor is authorized to determine the broker to be used for each securities transaction. In selecting brokers to execute transactions, the Advisor need not solicit competitive bids and does not have an obligation to seek the lowest available commission cost. In selecting brokers, the Advisor may or may not negotiate “execution only” commission rates and thus we may be deemed to be paying for other services provided by the broker that are included in the commission rate. In negotiating commission rates, the Advisor will take into account the financial stability and reputation of the broker and the brokerage, research and other services provided to us, the Advisor and other customers of the Advisor and its affiliates by such broker, even though we may not, in any particular instance, be the direct or indirect beneficiaries of the research or other services provided and the base management fee payable to the Advisor is not reduced because it receives such services. In addition, the Advisor may direct commissions to certain brokers that on the foregoing basis may furnish other services to us, the Advisor and other customers of the Advisor and its affiliates, such as telephone lines, news and quotation equipment, electronic office equipment, account record keeping and clerical services, trading software, financial publications and economic consulting services. As a result of the brokerage practices described above, the levels of commission paid and prices paid or received by us in securities transactions may be less favorable than in securities transactions effected on a best price and execution basis.
The Advisor engaged placement agents to assist with the placement of the Company’s shares, and may engage additional or different placement agents in the future. The Advisor and/or investors referred by a placement agent shall pay all compensation to the placement agents. The Company did not pay compensation to any placement agents in connection with the Company’s initial private offering (the “Private Offering”). The prospect of receiving placement fees or other compensation may provide placement agents and/or 

23



their salespersons with an incentive to favor sales of the shares of the Company over the sale of interests of other investments with respect to which the placement agent does not receive such additional compensation, or receives lower levels of additional compensation.
Capital Resources and Borrowings
We anticipate cash to be generated from future offerings of securities and cash flows from operations, including interest earned from the temporary investment of cash in cash equivalents, U.S. government securities and other high-quality debt investments that mature in one year or less. Additionally, we are permitted, under specified conditions, to issue multiple classes of indebtedness and one class of stock senior to our common stock if our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, is at least equal to 200% immediately after each such issuance. Effective February 2, 2019, following shareholder approval of the reduce asset coverage proposal, the Company may maintain an asset coverage ratio of only 150%. Furthermore, while any indebtedness and senior securities remain outstanding, we must make provisions to prohibit any distribution to our stockholders or the repurchase of such securities or shares unless we meet the applicable asset coverage ratios at the time of the distribution or repurchase. In connection with borrowings, our lenders may require us to pledge assets, investor commitments to fund capital calls and/or the proceeds of those capital calls. In addition, the lenders may ask us to comply with positive or negative covenants that could have an effect on our operations.

On August 14, 2020, the Parties entered into the second amended and restated credit agreement and the third amended and restated margining agreement (collectively, the “Amendment”), which amended and restated the terms of the existing credit facility (the “Amended and Restated Credit Facility”).
