ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

Introduction
 
We are a blank check company incorporated as a Delaware corporation for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities, which we refer to herein as our initial business combination. Our Sponsor is Mehana Capital LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Sponsor”).
 
We believe that there are many target companies that could become attractive public companies and we will seek a target in the disruptive technology sector with a spotlight on companies in Asia with Japan in particular. While we may pursue an initial business combination target in any industry or geographic region, we will seek to capitalize on the operational and investment experience of our management team and focus on disruptive technology companies that we believe have significant growth prospects and the potential to generate attractive returns for our stockholders. We expect to focus on identifying potential target companies with above-industry-average growth, and a defensible market position where our management team’s operational, strategic, or managerial expertise can assist in maximizing value.
 
The Registration Statement for our initial public offering was declared effective on August 4, 2022 (the “Initial Public Offering,” or “IPO”). On August 9, 2022, we consummated the Initial Public Offering of 11,500,000 Units, including 1,500,000 Units issued pursuant to the exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment option in full, generating gross proceeds of $115,000,000. Each Unit consists of one share of Class A common stock and one redeemable warrant (“Public Warrant”). Each Public Warrant entitles the holder to purchase one share of Class A common stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per whole share.
 
Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, we consummated the sale of 634,375 units (the “Placement Units”) at a price of $10.00 per Placement Unit in a private placement to the Sponsor, including 63,000 Placement Units issued pursuant to the exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment option in full, generating gross proceeds of $6,343,750, which is described in Note 4.
 
Following the closing of the Initial Public Offering on August 9, 2022, an amount of $117,875,000 ($10.25 per Unit) from the net proceeds of the sale of the Units in the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Placement Units was placed in a trust account (the “Trust Account”), and will be invested only in U.S. government treasury obligations with maturities of 185 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act, which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations, until the earlier of: (i) the completion of a business combination and (ii) the distribution of the funds held in the Trust Account, as described below.
 
We will have until 9 months (or up to 18 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering at our election pursuant to nine one month extensions subject to satisfaction of certain conditions, including the deposit of $379,500 ($0.033 per unit) for such one month extension, into the Trust Account, or as extended by our stockholders in accordance with our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation) from the closing of the Initial Public Offering to consummate a business combination (the “Combination Period”). If we are unable to complete a business combination within the Combination Period, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but no more than ten business days thereafter, redeem 100% of the outstanding Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, including interest earned (net of taxes payable and less interest to pay dissolution expenses up to $100,000), divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish Public Stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the remaining stockholders and our board of directors, proceed to commence a voluntary liquidation and thereby a formal dissolution of the Company, subject in each case to its obligations to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of applicable law. The underwriters have agreed to waive their rights to the deferred underwriting commission held in the Trust Account in the event we do not complete a business combination within the Combination Period and, in such event, such amounts will be included with the funds held in the Trust Account that will be available to fund the redemption of the Public Shares. In the event of such distribution, it is possible that the per share value of the assets remaining available for distribution will be less than the Initial Public Offering price per Unit ($10.00).

On January 31, 2023, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”), by and among us, Pono Two Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and our wholly-owned subsidiary (“Merger Sub”), SBC Medical Group Holdings Incorporated, a Delaware corporation (“SBC”), Mehana Capital, LLC, in its capacity as Purchaser Representative, and Yoshiyuki Aikawa, in his capacity as Seller Representative.
 
Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, at the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and into SBC, with SBC continuing as the surviving corporation. The transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement are referred to herein as the “Business Combination.”
 
As a condition to closing of the Business Combination, SBC will complete certain restructuring transactions pursuant to which SBC Medical Group Co., Ltd., a Japanese corporation (“SBC-Japan”) and certain related entities which carry on the business of SBC-Japan and such other related entities, will become subsidiaries of SBC.
 
As consideration for the Business Combination, the holders of SBC securities as of the closing of the Business Combination, collectively will be entitled to receive from us, in the aggregate, a number of our securities with an aggregate value equal to (a) $1,200,000,000, minus (b) the amount, if any, by which $3,000,000 exceeds SBC’s Net Working Capital, plus (c) the amount, if any, by which SBC’s Net Working Capital exceeds $3,000,000, minus (d) the aggregate amount of any outstanding indebtedness (minus cash held by SBC) of SBC at Closing, minus (e) specified transaction expenses of SBC associated with the Business Combination.

Our Company
 
We are a blank check company incorporated in Delaware on March 11, 2022 formed for the purpose of entering into a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses (a “business combination”). We intend to effectuate our initial business combination using cash from the proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the private placement units, the proceeds of the sale of our shares in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the shares issued to the owners of the target, debt issued to bank or other lenders or the owners of the target, or a combination of the foregoing or other sources.
 
We believe that there are many target companies that could become attractive public companies and we will seek a target in the disruptive technology sector with a spotlight on companies in Asia with Japan in particular. While we may pursue an initial business combination target in any industry or geographic region, we will seek to capitalize on the operational and investment experience of our management team and focus on disruptive technology companies that we believe have significant growth prospects and the potential to generate attractive returns for our stockholders. We expect to focus on identifying potential target companies with above-industry-average growth, and a defensible market position where our management team’s operational, strategic, or managerial expertise can assist in maximizing value.
 
We believe the traditional IPO and direct listing processes are not designed for these types of companies to execute on their ambitious strategies. We believe using a SPAC structure is a disruptive alternative to, and creates more efficiencies than, the traditional IPO approach. We also believe that because the industries in which we have particular expertise, and in which we will seek to identify a potential business combination target, are often overlooked by traditional venture capital, public equity and private equity investors, many high-quality companies in these industries are not well suited to a traditional IPO, direct listing or private equity buyout transaction. Therefore, we believe our focus on these particular industries will provide unique access to the highest quality companies and management teams and a substantial number of proprietary business combination opportunities. Our mission is to create a better solution to the conventional IPO for these high growth, disruptive technology and technology-enabled companies, which addresses their needs for capital and liquidity, while overcoming the key points of friction in the traditional IPO path in particular for businesses in Japan.

We believe our expertise will make us an attractive partner for companies seeking a clear and efficient path to listing their shares with a significant degree of funding certainty including high-quality companies in Japan where certain of the Company’s officers and directors are familiar with Japanese business and M&A culture, which will have an impact on the dynamics of a business combination. There are a large number of companies that desire to have publicly-traded shares to provide liquidity to investors and employees, create a currency for mergers and acquisitions and access to equity capital markets. We may seek to combine with businesses owned by our founder and minority investors, although we may consummate a transaction with businesses controlled by private equity investors or family-owned businesses, which means there is a wide universe of potential partners. We believe our understanding of private deal execution and public capital markets, and valuation dynamics in both markets, make us uniquely positioned to identify and execute a business combination with a growth orientation.
 
Our Management Team
 
Our management team is led by Darryl Nakamoto, our Chief Executive Officer and Director, Allison Van Orman, our Chief Financial Officer, and Dustin Shindo, our Chairman of the Board, who will be supported by Pono Capital Two, Inc.’s independent directors, sponsor, accountants and legal counsel, as further described below. We believe our management team is well positioned to identify and evaluate businesses within the technology industry that would benefit from being a public company and from access to our expertise. We believe we can achieve this mission by utilizing our team’s extensive experience in growing and operating technology companies as well as our broad network of contacts in the technology sector.
Competition
 
In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial business combination, we may encounter competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, public companies and operating businesses seeking strategic business combinations. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than we do. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the initial business combination of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination.
Employees
 
We currently have two executive officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters, but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the stage of the initial business combination process we are in. We do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the completion of our initial business combination.
 
For additional discussion of the general development of our business, see our final prospectus on Form 424B4, filed with the SEC on August 8, 2022.
