General
 
Miller Industries is The World’s Largest Manufacturer of Towing and Recovery Equipment®, with executive offices in Ooltewah, Tennessee, domestic manufacturing operations in Tennessee and Pennsylvania, and foreign manufacturing operations in France and the United Kingdom.
 
In 1990, we began developing or acquiring several of the most well-recognized brands in the towing and recovery equipment manufacturing industry. Our strategy has been to diversify our line of products and increase our presence in the industry by combining internal growth and development with acquisitions of complementary products.
 
In this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the words “Miller Industries,” “the Company,” “we,” “our,” “ours” and “us” refer to Miller Industries, Inc. and its subsidiaries or any of them.
 
Towing and Recovery Equipment
 
We offer a broad range of towing and recovery equipment products that meet most customer design, capacity and cost requirements. We manufacture the bodies of wreckers and car carriers, which are installed on truck chassis manufactured by third parties. We frequently purchase the truck chassis for resale to our customers. Wreckers generally are used to recover and tow disabled vehicles and other equipment and range in type from the conventional tow truck to large recovery vehicles with rotating hydraulic booms and up to 75-ton lifting capacities. Car carriers are specialized flatbed vehicles with hydraulic tilt mechanisms that enable a towing operator to drive or winch a vehicle onto the bed for transport. Car carriers transport new or disabled vehicles and other equipment and are particularly effective over longer distances. We also manufacture vehicle transport trailers.
 
Our products primarily are sold through independent distributors that serve all 50 states, Canada and Mexico, and other foreign markets including Europe, the Pacific Rim, the Middle East, South America and Africa, and through prime contractors to governmental entities. Additionally, as a result of our ownership of Jige International S.A. in France and Boniface Engineering, Ltd. in the United Kingdom, we have substantial distribution capabilities in Europe. While most of our distributor agreements do not generally contain exclusivity provisions, management believes that approximately 85% of our independent distributors choose to sell our products on an exclusive basis. In addition to selling our products to towing operators, our independent distributors provide them with parts and service. We also utilize sales representatives to inform prospective purchasers about our current product lines in an effort to drive sales to independent distributors. Management believes the strength of our distribution network and the breadth of our product offerings are two key advantages over our competitors.
 
Product Lines
 
We manufacture a broad line of wrecker, car carrier and trailer bodies to meet a full range of customer design, capacity and cost requirements.
 
Wreckers. Wreckers are generally used to recover and tow disabled vehicles and other equipment and range in type from the conventional tow truck to large recovery vehicles with up to 75-ton lifting capacities. Wreckers are available with specialized features, including underlifts, L-arms, crossbars and scoops, which lift disabled vehicles by the tires or front axle to minimize front end damage to the towed vehicles. Certain heavy-duty wrecker models offer rotating booms, which allow heavy-duty wreckers to recover vehicles from any angle, and remote control devices for recovery equipment. In addition, certain light-duty wreckers are equipped with automatic wheellift hookup devices that allow operators to engage a disabled or unattended vehicle without leaving the cab of the wrecker.
 
Our wreckers range in capacity from 4 to 75 tons, and are classified as either light-duty or heavy-duty, with wreckers of 16-ton or greater capacity being classified as heavy-duty. Light-duty wreckers are used to remove vehicles from accident scenes and vehicles illegally parked, abandoned or disabled, and for general recovery. Heavy-duty wreckers are used in towing and recovery applications including overturned tractor trailers, buses, motor homes and other large vehicles.

Car Carriers. Car carriers are specialized flat-bed vehicles with hydraulic tilt mechanisms that enable a towing operator to drive or winch a vehicle onto the bed for transport. Car carriers are used to transport new or disabled vehicles and other equipment and are particularly effective for transporting vehicles or other equipment over longer distances. In addition to transporting vehicles, car carriers may also be used for other purposes, including transportation of industrial equipment. Most professional towing operators have car carriers in their fleets to complement their towing capabilities.
Transport Trailers. Our multi-vehicle transport trailers are specialized auto transport trailers with upper and lower decks and hydraulic ramps for loading vehicles. These trailers are used for moving multiple vehicles for auto auctions, car dealerships, leasing companies and other similar applications. These trailers are easy to load and transport 6 to 7 vehicles. The vehicles can be secured to transport quickly with ratchet and chain tie-downs that are mounted throughout the frame of the transport. Many professional towing operators have added auto transport trailers to their fleets to add to their service offerings.
Brand Names
 
We manufacture and market our wreckers, car carriers and trailers under ten separate brand names. Although certain brands overlap in terms of features, prices and distributors, each brand has its own distinctive image and customer base.
 
Century®. The Century® brand is our “top-of-the-line” brand and represents what management believes to be the broadest product line in the industry. The Century® line was started in 1974 and produces wreckers ranging from 8-ton light-duty to 75-ton heavy-duty models, and car carriers in lengths from 20 to 30 feet. Management believes that the Century® brand has a reputation as the industry’s leading product innovator.
 
Vulcan®. Our Vulcan® product line includes a range of premium light-duty and heavy-duty wreckers, ranging from 8-ton light-duty to 75-ton heavy-duty models, and car carriers.
 
Challenger®. Our Challenger® products compete with the Century® and Vulcan® products and constitute a third premium product line. Challenger® products consist of heavy-duty wreckers with capacities ranging from 25 to 75 tons. The Challenger® line was started in 1975 and is known for high-performance heavy-duty wreckers and aesthetic design.
 
Holmes®. Our Holmes® product line includes mid-priced wreckers with 4 to 16-ton capacities, a 16-ton rotator and a detachable towing unit (DTU). The Holmes® wrecker was first produced in 1916. Historically, the Holmes® name has been the most well-recognized and leading industry brand both domestically and internationally.
 
Champion®. The Champion® brand, which was introduced in 1991, includes car carriers which range in length from 19 to 21 feet. The Champion® product line, which is generally lower-priced, allows us to offer a full line of car carriers at various competitive price points.
 
Chevron™. Our Chevron™ product line is comprised primarily of premium car carriers. Chevron™ produces a range of premium single-car, multi-car and industrial carriers, as well as wreckers ranging from 8-ton to 16-ton models.
 
Eagle®. Our Eagle® products consist of light-duty wreckers with the “Eagle Claw®” hook-up system that allows towing operators to engage a disabled or unattended vehicle without leaving the cab of the tow truck. The “Eagle Claw®” hook-up system was originally developed for the repossession market. Since acquiring Eagle, we have upgraded the quality and features of the Eagle® product line and expanded its recovery capability.
 
Titan®. Our Titan® product line is comprised of premium multi-vehicle transport trailers which can transport up to 7 vehicles depending on configuration.
 
Jige™. Our Jige™ product line is comprised of a broad line of premium light-duty and heavy-duty wreckers and car carriers marketed primarily in Europe. Jige™ is a market leader best known for its innovative designs of car carriers and light-duty wreckers necessary to operate within the narrow confines of European cities, as well as heavy-duty wreckers.
Boniface™. Our Boniface™ product line is comprised primarily of premium heavy-duty wreckers marketed primarily in Europe. Boniface™ produces heavy-duty wreckers specializing in the long underlift technology required to tow modern European tour buses.

Product Development and Manufacturing
 
Our Holmes® and Century® brand names are associated with four of the major innovations in the industry: the rapid reverse winch; the tow sling; the hydraulic lifting mechanism; and the underlift with parallel linkage and L-arms. Our engineering staff, in consultation with manufacturing personnel, uses computer-aided design and stress analysis systems to test new product designs and to integrate various product improvements. In addition to licensing new technologies, we have a continuing emphasis on research and development to achieve product innovations.
 
We manufacture wreckers, car carriers and trailers at six manufacturing facilities located in the United States, France and the United Kingdom. The manufacturing process for our products consists primarily of cutting and bending sheet steel or aluminum into parts that are welded together to form the wrecker, car carrier body or trailer. In addition, during the past several years, we have also begun to produce wrecker bodies using composites and other non-metallic materials. After the frame is formed, components such as hydraulic cylinders, winches, valves and pumps, which are purchased by us from third-party suppliers, are attached to the frame to form the completed wrecker or car carrier body. The completed body is either installed by us or shipped by common carrier to a distributor where it is then installed on a truck chassis. Generally, the wrecker or car carrier bodies are painted, and towing operators can select customized colors to coordinate with chassis colors or customer fleet colors. To the extent final painting is required before delivery, we either complete such painting or contract with independent paint shops for such services.
 
We purchase raw materials and component parts from several sources. Although we have no long-term supply contracts, management believes we have good relationships with our primary suppliers. In recent years prices have fluctuated significantly, but we have experienced no significant problems in obtaining adequate supplies of raw materials and component parts to meet the requirements of our production schedules. Management believes that the materials used in the production of our products are available at competitive prices from an adequate number of alternative suppliers. Accordingly, management does not believe that the loss of a single supplier would have a material adverse effect on our business.
 
Sales, Distribution and Marketing
 
The industry categorizes the towing and recovery market into three general product types: light-duty wreckers; heavy-duty wreckers; and car carriers. The light-duty wrecker market consists primarily of professional wrecker operators, repossession towing services, local and national governmental entities and repair shop or salvage company owners. The heavy-duty market includes professional wrecker operators serving the needs of commercial vehicle operators as well as governmental entities. The car carrier market has expanded to include equipment rental companies that offer delivery service and professional towing operators who desire to complement their existing towing capabilities.
 
We have developed a diverse network of independent distributors, consisting of approximately 80 distributors in North America, who serve all 50 states, Canada and Mexico, and numerous distributors that serve other foreign markets. In 2018, no single distributor accounted for more than 10% of our sales. Management believes our broad and diverse network of distributors provides us with the flexibility to adapt to market changes, lessens our dependence on particular distributors and reduces the impact of regional economic factors.
 
We engage sales representatives who provide sales support to our entire network of independent distributors. Sales representatives receive commissions on direct sales based on product type and brand and generally are assigned specific territories in which to promote sales of our products and to maintain customer relationships. To support sales and marketing efforts, we produce demonstrator models that are used by our sales representatives and independent distributors. In addition to providing services to our network of independent distributors, our sales representatives sell our products to various governmental entities, including the U.S. federal government and foreign governments, through prime contractors.
 
We routinely respond to requests for proposals or bid invitations in consultation with our local distributors. Our products have been selected by the United States General Services Administration as an approved source for certain federal and defense agencies. We intend to continue to pursue U.S. government and foreign government contracting opportunities.
 
The towing and recovery equipment industry places heavy marketing emphasis on product exhibitions at national, regional and international trade shows. To focus our marketing efforts and to control marketing costs, we concentrate our efforts on the major trade shows each year, and we work with our network of independent distributors to concentrate on various regional shows.

Product Warranties and Insurance
 
We generally offer a 12-month limited manufacturer’s product and service warranty on our wrecker and car carrier products. Our warranty generally provides for repair or replacement of failed parts or components. Our independent distributor customers regularly perform any needed warranty repair work themselves, rather than shipping products back to us, and then invoice us for the cost of the parts and labor. Management believes that we maintain adequate general liability and product liability insurance.
Backlog
 
We produce virtually all of our products to order. Our backlog is based upon customer purchase orders that we believe are firm. The level of backlog at any particular time, however, may not be an appropriate indicator of our future operating performance. Certain purchase orders may be subject to cancellation by the customer upon notification. Given our production and delivery schedules, management generally believes that the current backlog represents approximately five months of production.
Competition
 
The towing and recovery equipment manufacturing industry is highly competitive for sales to distributors and towing operators. Management believes that competition in this industry focuses on product quality and innovation, reputation, technology, customer service, product availability and price. We compete on the basis of each of these criteria, with an emphasis on product quality and innovation and customer service. Management also believes that a manufacturer’s relationship with distributors is a key component of success in the industry. Accordingly, we have invested substantial resources and management time in building and maintaining strong relationships with distributors. Management also believes that our products are regarded as high quality within their particular price points. Our marketing strategy is to continue to compete primarily on the basis of quality and reputation rather than solely on the basis of price, and to continue to target the growing group of professional towing operators who as end-users recognize the quality of our products.
 
Traditionally, the capital requirements for entry into the towing and recovery manufacturing industry have been relatively low. Management believes a manufacturer’s capital resources and access to technological improvements have become a more integral component of success in recent years. Certain of our competitors may have greater financial and other resources and may provide more attractive dealer and retail customer financing alternatives than we do.
 
Employees
 
We employed approximately 1,240 people as of December 31, 2018. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement, though our employees in France and the United Kingdom have certain similar rights provided by their respective government’s employment regulations. We consider our employee relations to be good.
Intellectual Property Rights
 
Our development of the underlift parallel linkage and L-arms was at the time considered one of the most innovative developments in the wrecker industry. This technology continues to be significant primarily because it allows the damage-free towing of aerodynamic vehicles made of lighter weight materials. This technology, particularly the L-arms, is still used in a majority of commercial wreckers today. Our patents on the L-arm have expired, but we hold a number of utility and design patents for our products. We have also obtained the rights to use and develop certain technologies owned or patented by others. Management believes that, during the life of our patents on our technology, utilizing our patented technology without a license would be an infringement of such patents.
Our trademarks “Century®,” “Holmes®,” “Champion®,” “Challenger®,” “Pro Star®,” “Street Runner®,” “Vulcan®,” “Right Approach®” and “Extreme Angle®,” among others, are registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. Management believes that our trademarks are well-recognized by dealers, distributors and end-users in their respective markets and are associated with a high level of quality and value.

Government Regulations and Environmental Matters
 
Our operations are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the generation, storage, handling, emission, transportation and discharge of materials into the environment. Management believes that we are in substantial compliance with all applicable federal, state and local provisions relating to the protection of the environment. The costs of complying with environmental protection laws and regulations have not had a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations in the past.
 
We act as a subcontractor for certain U.S. and other government programs. As a result, we are subject to extensive regulations and requirements of the U.S. and other government agencies and entities that govern these programs, including with respect to the award, administration and performance of contracts under such programs.
 
We are also subject to the additional diligence and disclosure requirements adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) in 2012 related to certain minerals sourced from the Democratic Republic of Congo or adjoining countries in connection with the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”). The SEC rules impose these obligations with respect to “conflict minerals,” defined as tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold, which are necessary to the functionality of a product manufactured, or contracted to be manufactured, by an SEC reporting company. If any “conflict minerals” that are necessary to the functionality of a product manufactured by an SEC reporting company originated in the Democratic Republic of Congo or an adjoining country, the rules require the issuer to prepare and file a report addressing its efforts to exercise due diligence on the source of such “conflict minerals” and their chain of custody.
 
We are also subject to the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Federal Trade Commission Improvement Act which regulates the description of warranties on products. The description and substance of our warranties are also subject to a variety of federal and state laws and regulations applicable to the manufacturing of vehicle components. Management believes that continued compliance with various government regulations will not materially affect our operations.
