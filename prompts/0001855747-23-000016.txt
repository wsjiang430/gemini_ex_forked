ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
Company Overview 
It’s our vision to bring simplicity and transparency to financial services, so every consumer can more easily access the capital they need to reach their financial goals. To realize this vision, we have built a market-leading, cloud-based software platform and suite of products for financial providers to transform consumer banking experiences and streamline workflows for their teams. From the moment a consumer starts an application for a loan or a deposit account to the moment they digitally sign the final documents, our software platform streamlines the process. Consumers expect modern banking experiences to be as simple as other online shopping experiences, and Blend enables financial providers to quickly deliver modern experiences that are easy to access and use. However, financial services firms may not have the resources and in-house software expertise to fulfill consumer demands for intuitive, digital, and easy-to-use products. In addition, most financial providers are burdened by antiquated, inflexible systems and use separate technology stacks for different product lines, making it difficult to drive rapid improvements. Consequently, a broad range of financial providers including banks, credit unions, fintechs, and community and independent mortgage banks have turned to Blend to help them accelerate their digital transformation initiatives and position themselves for future growth. 
Our Segments
We operate our business in two segments: Blend Platform and Title365.
The Blend Platform segment comprises a suite of products that power the entire origination process from back end workflows to consumer experience. Our growing suite of out-of-the-box, white-label products currently powers digital-first consumer journeys for mortgages, home equity loans and lines of credit, vehicle loans, personal loans, credit cards, and deposit accounts. Each of our products is built from an extensive library of modular components assembled into consumer journeys that typically include data collection, verification checks, product selection, pricing, pre-approvals, disclosures delivery, addressing stipulations, and signing closing documents. 
The Blend Platform segment also contains a software platform, called Blend Builder Platform, which offers a set of low-code, drag-and-drop design tools, modular components and integrations to allow our customers to create and deploy their own new product offerings. After three years of research and development, the Blend Builder Platform has evolved to the point where it can now power Composable Origination, the ability to easily configure or build custom workflows from a pre-built set of components, all while leveraging existing infrastructure. Financial services firms can experience Composable Origination by building custom solutions using the Blend Builder Platform, or with pre-built solutions such as Instant Home Equity, Deposit Accounts, Credit Cards, and more.
In 2022, our products within the Blend Platform segment helped financial services firms process nearly $1.7 trillion in loan applications. We bring together an extensive ecosystem of technology, data, and service providers through our software platform, enabling financial services firms to collaborate with third parties to provide best-in-class banking experiences to consumers. As consumers use our software platform to access financial products, they can also shop for realtors, title and property and casualty insurance products, and other service providers through integrated marketplaces that are introduced at the precise moment these products or services are needed. As more consumers use our software platform, we are able to attract a broader range of ecosystem partners, which allows us to deliver more value to consumers and attract more financial services providers as customers. This creates a powerful network effect and differentiator for our business. 
Strong customer relationships are the cornerstone of Blend’s success. We establish ourselves as a critical and long-term strategic partner to our customers by powering essential revenue-generating experiences, integrating our software into back office systems, and staffing teams chartered with increasing the value to the customer over time. Blend’s customer relationships grow as our platform is used for a broader range of products. Customers typically complete an initial deployment of one or two products and then add more products over time, building toward a unified consumer experience that supports multi-product journeys.
Blend’s business model is designed to align our growth with our customers’ priorities. In the Blend Platform segment, we offer our products through software-as-a-service agreements, where fees are assessed based on completed transactions, such as a funded loan, new account opening, or closing transaction. We do not charge for abandoned or rejected applications, even though they cause us to incur costs. Completed transaction fees are determined by the number and type of software platform components that are needed to support each product offering. Where applicable, we may also charge licensing fees for access to our platform. Additionally, we generate revenue through commissions or service fees when consumers use our marketplaces to select a real estate agent, property and casualty insurance carrier, title insurance underwriter, or settlement services provider. 
In June 2021, Blend acquired a 90.1% ownership of Title365, an underwritten title insurance agency engaged in selling title insurance policies and escrow services throughout the United States. Integrating Title365 with our software platform has enabled financial services firms to automate title commitments and streamline communication with consumers and settlement teams. 
Together we enable our customers to accelerate the title, settlement, and closing process at scale for mortgages, home equity lines of credit, and home equity loans. In performing title search services, Title365 serves as an agent to place and bind title insurance policies with third-party underwriters. Title365 escrow, closing and settlement services are primarily associated with managing the closing of real estate transactions, including the processing of funds on behalf of the transaction participants, gathering and recording the required closing documents, and providing notary and other real estate or title-related activities. Title365 also provides title services in connection with a borrower default and with the issuance of home equity lines of credit and home equity loans. Title365 became our second reportable segment at the time of acquisition. In June 2022, we completed the migration of the largest Title365 customer from traditional title to the software-enabled title solution. This solution automates the flow of the title orders from the customer’s loan origination software and passes the orders through the Blend Platform. In connection with the migration we changed the composition of our reporting segments and the Blend Platform segment now includes our software-enabled title component and Title365 consists of the traditional title business.
The industry in which we operate is heavily influenced by government policies and overall economic conditions. The real estate environment, including interest rates and the general economic environment, typically impact the demand for mortgage and mortgage related products. Purchase volume and refinance activity were strong in 2021 and 2020 relative to historical averages over the preceding decade; however, an increase in interest rates due to efforts by the Federal Reserve to manage rising inflation, combined with ongoing supply constraints, have resulted in a decline in mortgage origination activity for 2022. As a large portion of our revenue is driven by mortgage and mortgage related transaction volumes, declines in the mortgage origination volumes have had, and are likely to continue to have, adverse effects on our business.
In 2022, we have seen a 3.9% decrease in total reported banking transactions and a 31.9% decrease in mortgage transactions, particularly refinance transactions, on our software platform compared to 2021. We attribute the majority of this decrease to rapidly rising interest rates, decreased housing affordability, and uncertain worldwide political and economic conditions. Overall industry origination volumes, as reported by the Mortgage Bankers Association (“MBA”), have decreased by 56% over the same period. Due to deteriorating economic and market conditions, including a decline in our market capitalization and current and projected declines in the operating results of the Title365 segment, in 2022 we recorded a full impairment of goodwill and customer relationship intangible assets acquired in the Title365 business combination.
Our Solutions 
Blend Builder Platform for financial services firms is designed to power the end-to-end consumer journey for any banking product. From the moment a consumer starts an application for a loan or a deposit account to the moment they digitally sign their final documents, our software platform streamlines the process. Our growing library of composable product and workflow modules unlock the limitations of our customers’ existing technology stack, empowering financial services firms to deliver personalized, proactive and simple experiences without sacrificing speed or spend.
Blend is well positioned to benefit from the acceleration in digital transformation investment taking place across the financial services sector. Our software simplifies complex origination processes that can include hundreds of tasks and require interactions with dozens of external technology, data, and services providers. By automating these tasks and developing pre-built integrations, we help our customers potentially avoid years of expensive in-house software development, in addition to increasing productivity by freeing up resources for other initiatives. 
Composable Origination, powered by Blend Builder Platform
Product Offerings 
Blend Builder Platform powers the mission-critical interface between financial services firms and consumers. Financial services firms can rapidly deploy our growing number of out-of-the-box, white-labeled products for: 
•Mortgage — provides an end-to-end digital mortgage experience from application to close that puts financial services firms at the center of the broader homeownership journey.

•Personal Loans — drives faster pre-approvals for unsecured and secured personal loans, lines of credit, and overdraft protection lines. 
•Deposit Accounts — increases application conversion rates and reduces fraud risk with features that support financial services firms’ Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money laundering policies.
In addition, we have developed a suite of products that we offer to facilitate the homeownership journey for consumers that are integrated into the end-to-end digital mortgage experience delivered by our Mortgage products. These are:
•Close — streamlines traditional, hybrid, and fully digital closing experiences for mortgages, home equity lines of credit, and home equity loans.
•Income Verification for Mortgage and Home Equity — leverages data integrations with payroll data providers to deliver income reports that are recognized as verified sources of income. 
•Title — enables streamlining of the title, settlement, and closing processes at scale for mortgages, home equity lines of credit, and home equity loans.
•Homeowners Insurance — allows consumers to easily compare quotes from as many as 30 insurance carriers, depending on carriers’ coverage areas, and connect with an insurance specialist to purchase a policy.
•Realty — facilitates matches between consumers and local real estate agents who can provide guidance throughout the purchase process, and where eligible, the consumer can receive a rebate on the purchase of their home.
Blend Builder Platform 
Each of our products is built from an extensive library of modular components that typically include data collection, verification checks, product selection, pricing, pre-approvals, disclosures, addressing stipulations, and signing closing documents. New product offerings can be rapidly created by Blend by assembling our modular components into workflows using Blend Builder Platform, which includes tools for:
•Experience design — through low-code design tools, we enable the creation of flexible, consumer-facing forms, user flows for data collection, and automated communications that reflect the brand of each of our customers. 
•Process orchestration — through a drag-and-drop editor, we enable the creation of workflows that guide consumers through the process of getting a loan or opening a deposit account. 
•Persona-based workspaces — our software platform provides omni-channel user experiences for a broad range of stakeholder personas, including consumers, loan officers, bankers, real estate agents, settlement agents, and notaries. 
The modular components that make up our products generally fall under the categories of verification, decisioning, workflow intelligence, and marketplaces. 
Verification Components 
Our verification components automate confirmation tasks that are needed to underwrite a loan or approve the opening of a new deposit account. We have pre-built integrations with providers of technology and services to address requirements for: 
•Identity verification — to help financial services firms reduce fraud risk and address compliance requirements for know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) laws, we have integrations that can capture data from government issued identification cards and engage third-party identity verification service providers.
•Asset verification — with consumer permission, we enable financial services firms to verify account assets from directly-sourced data, sparing applicants the burden of manually collecting this information and providing financial services firms with greater assurance of data accuracy and reliability. 
•Income and employment verification — we integrate with payroll data providers to retrieve paystubs, enabling financial services firms to verify an applicant’s income, employment details, and work history. 
•Credit — our software platform allows financial services firms to retrieve credit reports from any of the three major credit bureaus and supports both soft and hard credit inquiries. 
Decisioning Components 
Our decisioning components reduce the need for human intervention by automatically applying business rules throughout an application workflow configured by a financial services firm. Examples include: 
•Pre-approvals — we automate the generation of a pre-approval decision when consumers meet specific underwriting criteria established by a financial services firm. 
•Cross-selling — we enable financial services firms to present personalized product recommendations to consumers based on data collected in the course of another product application. 
•Adverse actions — we automatically generate adverse action notifications for consumers that do not meet minimum credit criteria established by a financial services firm. 
Workflow Intelligence Components
Our workflow intelligence components manage data collection and automate tasks throughout the loan origination process. We create application flows with branching logic to streamline initial data collection. Wherever possible, our software eliminates the need for document uploads by integrating with authoritative data sources. We also automate key processing tasks so consumers can begin to address stipulations immediately after a loan application is submitted, including product and pricing selection, automated requests for letters of explanation, and capturing digital signatures on disclosures packages, resulting in faster turn-around times.
Marketplace Components
Our curated marketplace components enable consumers to shop for products and services presented at the precise moment of need during an application for a loan. We currently offer marketplaces that enable consumers to find real estate agents, insurance carriers, and automobiles for sale online. These marketplaces help consumers quickly locate service providers with competitive rates and enable financial services firms to increase operational efficiency by providing a one-stop shopping experience. Our acquisition of Title365 enabled us to integrate the title, settlement, and escrow process further into our platform and develop a marketplace that provides consumers and financial services firms with the flexibility to choose title insurance partners that provide services at competitive rates.
APIs and Integrations
Through our open APIs we are able to seamlessly integrate the capabilities of technology, data, and service providers into our software platform. As we develop integrations with new partners, our customers can quickly experience the benefits across their product suite. In addition, financial services firms can use our APIs to develop integrations with the back office systems in their tech stack, creating a unified, agile architecture for powering superior consumer journeys.
The Blend Ecosystem
We bring together an extensive partner ecosystem through our software platform consisting of technology, data, and service providers. We provide the central hub through which these partners collaborate to deliver best-in-class consumer journeys in highly efficient ways. In addition, we provide our ecosystem partners with a critical distribution channel to reach a universe of more than 100 million consumers at the precise moment they are looking for products and services through the financial services firms we serve.
By providing the software that powers consumer journeys at financial services firms across digital, contact center, and branch channels, we are able to benefit from a substantial volume of high-intent consumer traffic with no incremental acquisition costs. As more financial services firms become Blend customers or deploy additional products through our software platform, the number of consumers using our software platform grows, which attracts more service providers to our ecosystem to serve those consumers. As a result, consumers benefit from more opportunities to save time and money, financial services firms benefit from increased operational efficiency, our partners benefit from increased distribution, and Blend generates additional revenue. We believe this win-win-win-win model creates a powerful network effect that will continue to expand our serviceable addressable market over time.
Key elements of our partner ecosystem include:
•Technology Partners — we have built integrations with technology vendors including leading providers of CRM platforms, loan origination systems, core banking systems, document generation systems, and pricing and product engines. These integrations accelerate our deployments and reduce the need for financial services firms to build their own integrations.
•Data Partners — we have partnerships with data services providers that help automate verification checks and reduce the need for consumers to upload documents. These data services providers include credit bureaus, payroll service providers, tax preparers, consumer asset data integrators, employment verification services, and anti-fraud services.
•Marketplace Partners — we partner with realtors and insurance carriers who offer their services through marketplaces integrated into our consumer journeys, enabling consumers to shop for service providers at the precise moment they need these services. 
•Settlement Services Partners — we onboard settlement agents onto our software platform, enabling us to streamline the settlement and closing process for consumers getting a mortgage, home equity line of credit, or home equity loan.
To provide consumers with optimal end-to-end journeys through our software platform, we have created our own property and casualty insurance agency and our own title insurance agency. Consistent with this strategy, on June 30, 2021, we acquired a 90.1% interest in Title365, a leading title insurance agency, from Mr. Cooper Group Inc., or Mr. Cooper, Title365 allows us to marry operational scale with technology to provide a better user experience for loan teams and consumers by enabling financial services firms to automate title commitments and streamline communication with consumers and settlement teams.
Key Benefits to Our Customers 
We help our customers increase their revenue by powering best-in-class experiences that result in: 
•Increased consumer acquisition — our self-service consumer journeys are available at any hour on any device, which contributes to a higher volume of application submissions. In addition, through extensive automation, we enable loan teams to handle a greater volume of loan and deposit account applications.
•Increased consumer conversion — by leveraging the modular components and orchestration capabilities of our platform, financial services firms are able to accelerate the development and delivery of new financial products, ultimately increasing the number of borrowers that complete their loan and deposit account applications.
•Increased consumer satisfaction — we enable consumers to apply for products in minutes on any device, transition seamlessly between channels throughout the origination process, benefit from as much human support as they prefer, and save money on realtor commissions, home insurance, title insurance, and automobile purchases. 
We also position our customers for long-term success by helping them streamline operations and increase efficiency through:
•Faster innovation cycles — through our software platform, we help financial services firms evolve their business at a faster pace and adapt more quickly to changing market conditions than ever before. Our flexible software platform reduces time to market for new product offerings and eliminates the need to build integrations with an extensive array of technology and data services providers.
•Lower operating costs — we reduce labor costs, hedging costs, and warehouse line costs by automating workflows, shortening loan cycles, and enabling digital closings.
•Lower development costs — our customers benefit from a flexible, white-label software platform that is regularly updated and enhanced by hundreds of engineering, product, and operations specialists. 
•Reduced risk of fraud and human errors — we aggregate financial data from multiple sources with consent from consumers, which reduces the need to upload, review, and transcribe documents.
Ultimately, it is our goal to help banks, credit unions, fintechs, and other non-bank lenders proactively improve financial opportunities for consumers. By removing friction, increasing transparency, and bringing greater personalization to consumer acquisition workflows, we see the potential for our software platform to help financial services firms improve the lives of millions of consumers. 
What Sets Us Apart 
We believe we are well positioned to serve as a long-term strategic innovation partner and provider of mission-critical software to financial services firms due to the following factors: 
•Single software platform designed for any banking product — as a leading cloud-based software provider that streamlines the end-to-end consumer journey for mortgages, consumer loans, and deposit accounts through a single, unified software platform, we are a trailblazer with powerful competitive advantages. We support multi-product shopping experiences and enable consumers to move seamlessly across digital devices, contact centers, and branches throughout the origination process. We also provide additional benefits and incentives for customers to standardize on our software platform across products and channels. We continue to invest in research and development to build our software platform and grow our business. We believe the time, cost, and effort to replicate the breadth of our products and depth of our capabilities is difficult for others to match.
•Composable Origination, powered by Blend Builder Platform — we enable financial services firms to rapidly build and launch new product offerings by leveraging our low-code design tools and an extensive library of modular components purpose-built for loan origination, account opening, and consumer onboarding. Through our software platform, we deliver product updates on a weekly basis. Our products are highly complex and require us to have advanced knowledge of modern software development techniques as well as deep industry expertise, including in-depth knowledge of financial services regulations, product offerings, and operational workflows for approving loans and opening accounts. We manage this complexity for our customers, allowing them to focus on driving their business priorities.
•Expansive partner ecosystem — through our integrations and marketplaces, we enable technology, data, and service providers to collaborate through our software platform and provide superior consumer experiences. The scale of our partner ecosystem has been growing, and the acquisition of Title365 further added to our software platform and operational capacity. By aggregating transaction volume across multiple financial services firms, we are able to negotiate competitive rates for technology and data services we bundle into our products. We believe it would take competitors substantial time, effort, and cost to replicate the scale and benefits of our rapidly growing partner ecosystem.
•Powerful network effects — by providing the software that powers consumer journeys at financial services firms across digital, contact center, and branch channels, we are able to benefit from a substantial volume of high-intent consumer traffic with zero incremental consumer acquisition costs. As more consumers use our software platform to apply for financial services products, we attract more partners to our ecosystem. This allows us to deliver more value to consumers, attract more financial services firms as customers, expand our existing relationships with financial services firms, and generate increased revenue from completed transactions, creating a powerful network effect and differentiator for our business. Our aim is to become the distribution platform of choice for technology, data, and service providers to efficiently reach and serve consumers undertaking financial transactions.
•Agency subsidiaries and licensing — we created our own property and casualty insurance agency with licensing in all 50 states to facilitate transactions in our home insurance marketplace, and in 2021 we acquired 90.1% interest in Title365, one of the largest title insurance agencies in the United States, with licenses and partnerships covering all 50 states in order to deliver the benefits of our software platform to financial services firms at greater scale. We believe the complexity, cost, and level of effort to duplicate this operational scale is difficult for others to replicate.
•Extensive network of customers — we supply mission-critical software to hundreds of financial services firms, including 47 of the top 100 financial services firms in the United States by assets under management and 34 of the top 100 non-bank mortgage lenders by loan volume. We also have a proven track record of delivering our products securely, at scale, and in a way that meets their demanding needs. Once deployed, we become deeply embedded in business processes and integrated with back office systems. This enables us to cross-sell additional solutions to our customers. In addition, the scale and diversity of our customer base provides us with extensive data and deep insights that help us strengthen our software platform, enhancing our ability to serve existing and future customers. 
Our Growth Strategies 
We are working to drive growth through the following strategic priorities, while always maintaining a laser focus on the success of our customers:
•Increase the volume of banking transactions we power for our customers — we believe there is a large market for our software platform in the United States and around the world. By attracting new customers, growing our relationships with existing customers, and helping customers identify additional opportunities for platform deployment, our revenue will grow as our transaction volume increases. Within the top 100 large insured US chartered commercial banks as published by Federal Reserve only 39 are currently our customers in the Blend Platform segment, providing a large, untapped opportunity for Blend in addition to broadening our presence with existing customers. As of December 31, 2022, our product portfolio consisted of eight primary software products and three marketplace offerings, and 72% of our customers were using less than four products or marketplaces, which gives us an opportunity to expand these relationships.
•Continue to invest in new product offerings — we see numerous opportunities to expand our product suite both horizontally and vertically over time in ways that help us increase the volume of transactions we power and increase our revenue per banking transaction. Through our deep customer relationships, we gain insights that help us align our roadmap and strategy with the most pressing needs of financial services firms. While we focus today on consumer banking, we believe we can rapidly expand our library of modular components to support commercial banking products as well. In addition to developing products in-house, we anticipate pursuing selective acquisitions and 
partnerships to accelerate our growth. We believe we are well-positioned over the long term to become one of the top cloud-based banking platforms responsible for powering end-to-end consumer experiences across both origination and servicing.
•Integrate marketplaces into our end-to-end consumer journeys — we generate commissions as consumers use our integrated marketplaces to select a realtor, purchase property, casualty and title insurance, or shop online for used cars, which helps us increase our revenue per banking transaction. Our integrated shopping experiences can generate additional commissions with zero incremental consumer acquisition costs, while enabling financial services firms to deliver better consumer experiences and drive operational efficiency.
Our Customers
Strong customer relationships are a cornerstone of our success. Our customer relationships grow over time as our software platform is used for a broader range of products. Customers typically complete an initial deployment for one or two products and then add more products over time, building toward a unified consumer experience that supports multi-product shopping journeys. 
Our customers are currently based in the United States and range in size from the largest banks, credit unions, fintechs, and other non-bank mortgage lenders in the nation to smaller community lenders with less than $1 billion in assets under management.
We focus our go-to-market strategy on large financial services firms. As of December 31, 2022, in the Blend Platform segment, we had 346 customers, including 39 of the top 100 financial services firms in the United States by assets under management and 24 of the top 100 non-bank mortgage lenders in the United States by loan volume. In 2022, 20 customers each generated more than $1 million in revenue for us in the Blend Platform segment, which represented 57.4% of the Blend Platform segment revenue. As of December 31, 2022, in the Title365 segment, we had 123 customers including 15 of the top 100 financial services firms in the United States by assets under management and 17 of the top 100 non-bank mortgage lenders in the United States by loan volume. In 2022, 12 customers each generated more than $1 million in revenue for us in the Title365 segment, which represented 89.4% of Title365 segment revenue.
Sales and Marketing 
Our team focuses on building successful long-term customer relationships through a customer-first go-to-market approach. Accounts are staffed with account teams who are responsible for making customers successful using our products, whether it is through technical implementations, organizational change, loan officer enablement, or industry best practices. Our internal teams are highly incentivized to go beyond the initial sale and to get accounts live and fully adopted on Blend. 
Our products are sold through a direct sales force that continues to manage customer relationships on an ongoing basis post-sale. To create incentives for acquiring new customers and growing existing relationships, compensation is based on a combination of closing new deals and growing transaction volume through our software platform. We use a “land and expand” approach to growing customer relationships, typically completing an initial deployment for one or two products and then adding more products over time. 
Our marketing approach focuses on helping the industry understand the value of Blend’s suite of products and the power of the Blend Builder Platform. We aim to provide highly personalized experiences for customers and prospects as they engage with Blend and regularly highlight the success of our customers and share the impact Blend has had on their business. Our marketing efforts span across brand awareness, content development, digital marketing, demand generation and supporting our direct sales team. To maintain a high level of engagement with our customers, we participate in leading industry conferences and host our own executive summit called Blend Forum, where we discuss the latest innovations shaping the future of financial services. 
Customer Success 
We work in close partnership with our customers to help them rapidly deploy our software platform and realize value as quickly as possible from the breadth of our features. By investing deeply in the success of our customers, we seek to build a strong foundation for long-term relationships. Each customer is supported by a team of customer success managers, deployment and integration specialists. Most new customer deployments are completed within three to four months, including integrations to back-end systems. We often discount our deployment services during implementation to allow customers to engage with our platform and incentivize the customer to expand their investment in our products.
We also provide both free and paid training services and maintain an online knowledge base with best practices and training information to help our customers educate loan originators, processors, and support staff. We publish weekly release notes featuring product updates, and our support professionals are available 24 hours per day, seven days per week, and 52 weeks per year to answer questions and help customers resolve issues. 
Research & Development 
Our software platform operates as the interface that connects consumers, financial services firms, and third-party service providers such as realtors, property and casualty insurance providers, title agencies, and notaries. We invest substantial resources in research and development to expand our software platform by developing new components, features, and product offerings. Our engineering, product, and design teams build our software platform and products in close partnership with our customers and use focus groups with both customers and consumers to gain a deep understanding of the tasks and workflows we automate. We also analyze the data from millions of applications flowing through our system to understand opportunities for driving further efficiencies and improvements. 
We use Agile software development methodologies and automated testing to support continuous product deployment with new code shipping nearly every week. Our modular platform architecture uses microservices and APIs to support the ability for our customers to create unique financial product offerings and consumer journeys.
Competition 
The primary competitors for our software platform include point solution vendors, providers of back office software with proprietary digital capabilities, and systems developed internally at financial services firms. We also expect new players to enter the market and existing companies to allocate more resources to develop and market products that compete with ours. We contract with several providers of back-office software for financial services firms in order to integrate our products with their software, and these providers may choose to offer competing software products. We believe we distinguish ourselves from the competition through the breadth of our product offerings, the flexibility of our configurable platform architecture, our ability to support multi-product shopping experiences, the scale of our ecosystem, the service-provider marketplaces integrated into our product offerings, the size and scale of our customer base, and our ability to power superior end-to-end consumer journeys. 
Competition in the title insurance industry may impact our business and is intense, particularly with respect to price, service, and expertise. Larger commercial mortgage originators also look to the size and financial strength of a title insurance agency. Although we provide title and settlement services to large commercial customers and mortgage originators, there are many other title insurance agencies that have substantially greater gross revenue than we do and, if affiliated with a title insurance underwriter, could have significantly greater capital. The size and number of title insurance agencies vary in the geographic areas in which we conduct our title business. Our competitors include other major title brokers and underwriters, as well as other regional title insurance companies, underwritten title companies, and independent agency operations at the regional and local level. Competition, expansion of existing competitors, or new entrants to the title business could affect our business operations and financial condition. 
The principal competitive factors in our industry include:
•product functionality;
•consumer experience;
•employee user experience;
•time to value;
•total cost of ownership;
•flexibility;
•scalability;
•ease of integration;
•level of customer satisfaction;
•ability to innovate rapidly;
•brand awareness; and
•brand reputation.
We believe our product strategy, speed of innovation, and company culture allow us to compete favorably with respect to these factors. However, we expect competition to increase as our competitors invest more in their digital capabilities. Our ability to remain competitive will depend on our ongoing efforts to expand our product capabilities and increase the value we deliver to our customers.
Intellectual Property 
We believe that our success depends in part on our ability to protect our core technology and innovations. We rely on a combination of trademark, patent, copyright, and trade secret laws in the United States and other jurisdictions, as well as license agreements, contractual restrictions, non-disclosure agreements, intellectual property assignment agreements, and other contractual protections, to establish and protect our intellectual property rights. We control access to our proprietary technology by entering into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors, and confidentiality agreements with third parties. Though we rely in part upon these legal and contractual protections, we believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel, creation of new services, features and functionality, and frequent enhancements to our software platform are more essential to establishing and maintaining our technology leadership position. In addition, we use open source software in our services. The terms of various open source licenses have not been interpreted by United States courts, and there is a risk that such licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our services. 
As of December 31, 2022, we had one issued patent in the United States and patent applications pending in the United States, European Patent Office, Canada, and Australia. We continue to evaluate our intellectual property portfolio, and may seek patent protection for additional intellectual property developed by us in the future. Additionally, we have registered the term “Blend” in the United States, the United Kingdom, and the European Union, and as of December 31, 2022, we had pending trademark applications in the United States. Furthermore, we have and will continue to evaluate, maintain, and register terms and logos that we use, or plan to use, as part of our business. We also have registered domain names that we use in, or are related to our business, most importantly www.blend.com. 
We intend to pursue additional intellectual property protection to the extent we believe it would be beneficial and cost-effective. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights, they may not be respected in the future or may be invalidated, circumvented, or challenged. For additional information, see the section titled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property—Failure to adequately protect our intellectual property could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.”
Government Regulation 
Our customers and prospective customers are highly regulated and are generally required to comply with stringent regulations in connection with performing business functions that our products and services address. Additionally, we facilitate compliance with these regulatory requirements. While we currently operate our business in an effort to ensure our business itself is not subject to extensive regulation, there is a risk that certain regulations could become applicable to us, including as we expand the functionality of and services offered through our software platform.

Data Privacy and Security
The data we collect, use, receive, and otherwise process is integral to our business, providing us with insights to improve our software platform and our products. Our collection, use, receipt, and other processing of data in our business subjects us to numerous U.S. state, federal, and foreign laws and regulations addressing privacy, data protection, information security, and the collection, storing, sharing, use, transfer, disclosure, protection and processing of certain types of data. Such regulations include, for example, GLBA, the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, CAN-SPAM, Canada’s Anti-Spam Law, TCPA, FCRA, the FTC Act, and CCPA. We work to comply with, and to help allow customers to comply with, applicable laws and regulations relating to privacy, data protection and information security. This helps underpin our strategy of building trust and providing a strong experience to customers.
Despite our efforts to comply with applicable laws, regulations, and other obligations relating to privacy, data protection, and information security, it is possible that our interpretations of the law, practices, or software platform could be inconsistent with, or fail or be alleged to fail to meet all requirements of, such laws, regulations, or obligations. Our failure, or the failure by our partners, vendors, service providers, or customers, to comply with applicable laws or regulations or any other obligations relating to privacy, data protection, or information security, or any compromise of security that results in unauthorized access to, or use or release of personal information or other data relating to consumers or other individuals, or the perception that any of the foregoing types of failure or compromise has occurred, could damage our reputation, discourage new and existing customers and consumers from using our software platform, or result in fines, investigations, or proceedings by governmental agencies and private claims and litigation, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
See the section titled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Legal and Regulatory Environment—Changes in laws or regulations relating to privacy, information security, data protection or the protection or transfer of personal information, or any actual or perceived failure by us to comply with such laws and regulations or any other obligations relating to privacy, information security, data protection or the protection or transfer of personal information, could adversely affect our business.” for additional information about our approach to laws and regulations relating to privacy, data protection, and information security.
Human Capital
Our employees are a key reason for our success and are essential for our continued growth. Our culture, industry success, and competitive compensation enable us to successfully retain our employees and to effectively recruit new talent aligned with our vision. We have received numerous awards for corporate culture and professional development. In 2021, we were named as one of America’s Best Workplaces by Inc. Magazine.
As of December 31, 2022, we had a total of 1,546 employees. Since April 2022, we have undertaken several workforce reduction actions as part of our broader efforts to improve cost efficiency and better align our operating structure with our business activities (the “2022 Workforce Reduction Plans”). In January 2023, we announced a further workforce reduction plan which will impact approximately 340 employees and will further streamline our title operations, as well as our corporate operations in R&D, sales and marketing, and general and administrative functions (the “January Plan” and, together with the 2022 Workforce Reduction Plans, the “Workforce Reduction Plans”). As part of these Workforce Reduction Plans, we offered all terminated employees 9 weeks of pay with continued health insurance coverage, two months of COBRA pay, and outplacement services to assist them in finding their next opportunity. Other offerings included access to a Talent Network where they can register to share their resume with thousands of recruiters and companies looking for great talent and continued access to Blend’s employee assistance program, which offers free and confidential support and counseling to employees, their spouses, and their dependents.
None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.
