Item 1.    BUSINESS
Overview
Allegion plc ("Allegion," "we," "us" or "the Company") is a leading global provider of security products and solutions that keep people safe, secure and productive. We make the world safer as a company of experts, securing the places where people thrive, and we create peace of mind by pioneering safety and security. We offer an extensive and versatile portfolio of mechanical and electronic security products across a range of market-leading brands. Our experts across the globe deliver high-quality security products, services and systems, and we use our deep expertise to serve as trusted partners to end-users who seek customized solutions to their security needs. 

Allegion Principal Products 
Door closers and controls | Doors and door systems 
Electronic security products | Electronic, biometric and mobile access control systems 
Exit devices | Locks, locksets, portable locks, key systems and services
Time, attendance and workforce productivity systems | Other accessories 

Access control security products and solutions are critical elements in every building and home. Many door openings are configured to maximize a room’s particular form and function while also meeting local and national building and safety code requirements and end-user security needs. Most buildings have multiple door openings, each serving its own purpose and requiring different specific access-control solutions. Each door must fit exactly within its frame, be prepared precisely for its hinges, synchronize with its specific lockset and corresponding latch and align with a specific key to secure the door. Moreover, security products are increasingly linked electronically, integrated into software and popular consumer technology platforms and controlled with mobile applications, creating additional functionality and complexity.
We believe our ability to deliver a wide range of solutions that can be custom-configured to meet end-users’ security needs is a key driver of our success. We accomplish this with: 

• | Our extensive and versatile product portfolio, combined with our deep expertise, which enables us to deliver the right products and solutions to meet diverse security and functional specifications and to successfully and securely integrate into leading technology and systems;


• | Our consultative approach and expertise, which enables us to develop the most efficient and appropriate building security and access-control specifications to fulfill the unique needs of our end-users and their partners, including architects, contractors, home-builders and engineers;


• | Our access to and management of key channels in the market, which is critical to delivering our products in an efficient and consistent manner; and


• | Our enterprise excellence capabilities, including our global manufacturing operations and agile supply chain, which facilitate our ability to deliver specific product and system configurations to end-users and consumers worldwide, quickly and efficiently.

We believe that the security products industry is growing and will continue to benefit from several global macroeconomic and long-term demographic trends, including:

• | the convergence of mechanical and electronic security products;


• | heightened awareness of security requirements;


• | increased global urbanization; and


• | the shift to a digital, interconnected environment.

We believe the security products industry will also benefit from continued growth in institutional, commercial and residential end-markets. As end-users adopt newer technologies in their facilities and homes, we also expect growth in the global electronic product categories we serve to outperform growth in mechanical products. 
We operate in three geographic regions: Americas; Europe, Middle East, India and Africa ("EMEIA"); and Asia Pacific. We sell our products and solutions under the following brands:

For the year ended December 31, 2018, we generated Net revenues of $2,731.7 million and operating income of $525.8 million. 
History and Developments
We were incorporated in Ireland on May 9, 2013, to hold the commercial and residential security businesses of Ingersoll Rand plc ("Ingersoll Rand"). On December 1, 2013, we became a stand-alone public company after Ingersoll Rand completed the separation of these businesses from the rest of Ingersoll Rand via the transfer of these businesses from Ingersoll Rand to us and the issuance by us of ordinary shares directly to Ingersoll Rand’s shareholders (the "Spin-off"). Our security businesses have long and distinguished operating histories. Several of our brands were established nearly 100 years ago, and many originally created their categories: 

• | Von Duprin, established in 1908, was awarded the first exit device patent;


• | Schlage, established in 1920, was awarded the first patents granted for the cylindrical lock and the push button lock;


• | LCN, established in 1926, created the first door closer;


• | CISA, established in 1926, devised the first electronically controlled lock; and


• | SimonsVoss, established in 1995, created the first keyless digital transponder.

We have built upon these founding legacies since our entry into the security products market through the acquisition of Schlage, Von Duprin and LCN in 1974. Today, we continue to develop and introduce innovative and market-leading products. In 2018, product innovation spanned:

• | Improvements to the user experience, product design and ergonomics;


• | New technology solutions, software, mobile applications and integration with leading platforms; and


• | Improved locks and lights for portable security.

Recent examples of successful product launches are illustrated in the table below:

Industry and Competition 
The global markets we serve encompass commercial, institutional and residential construction markets throughout North America, EMEIA and Asia Pacific. In recent years, as end-users adopt newer technologies in their facilities and single and multi-family homes, growth in electronic security products and solutions continues to outperform growth in mechanical security products and solutions. We expect the security products industry will benefit from favorable long-term demographic trends such as continued urbanization of the global population, increased concerns about safety and security and technology-driven innovation. 
The security products markets are highly competitive and fragmented throughout the world, with a number of large multi-national companies and thousands of smaller regional and local companies. This high fragmentation primarily reflects local regulatory requirements and highly variable end-user needs. We believe our principal global competitors are Assa Abloy AB and dormakaba Group. We also face competition in various markets and product categories throughout the world, including from Spectrum Brands Holdings, Inc. in the North American residential market. As we move into more technologically-advanced product categories, we may also compete against new, more specialized competitors. 
Our success depends on a variety of factors, including brand and reputation, product breadth, integration with popular technology platforms, quality and delivery capabilities, price and service capabilities. As many of our businesses sell through wholesale distribution, our success also depends on building and partnering with a strong channel network. Although price often serves as an important customer decision criterion, we also compete based on the breadth and quality of our products and solutions, our ability to custom-configure solutions to meet individual end-user requirements and our global supply chain.

Door closers are devices that automatically close doors after they are opened. Exit devices are generally horizontal attachments to doors and enable rapid egress;


• | Electronic security products and access control systems: A broad range of electrified locks, access control systems, key card and reader systems and accessories, including Internet of Things (IoT), Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), Power over Ethernet and cloud-based solutions;


• | Time, attendance and workforce productivity systems: Products and services designed to help business customers manage and monitor workforce access control parameters, attendance and employee scheduling. We offer ongoing aftermarket services in addition to design and installation offerings;

Sales and Marketing
In markets where we sell through commercial and institutional distribution channels, we employ sales professionals around the world who work with a combination of end-users, security professionals, architects, contractors, engineers and distribution partners to develop specific custom-configured solutions for our end-users’ needs. Our field sales professionals are assisted by specification writers who work with architects, engineers and consultants to help design door openings and security systems to meet end-users’ functional, aesthetic and regulatory requirements. Both groups are supported by dedicated customer care and technical sales-support specialists worldwide. We also support our sales efforts with a variety of marketing efforts, including trade-specific advertising, cooperative distributor merchandising, digital marketing and marketing at a variety of industry trade shows.
In markets in which we sell through retail and home-builder distribution channels, we have teams of sales, merchandising and marketing professionals who help drive brand and product awareness through our channel partners and to consumers. We utilize a variety of advertising and marketing strategies, including traditional consumer media, retail merchandising, digital marketing, retail promotions and builder and consumer trade shows, to support these teams. 
We also work actively with several industry bodies around the world to help promote effective and consistent safety and security standards. For example, we are members of Builders Hardware Manufacturers Association (BHMA), Security Industry Association, Smart Card Alliance, American Society of Healthcare Engineering, American Institute of Architects, Construction Specification Institute, ASSOFERMA (Italy), BHE (Germany) and UNIQ (France). 
Production and Distribution
We manufacture our products in our geographic markets around the world. We operate 34 production and assembly facilities, including 16 in Americas, 12 in EMEIA and 6 in Asia Pacific. We own 17 of these facilities and lease the others. Our strategy is to produce in the region of use, wherever appropriate, to allow us to be closer to the end-user and increase efficiency and timely product delivery. Much of our U.S. based residential portfolio is manufactured in the Baja region of Mexico under a NAFTA Maquiladora. In managing our network of production facilities, we focus on eliminating excess capacity, reducing cycle time through productivity and harmonizing production practices and safety procedures.
We distribute our products through a broad network of channel partners. In addition, third-party manufacturing and logistics providers perform certain manufacturing, storage and distribution services for us to support certain parts of our manufacturing and distribution network.
Raw Materials
We support our region-of-use production strategy with corresponding region-of-use supplier partners, where available. Our global and regional commodity teams work with production leadership, product management and materials management teams to ensure adequate materials are available for production. 
We purchase a wide range of raw materials, including steel, zinc, brass and other non-ferrous metals, to support our production facilities. Where appropriate, we may enter into fixed-cost contracts to lower overall costs. 
Intellectual Property
Intellectual property, inclusive of certain patents, trademarks, copyrights, know-how, trade secrets and other proprietary rights, is important to our business. We create, protect and enforce our intellectual property investments in a variety of ways. We work actively in the U.S. and internationally to try to ensure the protection and enforcement of our intellectual property rights. We use trademarks on nearly all of our products and believe such distinctive marks are an important factor in creating a market for our goods, in identifying us and in distinguishing our products from others. We consider our CISA, Interflex, LCN, Schlage, SimonsVoss, Von Duprin and other associated trademarks to be among our most valuable assets, and we have registered these trademarks in a number of countries. Although certain proprietary intellectual property rights are important to our success, we do not believe we are materially dependent on any particular patent or license, or any particular group of patents or licenses.
Facilities
We operate through a broad network of sales offices, engineering centers, 34 production and assembly facilities and several distribution centers throughout the world. Our active properties represent approximately 6.9 million square feet, of which approximately 37% is leased. The following table shows the location of our worldwide production and assembly facilities:

Research and Development 
We are committed to investing in highly productive research and development capabilities, particularly in electro-mechanical systems. We concentrate on developing technology innovations that will deliver growth through the introduction of new products and solutions, as well as driving continuous improvements in product cost, quality, safety and sustainability. 
We manage our R&D team as a global group, with an emphasis on a global collaborative approach, to identify and develop new technologies and worldwide product platforms. We are organized on a regional basis to leverage expertise in local standards and configurations. In addition to regional engineering centers in each geographic region, we also operate a global engineering design center in Bangalore, India. 
Seasonality 
Our business experiences seasonality that varies by product line. Because more construction and do-it-yourself projects occur during the second and third calendar quarters of each year in the Northern Hemisphere, our security product sales related to those projects are typically higher in those quarters than in the first and fourth calendar quarters. However, certain other businesses typically experience higher sales in the fourth calendar quarter due to project timing. Net revenues by quarter for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 are as follows: 

 | First Quarter | Second Quarter | Third Quarter | Fourth Quarter
2018 | 22% | 26% | 26% | 26% 
2017 | 23% | 26% | 25% | 26% 
2016 | 22% | 26% | 26% | 26% 

Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 11,000 employees.
Environmental Regulation
We have a dedicated environmental program that is designed to reduce the utilization and generation of hazardous materials during the manufacturing process as well as to remediate identified environmental concerns. As to the latter, we are currently engaged in site investigations and remediation activities to address environmental cleanup from past operations at current and former production facilities. We regularly evaluate our remediation programs and consider alternative remediation methods that are in addition to, or in replacement of, those we currently utilize based upon enhanced technology and regulatory changes. 
 11

We are sometimes a party to environmental lawsuits and claims and have received notices of potential violations of environmental laws and regulations from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the "EPA") and similar state authorities. We have also been identified as a potentially responsible party ("PRP") for cleanup costs associated with off-site waste disposal at federal Superfund and state remediation sites. For all such sites, there are other PRPs and, in most instances, our involvement is minimal.
In estimating our liability, we have assumed that we will not bear the entire cost of remediation of any site to the exclusion of other PRPs who may be jointly and severally liable. The ability of other PRPs to participate has been taken into account, based on our understanding of the parties’ financial condition and probable contributions on a per site basis. Additional lawsuits and claims involving environmental matters are likely to arise from time to time in the future.
We incurred $2.4 million, $3.2 million and $23.3 million of expenses during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, for environmental remediation at sites presently or formerly owned or leased by us. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we have recorded reserves for environmental matters of $22.6 million and $28.9 million, respectively. Of these amounts $6.3 million and $8.9 million, respectively, relate to remediation of sites previously disposed by us. Given the evolving nature of environmental laws, regulations and technology, the ultimate cost of future compliance is uncertain.
