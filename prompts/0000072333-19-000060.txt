Item 1. Business.
DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
Founded in 1901 as a retail shoe business in Seattle, Nordstrom later incorporated in Washington State in 1946 and went on to become one of the leading fashion retailers based in the U.S. We aspire to be the best fashion retailer in a digital world by remaining focused on our customers, serving them through our three strategic pillars: providing a compelling product offering, delivering outstanding services and experiences and leveraging the strength of the Nordstrom brand. We offer an extensive selection of high-quality brand-name and private label merchandise focused on apparel, shoes, cosmetics and accessories. No matter how customers choose to shop, we are committed to delivering the best possible service, product and experience, including alterations, dining and styling, to make shopping fun, personalized and convenient.
We invested early in our omni-channel capabilities, integrating our operations, merchandising and technology across our stores and online, in both our Full-Price and Off-Price businesses. Today, we have more than 60 combinations in which merchandise is ordered, fulfilled and delivered. Though this has enabled us to serve customers in multiple ways, we are focused on providing a seamless experience for our customer across stores and online. As a result of the evolution of our operations, our reportable segments have become progressively more integrated such that, in the first quarter of 2018, we changed our reportable segments to one reportable segment to align with how management views the results of our operations. For more information about our business and our reportable segments, see Item 7: Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 16: Segment Reporting in Item 8.
As of March 18, 2019, our reportable segment, Retail, includes:
Full-Price

• | 115 Nordstrom-branded full-line stores in the U.S.


• | six full-line and six Rack stores in Canada


• | Full-Price Nordstrom.com website and mobile application


• | TrunkClub.com website and six Trunk Club clubhouses


• | three Jeffrey boutiques


• | three Nordstrom Local neighborhood hubs (“Nordstrom Local”)

Our Full-Price operating segment integrates Nordstrom full-line stores and Nordstrom.com to allow us to provide our customers with a seamless shopping experience. We engage with our customers on their terms, blurring the lines between the digital and in-store experience. Our customers can pick up online orders in our Nordstrom full-line stores if inventory is available or it can be shipped to that location. Full-Price also includes our full-line and Rack stores in Canada. We include our Canada operations in Full-Price as this is how we view and manage our operations internally. Trunk Club offers personalized styling services for men and women, which enables customers to shop and try on at home, paying only for what they decide to keep. Customers may also choose to shop using these personalized styling services in-person at our clubhouses. We provide customers with the same quality merchandise available at Nordstrom full-line stores and online. Nordstrom Local is a retail concept that is focused on services, providing customers convenient access to personal stylists, alterations, online orders and more. Trunk Club stylists are able to meet customers at select full-line and Nordstrom Local locations. We also leverage the expertise of our salespeople to enable customers to receive personalized product recommendations on their mobile phones through our digital Style Board selling tool. These capabilities allow us to better serve customers across various channels and improve sales. 
Off-Price

• | 239 Off-Price Nordstrom Rack stores in the U.S.


• | Off-Price Nordstromrack.com/HauteLook website and mobile application


• | two Last Chance clearance stores

In Off-Price, Nordstrom Rack and Nordstromrack.com purchase merchandise primarily from the same vendors carried in our Full-Price channel and also serve as outlets for clearance merchandise from the Full-Price channel. Nordstromrack.com/HauteLook offers both a persistent selection of Off-Price merchandise, as well as limited-time flash sale events on fashion and lifestyle brands, and is integrated with a single customer log-in, shared shopping cart and streamlined checkout process. Nordstromrack.com combines the technology expertise of HauteLook with the merchant expertise of Nordstrom Rack. 
FISCAL YEAR
We operate on a 52/53-week fiscal year ending on the Saturday closest to January 31st. References to 2018 and all years except 2017 within this document are based on a 52-week fiscal year, while 2017 is based on a 53-week fiscal year.

RETURN POLICY
We have a fair and reasonable approach to returns, handling them on a case-by-case basis with the ultimate objective of making our customers happy. We have no formal policy on how long we accept returns at our Nordstrom full-line stores or Nordstrom.com. Our goal is to take care of our customers, which includes making returns and exchanges easy, whether in stores or online, where we offer free shipping on purchases and returns. Trunk Club accepts returns within five days of delivery, which are free for the customer if the items are returned in the box provided by Trunk Club with the original price tag and packaging. Our Nordstrom Rack stores and Nordstromrack.com/HauteLook generally accept returns of apparel, footwear, accessories and HauteLook home products up to 45 days from the date of purchase or date of shipment with the original price tag and sales receipt. Off-Price merchandise can be returned by mail or at any Nordstrom Rack store location.
SEASONALITY
Our business, like that of other retailers, is subject to seasonal fluctuations. Our sales are typically higher during our Anniversary Sale in July and the holidays in the fourth quarter. Our Anniversary Sale shifted to the second quarter in 2018 compared with the second and third quarters in 2017. Results for any one quarter are not indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year. 
LOYALTY PROGRAM
We evolved our customer loyalty program with the launch of The Nordy Club in October 2018, which incorporates a traditional point system and the favorite benefits of our previous program, while providing customers exclusive access to products and events, enhanced services, personalized experiences and more convenient ways to shop. Customers accumulate points based on their level of spending and type of participation. Upon reaching certain point thresholds, customers receive Nordstrom Notes (“Notes”), which can be redeemed for goods or services offered at Nordstrom full-line stores, Nordstrom.com, Nordstrom Rack and Nordstromrack.com/HauteLook. Nordstrom cardmembers can also earn rewards at Trunk Club. The Nordy Club member benefits will vary based on the level of customer spend, and include Bonus Points days and shopping and fashion events.
We offer customers access to a variety of payment products and services, including a selection of Nordstrom-branded Visa® credit cards in the U.S. and Canada, as well as a Nordstrom-branded private label credit card for Nordstrom purchases. When customers use a Nordstrom-branded credit or debit card, they also participate in The Nordy Club and receive additional benefits, which can vary depending on the level of spend, including early access to the Anniversary Sale, Nordstrom to You (an in-home stylist) and incremental accumulation of points toward Notes. See Note 3: Credit Card Receivable Transaction in Item 8.
COMPETITIVE CONDITIONS
We operate in a highly competitive business environment. We compete with other international, national, regional and local retailers, including internet-based businesses, omni-channel department stores, specialty stores, off-price stores and boutiques, which may carry similar lines of merchandise. Our specific competitors vary from market to market. We believe the keys to competing in our industry are what will always matter most to our customers: providing compelling product and outstanding service backed by people who care, both digitally and in stores. This includes serving customers on their terms, by providing a seamless digital and physical experience, offering compelling, curated and quality products at multiple price points, and strategically partnering with relevant and limited distribution brands, all in top markets.
SUPPLY CHAIN NETWORK
Our “Supply Chain Network” consists of: 

• | fulfillment centers that process and ship orders to our customers, located in Cedar Rapids, Iowa; Elizabethtown, Pennsylvania; and San Bernardino, California,


• | distribution centers that process and ship merchandise to our stores and other facilities and


• | future Omni-channel centers that both fulfill customer orders and ship merchandise to our stores. These will open in 2019 and include large-scale centers and smaller local hubs (Local Omni-channel Hub).

We have expanded our Supply Chain Network facilities and enhanced our inventory management systems to support our omni-channel capabilities and provide greater access to merchandise selection and faster delivery. We select locations and customize inventory allocations to enable merchandise to flow more efficiently and quickly to our customers. 
Full-Price online purchases are primarily shipped to our customers from our Fulfillment Centers but may also be shipped from our Nordstrom full-line stores or Omni-channel centers. Full-Price in-store purchases are primarily fulfilled from that store’s inventory, but when inventory is unavailable at that store, it may also be shipped to our customers from our Fulfillment Centers, Omni-channel centers, or from other Nordstrom full-line stores. Off-Price online purchases are shipped to our customers from our Fulfillment Centers. Both channels selectively use vendor dropship to supplement their online offerings, which are then shipped directly from the vendor to the end customer.
Nordstrom, Inc. and subsidiaries  7

Our first large-scale Omni-channel center in Riverside, California will open in late 2019 and will initially support our Full-Price customers in the West Coast region. Off-Price inventory and fulfillment will be added to this facility in the future. We also plan to open a smaller Local Omni-channel Hub in Torrance, California in 2019, which will support the greater Los Angeles market as part of our new local market strategy and will have highly customized inventory that serves the specialized needs of that market. 
INVENTORY
We plan our merchandise purchases and receipts to coincide with expected sales trends. For instance, our merchandise purchases and receipts increase prior to our Anniversary Sale, which has historically extended over the last two weeks of July. We also purchase and receive a larger amount of merchandise in the fall as we prepare for the holiday shopping season (from late November through December). At Nordstrom Rack, we also invest in pack and hold inventory, which involves the strategic purchase of merchandise from some of our top Full-Price brands in advance of the upcoming selling seasons, to take advantage of favorable buying opportunities. This inventory is typically held for six months on average. 
In order to offer merchandise that our customers want, we purchase from a wide variety of high-quality domestic and foreign suppliers. We also have arrangements with agents and contract manufacturers to produce our private label merchandise. We expect our suppliers to meet our “Nordstrom Partnership Guidelines,” which address our corporate social responsibility standards for matters such as legal and regulatory compliance, labor, health and safety and the environment. This is available on our website at Nordstrom.com.
EMPLOYEES
During 2018, we employed approximately 71,000 employees on a full- or part-time basis. Due to the seasonal nature of our business, employment increased to approximately 76,000 employees in July 2018 and 74,000 in December 2018. All of our employees are non-union. We believe our relationship with our employees is good.
