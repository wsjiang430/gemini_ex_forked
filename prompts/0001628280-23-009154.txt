Seasonality
The retail business is seasonal in nature with a high proportion of sales and operating income generated in the months of November and December. Working capital requirements fluctuate during the year, increasing in mid-summer in anticipation of the fall merchandising season and increasing substantially prior to the months of November and December when the Company carries significantly higher inventory levels.
Purchasing
The Company purchases merchandise from many suppliers, none of which accounted for more than 5% of the Company's purchases during 2022. The Company has no material long-term purchase commitments with any of its suppliers and believes that it is not dependent on any one supplier. The Company considers its relations with its suppliers to be good.
Private Label Brands and Related Trademarks
The principal private label brands currently offered by the Company include Alfani, And Now This, Aqua, Bar III, Belgique, Charter Club, Club Room, Epic Threads, Family PJ’s, first impressions, Giani Bernini, Holiday Lane, Home Design, Hotel Collection, Hudson Park, Ideology, I-N-C, jenni, JM Collection, Karen Scott, lune+aster, M-61, Maison Jules, Martha Stewart Collection, Oake, Sky, Style & Co., Sun + Stone, Sutton Studio, Tasso Elba, The Cellar, Tools of the Trade and Wild Pair.

The agreement for the Martha Stewart Collection ended on January 31, 2023 and the Company will sell through remaining inventory during 2023.
Competition
The retail industry is highly competitive. The Company’s operations compete with many retail formats on the national and local level, including department stores, specialty stores, general merchandise stores, manufacturers' outlets and websites, off-price and discount stores, online retailers and catalogs, among others. The Company seeks to attract customers by offering compelling, high-quality products, great prices and trusted service across all channels, including its digital platforms. Other retailers may compete for customers on some or all of these bases, or on other bases, and may be perceived by some potential customers as being better aligned with their particular preferences.

Human Capital Resources 
Culture & Engagement 
At Macy's Inc., we strive to be the preferred employer across our brands through an unwavering passion and commitment to our customers, communities and employees (called colleagues). The Company's workplace is rooted in equity and guided by its social purpose, called Mission Every One, to create a brighter future with bold representation for all. 
The Company gathers colleague feedback at key times throughout the colleague lifecycle from onboarding to offboarding and provides regular venues for colleagues to ask questions and share their opinions, such as Ask Me Anything sessions, town halls and colleague resource groups. The Company formally solicits feedback from all colleagues twice a year through company-wide Culture Pulse Survey. The results are shared across the organization to provide visibility to both managers (called people leaders) and colleagues, to help create opportunities for open and constructive discussions among teams and to facilitate action planning to improve the colleague experience. 
Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (DE&I) 
The Company's commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion is guided by its values and starts from within by working to build a workforce that represents the customers and communities it serves at all levels and making structural changes to implement practices and processes designed to be equitable and cultivate a culture of belonging. The Company seeks to empower colleagues to harness and unleash the power of their individuality to help drive better business decisions for customers and shareholders. 
In 2019, the Company launched its MOSAIC program to advance the diversity of its leadership. The MOSAIC program is a one-year professional development program for colleagues at the manager and director levels who self-identify as ethnically diverse, with continued support available as participants progress through their careers. Approximately 68% of program participants were promoted or moved into a new role since the program was launched. We have made significant progress towards our aspiration to increase ethnically diverse representation at the director level and above by 2025.
The Company believes people leaders play an important role in driving performance and an inclusive culture. In 2020, the Company incorporated People Leader Commitments (which were launched in 2019) and DE&I into the performance review process. In 2021, the Company included standardized DE&I goals into annual reviews at the director level and above. In 2022, the Company included a diversity goal as part of its annual incentive program. To increase data accuracy and better understand the diverse dimensions of our colleagues, the Company plans to build the framework to capture DE&I-related dimensions beyond what is self-identified at the time of hire to advance the Company's benefits offering and colleague engagement efforts.
Company-sponsored, employee-led resource groups (ERGs) provide an opportunity for colleagues to experience connection, achieve belonging and develop leadership skills. In 2022, ERGs continued to expand beyond our corporate offices to an additional 198 Store ERG chapters across the country to further reinforce community building. In 2023, the Company plans to rebrand ERGs to Colleague Resource Groups (CRGs) and continue to strengthen the model through greater executive sponsorship, tools and community visibility. By the end of 2023, we expect that all Macy's and Bloomingdale's colleagues in both corporate offices and stores will have the opportunity to join a CRG chapter.
The Company has achieved a score of 100 every year since 2015 on the Human Rights Campaign Foundation’s Corporate Equality Index, earning the designation as “Best Place to Work for LGBTQ+ Equality.” This index is the nation’s foremost benchmarking survey and report measuring corporate policies and practices related to LGBTQ+ workplace equality. For the past two years, the Company was recognized by the NBIC, a coalition of the nation’s leading business organizations representing diverse communities, as one of the Top 50 Best-of-the-Best Corporations for Inclusion and Women's Enterprise National Council with America's Top Corporations Award for the commitment to create a brighter future for women-owned businesses.
The Company's DE&I focus areas extend beyond its colleagues and include community, customers, marketing and suppliers. Below are a few additional highlights from the past year:
•Hosted first Vendor Pitch Competition and awarded over $250,000 in business grants to graduates of The Workshop at Macy’s 2022 program.
•Launched S.P.U.R. Pathways: Shared Purpose, Unlimited Reach to help businesses gain access to capital to accelerate growth and create new jobs in historically underserved and underfunded communities.
•Expanded our portfolio of diverse suppliers, adding over 175 new diverse-owned businesses online and in-store. Increased number of Black-owned brands by 8 times since signing the Fifteen Percent Pledge in 2020. 
•Launched DE&I simulation-based training across the Company, which established new benchmarks and insights to inform future programming and people leader development efforts.
•Donated $1M to advance social justice and racial equity causes; additionally, $1M was donated to various Divine Nine Sorority education and research foundations, in honor of the first-of-its-kind Divine Nine Sorority Collection.
•Leveraged best in class partners, such as JOY Collective and Publicis Once & For All Coalition, to advance the cultural fluency of our marketing and media.
Learning & Development
Macy’s, Inc. believes that learning goes hand in hand with career growth, personal satisfaction and outstanding results. The Company aspires to create a learning culture where colleagues can build their skills, apply their learning to address business challenges and share their knowledge, including their mistakes, to help others grow. Learning is accessible through Ignite (powered by Degreed), the Company’s self-directed learning experience platform as well as through technology, social learning and meaningful experiences and exposures with colleagues. We have also partnered with Guild Education to provide eligible colleagues with a fully-funded education benefit, including more than 100 programs that range from foundational learning–such as high school completion and English language–to college degrees. 
The Company makes investments in its people leaders and future leaders. Macy’s Executive Development Program and Bloomingdale’s Leadership Development Program offer immersive, hands-on learning experiences for recent college graduates from top universities across the U.S. to jump-start a career in retail, with specialization in technology, digital, stores, merchandising, and supply chain. Macy’s and Bloomingdale’s offer internships for college students and Bloomingdale’s offers an early immersion program focused on providing experiential learning and career exposure to those who identify with underrepresented groups. Bluemercury’s Shooting Stars is a six-month mentorship program that empowers mentees to own their journey by creating a development plan, becoming an inclusive leader and leveraging resources to support their career aspirations. In 2022, the Company launched a multi-year career development initiative. This incentive included the launch of a Career Hub on the Company intranet to offer user-friendly tools to assist colleagues at any part of their career journey; a two-week virtual Career Expo that featured 18 workshops, panel discussions, external speakers and functional showcases to give colleagues a better sense of career opportunities across the Company; and people leader support with learning plans focused on career coaching and development.
People leaders participate annually in required leadership development training and have access to robust on-demand development resources. Professional colleagues participate in a 90-day onboarding experience with performance milestones, support resources and role-specific training
Total Rewards

Eligible colleagues have varied medical plan options to meet individual needs. The Company provides paid time-off, parental leave and holiday pay, as well as a company 401(k) plan and match, dependent care flexible spending account and a colleague merchandise discount for eligible colleagues.
The Company believes that pay equity is fundamental to its culture and DE&I strategy. Compensation is based on job, responsibilities, experience and performance with incentive opportunities that allow colleagues to share in the Company’s success. 
In 2022, the Company began sharing more pay information with our colleagues and educate our colleagues about our pay programs. All colleagues nationwide have access to view their job’s pay zone and salary range. Additionally, all job postings nationwide include the job’s salary range. People leaders and salaried colleagues were given the opportunity to attend Compensation Education Webinars to learn how pay is determined, and deep dive into our incentive programs. The Company also enhanced strategic investments in colleagues, providing free education and increasing the minimum wage to $15 per hour. 
Number of Employees
