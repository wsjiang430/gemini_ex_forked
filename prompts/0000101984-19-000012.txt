and technology into their products to enhance their consumer lifestyle ecosystems. Growth in these markets has been driven by the increasing demand for more energy efficient homes and the increasing proliferation of connected smart devices.
In 2015, we acquired Ecolink Intelligent Technology, Inc. ("Ecolink"), a leading developer of safety and security products. Ecolink provides a wide range of intelligent wireless security and automation components dedicated to redefining the home security experience. Ecolink has over 20 years of wireless engineering expertise in the home security and automation market and currently holds more than 50 related pending and issued patents. UEI’s current subscription broadcasting customers are adding home security and automation to their list of service offerings. Our acquisition of Ecolink, a premise equipment supplier to this market, enables us to broaden our design expertise and product portfolio to add home security and automation sensors to our capabilities.
On April 6, 2017, we acquired Residential Control Systems, Inc. ("RCS"), a U.S.-based designer and manufacturer of energy management and control products for the residential, small commercial and hospitality markets. The acquisition of RCS allows us to expand our product offering to include smart thermostat, sensing and monitoring products and enables us to broaden our technology and design expertise in these product categories. Smart and connected thermostats are critical components of the smart home that help deliver energy-efficiency and an enhanced consumer lifestyle.
For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, our sales to Comcast accounted for 17.6%, 23.0%, and 22.9% of our net sales, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 our sales to AT&T (formerly DIRECTV) and its sub-contractors collectively accounted for 11.2%, and 11.5% of our net sales, respectively.
Our One For All® brand name of remote controls and audio video accessories sold within the international retail markets accounted for 7.4%, 7.1%, and 7.2% of our total net sales for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.
Intellectual Property and Technology
We hold a number of patents in the United States and abroad related to our products and technology, and have filed domestic and foreign applications for other patents that are pending. At the end of 2018, we had approximately 500 issued and pending United States patents related to remote control, home security, safety and automation as well as hundreds of foreign counterpart patents and applications in various territories around the world.
Our patents have remaining lives ranging from one to 18 years. We have also obtained copyright registration and claim copyright protection for certain proprietary software and libraries of our device control codes. Additionally, the names of many of our products are registered, or are being registered, as trademarks in the United States Patent and Trademark Office and in most of the other countries in which such products are sold. These registrations are valid for terms ranging up to 20 years and may be renewed as long as the trademarks continue to be used and are deemed by management to be important to our operations. While we follow the practice of obtaining patent, copyright and trademark registrations on new developments whenever advisable, in certain cases we have elected common law trade secret protection in lieu of obtaining such other protection.
A key factor in creating products and software for control of entertainment devices is the device control code database. Since our beginning in 1986, we have compiled an extensive device control code database that covers over one million individual device functions and approximately 8,600 individual consumer electronic equipment brand names, including virtually all IR controlled set-top boxes, televisions, audio components, digital video players, such as, Blu-Ray/-DVD and streaming media players such as Roku® and AppleTV®. Our technology also includes other remote controlled home entertainment devices and home automation control modules, as well as wired Consumer Electronics Control ("CEC") and wireless Internet Protocol ("IP") control protocols commonly found on many of the latest HDMI and internet connected devices. Our proprietary software automatically detects, identifies and enables the appropriate control commands for any given home entertainment, automation and air conditioning device in the home. Our libraries are continuously updated with device control codes used in newly introduced AV and IoT devices. These control codes are captured directly from original remote control devices or from the manufacturer's written specifications to ensure the accuracy and integrity of the database. Our proprietary software and know-how permit us to offer a device control code database that is more robust and efficient than similarly priced products of our competitors.
Our goal is to provide universal control solutions that require minimal or no user set-up and deliver consistent and intuitive one-touch control of all connected content sources and devices. QuickSet® is a software application that is currently embedded or enabled, via a Cloud service, in over 500 million devices worldwide. QuickSet may be embedded in an AV device, set-top box, or other host device, or delivered as a Cloud-based service to enable universal remote setup and control. QuickSet enables universal device control set-up using automated and guided on-screen instructions and a wireless two-way communication link between the remote and the QuickSet enabled device. The two-way connection allows device control code data and configuration settings to be sent to the remote control from the device and greatly simplifies the universal control set-up process and can enable other time saving features. QuickSet utilizes data transmitted over HDMI or IP networks to automatically detect various attributes of the connected device and downloads the appropriate control codes and functions into the remote control without the need for the user to enter any additional information. The user does not need to know the brand or model number to set up the device in the remote.

Any compatible new device that is connected is recognized. Consumers can quickly and easily set up their control interface to control multiple devices. Recently added features in QuickSet address common consumer challenges in universal device control, such as mode confusion and input switching. With QuickSet, consumers switch easily between activities and reliably view their chosen content source with a single touch. QuickSet handles the device-specific control. A QuickSet user experience can be delivered via a tactile remote, touchscreen interface, on-screen graphical user interface ("GUI") or voice-enabled system. Licensees of QuickSet include service providers such as Comcast, AT&T and Echostar Technologies; smart TV manufacturers such as Sony and Samsung; leading game console manufacturer Microsoft on its Xbox One game system; and several Chinese mobile handset platforms.
QuickSet Cloud is an end-to-end platform for discovery, control, and interaction with devices including rules and automation framework for a truly connected home experience. Leveraging the largest knowledge graph of devices, services are offered through QuickSet Cloud and QuickSet SDK delivery methods with edge intelligence built in and cloud scalability capabilities.
Smart devices are becoming a more prevalent part of the home entertainment experience, and UEI offers several solutions to enable entertainment device control with a smart phone, tablet or smart TV. In its smart device control solutions, UEI offers all of the elements needed for device control ranging from IR and RF controller chips to device control libraries to graphical and voice user interfaces, as well as artificial intelligence systems that deliver context aware device interactions. Designed for Android, Nevo® Home is UEI's device and service discovery and control application, currently available for download at Google Play.
In 2018, UEI introduced Nevo.AI, a digital assistant for the connected home with a natural language interface to allow interaction with devices within the home using QuickSet's underlying capabilities. Features are expandable through Enterprise Integration and Ecosystem of Partner Services.
In 2019, we will introduce Nevo® Butler, a turnkey smart home hub with Nevo.AI & QuickSet pre-integrated. Offered as managed hardware with security built in from manufacturing through the life cycle, it is capable of natively running Nevo Assistant, as well as other digital assistants.
Methods of Distribution
Distribution methods for our control solutions vary depending on the sales channel. We distribute remote control devices, sensors, connected thermostats and AV accessories directly to subscription broadcasters and OEMs, both domestically and internationally. We also distribute home security sensors to pro-security installers in the United States through a network of dealers. Additionally, we sell our wireless control devices and AV accessories under the One For All® and private label brand names to retailers through our international subsidiaries and direct to retailers in key markets, such as in the United Kingdom, Germany and the United States. We utilize third-party distributors for the retail channel in countries where we do not have subsidiaries.
We have developed a broad portfolio of patented technologies and the industry's leading database of device setup and control software. We ship integrated circuits, on which our software and control code database are embedded, directly to manufacturers for inclusion in their products. In addition, we license our software and technology to manufacturers. Licenses are delivered upon the transfer of a product master or on a per unit basis when the software or technology is used in a customer device.
We provide domestic and international consumer support to our various universal control marketers, including manufacturers, cable and satellite providers, retail distributors, and audio and video OEMs through our live and automated call centers. We also make available a web-based support resource, www.urcsupport.com, designed specifically for subscription broadcasters. This solution offers videos and online tools to help users easily set up their universal remote controls, and as a result reduce call volume at customer support centers. Additionally, the UEI Technical Support Services call center provides customer interaction management services from technical service and support to customer retention. Services include pre-repair calls, post-install surveys, and inbound calls for cable customers to provide greater bottom-line efficiencies.

Raw Materials and Dependence on Suppliers
We utilize our own manufacturing plants and third-party manufacturers and suppliers primarily located within the PRC, Mexico and Brazil to produce our control and sensor products. In 2017 and 2016, Texas Instruments provided 10.0% and 11.7%, respectively, of our total inventory purchases. In 2018, no single supplier provided more than 10% of our total inventory purchases. 
Even though we operate two factories in the PRC and manufacturing and assembly plants in Brazil and Mexico, we continue to evaluate additional contract manufacturers and sources of supply. During 2018, we utilized multiple contract manufacturers and maintained duplicate tooling for certain of our products. Where possible we utilize standard parts and components, which are available from multiple sources. 
In 2018, to avoid the U.S. government-imposed tariffs on products made in China and imported into the United States, we began to move production of many of our products destined for the United States to Mexico and a third-party manufacturing partner outside of China. We expect this transition to continue during the first half of 2019.
We continually seek additional sources to reduce our dependence on our integrated circuit suppliers. To further manage our integrated and system on a chip ("SOC") circuit supplier dependence, we include flash microcontroller technology in most of our products. Flash microcontrollers can have shorter lead times than standard microcontrollers and may be reprogrammed, if necessary. This allows us flexibility during any unforeseen shipping delays and has the added benefit of potentially reducing excess and obsolete inventory exposure. This diversification lessens our dependence on any one supplier and allows us to negotiate more favorable terms.
Seasonality
Historically, our business has been influenced by the retail sales cycle, with increased sales in the second half of the year. We expect this pattern to be repeated during 2019.
