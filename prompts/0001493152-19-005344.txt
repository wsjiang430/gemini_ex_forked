Overview
 
We, through our indirectly wholly owned subsidiary, AiXinZhonghong, market and sell innovative, premium-quality nutritional products in Chengdu, China. The products we market and sell are manufactured by unaffiliated parties. The number of products we offer varies over time. At the beginning of each calendar year, we evaluate the sale performance and market demand of each product offered during the preceding year, and decide whether to continue to offer that product in the current year. During 2018 we offered eleven products, including cell food, goat milk power, clear lung Kangbao, light tea, bear gall powders, and other nutritional supplements. We offer these products directly to our clients at events we organize and sponsor, at which, on occasion, representatives of the manufacturer promote the products and discuss the benefits derived from using them. We also rely on client recommendations to market and sell products and offer discounts to clients who purchase significant quantities of products for the purpose of marketing and selling the products to their friends, family members and others. We also offer clients who purchase significant quantities of products paid vacations, travel and other benefits. The products can be purchased at the events held by us, as well as any of the 14 sales offices we maintain in Chengdu.
 
Before promoting a product, we research it and its manufacturer to determine the manufacturer’s reputation as to whether it delivers unadulterated products, and whether there is a basis for claiming the product can deliver the benefits claimed. As part of this effort, a group of our employees use the products and provide feedback based upon their personal experiences. We base our evaluation of products on the assessments received from our employees. We also review and to the extent feasible confirm information and reports received from the manufacturer and distributor. We do not rely upon any other third-party reports.
 
We do not independently test products to determine efficacy. Rather we rely upon information we uncover through inquiries in the community and a review of scientific and other literature. Once we determine to offer a product and believe it will be purchased by our clients, we will purchase a bulk quantity, enabling us to acquire products at prices below those which are available to smaller distributors.
 
We offer our clients personalized services, including educating them through seminars on the benefits of the products we distribute, maintaining sales offices at which our clients can engage in recreational and social activities where the products we offer are prominently displayed and can be picked up, conducting promotions with representatives of the manufacturers of the products, and encouraging customer loyalty with incentives such as rewards and discounts based upon the quantities of products purchased for individual use or sold to others. We believe our marketing strategy which emphasizes ongoing personal contact and support, coaching and educating our clients as to the benefits of the products we distribute is ideally suited for selling nutritional products and builds confidence in and customer loyalty to our company and the products we sell. We believe this is particularly the case in China where the middle class is growing in size yet, due to lax enforcement and limited laws and regulations, many manufacturers and distributors, particularly those of new and innovative products, are not trusted by consumers. Thus, although our focus is our clients, the manufacturers we work with get the benefit of the trust our clients have placed in us. Consequently, although certain of the products we distribute are produced by a variety of manufacturers, we require the manufacturer or distributor from which we purchase a product to provide us with exclusive distribution rights for an agreed upon time period within a prescribed territory or package the product so that while we are offering a product, it is distinct from products sold to our competitors.
 
In addition to our ongoing operations, we are seeking to acquire an interest in additional business through opportunities located by our management or presented by persons or firms which desire to take advantage of the perceived advantages of an Exchange Act registered corporation. We are not restricting our search to any specific business, industry, or geographical location and may participate in a business venture of virtually any kind or nature.  We are not currently engaged in negotiations regarding the acquisition of any business.

Products We Offer
 
We offer a variety of nutritional products, which change over time. In 2017 we offered 26 products and in 2018 we offered 11 products. Our most popular products during 2018 were cell food, goat milk power, clear lung Kangbao, light tea, bear gall powders and mattresses,
 
We source and purchase all our products through third party distributors and manufacturers which we carefully research before determining to distribute a product.
 
Marketing and Sales Strategy
 
We market and sell the products we offer directly to our clients, primarily utilizing person-to-person marketing to promote and sell our products. These personal marketing efforts are supported by various mediums, including our marketing content, educational events, open facilities and social business solutions. We believe our marketing strategy is effective because:

● | we educate consumers about products face-to-face, which we believe is more effective for differentiating our products than using traditional mass-media advertising, particularly when introducing a new product to an older unsophisticated group of consumers in an environment where it is difficult to obtain accurate, reliable product information; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | it provides for actual product demonstrations and trial by potential consumers; 
● | it allows us to provide personal testimonials of product efficacy; and 
● | as compared to other marketing methods, we have the opportunity to provide consumers higher levels of service and encourage repeat purchases. 

 
We market the products we offer to two types of clients: individuals who buy our products directly from us primarily for personal or family consumption; and individuals who personally buy, use and distribute our products to new clients.
 
We offer those clients who purchase for their own personal use high-quality, innovative products that provide demonstrable benefits. We attempt to obtain detailed personal information about each of our clients so that we can direct each of them to products that best suit their needs and begin to distribute new products that will appeal to our clients. We track the purchases made by every individual who purchases products directly from us. Based upon their purchasing history, we believe a significant majority of our clients purchase the products we sell primarily for personal or family consumption and are not actively pursuing the opportunity we offer to generate income by marketing and reselling products.

Our strategy for increasing the number of clients interested in selling the products we offer to others and for developing new clients who demonstrate the ability to sell our products to others, is to provide them with compensation, in the form of quantity purchase discounts and other incentives, such as free meals, travel or vacations. We track the amount of products purchased and frequency of purchases by those clients who sell our products to others and reward them when we think it is appropriate
 
We offer our clients a customer satisfaction guarantee. Our sales policy allows for the return of unopened products for cash after deducting certain service and transaction fees. As alternatives for the product return option, the customers have options of asking an exchange of the products with same value.
 
Because of restrictions on direct selling and multi-level market in Mainland China, we structured our business model to avoid being placed in either category based on the guidance we received from government officials, our interpretation of applicable regulations, our understanding of the practices of international direct selling companies operating in Mainland China, and our understanding as to how regulators are interpreting and enforcing the regulations.
 
Competition
 
Products
 
The category of nutritional products is very competitive and there are various channels through which such products are marketed to consumers, including direct selling, through the internet, in specialty retailers and the discounted channels of food, drug and mass merchandise. AixinZhonghong seeks to differentiate itself from this group by being familiar with its clients and providing a personalized sales experience, and focusing on after-sale services where sales employees focus on the consultative sales process through product education and the frequent contact and support that many sales employees have with the clients. From a competitive standpoint, there are many providers and sales outlets of nutritional products in China. We believe that none have effectively combined the product, personal coaching, education and the product access provided by our sales employees and, further, that these efforts are compounded by the peer pressure our clients generate through our organized group sales presentations.
Our Competitive Advantages / Strengths
 
Client Base
 
We have clients who primarily join for a discount on products they consume and introductions to new products they might desire, along with clients who also choose to profit by reselling our products. We currently have slightly in excess of 2,800 preferred clients, who purchase products for personal and family use, and 600 client distributors, who purchase products for their own use and for distribution to others. In addition, we have over 10,000 “potential” clients,i.e., individuals who attended a marketing event or made two purchases within the past two months.
 
When customers purchase the products we offer, information such as the customer’s name and the products purchased, is entered into our computer system, enabling us to develop a profile of more active customers. We do not initially identify a new customer as a preferred client or client distributor, but monitor each member’s purchase patterns over time in order to match products to their desires and, eventually, categorize them as a preferred customer or distributor.
 
We do not pay salaries or commissions to client distributors. It is our practice to offer client distributors discounts on quantity purchases and to reward them through incentives, such as free meals, travel or vacations.,

People become our clients for a number of reasons. Many first start out as consumers looking to improve their health through better nutrition and join simply to receive a better price on products they and their families consume and enjoy, while others join so they can resell our products and generate income.
 
Competitive Advantages
 

- | We study the attributes of new products which become available and after researching the benefits which they claim to offer we organize a group of professionals to experience and evaluate the products. Only after we determine that a product is safe, manufactured in conformance with appropriate standards, and has a basis for the claims made, do we recommend a product to our clients. This process ensures our clients get safe, quality products that suit their personal needs and upon which they can rely. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- | Our clients vary greatly in age, background, health and physical condition. We organize activities and events so that we might learn each client’s family background, physical condition and personal health needs, and categorize them into different groups for different products. For example: “cardiovascular and cerebrovascular group”, “bones and joints”, and “heart health.” 
- | We also focus on after-sale services. Due to the large number of clients that are in the middle-to-older aged groups, we have the ability to have products delivered to our clients’ homes by sales personal who can explain the product and demonstrate its use. Our sales personnel are available on a 24 hour basis for questions from clients. Once a client purchases a product, our in-house health advisors will contact him or her to give appropriate professional advice and consultation both over the phone, of face-to-face if needed. 

Our Strategies
 

- | On-site Publicity. We have rooms available at our 14 sales offices throughout Chengdu at which our clients can gather to play cards, enjoy afternoon teas, and engage in other activities. The products we distribute are displayed at each of these sites along with appropriate literature and can be purchased by clients and visitors. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | Marketing Events. We periodically host small and large-scale marketing events for up to approximately 1000 participants. These events are held at our premises or at restaurants and during travel. At each event products are demonstrated and our personnel explain the benefits of the products and, if available, representatives of the manufacturer or distributor are on hand to respond to questions or make a presentation. We use holidays, such as “National Day,” “New Year Day,” and “Mid-Autumn Day” as an opportunity to host large-scale themed activities or events appropriate for the season. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- | One-on-one marketing. Sales people will explain and market products to clients one-on-one at our facilities, during marketing events or at a client’s home or office, which gives a personal touch and more detailed explanation of products. 

Seasonality
 
In general, there is no seasonality in the sales of nutrition products.
 
Regulation
 
General
 
The distribution of nutritional products is subject to many laws, governmental regulations, administrative determinations and guidance and similar constraints. Such laws, regulations and other constraints exist at the national, provincial and or local levels, including regulations pertaining to: (1) the formulation, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, distribution, importation, sale and storage of products; (2) product claims and advertising, including direct claims and advertising by us, as well as claims and advertising by manufacturers and distributors of the products we offer, for which we may be held responsible; and (3) taxes. As a distributor, we are subject to only a portion of these laws and regulations. We believe that we are fully compliant with those applicable to our activities.

Products
 
Prior to commencing manufacture or distribution of a product, the manufacturer or distributor may be required to obtain an approval, license or certification from the national, provincial or local government in China. Although we attempt to determine whether all regulatory requirements have been met, we cannot monitor the manufacture of products and cannot be certain that all applicable regulations are satisfied. Moreover, even if we were to determine that a manufacturer or distributor had the requisite license or certification at the beginning of a relationship, we might not become aware if it were to forfeit any regulatory approvals or fail to adhere to applicable requirements.
Regulation of Nutritional Products.
 
Dietary supplements are subject to regulation by the China Food and Drug Administration. Mainland China has highly restrictive nutritional supplement product regulations. Products marketed as “health foods” are subject to extensive laboratory and clinical analysis by government authorities, and the product registration process in Mainland China generally takes one to two years, but may be substantially longer. We market both “health foods” and “general foods” in Mainland China. As a secondary distributor, we are not in a position to obtain any required license, though we may be held liable if we were to distribute a product which had not been properly tested and registered with the authorities. There is some risk associated with the common practice in Mainland China of marketing a product as a “general food” while seeking “health food” classification. If government officials feel the categorization of a product distributed by us is inconsistent with product claims, ingredients or function, this could end or limit our ability to market such products.
 
As the middle class has grown, the number of manufacturers and distributors of nutritional supplements in China has dramatically increased. Many of these enterprises have often ignored applicable laws and distributed adulterated or inferior products. We believe this has created a marketing opportunity which we have tried to exploit as a trusted source of products on which our clients can rely. To the extent our reputation results from reviewing and testing products prior to distributing them, and then distributing only products determined to be safe, it is incumbent upon us to ensure that the manufacturers and distributors upon which we rely are trustworthy. A failure by any of these third parties could cause substantial damage to our reputation, business and financial results.
 
Direct Selling and Multi-Level Marketing Regulations
 
Direct selling and multi-level marketing are two forms of marketing regulated by various national, provincial and local government agencies in China. These laws and regulations are generally intended to prevent fraudulent or deceptive schemes, including “pyramid” schemes, which compensate participants primarily for recruiting additional participants without significant emphasis on product sales to consumers.
 
Under PRC regulations, “direct selling” refers to a type of business mode in which a company recruits door-to-door salesmen to sell products directly to ultimate consumers outside the companies’ fixed places of business. Businesses engaged in “direct selling” are required to obtain a license from the PRC government. A direct selling company is required to provide vocational training for, and conduct an examination of, any sales promoter it recruits, and obtain a certificate for each sales promoter after the sales promoter has passed the examination. A direct selling company is also required, when commencing operations, to deposit RMB 20 million ($2.9 million) in a special account with a designated bank, which deposit is adjusted on a monthly basis to equal 15% of the operator’s sales from direct selling products up to RMB 0.1 billion ($14.5 million).
 
We do not engage in direct selling activities subject to regulations prevalent in China since we do not employee sales personnel engaged in door-to-door sales outside our place of business.
 
Under PRC regulations, “multi-level marketing” refers to marketing, promotional and sales activities whereby organizers or operators take in new members and compensate each member based upon the number of new members introduced by such member, directly or indirectly, or based upon the level of sales generated by the members introduced by such member. The regulations also prohibit an organizer from requiring new members to deposit a sum of money as a condition to membership, or requiring that members recruit additional members to establish a multi-level relationship. PRC regulations distinguish direct selling from multi-level marketing in that all direct sellers are normally trained by the direct selling company and any direct seller is not allowed to develop new followers or form multiple levels.

We are not in the direct selling category or multi-level marketing category since (i) we do not pay salaries or commissions to our member distributors, who decide as a matter of personal preference whether to introduce our products to relatives or friends based on their own personal experience of usage and/or trust of our company’s products; (ii) we do not require individuals to deposit a sum of money to become a member; and (iii) we do not pay members to recruit individuals to join in or to form a multi-level relationship.
 
Nevertheless, the laws and regulations governing direct selling and multi-level marketing may be modified or reinterpreted from time to time, which may cause us to change our business model. Regulations are subject to discretionary interpretation by regulators and governmental authorities. There is often ambiguity and uncertainty with respect to the implication of direct selling and anti-pyramiding laws and regulations.
 
Employees
 
As of April 3, 2019, we had approximately 60 full-time employees, of which approximately 26 were in management and administration, 32 were sales and service personnel and 2 were in public relations and sales support.
Corporate History
 
We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Colorado on December 30, 1987 under the name Mercari Communications Group, Ltd. (“Mercari”). From 1988 until early in 1990, we provided educational products, counseling, seminar programs, and publications such as newsletters to adults aged 30 to 50. We registered our common stock with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) under the Exchange Act in 1988. Our business failed in 1990 and we conducted no operating activities from June 1, 1990 to August 31, 2001.
 
In 2001, we were reactivated and filed all delinquent documents with the Colorado Secretary of State and federal and state tax authorities. Since 2002, we have filed all reports required under the Exchange Act and are now current in our reporting obligations under the Exchange Act.
 
On November 9, 2009, we entered into a stock purchase agreement with Algodon Wines & Luxury Development Group, Inc. or “Algodon” (formerly Diversified Private Equity Corporation or “DPEC”), a then privately-held Delaware corporation, and Kanouff, LLC (“KLLC”) and Underwood Family Partners, Ltd. (the “Partnership”). KLLC and the Partnership were the then holders of a majority of our outstanding common stock. Pursuant to the stock purchase agreement, Algodon purchased and the Company sold, 43,822,001 shares of common stock for $43,822, or $0.001 per share. In addition, Algodon purchased 200 shares of our common stock from KLLC and 200 shares of our common stock from the Partnership for $180,000 payable to each selling shareholder. Immediately following the closing of the transactions contemplated by the foregoing stock purchase agreement, Algodon owned 43,822,401 shares of our common stock, or 96.5% of our outstanding shares.
 
During each of the years from 2002 to 2016 we had no revenue and had losses approximately equal to the expenditures required to reactivate and comply with filing and reporting obligations. Expenditures were paid by Mercari from capital contributions and loans made by our principal stockholders and their affiliates.
 
In October 2016, Mr. Yao-Te Wang, introduced Mr. Ethan Chuang, a representative of China Concentric Capital, Ltd. (“China Concentric”), to Mr. Quanzhong Lin to discuss the possible acquisition of Mercari by China Concentric or Mr. Chuang for purposes of then acquiring an operating company in China. On December 21, 2016, China Concentric, a company with which Mr. Chuang was affiliated, entered into a purchase agreement (as amended, the “Lin Purchase Agreement”) with Mr. Lin for the purchase of a controlling interest in our company.
 
On January 20, 2017, Algodon sold all of the 43,822,401 shares of our common stock which it owned, 96.5% of our outstanding shares of common stock, to China Concentric, for $260,000, and assigned its right to the repayment of $150,087 of non-interest bearing advances to our company for working capital under a stock purchase agreement dated December 20, 2016, as amended, with China Concentric (the “Algodon Purchase Agreement”). Prior to entering into the Algodon Purchase Agreement, neither China Concentric nor any of its affiliates, had any relationship to, our company, Algodon or any of their respective affiliates, though China Concentric acquired the shares of Algodon with a view towards reselling them to Mr. Lin.

On February 2, 2017, Mr. Lin purchased 29,521,410 shares of our common stock, approximately 65% of our outstanding shares of common stock, from China Concentric for $300,000, pursuant to the Lin Purchase Agreement, which resulted in a change in control of our company. Mr. Lin is an accomplished Chinese entrepreneur who has founded pharmacies, retail outlets, companies which provide services in hotel management and global tourism, and AiXinZhonghong,
 
Mr. Chuang was appointed a director and officer of our company upon the consummation of the Algodon Purchase Agreement, and continued to serve as a director and officer of our company following the acquisition by Mr. Lin of a controlling interest in our company until the consummation of the AiXin BVI Acquisition on December 12, 2017, discussed below. Mr. Lin was appointed a director and Chief Executive Officer of our company at the time he acquired a controlling interest in our company. At the time the acquisition of Aixin (BVI) was being structured, Mr. Lin and Mr. Chuang were our only officers and directors. Mr. Wang was appointed a director of our company to fill the vacancy created by the resignation of Mr. Chuang at the time of the acquisition of Aixin (BVI).
 
On December 12, 2017, we issued 227,352,604 shares of common stock to Mr. Lin, the sole stockholder of AiXin BVI, for his shares of AiXin BVI, pursuant to a share exchange agreement (the “Share Exchange Agreement”). Mr. Lin then owned 256,874,014 shares of our common stock, or 80.8% of our outstanding shares.
 
The terms of each of the Algodon Purchase Agreement whereby China Concentric acquired control of our company, the terms of the Lin Purchase Agreement whereby controlled was transferred to Mr. Lin and the terms of the Share Exchange Agreement whereby we acquired Aixin (BVI) reflect the negotiations among Mr. Lin, Mr. Wang and China Concentric as to their relative compensation for their contributions to our company.
 
Messrs. Lin, Wang, Chuang and China Concentric structured the foregoing stock purchase and share exchange transactions as part of the AiXin BVI Acquisition to obtain the share allocations and monetary benefits described below. China Concentric received 14,300,991 shares of our common stock (the difference between the 43,822,401 shares it purchased from Algodon and the 29,521,410 shares it sold to Mr. Lin), realized $40,000 (the difference between the $300,000 it received from Mr. Lin for the sale of the 29,521,410 shares sold to Mr. Lin and the $260,000 it paid Algodon for the 43,822,401 shares it purchased from Algodon), and an assignment of Algodon’s right to repayment for working capital advances in the aggregate amount of $150,807 which Algodon had made to our company as our controlling stockholder
 
Effective February 1, 2018, we changed our name to AiXin Life International., Inc. (“AiXin”).
