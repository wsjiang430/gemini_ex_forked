Amorphous alloys are, in general, unique materials that are distinguished by their ability to retain a random atomic structure when they solidify, in contrast to the crystalline atomic structure that forms in other metals and alloys when they solidify. Liquidmetal alloys are proprietary amorphous alloys that possess a combination of performance, processing, and potential cost advantages that we believe will make them preferable to other materials in a variety of applications. The amorphous atomic structure of bulk alloys enables them to overcome certain performance limitations caused by inherent weaknesses in crystalline atomic structures, thus facilitating performance and processing characteristics superior in many ways to those of their crystalline counterparts. We believe the alloys and the molding technologies we employ can result in components for many applications that exhibit exceptional dimensional control and repeatability that rivals precision machining, excellent corrosion resistance, brilliant surface finish, high strength, high hardness, high elastic limit, alloys that are non-magnetic, and the ability to form complex shapes common to the injection molding of plastics. All of these characteristics are achievable from the molding process, so design engineers often do not have to select specific alloys to achieve one or more of the characteristics as is the case with crystalline materials. We believe these advantages could result in Liquidmetal alloys supplanting high-performance alloys, such as titanium and stainless steel, and other incumbent materials in a wide variety of applications. Moreover, we believe these advantages could enable the introduction of entirely new products and applications that are not possible or commercially viable with other materials.
 
General Corporate Information 
 
We were originally incorporated in California in 1987, and we reincorporated in Delaware in May 2003.  Our principal executive office is located at 20321 Valencia Circle, Lake Forest, California 92630. Our telephone number at that address is (949) 635-2100. Our Internet website address is www.liquidmetal.com and all of our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) are available free of charge on our website.
Our Technology
 
The performance, processing, and potential cost advantages of Liquidmetal alloys are a function of their unique atomic structure and their proprietary material composition.
 
Unique Atomic Structure
 
The atomic structure of Liquidmetal alloys is the fundamental feature that differentiates them from other alloys and metals. In the molten state, the atomic particles of all alloys and metals have an amorphous atomic structure, which means that the atomic particles appear in a completely random structure with no discernible patterns. However, when non-amorphous alloys and metals are cooled to a solid state, their atoms bond together in a repeating pattern of regular and predictable shapes or crystalline grains. This process is analogous to the way ice forms when water freezes and crystallizes. In non-amorphous metals and alloys, the individual crystalline grains contain naturally occurring structural defects that limit the potential strength and performance characteristics of the material. These defects, known as dislocations, consist of discontinuities or inconsistencies in the patterned atomic structure of each grain. Unlike other alloys and metals, bulk Liquidmetal alloys can retain their amorphous atomic structure throughout the solidification process and therefore do not develop crystalline grains and the associated dislocations. Consequently, bulk Liquidmetal alloys exhibit superior strength and other superior performance characteristics compared to their crystalline counterparts.
 
Prior to 1993, commercially viable amorphous alloys could be created only in thin forms, such as coatings, films, or ribbons. However, in 1993, researchers at the California Institute of Technology (“Caltech”) developed the first commercially viable amorphous alloy in a bulk form. We obtained the exclusive right to commercialize the bulk amorphous alloy through a license agreement with Caltech and have developed the technology to enable the commercialization of bulk amorphous alloys.     
 
Proprietary Material Composition
 
The constituent elements and percentage composition of Liquidmetal alloys are critical to their ability to solidify into an amorphous atomic structure. We have several different alloy compositions that have different constituent elements in varying percentages. The raw materials that we use in Liquidmetal alloys are readily available and can be purchased from multiple suppliers.
Advantages of Liquidmetal Alloys

Liquidmetal alloys possess a unique combination of performance, processing, and potential cost advantages that we believe makes them superior in many ways to other commercially available materials for a variety of existing and potential future product applications. The unique combined process results of precise dimensional control and repeatability, surface finish, strength, hardness, elasticity, and corrosion resistance are uncommon in crystalline material alternatives. Additionally, the ability to leverage various molding processes and related tooling technologies provides the ability to deliver a broad range of material characteristics in a complex shaped component.

Performance Advantages
 
Our bulk Liquidmetal alloys provide several distinct performance advantages over other materials, and we believe that these advantages make the alloys desirable in applications that require high precision and repeatability, high yield strength, strength-to-weight ratio, elasticity, corrosion resistance and hardness.
Processing Advantages
 
The processing of a material generally refers to how a material is shaped, formed, or combined with other materials to create a finished product. Bulk Liquidmetal alloys possess processing characteristics that we believe make them preferable to other materials in a wide variety of applications. In particular, our alloys are amenable to processing options that are similar in many respects to those associated with plastics. Additionally, unlike most metals and alloys, our bulk Liquidmetal alloys are capable of being thermoplastically molded in bulk form. Thermoplastic molding consists of heating a solid piece of material until it is transformed into a moldable state, although at temperatures much lower than the melting temperature, and then introducing it into a mold to form near-to-net shaped products. Accordingly, thermoplastic molding can be beneficial and economical for net-shape fabrication of high-strength products. Liquidmetal alloys also have superior net-shape casting capabilities as compared to high-strength crystalline metals and alloys. “Net-shape casting” is a type of casting that permits the creation of near-to-net shaped products that reduce costly post-cast processing or machining.
Cost Advantages
 
Liquidmetal alloys have the potential to provide cost advantages over other high-strength metals and alloys in certain applications. Because bulk Liquidmetal alloys have processing characteristics similar in some respects to plastics, which lend themselves to near-to-net shape molding, Liquidmetal alloys can in many cases be shaped efficiently into intricate, engineered products. This capability can eliminate or reduce certain post-molding steps, such as machining and re-forming, and therefore has the potential to significantly reduce processing costs associated with making parts in high volume.
Our Strategy
 
The key elements of our strategy include:
 

• | Focusing Our Marketing Activities on Select Products with Optimized Gross-Margins. We have focused and continue to focus our marketing activities on select products with optimized gross margins for the long term. This strategy is designed to align our product development initiatives with our processes and cost structure, and to reduce our exposure to more commodity-type product applications that are prone to unpredictable demand and fluctuating pricing. Our focus is primarily on products that possess design features that take advantage of our physical properties and manufacturing advantages of our technology and that command a price commensurate with the performance advantages of our alloys. In addition, we will continue to engage in prototype manufacturing for products that will ultimately be licensed to or manufactured by third-parties. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | Pursuing Strategic Partnerships in Order to More Rapidly Develop and Commercialize Products. We have and continue to actively pursue and support strategic partnerships that will enable us to leverage the resources, strength, and technologies of other companies in order to more rapidly develop and commercialize products. These partnerships may include licensing transactions in which we license full commercial rights to our technology in a specific application area, or they may include transactions of a more limited scope in which, for example, we outsource manufacturing activities or grant limited licensing rights. We believe that utilizing such a partnering strategy will enable us to reduce our working capital burden, better fund product development efforts, better understand customer adoption practices, leverage the technical and financial resources of our partners, and more effectively handle product design and process challenges. 
• | Advancing the Liquidmetal® Brand. We believe that building our corporate brand will foster continued adoption of our technology. Our goal is to position Liquidmetal alloys as a superior substitute for materials currently used in a variety of products across a range of industries. Furthermore, we seek to establish Liquidmetal alloys as an enabling technology that will facilitate the creation of a broad range of commercially viable new products. To enhance industry awareness of our company and increase demand for Liquidmetal alloys, we are engaged in various brand development strategies that could include collaborative advertising and promotional campaigns with select customers, industry conference and trade show appearances, public relations, and other means.

Applications for Liquidmetal Alloys
 
There is a very broad number of markets where Liquidmetal alloys have application opportunities. Some of the more prominent markets include: medical/ dental, automotive, non-consumer electronics, and sporting equipment. We believe that these areas are consistent with our strategy in terms of market size, building brand recognition, and providing an opportunity to develop and refine our processing capabilities. Although we believe that strategic partnership transactions could also create valuable opportunities beyond the parameters of these target markets, we anticipate continuing to pursue these markets both internally and in conjunction with partners.
Medical Devices
 
We are engaged in product development efforts relating to various medical devices that could be made from bulk Liquidmetal alloys. We believe that the unique properties of bulk Liquidmetal alloys provide a combination of performance and cost benefits that could make them a desirable replacement for incumbent materials, such as machined stainless steel and titanium, or components made from other more traditional metalworking technologies currently used in various medical device applications.  Our ongoing emphasis has been on minimally invasive surgical instrument applications for Liquidmetal alloys. These include, but are not limited to, specialized blades, clamps, tissue suturing components, tissue manipulation devices and orthopedic instruments utilized for implant surgery procedures, dental devices, and general surgery devices. The potential value offered by our alloys is higher performance in some cases and cost reduction in others, the latter stemming from the ability of Liquidmetal alloys to be net shape molded into components, thus reducing costs of secondary processing common with other metalworking processes. The status of most components in the prototyping phase is subject to non-disclosure agreements with our customers.
Automotive Components
 
We are engaged in product development efforts relating to various automotive components that could be made from bulk Liquidmetal alloys. We believe that the unique properties of bulk Liquidmetal alloys provide the combination of long-lasting surface finish, corrosion resistance, strength, and precision required by most automotive applications, especially for the EV space. The potential value offered by our alloys is higher performance in some cases and cost reduction in others, the latter stemming from the ability of Liquidmetal alloys to be net shape molded into components, thus reducing costs of secondary processing common with existing processes.
 
Components for Non-Consumer Electronic Products
 
We design, develop and supply components for non-consumer electronic devices utilizing our bulk Liquidmetal alloys and believe that our alloys offer enhanced performance and design benefits for these components in certain applications.  Our strategic focus is primarily on parts that command a price commensurate with the performance advantages of our alloys. These product categories in the non-consumer electronics field include, but are not limited to, aerospace components, leisure products, and industrial machines. We believe that there are multiple applications and opportunities in the non-consumer electronics product category for us to produce parts that command the higher margin and premium prices consistent with our core business strategy.
 
We believe that the continued miniaturization of, and the introduction of advanced features to non-consumer electronic devices is a primary driver of growth, market share, and profits in our industry. The high strength-to-weight ratio and elastic limit, along with the processing advantages of bulk Liquidmetal alloys enable the production of smaller, thinner, but stronger electronic parts. We also believe that the strength characteristics of our alloys could facilitate the creation of a new generation of non-consumer electronic devices which currently may not be viable because of strength limitations of conventional metal parts in the marketplace today. Lastly, we believe that our alloys offer style and design flexibility, such as shiny metallic finishes, to accommodate the changing tastes of our customers.
 
On August 5, 2010, we entered into a license transaction with Apple Inc. (“Apple”) pursuant to which, for a one-time, upfront license fee, we granted to Apple a perpetual, worldwide, fully-paid, exclusive license to commercialize our intellectual property in the field of “consumer electronic” products, as defined in the license agreement. We continue to work with Apple to develop and advance research and development in the amorphous alloy space to benefit both consumer and non-consumer electronics fields.

(“ATJ”), a newly formed Japanese entity that was established by Twins Corporation, a sporting goods company operating in Japan. Under the agreement, LMG granted to ATJ a nonexclusive worldwide sublicense to the Company’s amorphous alloy technology and related trademarks to manufacture and sell golf clubs and golf related products. The LMG Sublicense Agreement has a term of three years and provides for the payment of a running royalty to LMG of 3% of the net sales price of licensed products.
Our Intellectual Property 
 
Our intellectual property consists of patents, trade secrets, know-how, and trademarks. Protection of our intellectual property is a strategic priority for our business, and we intend to vigorously protect our patents and other intellectual property. Our intellectual property portfolio includes more than 35 owned or licensed U.S. patents relating to the composition, processing, and application of our alloys, as well as more than 30 foreign counterpart patents and patent applications.
 
Our initial bulk amorphous alloy technology was developed by researchers at Caltech. We have acquired patent rights that provide us with the exclusive right to commercialize amorphous alloys and other amorphous alloy technology developed at Caltech through a license agreement (“Caltech License Agreement”) with Caltech. In addition to the patents and patent applications that we license from Caltech, we are building a portfolio of our own patents to expand and enhance our technology position. These patents and patent applications primarily relate to various applications of our bulk amorphous alloys and the processing of our alloys. The patents expire on various dates between 2023 and 2039. Our policy is to seek patent protection for all technology, inventions, and improvements that are of commercial importance to the development of our business, except to the extent that we believe it is advisable to maintain such technology or invention as a trade secret.
 
In order to protect the confidentiality of our technology, including trade secrets, know-how, and other proprietary technical and business information, we require that all of our employees, consultants, advisors and collaborators enter into confidentiality agreements that prohibit the use or disclosure of information that is deemed confidential. The agreements also obligate our employees, consultants, advisors and collaborators to assign to us developments, discoveries and inventions made by such persons in connection with their work with us.
 
Research and Development
 
We have engaged in limited research and development programs that were driven by the following key objectives:
 

• | Enhance Material Processing and Manufacturing Efficiencies. We are working with our strategic partners to enhance material processing and manufacturing efficiencies. We plan to continue research and development of processes and compositions that will decrease our cost of making products from Liquidmetal alloys.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | Develop New Applications. We will continue the research and development of new applications for Liquidmetal alloys. We believe the range of potential applications will broaden as we expand the forms, compositions, and methods of processing of our alloys. 

 
In addition to our internal research and development efforts, we enter into cooperative research and development relationships with leading academic institutions.  We have entered into development relationships with other companies for the purpose of identifying new applications for our alloys and establishing customer relationships with such companies. Some of our product development programs are partially funded by our customers. We are also engaged in negotiations with other potential customers regarding possible product development relationships. Our research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were $55 and $84, respectively.
 
Raw Materials
 
Liquidmetal alloy compositions are comprised of many elements, many of which are generally available commodity products. While we believe that each of these raw materials is readily available in sufficient quantities from multiple sources on commercially acceptable terms, we continue to seek opportunities to secure stocks of essential elements in advance to manage lead-times and cost. Due to our inherent dependency on these alloy compositions for the manufacture of Liquidmetal products, any substantial increase in the price or interruption in the supply of these materials could have an adverse effect on our business.

Manufacturing
 
Our current manufacturing strategy is to partner with global companies that are contract manufacturers and alloy producers. We seek third party companies with proven track records of success who can gain specialized skills and knowledge of our alloys through close collaborations with our team of engineers. We believe that partnering with these global companies will allow us to forgo the capital intensive requirements of maintaining our own large scale manufacturing facilities and allow us to grow the number of applications for the technology much faster than could be accomplished on our own.
 
On January 12, 2022, Liquidmetal Technologies entered into a manufacturing agreement (“Manufacturing Agreement”) with Dongguan Yihao Metal Materials Technology Co. Ltd. (“Yihao”) to become the primary outsourced manufacturer of the Company’s products. Under the Manufacturing Agreement, which has a term of five years, Yihao has agreed to serve as a non-exclusive contract manufacturer for amorphous alloy parts offered and sold by the Company at prices determined on a “cost-plus” basis. Yihao is an affiliate of Dongguan Eontec Co. Ltd. and Professor Lugee Li, our Chairman and largest beneficial owner of the Company’s capital stock.
 
Customers
 
During 2022, there were three major customers, who together accounted for 74% of our revenue. During 2021, there were three major customers, who together accounted for 82% of our revenue. As of December 31, 2022, one customers represented 100%, or $24, of the total outstanding trade accounts receivable. As of December 31, 2021, two customers represented 89%, or $147,000, of the total outstanding trade accounts receivable. In the future, we expect that a significant portion of our revenue may continue to be concentrated in a limited number of customers, even if our bulk alloys business grows.
Competition
 
Our bulk Liquidmetal alloys face competition from other materials, including metals, alloys, plastics and composites, which are currently used in the commercial applications that we pursue. For example, we face significant competition from plastics, zinc and stainless steel in our non-consumer electronics components business, and titanium and composites will continue to be used widely in medical devices and sporting goods. Many of these competitive materials are produced by domestic and international companies that have substantially greater financial and other resources than we do. Based on our experience developing products for a variety of customers, we believe that the selection of materials by potential customers will continue to be product-specific in nature, with the decision for each product being driven primarily by the performance needs of the application and, secondarily, by cost considerations and design flexibility. Because of the relatively high strength of our alloys, dimensional precision, and the design flexibility of our process, we are most competitive when the customer is seeking a higher strength, as well as greater design flexibility, than currently available with other materials. However, if currently available materials, such as plastics, are strong enough for the application, our alloys are often not competitive in those applications with respect to price. We also believe that our alloys are generally not competitive with the cost of some of the basic metals, such as steel, aluminum or copper, when such basic metals can be processed by simple traditional metalworking processes into shapes and components that are satisfactory for their intended applications. Our alloys are generally more competitive with respect to price compared to components machined from various metals, such as titanium, stainless steel and other higher performance crystalline metals. Our alloys could also face competition from new materials that may be developed in the future, including new materials that could render our alloys obsolete.
 
We experience and will continue to experience indirect competition from the competitors of our customers. Because we rely on our customers to market and sell finished goods that incorporate our components or products, our success will depend in part on the ability of our customers to effectively market and sell their own products and compete in their respective markets.
 
Backlog
 
Because of the minimal lead-time associated with orders of bulk alloy parts, we generally do not carry a significant backlog. The backlog as of any particular date gives no indication of actual sales for any succeeding period.
Sales and Marketing
 
We direct our marketing efforts towards customers that will incorporate our components and products into their finished goods. Our goal is to educate customers on the benefits of our technology and help them gain adequate knowledge to apply the technology to their upcoming product application designs. To that end, we have business development personnel who, in conjunction with engineers and scientists, will actively identify potential customers that may be able to benefit from the introduction of Liquidmetal alloys to their products. We currently have 4 full-time individuals engaged in our internal sales, business development and marketing activities. In addition, we work closely with a team of more than 15 external sales representatives covering the territories of North America and Europe.

Human Capital
 
As of December 31, 2022, we had 7 full-time employees and 1 full-time consultant. As of that date, none of our employees or consultants were represented by a labor union.  We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our employee and consultant relations to be favorable. We endeavor to maintain a workplace that is free from discrimination or harassment on the basis of color, race, sex, national origin, ethnicity, religion, age, disability, sexual orientation, gender identification or expression or any other status protected by applicable law. The basis for recruitment, hiring, development, training, compensation and advancement is a person’s qualifications, performance, skills and experience. We believe that our employees are fairly compensated, without regard to gender, race and ethnicity, and routinely recognized for outstanding performance.
Governmental Regulation
 
Government regulation of our products will depend on the nature and type of product and the jurisdictions in which the products are sold. For example, medical instruments incorporating our Liquidmetal alloys will be subject to regulation in the United States by the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) and corresponding state and foreign regulatory agencies. Medical device manufacturers to whom we intend to sell our products may need to obtain FDA approval before marketing their medical devices that incorporate our products and may need to obtain similar approvals before marketing these medical device products in foreign countries.
Environmental Law Compliance 
 
Our operations are subject to national, state, and local environmental laws in the United States. We believe that we are in material compliance with all applicable environmental regulations. While we continue to incur costs to comply with environmental regulations, we do not believe that such costs will have a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position.
Liquidmetal Golf 
 
Liquidmetal Golf Inc. (“Liquidmetal Golf” or “LMG”) is a majority-owned subsidiary which has the exclusive right and license to utilize our Liquidmetal alloy technology for purposes of golf equipment applications. This right and license is set forth in an intercompany license agreement dated January 1, 2002 between Liquidmetal Technologies and Liquidmetal Golf. This license agreement provides that Liquidmetal Golf has a perpetual and exclusive license to use Liquidmetal alloy technology for the purpose of manufacturing, marketing, and selling golf club components and other products used in the sport of golf. We own 79% of the outstanding common stock in Liquidmetal Golf.
 
On January 13, 2022, Liquidmetal Golf entered into a sublicense agreement (“LMG Sublicense Agreement”) with Amorphous Technologies Japan, Inc. (“ATJ”), a newly formed Japanese entity that was established by Twins Corporation, a sporting goods company operating in Japan. Under the agreement, LMG granted to ATJ a nonexclusive worldwide sublicense to the Company’s amorphous alloy technology and related trademarks to manufacture and sell golf clubs and golf related products. The LMG Sublicense Agreement has a term of three years and provides for the payment of a running royalty to LMG of 3% of the net sales price of licensed products.
