ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
FARO was founded in 1982 and re-incorporated in Florida in 1992. Our worldwide headquarters are located at 250 Technology Park, Lake Mary, Florida 32746 and our telephone number is (407) 333-9911. 
We are a global technology company that designs, develops, manufactures, markets and supports software driven, three-dimensional (“3D”) measurement and imaging solutions. This technology permits high-precision 3D measurement, imaging and comparison of parts and complex structures within production and quality assurance processes. Our devices are used for inspection of components and assemblies, rapid prototyping, reverse engineering, documenting large volume or structures in 3D, surveying and construction, as well as for investigation and reconstruction of accident sites or crime scenes. We sell the majority of our products through a direct sales force across a broad number of customers in a range of manufacturing, industrial, architecture, surveying, building information modeling, construction, public safety forensics, cultural heritage, dental, and other applications. Our FaroArm®, FARO ScanArm®, FARO Laser TrackerTM, FARO Cobalt Array Imager, FARO Laser Projector, and their companion CAM2®, BuildIT, and BuildIT Projector software solutions, provide for Computer-Aided Design (“CAD”) based inspection, factory-level statistical process control, high-density surveying, and laser-guided assembly and production. Together, these products integrate the measurement, quality inspection, and reverse engineering functions with CAD and 3D software to improve productivity, enhance product quality, and decrease rework and scrap in the manufacturing process, mainly supporting applications in our 3D Manufacturing (formerly known as “Factory Metrology” and “3D Factory”) vertical. Our FARO Focus, FARO ScanPlan and FARO Scanner Freestyle3D X laser scanners, and their companion FARO SCENE, BuildIT, FARO As-BuiltTM, and FARO Zone public safety forensics software offerings, are utilized for a wide variety of 3D modeling, documentation and high-density surveying applications in our Construction Building Information Modeling (“Construction BIM,” formerly known as “Construction BIM-CIM”) and Public Safety Forensics verticals. Our FARO ScanArm®, FARO Cobalt Array Imager, FARO Scanner Freestyle3D X laser scanners and their companion SCENE software, and other 3D structured light scanning solutions specific to the dental industry, also enable a fully digital workflow used to capture real world geometry for the purpose of empowering design, enabling innovation, and speeding up the design cycle, supporting our 3D Design (formerly known as “Product Design”) vertical. Our line of galvanometer-based scan heads and laser scan controllers are used in a variety of laser applications and are integrated into larger components and systems, supporting our Photonics vertical.
Industry Background
We believe four principal forces drive the need for our products and services: 1) the widespread use by manufacturers of CAD in product development, which shortens product cycles; 2) the adoption by manufacturers of quality standards such as Six Sigma and ISO 9001 (and its offshoot QS 9000), which stress the measurement of every step in a manufacturing process to reduce or eliminate defects; 3) the inability of traditional measurement devices to address many manufacturing problems such as throughput, efficiency and accuracy, especially with respect to large components for products such as automobiles, aircraft, heavy duty construction equipment and factory retrofits; and 4) the growing demand to capture and synthesize large volumes of three-dimensional data for modeling and analysis.
CAD improves the manufacturing process. The creation of physical products involves the processes of design, engineering, production, and measurement and quality inspection. These basic processes have been profoundly affected by the computer hardware and software revolution that began in the 1980s. CAD software was developed to automate the design process, providing manufacturers with computerized 3D design capability and shortening the time between design changes. Today, most manufacturers use some form of CAD software to create designs and engineering specifications for new products and to quantify and modify designs and specifications for existing products. While manufacturers previously designed their products to remain in production for longer periods of time, current manufacturing practices must accommodate more frequent product introductions and modifications, while satisfying more stringent quality and safety standards. Assembly fixtures and measurement tools must be linked to the CAD design to enable production to keep up with the rate of design change.
Quality standards dictate measurement to reduce defects. QS 9000 is the name given to the Quality System requirements of the automotive industry developed by Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V. (formerly Chrysler Corporation), Ford Motor Company, General Motors Company and major truck manufacturers. Companies registered under QS 9000 are considered to have higher standards and better quality products. Six Sigma is a set of quality standards that embodies the principles of total quality management, focused on measuring results and reducing product or service failure rates to 3.4 per million. All aspects of a Six Sigma company’s infrastructure must be analyzed and, if necessary, restructured to increase revenues and raise customer satisfaction levels. The all-encompassing nature of these and other quality standards has resulted in manufacturers measuring every aspect of their processes, including stages of product assembly that may never have been measured before, in part, because of the lack of suitable measurement equipment.
Traditional products do not measure up. A significant aspect of the manufacturing process entails measurement and quality inspection. Historically, manufacturers have measured and inspected products using hand-measurement tools such as scales, calipers, micrometers and plumb lines for simple measuring tasks, test (or check) fixtures for certain large manufactured products, and traditional (or fixed) coordinate measurement machines (“CMM”) for objects that require higher precision measurement. However, the broader utility of each of these measurement methods is limited.
Although hand-measurement tools are often appropriate for simple geometric measurements, including hole diameters or length and width of a rectangular component, their use for complex part measurements, such as the fender of a car, is limited. Also, these devices do not allow for the measurements to be directly compared electronically to the CAD model of the part. Test fixtures (customized fixed tools used to make comparative measurements of complex production parts to “master parts”) are relatively expensive and must be reworked or discarded each time a dimensional change is made in the part being measured. In addition, these manual measuring devices do not permit the manufacturer to electronically compare the dimensions of an object with its CAD model.
Conventional CMMs are generally large, fixed-base machines that provide very high levels of precision and provide a link to the CAD model of the object being measured. However, fixed-base CMMs require that the object being measured be brought to the CMM and fit within the CMM’s measurement grid. As manufactured subassemblies increase in size and become integrated into even larger assemblies, they become less transportable, thus diminishing the utility of a conventional CMM. Consequently, manufacturers must continue to use hand-measurement tools, or expensive customized test fixtures, to measure large or unconventionally shaped objects. In addition, some parts or assemblies are not easily accessible and cannot be measured using traditional devices.
The market demands three-dimensional data. Various factors contribute to market demand for FARO products and services. Conventional surveying equipment is limited to single-point measurements and does not have the capacity to capture and analyze large volumes of 3D data. As data requirements for construction, civil engineering and public safety applications become more complex, single-point measurement devices will become increasingly more difficult to utilize in those applications.
Escalating global competition has created a demand for higher quality products with shorter life cycles. Customers require more rapid design, greater control of the manufacturing process, tools to compare components to their CAD specifications, the ability to precisely measure components that cannot be measured or inspected by conventional devices, and the ability to capture and analyze large volumes of 3D data. Moreover, they increasingly require measurement capabilities to be integrated into manufacturing processes and to be available on the factory floor. These changing demands have contributed to the demand for FARO’s products and services.

Customers
Our sales are diversified across a broad number of over 15,000 customers worldwide in our 3D Manufacturing, Construction BIM, 3D Design, Public Safety Forensics and Photonics vertical markets. Our ten largest customers by revenue represented an aggregate of approximately 2.2% of our total sales in 2018. No customer represented more than 1.0% of our sales in 2018.
Sales and Marketing
We conduct our sales and marketing efforts on a vertical basis. Each vertical has its own sales and marketing team coordinated by our Lake Mary headquarters. Geographically, we have operations in three main regions around the world: Americas, Europe/Middle East/Africa (“EMEA”) and Asia-Pacific. The regional headquarters for the Americas, which is also our global headquarters, is located in Lake Mary, Florida; the EMEA regional headquarters is located in Stuttgart, Germany; and the regional headquarters for the Asia-Pacific region is located in Singapore. Each of these regional sales and marketing organizations support each of our reporting segments. As of December 31, 2018, we employed 808 sales and marketing specialists globally. 
We sell most of our products through direct sales representation in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Our sales and marketing efforts use a process of integrated lead qualification and sales demonstration. Once a customer opportunity is identified, we employ a team-based sales approach involving inside and outside sales personnel. Each team has the ability to sell multiple product lines. We employ a variety of marketing techniques to promote brand awareness and customer identification.
Research and Development
We believe that our future success depends, in part, on our ability to maintain what we believe to be our technological leadership, which will require ongoing enhancements of our products and the development of new applications and products that provide 3D measurement and imaging solutions. The field of 3D measurement and imaging continues to expand, and new technologies and applications will be essential to competing in this market. Accordingly, we intend to continue to make substantial investments in the development of new technologies, the commercialization of new products that build on our existing technological base, and the enhancement and development of additional applications for our products.
Our research and development efforts are directed primarily at enhancing the functional adaptability of our current products and developing new and innovative products that respond to specific requirements of the emerging market for 3D measurement and imaging solutions. Additionally, certain of our acquisitions are intended, in whole or in part, to further the development of technologies which, on a risk adjusted basis, are better to be acquired than developed internally by us. Research and development activities, especially with respect to new products and technologies, are subject to significant risks, and there can be no assurance that any of our research and development activities will be completed successfully or on schedule, or, if completed, will be commercially accepted.
At December 31, 2018, we employed 260 scientists and technicians in our research and development efforts. Research and development expenses were approximately $39.7 million in 2018, compared to $35.4 million in 2017 and $30.1 million in 2016.
Intellectual Property
We own approximately 960 patents and pending patent applications worldwide, which generally expire on a rolling basis between 2019 and 2042. We also own approximately 74 trademark registrations worldwide, with 2 pending trademark applications.
Our success and ability to maintain a competitive position depends, in large part, on our ability to protect our intellectual property. We rely on a combination of contractual provisions and trade secret laws to protect our proprietary information. However, there can be no assurance that the steps taken by us to protect our trade secrets and proprietary information will be sufficient to prevent misappropriation of our proprietary information or preclude third-party development of similar intellectual property.
Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. We intend to vigorously defend our proprietary rights against infringement by third parties. However, policing unauthorized use of our products is difficult, particularly in foreign countries, and we may be unable to determine the extent, if any, to which unauthorized uses of our products exist. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States.
We do not believe that any of our products infringe on the valid, proprietary rights of third parties. There can be no assurance, however, that third parties will not claim infringement by us with respect to current or future products. Such claims, with or without merit, could be time consuming, result in costly litigation, cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements, which could have a material adverse effect upon our business, operating results and financial condition. In addition, such royalty or licensing agreements, if required, may not be available on terms acceptable to us, if at all.
Manufacturing and Assembly
Manufacturing consists primarily of assembling and integrating components and subassemblies purchased from suppliers into finished products. The primary components, which include machined parts and electronic circuit boards, are produced by subcontractors according to our specifications. Products are assembled, calibrated and tested for accuracy and functionality before shipment. We perform limited in-house circuit board assembly and component part machining. Typically, we enter into purchase commitments for manufacturing components to cover production requirements for 60 to 120 days. We have entered, and may continue to enter, into longer agreements to purchase sufficient inventory to satisfy warranty commitments or to ensure adequate component availability.
Our manufacturing, engineering, and design headquarters have been registered to the ISO 9001 standard since July 1998. Semi-annual surveillance audits have documented continuous improvement to this multinational standard. Currently, our manufacturing sites in Lake Mary, Florida; Exton, Pennsylvania; Stuttgart, Germany; Schaffhausen, Switzerland; and Singapore are jointly registered to ISO 9001. Our FARO Laser TrackerTM, FaroArm®, and FARO Cobalt Array Imager products are all registered to ISO 17025:2005. We continue to examine our scope of registration as our business evolves, and we have chosen English as the standard business language for our operations.
Our efforts to register our manufacturing, engineering and design headquarters to the ISO 9001 standard in concert with the ISO 9001:2015 Quality Management System Certification verifies our commitment to quality through an internationally recognized standard. Additionally, we take a global approach to ISO 17025:2005 regarding the recognition of the Competence of Calibration and Testing Laboratories, seeking to have all locations registered with similar scopes of accreditation and capabilities for the products generated and serviced.
We manufacture our FaroArm® and FARO ScanArm® products in our manufacturing facility located in Switzerland for customer orders from EMEA, in our manufacturing facility located in Singapore for customer orders from the Asia-Pacific region, and in our manufacturing facility located in Florida for customer orders from the Americas. We manufacture our FARO Focus in our manufacturing facilities located in Germany and Switzerland for customer orders from EMEA and the Asia-Pacific region, and in our manufacturing facility located in Pennsylvania for customer orders from the Americas. We manufacture our FARO Freestyle3D X products in our facility located in Germany. We manufacture our FARO Laser TrackerTM and our FARO Laser Projector products in our facility located in Pennsylvania. We manufacture our 3D structured light scanning solutions specific to the dental industry in our engineering and manufacturing facility in Italy. We expect all of our existing manufacturing facilities to have the production capacity necessary to support our volume requirements during 2019.
Competition
Our measurement systems compete in the broad and highly competitive market for measurement devices for manufacturing and industrial applications, which, in addition to portable articulated arms, laser trackers, 3D imaging and laser scanner products, consist of fixed-base CMMs, templates and go/no-go gages, check fixtures, handheld measurement tools, and various categories of surveying equipment. In the FaroArm®, FARO ScanArm®, FARO Laser TrackerTM, and FARO Focus product lines, we compete primarily with Hexagon Manufacturing Intelligence, a division of Hexagon AB; Automated Precision Inc.; Artec Europe, S.a.r.l.; Leica Geosystems, Inc., a division of Hexagon AB; and Trimble Inc. In the FARO Cobalt Array Imager product lines, we compete primarily with Carl Zeiss Optotechnik GmbH, GOM GmbH, Hexagon Manufacturing Intelligence, and Nikon Metrology, Inc., a division of Nikon Inc. In the FARO Laser Projector product line, we compete primarily with ViRTEK, a division of Gerber Technology LLC. We also compete in these product lines with a number of other smaller companies. We compete on the basis of technical innovation, product performance, quality and price with respect to all of our products.
We will be required to make continued investments in technology and product development to maintain and extend the technological advantage that we believe we currently have over our competition. However, we cannot be certain that our technology or our product development efforts will allow us to successfully compete as the industry evolves. As the market for our measurement systems expands, additional competition may emerge, and our existing and future competitors may commit more resources to the markets in which we participate.
Government Regulation
Our operations are subject to numerous governmental laws and regulations, including those governing antitrust and competition, the environment, collection, recycling, treatment and disposal of covered electronic products and components, import and export of products, currency conversions and repatriation, taxation of foreign earnings, and the use of local employees and suppliers. Our foreign operations are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, and similar foreign anti-corruption laws, which makes illegal any payments to government officials or government employees that are intended to induce their influence to assist us or to gain any improper advantage for us. We operate in certain regions in the Middle East, Africa, Latin America and Asia-Pacific that are more prone to risk under these anti-corruption laws.
Manufacturers of electrical goods are subject to the European Union’s RoHS2 and WEEE directives, which took effect during 2006. RoHS2 prohibits the use of lead, mercury and certain other specified substances in electronics products, and WEEE makes producers of electrical goods financially responsible for specified collection, recycling, treatment, and disposal of covered electronic products and components. Parallel initiatives are being proposed in other jurisdictions, including several states in the United States and China. We currently hold RoHS2 and WEEE registration and are in compliance with such directives of the European Union. 
In addition, a number of data protection laws impact, or may impact, the manner in which we collect, process and transfer personal data. Most notably, the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), which went into effect in May 2018, expands data protection compliance obligations and authorizes significantly increased fines for noncompliance, requiring additional compliance resources and efforts on our part. Further, a number of other regions where we do business, including the United States, Asia-Pacific and Latin America, have enacted or are considering new data protection regulations that may impact our business activities that involve the processing of personal data. Compliance with enhanced data protection laws requires additional resources and efforts, and noncompliance with personal data protection regulations could result in increased regulatory enforcement and significant monetary fines and costs.
We currently sell our products and related services to the U.S. Government (the “Government”) under two General Services Administration (“GSA”) Federal Supply Schedule contracts (the “GSA Contracts”). The Government, as well as state and local governments, can typically terminate or modify their contracts with us either at their discretion or if we default by failing to perform under the terms of the applicable contract, which could expose us to liability and impede our ability to compete in the future for contracts and orders. Our sales to the Government under the GSA Contracts represented approximately 3.5% of our total sales for 2018.
Certain of our products are classified as medical devices and are subject to restrictions under domestic and foreign laws, rules, regulations, self-regulatory codes, circulars and orders, including, but not limited to, the United States Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the “FDCA”), Council Directive 93/42/EEC on Medical Devices (“MDD”) (1993) in the European Union (and implementing and local measures adopted thereunder) and similar international laws and regulations. The FDCA requires these products, when sold in the United States, to be safe and effective for their intended use and to comply with the regulations administered by the United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”). Certain medical device products are also regulated by comparable agencies in non-U.S. countries in which they are produced or sold.
Backlog and Seasonality
At December 31, 2018, we had orders representing approximately $17.5 million in sales outstanding, of which $8.3 million related to services that we expect to deliver within one year. The product-related outstanding orders as of December 31, 2018 were $9.2 million, of which $3.0 million were shipped by February 15, 2019. As of February 15, 2019, we had orders representing approximately $17.1 million in sales outstanding, inclusive of 2018 open and undelivered orders, of which $7.7 million related to service orders and $9.4 million were product-related orders. We believe that substantially all of the outstanding product-related orders as of February 15, 2019 will be shipped during 2019. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had orders representing approximately $18.0 million and $13.4 million in sales outstanding, respectively.
We typically experience greater order volume during the fourth quarter as customers spend the remaining balances of their capital expenditure budgets.

At December 31, 2018, we had 1,862 full-time employees, consisting of 808 sales and marketing professionals, 305 customer service/training/application engineering specialists, 273 production staff, 260 research and development staff, and 216 administrative staff. We are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements and believe our employee relations are satisfactory. Management believes that our future growth and success will depend in part on our ability to retain and continue to attract highly-skilled personnel. We anticipate that we will be able to obtain the additional personnel required to satisfy our staffing requirements during 2019.
