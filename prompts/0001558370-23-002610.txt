ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
OVERVIEW​
TG Therapeutics is a fully-integrated, commercial stage, biopharmaceutical company focused on the acquisition, development and commercialization of novel treatments for B-cell diseases. In addition to a research pipeline including several investigational medicines, TG has received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for BRIUMVI™ (ublituximab-xiiy) for the treatment of adult patients with relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (RMS), to include clinically isolated syndrome, relapsing-remitting disease, and active secondary progressive disease, in adults. We also actively evaluate complementary products, technologies and companies for in-licensing, partnership, acquisition and/or investment opportunities.
​
Business Updates
​
FDA Approval and U.S. Launch of BRIUMVI
​
On December 28, 2022, we announced that the FDA granted approval of ublituximab, now referred to as BRIUMVI, for the treatment of RMS, to include clinically isolated syndrome, relapsing-remitting disease, and active secondary progressive disease, in adults. BRIUMVI is an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody approved for patients with RMS that can be administered in a one-hour infusion following the starting dose. Approval was granted for this indication based on data from the ULTIMATE I & II Phase 3 trials, which demonstrated superiority over teriflunomide in significantly reducing the annualized relapse rate (ARR, the primary endpoint), the number of T1 Gd-enhancing lesions and the number of new or enlarging T2 lesions. Results from the ULTIMATE I & II trials were recently published in August 2022 in The New England Journal of Medicine.
​
On January 26, 2023, we announced the commercial launch of BRIUMVI, making it available to physicians and patients. We are committed to helping patients access BRIUMVI through the BRIUMVI Patient Support Program, which we launched following the approval, additional information can be found at www.briumvi.com. 
​
UNITY-CLL Phase 3 Trial & Withdrawal of the BLA/sNDA Submission for U2 to Treat Patients with CLL/SLL and Withdrawal of UKONIQ® (umbralisib) from Sale 
​
On February 5, 2021, we announced that the FDA granted accelerated approval of umbralisib, the Company’s PI3K delta inhibitor, then commercially referred to as UKONIQ, for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory Marginal Zone Lymphoma (MZL) who have received at least one prior anti-CD20 based regimen and adult patients with relapsed or refractory Follicular Lymphoma (FL) who have received at least three prior lines of systemic therapy. 
​
To further expand the use of UKONIQ and to obtain the approval of ublituximab, our anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody under development, we conducted the UNITY-CLL study, a global, Phase 3, randomized, controlled clinical trial, that compared the combination of ublituximab, and UKONIQ, (combination referred to as U2), to an active control arm of obinutuzumab plus chlorambucil in patients with both treatment-naïve and relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The trial met its primary endpoint, and based on those results, a Biologics License Application (BLA) and supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) were submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for U2 to treat patients with CLL/small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL). 
​
In November 2021, we received notification from the FDA that it planned to host an Oncologic Drug Advisory Committee (ODAC) meeting in connection with its review of the pending BLA/sNDA and to discuss the benefit risk of UKONIQ in its approved indications. While the FDA identified a number of concerns, the FDA’s desire to host an ODAC appeared to stem from an early ad hoc analysis of overall survival (OS) from the UNITY-CLL trial.
​

5



On April 15, 2022, based on newly updated OS data from the UNITY-CLL study, which showed a negative survival benefit, we decided to withdraw the pending BLA/sNDA for U2 to treat CLL/SLL. 
​
On April 15, 2022, we also announced the voluntary withdrawal of UKONIQ from sale for its approved indications. Our decision to withdraw UKONIQ from sale was primarily based on the withdrawal of the BLA and sNDA for U2 in CLL.  On June 1, 2022, the FDA withdrew its approval of UKONIQ. 
​
As a result of these withdrawals, we closed or are in the process of closing all studies related to umbralisib +/- ublituximab in oncology.

--+-----------------------------------------------------------------

​
Our Approach and Platform
​
Our approach to drug development is centered on developing therapies for b cell diseases. Our process begins by identifying validated targets against B-cell diseases, and then searching for and, ideally, acquiring what we believe to be “best-in-class” compounds with complementary mechanisms against these targets.
​
Our preference is to identify targets for which there is human clinical proof of concept that the mechanism is active in B-cell diseases and then to identify drug candidates that effectively modulate the desired molecular target. We identify these drug candidates at academic centers of excellence or in development at biotech companies or pharmaceutical companies globally. Our current drug candidates were acquired through license agreements, collaborations, or joint ventures with biopharmaceutical companies located globally. This approach enables us to minimize target risk while looking for the best available drug candidates around the world. By focusing on B-cell diseases and targets with a known activity profile, we believe that we can quickly identify the patients most likely to respond, resulting in a more efficient development path with the potential for a greater likelihood of success.
​

Our approach is enabled by our clinical development platform which includes an internal team with a deep understanding of B-cell diseases and significant experience successfully obtaining FDA approval for innovative treatments for these complex diseases.
​
AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE OVERVIEW

An autoimmune disease occurs when the body’s immune system attacks and destroys healthy body tissue by mistake. There are currently more than 80 types of autoimmune disorders that have been identified. Some of these diseases may result from inappropriate production of antibodies from the B-cells. These antibodies cannot discriminate “self” from “non-self,” and inadvertently mount a disabling immune response against normal organs. Examples of common and very debilitating autoimmune disorders for which abnormally functioning B-cells have been implicated include MS and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). 
​The Company’s current focus is on MS.

Multiple Sclerosis Overview
RMS is a chronic demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS) and includes people with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) and people with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS) who continue to experience relapses. RRMS is the most common form of MS and is characterized by episodes of new or worsening signs or symptoms (relapses) followed by periods of recovery. MS is the most prevalent chronic inflammatory disease of the CNS. It is estimated that nearly 1 million people are living with MS in the United States and over 2.3 million people world-wide are living with MS.
​
OUR PRODUCTS 

We currently license worldwide development and commercial rights, subject to certain limited geographical restrictions, for all of our products under development. The following table summarizes the current clinical trial status for our lead drug candidates as of February 2023.

Clinical Drug Candidate: (molecular target) | Initial Target Disease | Stage of Development(trial name)
Ublituximab (anti-CD20 mAb) | Relapsing Forms of Multiple Sclerosis (RMS) | APPROVED 
TG-1701 (BTK inhibitor) | B-cell disorders | Phase 1 trial 
TG-1801 (anti-CD47/CD19 bispecific mAb) | B-cell disorders | Phase 1 trial 

​BRIUMVI (ublituximab-xiiy) Overview
BRIUMVI is the first and only anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody approved for the treatment of RMS, to include clinically isolated syndrome, relapsing-remitting disease, and active secondary progressive disease, in adults, that can be administered in a one-hour infusion following the starting dose.
Late-Stage Clinical Development of Ublituximab-xiiy
​
ULTIMATE I & II Trials Evaluating Single Agent Ublituximab in RMS: ULTIMATE I and ULTIMATE II are two independent Phase 3 trials. Each trial is a global, randomized, multi-center, double-blinded, double-dummy, active-controlled study evaluating the efficacy and safety/tolerability of ublituximab-xiiy (450mg dose administered by one hour intravenous infusion every six months, following a Day 1 infusion of 150mg over four hours, and a Day 15 infusion of 450mg over one hour) to teriflunomide (14mg oral tablets taken once daily) in subjects with RMS. The primary endpoint for each study was ARR following 96 weeks of treatment. This program was led by Lawrence Steinman, MD, George A. Zimmermann Professor and Professor of Pediatrics, Neurology and Neurological Sciences at Stanford University.
​

7



In December 2020, we announced positive topline results from the ULTIMATE I & II trials. Both studies met their primary endpoint of significantly reducing ARR over a 96-week period (p<0.005 in each study) with ublituximab-xiiy demonstrating an ARR of <0.10 in each of the studies. Relative reductions of approximately 60% and 50% in ARR over teriflunomide were observed in ULTIMATE I & II, respectively. Key secondary MRI endpoints were also met.
​
On August 22, 2022, the full results from the ULTIMATE I & II trials were published in the New England Journal of Medicine. 
​
Commercialization of BRIUMVI (ublituximab-xiiy)
​
On December 28, 2022, we announced the FDA approval of BRIUMVI (ublituximab-xiiy) for the treatment of RMS, to include clinically isolated syndrome, relapsing-remitting disease, and active secondary progressive disease, in adults, primarily based on results from the ULTIMATE I & II Phase 3 trials, and on January 26, 2023, we announced the U.S. commercial launch of BRIUMVI, making it available to physicians and patients.
​
A marketing authorization application (MAA) has been submitted to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for ublituximab to treat adult patients with relapsing forms of MS. We expect a decision to be made on this application in the second half of 2023. 
​
 We will continue to evaluate options for commercialization outside the U.S., either alone or with a partner, that maximizes the potential return on investment.

TG-1701 (BTK inhibitor) Overview

TG-1701 is a novel, orally available and covalently-bound Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor that exhibits strong selectivity to BTK in in vitro kinase screening.

B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling is crucial for normal B-cell development and supports the survival and growth of malignant B-cells in patients with B-cell leukemias or lymphomas. Targeting BTK, an essential element of BCR signaling pathway which regulates the survival, activation, proliferation, and differentiation of B lymphocytes, has shown remarkable efficacy with an acceptable safety profile in B-cell malignancies.

We are currently evaluating TG-1701 in a Phase 1, multi-center, dose-escalation clinical trial in patients with B-cell malignancies. Key secondary objectives include evaluation of pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics, and preliminary anticancer activity. Data from this trial was presented at the 2021 American Society of Hematology (ASH) annual meeting. 

TG-1801 (anti-CD47/anti-CD19 bispecific monoclonal antibody) Overview

TG-1801 is a first-in-class, bispecific CD47 and CD19 antibody. It is the first therapy to target both CD19, a B-cell specific market widely expressed across B-cell malignancies, and CD47, the "don’t eat me" signal used by both healthy and tumor cells to evade macrophage mediated phagocytosis. CD47 is expressed ubiquitously on normal cells, including red blood cells and platelets. CD19 is a specific B-cell marker, expressed early during pre-B cell ontogeny and until terminal differentiation into early plasma cells. The majority of B-cell lineage malignancies (more than 90%) express CD19, including NHL, CLL and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Tumor B-cells that have lost the expression of CD20 after anti-CD20 mAb therapy, have been found to maintain the expression of CD19, making CD19 an attractive target in the treatment of B cell malignancies.

In the first quarter of 2019, we commenced a Phase 1 first-in-human, dose-escalation study of TG-1801. This study is evaluating escalating doses of TG-1801 in patients with B-Cell lymphoma. The primary objective of the study is to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose and to characterize the safety profile of TG-1801. Key secondary objectives are to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of TG-1801 and its preliminary anticancer activity. In December 2022, preliminary results from this first-in-human Phase 1 study were presented at the 64th American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting & Exposition. TG-1801 was well tolerated as monotherapy and in combination with ublituximab with no MTD identified and exhibited preliminary signs of efficacy in a variety of relapsed or refractory B-cell lymphomas. 
​
In the first half of 2021, we commenced a second Phase 1 study of TG-1801 in the US to continue dose optimization as monotherapy and in combination with ublituximab. Enrollment in this study is ongoing.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND PATENTS
 ​
General
 ​
Our goal is to obtain, maintain and enforce patent protection for our products, formulations, processes, methods and other proprietary technologies, preserve our trade secrets, and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of other parties, both in the United States and in other countries. Our policy is to actively seek to obtain, where appropriate, the broadest intellectual property protection possible for our product candidates, proprietary information and proprietary technology through a combination of contractual arrangements and patents, both in the U.S. and elsewhere in the world.
 ​
We also depend upon the skills, knowledge and experience of our scientific and technical personnel, as well as that of our advisors, consultants and other contractors. This knowledge, trade secrets, proprietary information and experience we call “know-how.” To help protect our proprietary know-how, which is not patentable, and for inventions for which patents may be difficult to enforce, we rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect our interests. To this end, we seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements with our collaborators, scientific advisors, employees and consultants, and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants. There can be no assurance, however, that we can prevent unauthorized disclosure or use of our trade secrets, know-how and proprietary information despite the existence of confidentiality agreements.
 ​
Patents and other proprietary rights are crucial to the development of our business. We will be able to protect our proprietary technologies from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that our proprietary rights are covered by valid and enforceable patents, supported by regulatory exclusivity or are effectively maintained as trade secrets. We have a number of issued patents and pending patent applications related to our compounds and other technology, but we cannot guarantee the scope of protection of the issued patents, or that such patents will survive a validity or enforceability challenge, or that any of the pending patent applications will issue as patents.
 ​
Generally, patent applications in the U.S. are maintained in secrecy for a period of 18 months or more. Since publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature often lags behind actual discoveries, we are not certain that we were the first to make the inventions covered by each of our issued patents and pending patent applications or that we were the first to file patent applications covering such inventions. The patent positions of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies are highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. To date, there has been no consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims allowed in biotechnology patents. Therefore, we cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be ultimately allowed from our pending patent applications, cannot predict whether the claims in our issued patents will be invalidated or modified through the district courts, Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) proceedings, or reexamination proceedings at the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), and thus cannot predict the enforceability of the claims in our issued patents or the claims that may ultimately issue from our pending patent applications. Third parties or competitors may challenge or circumvent our patents or patent applications, if issued. If our competitors prepare and file patent applications in the U.S. that claim technology also claimed by us in a pending patent application or issued patent, we may have to participate in interference proceedings to determine priority of invention, which could result in substantial cost, even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us. Because of the extensive time required for development, testing and regulatory review of a potential product, it is possible that before we commercialize any of our products, any related patent may expire or remain in existence for only a short period following commercialization, thus reducing any advantage of the patent. However, the life of a patent covering a product that has been subject to regulatory approval may have the ability to be extended through the patent restoration program, although any such extension could still be minimal. If a patent is issued to a third party containing one or more preclusive or conflicting claims, and those claims are ultimately determined to be valid and enforceable, we may be required to obtain a license under such patent or to develop or obtain alternative technology. In the event of litigation involving a third-party claim, an adverse outcome in the litigation could subject us to significant liabilities to such third party, require us to seek a license for the disputed rights from such third party, and/or require us to cease use of the technology. Further, our breach of an existing license or failure to obtain a license to technology required to commercialize our products may seriously harm our business. We also may need to commence litigation to enforce any patents issued to us or to determine the scope and validity of third-party proprietary rights. Litigation would involve substantial costs.

We, or those companies from which we have licensed our drug candidates, file patent applications directed to our drug candidates in an effort to establish intellectual property positions regarding these new chemical entities as well as uses of these new chemical entities in the treatment of diseases. We also file patent applications directed to novel combinations of our drugs together and with drugs developed by others. The intellectual property portfolios for our most advanced drug candidates as of February 2022 are summarized below. Each of these portfolios contains one or more pending patent applications covering our products and product candidates and uses and combinations thereof. For those patents, prosecution is in progress. Prosecution is a lengthy process, during which the scope of the claims initially submitted for examination by the USPTO is often significantly narrowed by the time they issue, if they issue at all. This may be the case with respect to our pending patent applications referred to below.
 ​
BRIUMVI (ublituximab-xiiy)
 ​
Pursuant to our license for ublituximab with LFB Biotechnologies, GTC Biotherapeutics, and LFB/GTC LLC, we have the exclusive commercial rights to a series of patents and patent applications in the U.S. and in multiple countries around the world, as well as a non-exclusive license to additional background patent rights. These patents and patent applications include composition of matter patents relating to the structure and mechanism of action for ublituximab, as well as method of use patents which cover use of ublituximab in combination with various agents and for various therapeutic indications.
 ​
The composition of matter patent for ublituximab has been issued in the U.S., Europe and other jurisdictions, including Australia, Canada, China, Japan, Korea, and India. The expected expiration for the composition of matter patent is 2029 in the U.S. and 2025 in Europe and other non-US jurisdictions, exclusive of patent term extensions, which could result in later expiration dates. We also have a method of use patent on the combination of UKONIQ and ublituximab, which has been issued in the U.S., Europe, and other jurisdictions, including Australia, China, Korea, and Japan, and is pending in other territories. The expected expiration of the method of use patent for the combination of UKONIQ and ublituximab is 2033. In the U.S., the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act provides that BRIUMVI is eligible for 12 years of market exclusivity from the date of BRIUMVI’s U.S. approval. During this 12 year period a biosimilar product that references our BRIUMVI product, cannot be approved.
​
TG-1701 (BTK inhibitor)
 ​
Pursuant to our license agreement with Jiangsu Hengrui Medicine Co. (Hengrui), we have the exclusive commercial rights in the treatment of hematologic cancers to a patent family which covers the composition of matter and proposed methods of use for various therapeutic indications in the U.S. and certain other countries. Patents directed to the compound have granted in the U.S., Europe, and other jurisdictions, including Australia, Canada, Japan, China, and Korea and are expected to expire no sooner than October 2034. Applications are pending in other jurisdictions. 
​
TG-1801 (anti-CD47/anti-CD19 bispecific antibody)
 ​
Pursuant to our joint venture and license option agreement with Novimmune SA (Novimmune), we maintain an exclusive option, exercisable at specific times during development, to license the commercial rights to a series of global patent applications and patents, and the non-exclusive right to certain technology patent applications. Patents directed to a bispecific antibody have issued in Australia, China, Europe, Japan, and Russia and are pending in other jurisdictions including the U.S. Any patents maturing from these pending applications are expected to expire no sooner than December 2033. 
​
Limitations on Patent Rights and Trade Secrets
 ​
The patent rights that we own or have licensed relating to our product candidates are limited in ways that may affect our ability to exclude third parties from competing against us if we obtain regulatory approval to market these product candidates. See “Item 1A – Risk Factors -- Risks Related to the Company’s Intellectual Property.” In addition, the limited patent protection may adversely affect the value of our products or product candidates and may inhibit our ability to obtain a corporate partner at terms acceptable to us, if at all.
 ​
Proof of direct infringement by a competitor for method of use patents can prove difficult because the competitors making and marketing a product typically do not engage in the patented use. Additionally, proof that a competitor contributes to or induces infringement of a patented method of use by another can also prove difficult because an off-label use of a product could prohibit a finding of contributory infringement, and inducement of infringement requires proof of intent by the competitor.
 ​

10



Moreover, physicians may prescribe such a competitive identical product for indications other than the one for which the product has been approved, or off-label indications, that are covered by the applicable patents. Although such off-label prescriptions may directly infringe or contribute to or induce infringement of method of use patents, such infringement is difficult to prevent or prosecute.
 ​
U.S. Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity
 ​
Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of any FDA approval of our drug candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Act. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an Investigational New Drug (IND) application and the submission date of a New Drug Application (NDA) or BLA plus the time between the submission date of an NDA or BLA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent, and within 60 days of a product’s approval. The USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. 
 ​
Also, under the Hatch-Waxman Act, drugs that are new chemical entities (NCEs) are eligible for a five-year period of marketing exclusivity in the United States. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA) or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another drug based on the same active moiety, regardless of whether the drug is intended for the same indication as the original innovator drug or for another indication, where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement to one of the patents listed with the FDA by the innovator NDA holder. The Hatch-Waxman Act also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for a drug product that contains an active moiety that has been previously approved, if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the modification for which the drug received approval on the basis of the new clinical investigations. During this period, FDA will not approve an application filed by a third party for the protected conditions of use that relies on any of the data from the new clinical investigations that was submitted by the innovator company. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA that does not rely on the innovator company’s data. 
 ​
The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 2009 (BPCIA) created an abbreviated pathway for companies to bring biologic drugs to market that are biosimilar to previously approved branded reference products by relying on clinical studies that were performed by the reference product sponsor. The BPCIA also created a 12-year period of data exclusivity for innovator biologics, whereby the FDA cannot approve a biological license application (BLA) for a biosimilar product relying on data for a specific reference product until 12 years after the reference product is first licensed. BLA supplements are not eligible for any additional exclusivity. The objectives of the BPCIA are conceptually similar to those of the Hatch-Waxman Act described above. The implementation of an abbreviated approval pathway for biosimilar products is under the direction of the FDA. Since the enactment of the BPCIA, the FDA has issued guidance on biosimilars, addressing scientific, quality and procedural issues relevant to an abbreviated application for a biosimilar product. As of December 2022, the FDA had approved 40 biosimilar products.
 ​
Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric trial in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a trial.

 LICENSING AGREEMENTS AND COLLABORATIONS
 ​
We have formed strategic alliances with a number of companies for the manufacture and commercialization of our products. Our current key strategic alliances are discussed below.
 ​
BRIUMVI (ublituximab-xiiy)
 ​
LFB Biotechnologies S.A.S, GTC Biotherapeutics, LFB/GTC LLC.
 ​
In January 2012, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with LFB Biotechnologies, GTC Biotherapeutics and LFB/GTC LLC, all wholly-owned subsidiaries of LFB Group, relating to the development of ublituximab (the LFB License Agreement). Under the terms of the LFB License Agreement, we have acquired the exclusive worldwide rights (exclusive of France/Belgium) for the development and commercialization of ublituximab. As of December 31, 2022, we have incurred expenses of approximately $25.0 million related to milestones in accordance with the terms of the LFB License Agreement, $12.0 million of which was incurred in December of 2022 related to a milestone associated with receiving approval of BRIUMVI by the FDA. LFB Group is eligible to receive future payments of approximately $6.0 million, upon our successful achievement of certain regulatory milestones, in addition to royalty payments on net sales of ublituximab at a royalty rate in the high-single digits. The license will terminate on a country-by-country basis upon the expiration of the last licensed patent right or 15 years after the first commercial sale of a product in such country, unless the agreement is earlier terminated (i) by LFB if the Company challenges any of the licensed patent rights, (ii) by either party due to a breach of the agreement, or (iii) by either party in the event of the insolvency of the other party. 
 ​
Ildong Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd.(Ildong)
 ​
In November 2012, we entered into an exclusive (within the territory) sublicense agreement with Ildong relating to the development and commercialization of ublituximab in South Korea and Southeast Asia. Under the terms of the sublicense agreement, Ildong has been granted a royalty bearing, exclusive right, including the right to grant sublicenses, to develop and commercialize ublituximab in South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Philippines, Vietnam, and Myanmar. To date, we have received $2 million in the form of an upfront payment from Ildong and are eligible to receive sales-based milestone payments up to an aggregate of $5 million and royalty payments on net sales of ublituximab at a royalty rate that escalates from mid-teens to high-teens upon approval in South Korea and/or Southeast Asia. The license will terminate on a country by country basis upon the expiration of the last licensed patent right or 15 years after the first commercial sale of a product in such country, unless the agreement is earlier terminated (i) by Ildong if the Company challenges any of the licensed patent rights, (ii) by either party due to a breach of the agreement, or (iii) by either party in the event of the insolvency of the other party.
 ​
TG-1701 (BTK inhibitor)
 ​
In January 2018, we entered into a global exclusive license agreement with Jiangsu Hengrui, to acquire worldwide intellectual property rights, excluding Asia but including Japan, and for the research, development, manufacturing, and commercialization of products containing or comprising of any of Hengrui’s Bruton’s Tyrosine Kinase inhibitors containing the compounds of either TG 1701 (SHR1459 or EBI1459) or TG1702 (SHR1266 or EBI1266). Hengrui is eligible to receive milestone payments totaling approximately $350 million upon and subject to the achievement of certain milestones. Various provisions allow for payments in conjunction with the agreement to be made in cash or our common stock, while others limit the form of payment. In July 2020, we paid Hengrui $2.0 million as part of a milestone in accordance with the license agreement. Royalty payments in the low double digits are due on net sales of licensed products and revenue from sublicenses. Additionally, before we can license, sell, develop, or commercialize ublituximab within China, we must notify Hengrui, giving Hengrui the right of first offer. The agreement allows combinations of TG-1701 or TG-1702 with umbralisib, ublituximab, or U2. Additional combinations may be undertaken under the agreement subject to additional pre-specified payments to Hengrui.
 ​
The term of the agreement expires after the expiration of the last royalty term to expire with respect to any of the patent rights under the agreement. We or Hengrui may terminate the agreement upon notice to the other upon breach without remedy or upon insolvency. In addition, either party may terminate the agreement upon a material breach, after providing the other party with adequate notice and allowing 45 days to cure.

TG-1801 (anti-CD47/anti-CD19 bispecific antibody)
 ​
In June 2018, we entered into a Joint Venture and License Option Agreement with Novimmune to collaborate on the development and commercialization of Novimmune’s novel first-in-class anti-CD47/anti-CD19 bispecific antibody known as TG 1801 (previously NI 1701). The companies will jointly develop the product on a worldwide basis, focusing on indications in the area of hematologic B-cell malignancies. We serve as the primary responsible party for the development, manufacturing and commercialization of the product. Milestone payments will be paid based on early clinical development, and the Company will be responsible for the costs of clinical development of the product through the end of the Phase 2 clinical trials, after which the Company and Novimmune will be jointly responsible for all development and commercialization costs. The Company and Novimmune will each maintain an exclusive option, exercisable at specific times during development, for the Company to license the rights to TG 1801, in which case Novimmune is eligible to receive additional milestone payments totaling approximately $185 million as well as tiered royalties on net sales in the high single to low double digits upon and subject to the achievement of certain milestones.
 ​
UKONIQ (umbralisib)
 ​
In September 2014, we exercised our option to license the global rights to umbralisib, thereby entering into an exclusive licensing agreement (the Umbralisib License) with Rhizen Pharmaceuticals, S A (Rhizen) for the development and commercialization of umbralisib. Rhizen is eligible to receive approval and sales-based milestone payments in the aggregate of approximately $175 million payable. Additionally, Rhizen receives tiered royalties that escalate from high single digits to low double digits on any net sales of umbralisib. The license will terminate on a country-by-country basis upon the expiration of the last licensed patent right or any other exclusivity right in such country, unless the agreement is earlier terminated (i) by us for any reason, or (ii) by either party due to a breach of the agreement.
​
Cosibelimab
 ​
In March 2015, we entered into a global collaboration (the Collaboration Agreement) with Checkpoint Therapeutics, Inc. (Checkpoint) for the development and commercialization of Checkpoint’s anti-PD-L1 and anti-GITR antibody research programs in the field of hematological malignancies with an option to acquire rights in autoimmune diseases. Under the terms of the agreement, we will make development and sales-based milestone payments up to an aggregate of approximately $110 million and will pay a tiered low double-digit royalty on net sales. The royalty term will terminate on a country by country basis upon the later of (i) ten years after the first commercial sale of any applicable licensed product in such country, or (ii) the expiration of the last-to-expire patent containing a valid claim to any licensed product in such country. 
 ​
COMPETITION
 ​
Competition in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries is intense. Our competitors include pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies, as well as universities and public and private research institutions. In addition, companies that are active in different but related fields represent substantial competition for us. Many of our competitors have significantly greater capital resources, larger research and development staffs and facilities and greater experience in drug development, regulation, manufacturing and marketing than we do. These organizations also compete with us to recruit qualified personnel, attract partners for joint ventures or other collaborations, and license technologies that are competitive with ours. To compete successfully in this industry, we must identify novel and unique drugs or methods of treatment and then complete the development of those drugs as treatments in advance of our competitors.
 ​
The drugs that we are attempting to develop will have to compete with existing therapies. In addition, a large number of companies are pursuing the development of pharmaceuticals that target the same diseases and conditions that we are targeting. Some of these potential competing drugs are further advanced in development than our drug candidates and may be commercialized earlier. The resulting changes in standard of care can impact the likelihood of regulatory accelerated approval opportunities for our drug candidates.
 ​
For BRIUMVI, there are a number of established therapies with which we will compete:
 ​

● | We expect BRIUMVI will primarily compete against other iv CD20-targeted agents, while the group of CD20-targeted agents will also compete broadly against a number of already approved MS therapies. Currently, there is one other approved intravenously delivered anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody ocrelizumab (Roche Holdings AG). In addition, while we believe not directly competitive, there is also a subcutaneous anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody approved for MS, ofatumumab (Novartis AG).

TG-1701 and TG-1801 if approved will also face competition from drugs on the market and under development in the same therapeutic class as each of those drugs.

 ​
SUPPLY AND MANUFACTURING
 ​
We have limited experience in manufacturing products for clinical or commercial purposes. We currently do not have any manufacturing capabilities of our own. We have established a contract manufacturing relationship for the commercial supply of BRIUMVI with Samsung Biologics. As with any supply program, obtaining materials of sufficient quality and quantity to meet the requirements of the market demand for BRIUMVI and our ublituximab development programs cannot be guaranteed and we cannot ensure that we will be successful in this endeavor.
​
To the extent possible and commercially practicable, we plan to develop back-up strategies for raw materials, manufacturing and testing services for our commercial products. Given the long lead times and cost of establishing additional commercial manufacturing sites we expect that we will rely on single contract manufacturers to produce our commercial products under current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, regulations for many years. Our commercial manufacturing partners have a limited number of facilities in which our product candidates can be produced and will have limited experience in manufacturing our product candidates in quantities sufficient for commercialization. Our third-party manufacturers will have other clients and may have other priorities that could affect their ability to perform the work satisfactorily and/or on a timely basis. Both of these occurrences would be beyond our control. 
 ​
We expect to similarly rely on contract manufacturing relationships for any products that we may in-license or acquire in the future. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully contract with such manufacturers on terms acceptable to us, or at all.
 ​
Contract manufacturers are subject to ongoing periodic and unannounced inspections by the FDA, the Drug Enforcement Administration if applicable, and corresponding state agencies to ensure strict compliance with cGMP and other state and federal regulations. Where manufactured products are globally registered, similar regulatory inspection burdens are applicable from each and every marketed territory. If our manufacturing partners are inspected and deemed out of compliance with cGMPs, product recalls could result, inventory could be destroyed, production could be stopped, and supplies could be delayed or otherwise disrupted.
 ​
If we need to change manufacturers after commercialization, the FDA and corresponding foreign regulatory agencies may need to approve these new manufacturers in advance, which will involve testing, regulatory submissions, and additional inspections to ensure compliance with FDA regulations and standards and may require significant lead times and delay. Furthermore, switching manufacturers may be difficult because the number of potential manufacturers is limited. It may be difficult or impossible for us to find a replacement manufacturer quickly or on terms acceptable to us, or at all.
 ​
GOVERNMENT AND INDUSTRY REGULATION
 ​
Numerous governmental authorities, principally the FDA and corresponding state and foreign regulatory agencies, impose substantial regulations upon the clinical development, manufacture and marketing of our product candidates, as well as our ongoing research and development activities. We, along with our third-party contractors, will be required to navigate the various pre- and post-approval requirements of the governing regulatory agencies of the jurisdictions in which we wish to conduct clinical studies or market our product candidates. None of our product candidates, except BRIUMVI, are approved for sale in any market in which we have marketing rights. Before marketing in the U.S., any drug that we develop must undergo rigorous pre-clinical testing and clinical trials and an extensive regulatory review and approval process implemented by the FDA under the FDCA and, in the case of biologics, the Public Health Service Act. The FDA regulates, among other things, the pre-clinical and clinical testing, safety, efficacy, approval, manufacturing, quality control and assurance, record keeping, pharmacovigilance and adverse event reporting, packaging, labeling, storage, advertising, promotion, import and export, sale and distribution of biopharmaceutical products. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
 ​

14



Product Development and Applications for Marketing Authorization
 ​
The regulatory review and approval process is lengthy, expensive, and uncertain. We are required to submit extensive pre-clinical and clinical data and supporting information to the FDA for each indication or use to establish a drug candidate’s safety and efficacy before we can secure FDA approval to market or sell a product in the U.S. The approval process takes many years, requires the expenditure of substantial resources, and may involve ongoing requirements for post-marketing studies or surveillance. Before commencing clinical trials in humans, we must submit an IND to the FDA containing, among other things, pre-clinical data, chemistry, manufacturing and control information, and an investigative plan. Our submission of an IND may not result in FDA authorization to commence a clinical trial.
 ​
For purposes of clinical development and to pursue NDA or BLA approval, clinical trials are typically conducted in the following sequential phases:
​

● | Phase 1: The drug is administered to a small group of humans, either healthy volunteers or patients, to test for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, excretion, and clinical pharmacology.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 2: Studies are conducted on more patients to assess the product's efficacy, to ascertain dose tolerance and the optimal dose range, and to gather additional data relating to safety and potential adverse events.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 3: Studies establish safety and efficacy in an expanded patient population.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 4: The FDA may require Phase 4 post-marketing studies to find out more about the drug’s long-term risks, benefits, and optimal use, or to test the drug in different populations.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
Clinical testing must meet requirements for institutional review board oversight, informed consent and good clinical practices, and must be conducted pursuant to an IND, unless exempted. In addition, the FDA, equivalent foreign regulatory authority, or a data safety monitoring committee for a trial may place a clinical trial on hold or terminate it if it concludes that subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk, or for futility. Any drug is likely to produce some toxicity or undesirable side effects in animals and in humans when administered at sufficiently high doses and/or for a sufficiently long period of time. Unacceptable toxicity or side effects may occur at any dose level at any time in studies in animals designed to identify unacceptable effects of a drug candidate, known as toxicological studies, or clinical trials of drug candidates. The appearance of any unacceptable toxicity or side effect could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt, limit, delay or abort the development of any of our drug candidates and could ultimately prevent approval by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities for any or all targeted indications.
​
The length of time necessary to complete clinical trials varies significantly and may be difficult to predict. Clinical results are frequently susceptible to varying interpretations that may delay, limit or prevent regulatory approvals. Additional factors that can cause delay or termination of our clinical trials, or that may increase the costs of these trials, include: 
​

● | slow patient enrollment due to the nature of the clinical trial plan, the proximity of patients to clinical sites, the eligibility criteria for participation in the study or other factors;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | inadequately trained or insufficient personnel at the study site to assist in overseeing and monitoring clinical trials or delays in approvals from a study site’s review board;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | longer treatment time required to demonstrate efficacy or determine the appropriate product dose;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | insufficient supply of the drug candidates;
--+--------------------------------------------


● | adverse medical events or side effects in treated patients; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


● | ineffectiveness of the drug candidates.
--+----------------------------------------

 ​
For clinical trials that are intended to form the basis of a new drug or biologics license application for approval, sponsors of drugs may apply for an SPA from the FDA, by which the FDA provides official evaluation and written guidance on the design and size of proposed protocols. While obtaining an SPA provides some assurance the design of a trial should be sufficient for approval, the final marketing approval depends on the results of efficacy, the adverse event profile and an evaluation of the benefit/risk of treatment demonstrated in the Phase 3 trial. The SPA agreement may only be changed through a written agreement between the sponsor and the FDA, or if the FDA becomes aware of a substantial scientific issue essential to product safety or efficacy.
 ​

15



The FDA may permit expedited development, evaluation, and marketing of new therapies intended to treat persons with serious or life-threatening conditions for which there is an unmet medical need under its expedited drug development programs. A sponsor can apply for Fast Track designation at the time of submission of an IND, or at any time prior to receiving marketing approval of the new drug application, or NDA. To receive Fast Track designation, an applicant must demonstrate:
​

● | that the drug is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | that nonclinical or clinical data demonstrate the potential to address an unmet medical need.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
The FDA must respond to a request for Fast Track designation within 60 calendar days of receipt of the request. Over the course of drug development, a product in a Fast Track development program must continue to meet the criteria for Fast Track designation. Sponsors of products in Fast Track drug development programs must be in regular contact with the reviewing division of the FDA to ensure that the evidence necessary to support marketing approval will be developed and presented in a format conducive to an efficient review. Sponsors of products in Fast Track drug development programs are also permitted to submit portions of an NDA or BLA to the FDA on a rolling basis where the FDA may consider reviewing portions of a marketing application before the sponsor submits the complete application.
​
In addition, sponsors may also apply to the FDA for Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD). The procedures and requirements for BTD are similar to those required for Fast Track such that the Breakthrough Therapy Designation is intended to expedite the development and review of a potential new drug for serious or life-threatening diseases, however, with BTD, there is a further requirement that the sponsor present “preliminary clinical evidence” which “indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development.” The designation of a drug as a Breakthrough Therapy was enacted as part of the 2012 Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act.
​
Sponsors of drugs granted Fast Track or breakthrough therapy designation also may seek approval under the FDA’s accelerated approval regulations. Under this authority, the FDA may grant marketing approval for a new drug product on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the drug product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely, based on epidemiologic, therapeutic, pathophysiologic, or other evidence, to predict clinical benefit or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity. To obtain accelerated approval a sponsor must be able to demonstrate the drug candidate treats a serious condition, provides a meaningful advantage over other available therapies, and demonstrates an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. Many companies have filed for accelerated approval and have subsequently failed to obtain such approval for a variety of reasons. To the extent a product does obtain an accelerated approval, such approval will be subject to the requirement that the applicant study the drug further in a post-marketing confirmatory clinical trial to verify and describe its clinical benefit where there is uncertainty as to the relation of the surrogate endpoint to clinical benefit or uncertainty as to the relation of the observed clinical benefit to ultimate outcome. Accelerated approval is sometimes referred to as conditional approval because if the results of these confirmatory clinical trials fail to verify clinical benefit, the FDA has the right to remove the drug from the market and has done so in the recent past. Post-marketing confirmation studies are usually underway at the time an applicant files the NDA. When required to be conducted, such post-marketing confirmation studies must also be adequate and well-controlled. The applicant must carry out any such post-marketing confirmation studies with due diligence. Completing the required post-approval clinical studies as designed can be difficult, especially as the treatment landscape evolves. 
​
It is also becoming more common for the FDA to request a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, as part of an NDA/BLA. The REMS plan contains post-market obligations of the sponsor to train prescribing physicians, monitor off-label drug use, and conduct Phase 4 follow-up studies and registries to ensure the continued safe use of the drug.
​
The NDA and BLA review process also generally includes a pre-approval inspection, or PAI, to assess the manufacturing facilities and relevant processes and data for compliance, and readiness for commercial manufacture in accordance with cGMPs. Among the conditions of approval is the requirement that a manufacturer’s quality systems and manufacturing procedures conform to cGMP. Even when product approval is received, manufacturers must expend significant time, money and effort to ensure continued compliance, and the FDA conducts periodic surveillance inspections to monitor the manufacturing process and drug quality and evaluate whether the manufacturers are in compliance. It may be difficult for our manufacturers or us to comply with the applicable cGMP, as interpreted by the FDA, and other FDA regulatory requirements. If we, or our contract manufacturers, fail to comply, then the FDA may not allow us to market products that have been affected by the failure. Many drug approvals have been delayed due to issues at contract manufacturing facilities. If we were to experience any such delay that would negatively impact our business and timeline to commercialization of any of our drug candidates affected by such manufacturing issue.
​

16



Post-Approval Requirements
​
Any products for which we receive FDA approval are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA and other federal and state regulators on a wide range of matters, including, among other things cGMPs and product quality, pharmacovigilance and reporting of adverse events, product distribution requirements, fulfilling post-marketing or confirmatory study or REMS commitments, and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements. Violations of the FDCA or other post-approval regulatory requirements may result in agency enforcement actions, including withdrawal of approval, recall, seizure of products, warning letters, injunctions, fines and/or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on our business.
​
The FDA promotion and advertising requirements applicable to marketed products include, among other things, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, restrictions against promoting products for uses or in patient populations that are not either described in the product’s approved indications and uses or otherwise consistent with the FDA-approved product labeling, limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, rules regarding communication of health care economic information regarding biopharmaceutical products to payors and formularies, and requirements for promotional activities involving the internet. Drugs whose review was accelerated may carry additional requirements on marketing activities, including the requirement that all promotional materials are pre-submitted to the FDA.
 ​
After product approval, quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to applicable manufacturing requirements. FDA regulations require among other things, quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation and the obligation to investigate and correct any deviations from cGMPs. Manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved products are required to register their establishments and list their products with the FDA and certain state agencies. Manufacturers and their third-party contractors may be subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for assessment of compliance with cGMPs and other applicable laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the areas of production and quality control to maintain quality control and manufacturing compliance. Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, including, among other things, withdrawal of approval, recall or withdrawal of the product from the market. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval or notification before being implemented. Other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and claims to the product labeling, are also subject to further FDA review and approval.
​
Marketed products must meet the requirements of the Drug Supply Chain Security Act, or DSCSA, which regulates the commercial distribution of prescription drug products at the federal level. The DSCSA sets certain standards for federal or state registration, requires tracing of products through the pharmaceutical distribution supply chain, and imposes other requirements on entities in the supply chain, including manufacturers and repackagers, wholesale distributors, third-party logistics providers, and dispensers. The DSCSA requirements, development of standards, and the system for product tracing have been and will continue to be phased in per the DSCSA implementation timeline established by the FDA. 
​
In addition, the post-marketing discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements can have negative consequences, including adverse publicity, judicial or administrative enforcement, warning letters from the FDA, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, and civil or criminal penalties, among others. Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a product’s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and may require the implementation of other risk management measures. 
​
From time to time, legislation is drafted, introduced and passed in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the approval, manufacturing and marketing of products regulated by the FDA. In addition to new legislation, FDA regulations, guidance documents, and policies are often revised or reinterpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business. It is impossible to predict whether further legislative or FDA regulation or policy changes will be enacted or implemented and what the impact of such changes, if any, may be.
​

Should we wish to market our products outside the U.S., we must receive marketing authorization from the appropriate foreign regulatory authorities. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, marketing authorization, pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. Importantly, the level of evidence of efficacy and safety necessary to apply for marketing authorization for a drug candidate differs from country to country. In particular, clinical trial endpoints, and the level of clinical evidence that may support, for example, an accelerated approval filing with the FDA, may be insufficient to file for marketing applications outside of the U.S. At present, companies are typically required to apply for foreign marketing authorizations at a national level. However, within the European Union, centralized registration procedures are available to companies wishing to market a product across the European Union member states. Typically, if the regulatory authority is satisfied that a company has presented adequate evidence of safety, quality and efficacy, then the regulatory authority will grant a marketing authorization. This foreign regulatory approval process, however, involves risks similar or identical to the risks associated with FDA approval discussed above, and therefore we cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain the appropriate marketing authorization for any product in any particular country.
​
Failure to comply with applicable federal, state and foreign laws and regulations would likely have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, federal, state and foreign laws and regulations regarding the manufacture and sale of new drugs are subject to future changes. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature, effect or extent of adverse governmental regulation that might arise from future legislative or administrative action, either in the U.S. or abroad.
 ​
Coverage and Reimbursement
 ​
Sales of our drugs will depend, in part, on the extent to which our drugs will be covered by third-party payors, such as government health programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. These third-party payors are increasingly reducing reimbursements for medical drugs and services. In addition, the containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of foreign and U.S. federal and state governments, and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement, importation, and requirements for substitution of generic drugs. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net revenue and results. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for our drug candidates, if approved, or a decision by a third-party payor to not cover our drug candidates could reduce physician usage of such drugs and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition.
 ​
In the U.S., the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively the Affordable Care Act, enacted in March 2010, has had a significant impact on the health care industry. The Affordable Care Act expanded coverage for the uninsured while at the same time containing overall healthcare costs. With regard to pharmaceutical products, the Affordable Care Act, among other things, created a new average manufacturer price definition under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected and not generally dispensed through the retail channel, increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and extended the rebate program to individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, established annual fees and taxes on manufacturers of certain branded prescription drugs, and a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period (subsequent legislation increased this to 70% effective as of January 1, 2019), as a condition for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D.
 ​
Since the enactment of the Affordable Care Act, certain provisions of the Affordable Care Act have been subject to judicial challenges as well as efforts to repeal or replace them or to alter their interpretation or implementation. For example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted on December 22, 2017, eliminated the shared responsibility payment for individuals who fail to maintain minimum essential coverage under section 5000A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, commonly referred to as the individual mandate, effective January 1, 2019. Although litigation and legislation over the Affordable Care Act are likely to continue, with unpredictable and uncertain results, we expect that the Biden administration may seek to expand and strengthen the Affordable Care Act. 
​

On August 16, 2022, President Biden signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the Act), which, among other provisions, included several measures intended to lower the cost of prescription drugs and related healthcare reforms. Specifically, the Act authorizes and directs the Department of Health and Human Services (the DHHS) to set drug price caps for certain high-cost Medicare Part B and Part D qualified drugs, with the initial list of drugs to be selected by September 1, 2023, and the first year of maximum price applicability to begin in 2026. The Act further authorizes the DHHS to penalize pharmaceutical manufacturers that increase the price of certain Medicare Part B and Part D drugs faster than the rate of inflation. Finally, the Act creates significant changes to the Medicare Part D benefit design by capping Part D beneficiaries’ annual out-of-pocket spending at $2,000 beginning in 2025. We cannot be sure whether additional or related legislation or rulemaking will be issued or enacted, or what impact, if any, such changes will have on the profitability of any of our drug candidates, if approved for commercial use, in the future.
 ​
At the state level, individual states are increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control prescription drug pricing, including price and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, authorizing importation of prescription drugs from other countries. In addition, regional health care authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other health care programs. These measures could reduce the ultimate demand for our products or put pressure on our product pricing. We expect that additional state healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, which could limit the amounts that state governments will pay for healthcare products and services and result in additional pricing pressures.
 ​
 In addition, in some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a prescription drug must be approved before the drug may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the United Kingdom and many European Union member states have robust health technology assessment processes to determine pricing and reimbursement for pharmaceuticals through their national health insurance system. Many European Union members states also include either direct or indirect price referencing, or other price control mechanisms, in determining the price of a pharmaceutical in their market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical drugs will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products. Historically, drugs launched in the European Union do not follow price structures of the U.S. and generally tend to be significantly lower.
 ​
Other U.S. Healthcare Laws
 ​
We may also be subject to healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and the states and foreign governments where we may market our product candidates, if approved. These laws include, without limitation: state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, privacy and security laws; laws governing interactions with healthcare professionals and related transparency requirements (such as the federal Sunshine Act and a range of state biopharmaceutical marketing and transparency laws); and requirements for manufacturers to report certain calculated product prices to the government or provide certain discounts or rebates to government authorities or private entities, often as a condition of reimbursement under government healthcare programs. The compliance and enforcement landscape is informed by government enforcement precedent and settlement history, Advisory Opinions, and Special Fraud Alerts. The risks we face and our approach to compliance may evolve over time in light of these types of developments. The potential safe harbors available for, example, relative to the Anti-Kickback Statute, are subject to change through legislative and regulatory action, and we may decide to adjust our business practices or be subject to heightened scrutiny as a result. 
 ​
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person from knowingly and willfully offering, soliciting, receiving or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an individual, for an item or service or the purchasing or ordering of a good or service, for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The government has enforced the Anti-Kickback Statute to reach large settlements with healthcare companies based on research, consulting and other financial arrangements with physicians that the government alleged were not based on the provision of bona fide services and were intended as an inducement or reward. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act. The majority of states also have anti-kickback laws, which establish similar prohibitions and in some cases may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers.
 ​

19



In addition, the civil False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, knowingly presenting or causing the presentation of a false, fictitious or fraudulent claim for payment to the U.S. government. Actions under the False Claims Act may be brought by the Attorney General or as a qui tam action by a private individual in the name of the government. Violations of the False Claims Act can result in very significant monetary penalties and treble damages. The federal government is using the False Claims Act, and the accompanying threat of significant liability, in its investigation and prosecution of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies throughout the U.S., for example, in connection with the promotion of products for unapproved uses and other sales and marketing practices. The government has obtained multi-million and multi-billion dollar settlements under the False Claims Act in addition to individual criminal convictions under applicable criminal statutes. Given the significant size of actual and potential settlements, it is expected that the government will continue to devote substantial resources to investigating healthcare providers’ and manufacturers’ compliance with applicable fraud and abuse laws.
​
The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, (HIPAA), also created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
​
There has also been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians and other healthcare providers. The Affordable Care Act, among other things, imposes reporting requirements on drug manufacturers for payments made by them to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of $150,000 per year (or up to an aggregate of $1 million per year for “knowing failures”), for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests that are not timely, accurately and completely reported in an annual submission. Drug manufacturers are required to submit annual reports to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, which publicly posts the data on its website. Effective January 1, 2022, these reporting obligations extend to include transfers of value made to certain non-physician providers such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners. Certain states also mandate implementation of compliance programs, impose restrictions on drug manufacturer marketing practices and/or require the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to physicians.
​
We may also be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology and Clinical Health Act, (HITECH), and their respective implementing regulations, including the final omnibus rule published on January 25, 2013, imposes specified requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to “business associates,” defined as independent contractors or agents of covered entities that create, receive, maintain or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, according to the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, (FTC), failing to take appropriate steps to keep consumers' personal information secure constitutes unfair acts or practices in or affecting commerce in violation of Section 5(a) of the Federal Trade Commission Act. The FTC expects a company's data security measures to be reasonable and appropriate in light of the sensitivity and volume of consumer information it holds, the size and complexity of its business, and the cost of available tools to improve security and reduce vulnerabilities. Medical data is considered sensitive data that merits stronger safeguards. The FTC's guidance for appropriately securing consumers' personal information is similar to what is required under HIPAA.

In addition, we may be subject to state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers, and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways, thus complicating compliance efforts. For example, the California Consumer Protection Act, (CCPA), which went into effect on January 1, 2020, established a privacy framework for covered businesses by creating an expanded definition of personal information, data privacy rights for consumers in California, and a potentially severe statutory damages framework for violations of the CCPA and for businesses that fail to implement reasonable security procedures and practices to prevent data breaches. The CCPA was recently amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA), expanding certain consumer rights such as the right to know. It remains unclear what, if any, additional modifications will be made to these laws by the California legislature or how these laws will be interpreted and enforced. The potential effects of the CCPA and CPRA are significant and may cause us to incur substantial costs and expenses to comply.

For other countries outside of the U.S. and the European Union, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, drug licensing, sales and marketing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
 ​
European Union member states, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, and other foreign jurisdictions have adopted data protection laws and regulations, which impose significant compliance obligations. In the European Union and the United Kingdom, the collection and use of personal data, including clinical trial data, is governed by the provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR. The GDPR, together with national legislation, regulations and guidelines of the European Union member states and the United Kingdom governing the processing of personal data, impose strict obligations and restrictions on the ability to collect, analyze and transfer personal data, including health data from clinical trials and adverse event reporting. In particular, these obligations and restrictions concern the consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, the information provided to the individuals, the transfer of personal data out of the European Union or the United Kingdom, security breach notifications, security and confidentiality of the personal data and imposition of substantial potential fines for breaches of the data protection obligations. Compliance with the GDPR is a rigorous and time-intensive process that may increase the cost of doing business to ensure full compliance. Furthermore, European data protection authorities may interpret the GDPR and national laws differently and impose additional requirements, which add to the complexity of processing personal data in or from the European Union or United Kingdom.
