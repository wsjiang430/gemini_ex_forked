 Item 1. Business
 Overview
 We are a biomedical products company focused on developing and commercializing the INTERCEPT Blood System to enhance blood safety. The INTERCEPT Blood System, which is based on our proprietary technology for controlling biological replication, is designed to reduce blood-borne pathogens in donated blood components intended for transfusion.
Our INTERCEPT Blood System is intended for use with blood components and certain of their derivatives: platelets, plasma, red blood cells and to produce INTERCEPT Fibrinogen Complex, or IFC, and pathogen reduced plasma, cryoprecipitate reduced. The INTERCEPT Blood System for platelets, or platelet system, and the INTERCEPT Blood System for plasma, or plasma system, have received a broad range of regulatory approvals and certification, including but not limited to FDA approval in the U.S., CE Certificates of Conformity delivered in accordance with the Medical Devices Directive 93/42/EEC, or MDD, permitting us to affix the CE Mark to our products and place them on the market in the European Union in accordance with the transitional provisions of the Medical Devices Regulation 2017/745, or MDR, and other jurisdictions that recognize the CE Mark, and are being marketed and sold in a number of countries around the world, including the U.S., certain countries in Europe, the Commonwealth of Independent States, or CIS, the Middle East, and Latin America and selected countries in other regions of the world. Additionally, we have received FDA approval for the INTERCEPT Blood System for Cryoprecipitation. The INTERCEPT Blood System for Cryoprecipitation uses our plasma system to produce IFC for the treatment and control of bleeding, including massive hemorrhage, associated with fibrinogen deficiency. In addition, the INTERCEPT Blood System for Cryoprecipitation is used to produce pathogen reduced plasma, cryoprecipitate reduced. We currently sell the platelet and plasma systems using our direct sales force and through distributors and sell IFC or disposable kits to manufacture IFC in the U.S. using our direct sales force. If we are unable to gain widespread commercial adoption in markets where our blood safety products are approved for commercialization, including in the U.S., we will have difficulties achieving profitability.


The INTERCEPT Blood System for red blood cells, or the red blood cell system, is currently in development. In the U.S., we are currently conducting two Phase 3 clinical trials - the RedeS study, to assess the safety and efficacy of INTERCEPT-treated red blood cells when compared to conventional, un-treated, red blood cells and the ReCePI study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of INTERCEPT-treated red blood cells in patients requiring transfusion for acute blood loss during surgery. In the European Union, or EU, we completed the resubmission of our application for a CE Certificate of Conformity under the new Medical Device Regulation 2017/745, or MDR, in June 2021; however, we do not expect an approval decision will occur for at least another 12 months, if ever.
 Contribution margins from our sales is expected to be less than the cost of our operating expenses. In order to successfully commercialize all of our products and product candidates, we will be required to conduct significant research, development, preclinical and clinical evaluation, commercialization and regulatory compliance activities for our products and product candidates, which, together with anticipated increased selling, general and administrative expenses, are expected to result in substantial operating losses. Accordingly, we may never achieve a profitable level of operations in the future.
 We were incorporated in California in 1991 and reincorporated in Delaware in 1996. Our wholly-owned subsidiary, Cerus Europe B.V., was formed in the Netherlands in 2006. Information regarding our revenues, net losses, and total assets for the last three fiscal years can be found in the consolidated financial statements and related notes found elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 Product Development
 Background
 The INTERCEPT Blood System is designed to broadly target and inactivate blood-borne pathogens, such as viruses (for example, HIV, West Nile, SARS, hepatitis B and C), bacteria and parasites, as well as potentially harmful white blood cells, while preserving the therapeutic properties of platelet, plasma, red blood cell and IFC transfusion products. The INTERCEPT Blood System has been shown to inactivate a broad array of pathogens and has the potential to reduce the risk of transfusion related transmission of pathogens for which testing is not completely effective, is not available or is not performed. We believe that the INTERCEPT Blood System also has the potential to inactivate most new pathogens before they are identified and before tests are developed and adopted commercially to detect their presence in donated blood.

INTERCEPT Blood System for Platelets, Plasma and Cryoprecipitation
 The platelet system and plasma system are designed to inactivate blood-borne pathogens in platelets and plasma donated for transfusion. Both systems received a CE Certificate of Conformity permitting us to affix the CE Mark in the European Economic Area, or EEA, and FDA approval in the U.S. and are currently marketed and sold in a number of countries around the world including the U.S., countries in Europe, the CIS, the Middle East and selected countries in other regions of the world. Separate approvals for use of INTERCEPT-treated platelet and plasma products have been obtained in France and Switzerland. In Germany and Austria, where approvals must be obtained by individual blood centers for use of INTERCEPT-treated platelets and plasma, several centers have obtained such approvals for use of INTERCEPT-treated platelets and one center has obtained such approval for use of INTERCEPT-treated plasma. Many countries outside of the European Union recognize the CE Mark and have varying additional administrative or regulatory processes that must be completed before the platelet system or plasma system can be made commercially available. In general, these processes do not require additional clinical trials. Regardless, some potential customers may desire to conduct their own clinical studies before adopting the platelet system or plasma system. We received CE Certificates of Conformity in accordance with the MDD for our INTERCEPT platelet and plasma systems, which currently will expire in May 2024. European Union regulators have enacted legislation that requires all medical devices to comply with the requirements of the new MDR, including the related transitional provisions. To continue to place our platelet and plasma systems on the European Union market, we will need to obtain new CE Certificates of Conformity under the new MDR. We have submitted our application and technical documentation for CE Certificates of Conformity under the MDR for both our INTERCEPT platelet and plasma systems which are currently under review by our Notified Body. The FDA has approved the platelet system for ex vivo preparation of pathogen-reduced apheresis platelet components collected and stored in 100% plasma or InterSol in order to reduce the risk of transfusion-transmitted infection, or TTI, including sepsis, and as an alternative to gamma irradiation for prevention of transfusion-associated graft versus host disease. In 2021, we completed one of the two post-approval studies that FDA required as part of its approval of the platelet system - a haemovigilance study evaluating the incidence of acute lung injury following transfusion of INTERCEPT-treated platelets. The second required post-approval study - a recovery study of platelets treated with the platelet system - is currently in progress. The FDA has also approved the plasma system for ex vivo preparation of plasma in order to reduce the risk of TTI when treating patients requiring therapeutic plasma transfusion.
We have also received FDA approval for the INTERCEPT Blood System for Cryoprecipitation, which uses our plasma system to produce IFC for the treatment and control of bleeding, including massive hemorrhage, associated with fibrinogen deficiency and to produce pathogen reduced plasma, cryoprecipitate reduced.
We expect our commercial efforts in 2023 will continue to largely be focused on enabling blood centers that are using INTERCEPT to increase the number of platelet and plasma units produced and made available to patients. In addition we plan to sell the INTERCEPT Blood System for Cryoprecipitation to certain blood center customers and to sell IFC to hospital customers. In addition, we will continue to develop awareness of INTERCEPT’s product profile relative to other platelet and plasma products, including conventional, un-treated components. To enable broader patient access to IFC in the U.S., U.S.-based blood centers need to complete process validations and obtain site-specific licenses from the FDA Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, or CBER, before IFC can be made available to hospital customers outside of the state of IFC production. We have contracted with several blood centers to produce IFC for us which we plan to sell directly to hospitals. All of the blood centers that we have contracted with to produce IFC for us have submitted for their interstate licenses, or BLAs. Until BLAs are more broadly obtained, we expect that our direct sales of IFC will be limited. Further, the hospital customers of blood centers may need to complete changes to their administrative processes of generating internal tracking codes to integrate INTERCEPT-treated products into their inventories prior to receiving INTERCEPT-treated components. In addition, we estimate that the majority of platelets used in the U.S. are collected by apheresis, which is part of our FDA-approved label for the platelet system, though a significant minority are prepared from pooled random donor platelets derived from whole blood collections. While available in Europe and other regions around the world, in order to gain FDA approval for a pathogen reduction system compatible with triple dose collections and random donor platelets, we will need to perform additional product development and testing, including additional clinical trials, and will need to obtain FDA approval of a PMA supplement. We do not currently have plans to pursue these configurations. In addition, we may pursue development projects for other plasma derived biological products, which may require the submission and approval of additional PMA supplements for the plasma system. These development activities will be costly and may not be successful should we choose to pursue them. Our failure to seek and obtain FDA and foreign regulatory approvals or certification of new configurations could limit revenues from sales of our products.
INTERCEPT Blood System for Red Blood Cells
 The red blood cell system is designed to inactivate blood-borne pathogens in red blood cells intended for transfusion. We completed a series of in vitro and in vivo tests with the red blood cell system, including successfully completing recovery and survival studies measuring red cell recovery twenty-four hours after transfusion. Previously, we terminated Phase 3 clinical trials for acute and chronic anemia using a prior generation of the red blood cell system due to the detection of antibody reactivity to INTERCEPT-treated red blood cells, or RBCs, in two patients in the trial for chronic anemia. The antibody eventually cleared and the subjects had no adverse health consequences. After unblinding the data from the original Phase 3 clinical trials, we found that we had met the primary endpoint in the clinical trial for acute anemia. We evaluated the antibodies detected and developed process changes to diminish the likelihood of antibody reactivity in RBCs treated with our modified process. We have since successfully completed Phase 3 clinical trials of the red

blood cell system for subjects with acute and chronic anemia patients to support an application for a CE Certificate of Conformity. We filed our application for a CE Certificate of Conformity for the red blood cell system in December 2018 under the Medical Device Directive, or MDD, and in June 2021, we completed the application for a CE Certificate of Conformity under the new MDR. We have been notified that all four modules of our submission have been reviewed by our notified body, TÜV SÜD. Furthermore, the Dutch Medical Evaluation Board (CBG), the competent authority for our red blood cell product, has reviewed the relevant sections of our submission and have asked numerous questions. We will need to satisfactorily respond to those questions timely and with satisfactory data before our products will be considered for certification. We cannot predict when, if ever, we will be able to answer those questions and supply the required data or whether a decision concerning certification will occur. See also the risk factor entitled “The red blood cell system is currently in development and may never receive any marketing approvals or CE Certificate of Conformity” under “Item 1A—Risk Factors” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information with respect timing of the ultimate decision on our application for a CE Certificate of Conformity.
 We previously completed a European Phase 3 clinical trial of RBCs treated with the INTERCEPT Blood System for acute anemia in cardiovascular surgery subjects announced that the trial met its primary endpoint, with preliminary analysis demonstrating that the mean hemoglobin content (53.1g) of INTERCEPT-treated RBCs, on day 35 of storage met the protocol-defined criteria for equivalence based on the inferiority margin of 5g compared to conventional RBCs (55.8g). The randomized, double-blind, controlled, multi-center Phase 3 clinical trial of the red blood cell system evaluated the efficacy of the red blood cell system to process RBCs with quality and mean hemoglobin content (>40 g) suitable to support transfusion according to the European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines. The blood components were transfused to 51 cardiovascular surgery subjects at two German clinical trial sites to evaluate transfusion efficacy and overall safety. There were no clinically relevant trends in severe or serious treatment related adverse events by system organ class. The observed adverse events were within the expected spectrum of co-morbidity and mortality for subjects of similar age and with advanced cardiovascular diseases undergoing cardiovascular surgery requiring red cell transfusion. No subjects exhibited an immune response to INTERCEPT-treated RBCs. Additionally, we previously announced that the European Phase 3 clinical trial of chronic anemia evaluating INTERCEPT-treated RBCs in thalassemia subjects met its primary efficacy and safety endpoints. Regardless of the potential sufficiency of clinical data required to receive a CE Certificate of Conformity, we understand that we will need to generate additional safety data from commercial use in order to achieve broad market acceptance, if ever certified.
In the U.S., we successfully completed a Phase 2 recovery and lifespan study. Subsequently, we initiated a double-blind Phase 3 clinical study, known as the RedeS study, to assess the safety and efficacy of INTERCEPT-treated RBCs when compared to conventional RBCs in regions impacted by the Zika virus epidemic. The RedeS study was expanded to other areas at risk for transfusion-transmitted infections. The FDA has agreed to modify the criteria for a clinical pause if we see three or more treatment emergent antibodies with amustaline specificity without evidence of hemolysis in patients receiving INTERCEPT-treated RBCs in our RedeS study. We will now be allowed to continue study enrollment for the RedeS study while we investigate the clinical significance of the antibodies. If we determine that there is no clinical significance and no impact on patients, then there will be no impact on study enrollment. If treatment emergent antibody reactions associated with hemolysis are observed in any of our Phase 3 trials, the FDA will require us to place a clinical hold and we will need to investigate the underlying cause. Such investigations may be difficult for us to assess imputability which may lead to a complete halt of the clinical trial, may irreparably harm our red blood cell product’s reputation and may force us to suspend or terminate development activities related to the red blood cell system in the U.S., which would have a material adverse effect on our business and business prospects. The trial has been further expanded to include a 6-month chronic phase for subjects requiring simple repeat transfusions and also to include up to thirty patients with Sickle Cell Disease requiring red cell exchange. Subjects that would qualify for inclusion into the chronic phase would be those with conditions such as Sickle Cell Disease, Thalassemia or Myelodysplasia. This expansion of study population requires the inclusion of additional sites beyond the nine currently engaged in the trial up to fifteen. RedeS is a double-blind, controlled, parallel group study where up to 800 subjects will be randomized to receive either 28 days, or 28 days plus 6 months of transfusion support with INTERCEPT-treated RBCs or conventional RBCs, with a primary endpoint of hemoglobin increment following transfusion. These data from the expanded RedeS study will support our chronic use assessment in our submission for approval to the FDA. We also received investigational device exemption, or IDE, approval from the FDA to initiate a Phase 3 clinical trial, known as the ReCePI study, that is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of INTERCEPT-treated RBCs in patients requiring transfusion for acute blood loss during surgery. Up to 600 subjects are expected to be transfused in up to 19 participating sites in the U.S. Subjects will be randomized on a 1:1 basis either to the treatment arm transfused with RBCs treated with or to the control arm transfused with conventional RBCs. The primary efficacy endpoint is the proportion of subjects experiencing acute kidney injury as an assessment of RBC efficacy in providing tissue oxygenation, measured as an increase in serum creatinine compared to pre-surgery, baseline levels within 48 hours after the surgery. Enrollment in the ReCePI study is currently underway at 15 sites. Enrollment in the ReCePI study began in 2019. Both RedeS and ReCePI trials have seen significant delays in subject recruitment due to COVID-19. Several participating institutions implemented policies that limited clinical research activities and some eligible subjects have rejected participation because of the need for follow up. Furthermore, some study sites have withdrawn from study participation. Additionally, delays in progressing new site commitments to participate in the trials were seen due to hospital clinical research staff reductions and institutional commitments to COVID-19 related activities. The RedeS and ReCePI studies are being funded as part of our agreement with BARDA. In addition to successfully conducting and completing the RedeS and ReCePI studies, we also understand that one or more additional in vitro studies will be required to be successfully completed and submitted to

the FDA before the FDA will consider our red blood cell product for approval. Should the COVID-19 pandemic resurge in areas where we are enrolling patients, our ability to complete the clinical trials timely, or at all, may be jeopardized.
Additional information regarding our interactions with the FDA, our application for a CE Certificate of Conformity in the European Union for the red blood cell system, and potential future clinical development of the INTERCEPT Blood System in Europe and in the U.S. can be found under “Item 1A—Risk Factors” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, under the risk factors titled “Clinical trials are costly and time consuming, may take longer than we expect or may not be completed at all, and their outcomes are uncertain. A failure to generate data in clinical trials to support expanded label claims or to support marketing approvals or certification for our product candidates could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects” and “The red blood cell system is currently in development and may never receive any marketing approvals or CE Certificates of Conformity,” as well as generally under the heading “Risks Related to Regulatory Approval, CE Certificates of Conformity and Oversight, and Other Legal Compliance Matters.”
 INTERCEPT Blood System Technology
 Both our platelet system and plasma system employ the same technology. Platelet or plasma components collected from blood donors are transferred into plastic INTERCEPT disposable kits and are mixed with our proprietary compound, amotosalen, a small molecule compound that has an affinity for nucleic acid.
 The disposable kits are then placed in an illumination device, or illuminator, where the mixture is exposed to ultra-violet A, or UVA, light. If pathogens such as viruses, bacteria or parasites, as well as leukocytes, or white cells, are present in the platelet or plasma components, the energy from the UVA light causes the amotosalen to bond with the nucleic acid. Since platelets and plasma do not rely on nucleic acid for therapeutic efficacy, the INTERCEPT Blood System is designed to preserve the therapeutic function of the platelet and plasma components and IFC when used in human transfusions.
 The ability of amotosalen to form both cross-links between strands of nucleic acid and links to single nucleic acid strands results in a strong chemical bond between the amotosalen and the nucleic acid of the pathogens. The presence of these bonds is designed to prevent replication of the nucleic acid within pathogens, effectively inactivating the pathogens. A high level of inactivation has been demonstrated in a broad range of pathogens studied by us and others in laboratory testing. For instance, INTERCEPT has demonstrated inactivation of a number of single stranded nucleic acid-based viruses such as HIV, hepatitis B, hepatitis C (using a model virus), West Nile, chikungunya and certain influenza viruses.
 Following the inactivation process, residual amotosalen and by-products are reduced by more than 99% through use of a compound adsorption device, which is an integrated component of the disposable kit. We have performed extensive toxicology testing on the residual amotosalen and its by-products and good safety margins have been demonstrated. Any remaining amotosalen which may be transfused, should any exist, is rapidly excreted by humans.
 Leukocytes, also known as white blood cells, are typically present in platelet and plasma components collected for transfusion and can cause adverse transfusion reactions as well as an often fatal disease called graft-versus host disease. Leukocytes, like pathogens, rely on nucleic acid for replication and cellular function. The INTERCEPT Blood System, with its combination of the amotosalen and UVA light, is designed to inactivate leukocytes in the same manner it inactivates pathogens.
 Like the platelet and plasma systems, the red blood cell system is designed to prevent pathogen replication by using a small molecule additive compound to form bonds with nucleic acid in pathogens that may be present in donated red blood cell collections. The red blood cell system is designed to preserve the therapeutic qualities of the red blood cells, which, like platelets and plasma, do not rely on nucleic acid for their therapeutic efficacy. The red blood cell system uses another of our proprietary compounds, amustaline. Unlike the platelet and plasma systems, the chemical bonds from amustaline are not triggered by UVA light, but instead, by the pH level of the red blood cell components. After mixture with the red blood cell components in plastic disposable kits and resulting nucleic-acid bonding, amustaline is designed to rapidly break down into a form that is no longer chemically reactive with nucleic acid. As with the platelet and plasma systems, a high level of inactivation in a broad range of pathogens has been demonstrated with the red blood cell system in the clinical setting. We plan on conducting additional pathogen-inactivation studies of the red blood cell system, broadening our understanding of the pathogens the system may be able to inactivate.
 By treating blood components with INTERCEPT within a day of collection, the inactivation of bacteria prevents bacterial growth that could create increased risk of inflammatory response or dangerous levels of endotoxins. Extensive clinical testing has been done on platelet and plasma products treated with the INTERCEPT Blood System, as well as post-marketing haemovigilance studies of the treated blood products in routine use.
 We believe that, due to their mechanisms of action, the platelet system, plasma system, and red blood cell system will potentially inactivate blood-borne pathogens that have not yet been tested with our systems, including emerging and future threats to the blood supply. We do not claim, however, that our INTERCEPT Blood System will inactivate all pathogens, including prions, and our inactivation claims are limited to those contained in our product specifications. There can also be no assurance that INTERCEPT will inactivate even those pathogens where claims exist, in every instance or under every processing condition.


Manufacturing and Supply
 We have used, and intend to continue to use, third parties to manufacture and supply the illuminators, components, disposable kits and inactivation compounds that make up the INTERCEPT Blood System for use in clinical trials and for commercialization. With the exception of certain components, we rely solely on Fresenius Kabi AG, or Fresenius, for the manufacture of disposable kits for the platelet and plasma systems. We rely on other contract manufacturers for the production of our reagents, inactivation compounds, compound adsorption components of the disposable kits, illuminators and other disposable kits or disposable accessories used in the INTERCEPT Blood System. We currently do not have alternate manufacturers for many of the components in our products or product candidates beyond those that we rely on, but we are in the process of identifying potential alternate manufacturers for several components, reagents and compounds. On May 2, 2022, we entered into the Second Amended and Restated Supply and Manufacturing Agreement, or the 2022 Agreement, with Fresenius Kabi AG, Fenwal France SAS, Fenwal International, Inc. and Fresenius Kabi Deutschland GmbH, or collectively, Fresenius, for the manufacture and production of disposable sets for the INTERCEPT Blood System until December 31, 2031. Under the terms of the 2022 Agreement, Fresenius is obligated to manufacture, and we are obligated to purchase, finished disposable kits for the platelet and plasma systems. The 2022 Agreement permits us to purchase sets for the platelet and plasma systems from third parties to the extent necessary to maintain supply qualifications with such third parties or where local or regional manufacturing is needed to obtain product registrations or sales. Fresenius will expand manufacturing of the disposable sets to three production facilities, following qualification and licensure of such additional facilities. The term of the 2022 Agreement will automatically renew for successive two-year periods unless terminated by either party upon two years’ prior written notice, in the case of the initial term, or one year prior written notice, in the case of any successive renewal term. We and Fresenius each have normal and customary termination rights, including termination for material breach. Pricing under the 2022 Agreement for the initial term is based on volume purchases by us and subject to an annual adjustment based on variation in a price index.
Components of the compound adsorption devices used in our platelet and plasma disposable kits are manufactured by Porex Corporation, or Porex. In April 2017, we entered into an amended and restated manufacturing and supply agreement with Porex for the continued supply of the compound adsorption devices. Porex is our sole supplier for certain components of and manufacturing of the compound adsorption devices. Under the amended and restated Porex agreement, we are no longer subject to a minimum annual purchase requirement; however, Porex has the right to terminate the agreement, upon twelve months’ prior written notice, if annual production falls below a mutually agreed threshold. The amended and restated Porex agreement was renewed in December 2021 and will continue until December 31, 2024. Commercially viable alternatives, if ever available, are likely several years away.
 We also have an amended and restated supply agreement with Purolite LLC, formerly Purolite Corporation, or Purolite, for the supply of raw materials used to make the compound adsorption devices. The amended supply agreement expires in April 2024, and will automatically renew for an additional year unless either party has provided notice not to renew at least two years prior to the expiration. Neither party has delivered notice of its intent to terminate the agreement. Under the terms of the amended agreement, pricing is volume based and is subject to annual, prospective adjustments based on a Producer Price Index subject to an annual cap.
Pursuant to a contract that we and Nova Biomedical Corporation, or Nova, entered into in September 2008, Nova had been manufacturing the current model of illuminators for us. In February 2022, Nova completed a last time build of our current model illuminator, which is being phased out of manufacture due to obsolescence of certain components. Although still in development, we have completed the redesign of the new illuminator, which is expected to take more than twelve months to obtain regulatory approval. Until such time as we obtain approval for the redesigned illuminator, if ever, the demand for illuminators may be higher than the remaining number of illuminators in inventory, resulting in possible customer allocations or loss of sales. Our Nova agreement expired in September 2022.
 We operate with an amended manufacturing and supply agreement with Piramal, formerly, Ash Stevens, Inc., for the synthesis of amotosalen, the inactivation compound used in our platelet and plasma systems. Under this amended agreement, we are subject to minimum annual purchase requirements. The term of the amended manufacturing and supply agreement with Piramal will expire on December 31, 2023 and will continue to automatically renew for successive two-year periods, unless terminated by either party upon providing at least one year prior written notice, in our case, or at least two years prior written notice, in the case of Piramal. Neither party has delivered notice of its intent to terminate the agreement.
 We and our contract manufacturers purchase certain raw materials for our disposable kits, inactivation compounds, materials and parts associated with compound adsorption devices and UVA illuminators from a limited number of suppliers. Some of those raw material suppliers require minimum annual purchase amounts. While we believe that there are alternative sources of supply for such materials, parts and devices, we have not validated or qualified any alternate manufacturers. As such, establishing additional or replacement suppliers for any of the raw materials, parts and devices, if required, will likely not be accomplished quickly and could involve significant additional costs and potential regulatory reviews that could limit our ability to supply customer demand.
Certain regions that we sell into or may sell into in the future may give priority to those products that are manufactured locally in their jurisdiction. Our failure to meet these local manufacturing conditions may prevent us from successfully commercializing our product in those geographies. In addition, should we choose to manufacture locally in those jurisdictions, we would likely incur additional costs, may be unable to meet our quality system requirements or successfully manufacture products, and such activities will be a distraction

from our current focus and operations. We have limited experience managing local manufacturing or working with local manufacturers in geographies or jurisdictions outside of our existing manufacturing operations.
 Marketing, Sales and Distribution
 The market for the INTERCEPT Blood System, including the U.S. market, is dominated by a relatively small number of blood collection organizations. Accordingly, there may be an extended period during which some potential U.S.-based customers may first choose to validate our technology or run experience studies themselves before deciding to adopt the system for commercial use, which may never occur. On October 1, 2021, all U.S. blood centers had to be compliant with the FDA guidance document, “Bacterial Risk Control Strategies for Blood Collection Establishments and Transfusion Services to Enhance the Safety and Availability of Platelets for Transfusion,” or the Final Guidance Document. Although the INTERCEPT Blood System is one of the options available to U.S. blood centers for compliance under the Final Guidance Document, we cannot predict if U.S. customers will continue to adopt INTERCEPT over other options or at what levels.
The American Red Cross represents the largest single portion of the blood collection market in the U.S. and is one of our key customers. While we believe adoption of the INTERCEPT Blood System will afford the American Red Cross with many benefits, we cannot guarantee the volume or timing of commercial purchases that the American Red Cross may make.
 The U.S. blood banking market is undergoing consolidation which may continue and further concentrate the potential customer base. In many countries in Western Europe and in Japan, various national blood transfusion services or Red Cross organizations collect, store and distribute virtually all of their respective nations’ blood and blood components supply. The largest European markets for our products are in Germany, France, and England.
 In Germany, decisions on product adoption are made on a regional or blood center-by-blood center basis. While our obtaining a CE Certificate of Conformity permitting us to affix the CE Mark and sell the platelet and plasma systems to blood centers in Germany, blood centers in Germany must still obtain both local manufacturing approval and national marketing authorization from the Paul Ehrlich Institute, or PEI, a German governmental regulatory body overseeing the marketing authorization of certain medical products, before being allowed to sell platelet and plasma components treated with the INTERCEPT Blood System to transfusing hospitals and physicians. To date, several blood centers in Germany have received such requisite approvals and authorizations for the platelet system. Given the competitive nature of the German blood banking market, pricing for blood components is relatively low compared to other markets. INTERCEPT-treated platelets received national reimbursement in Germany in 2018 at a premium to untreated platelets. While this dynamic has the potential to generate economic value for blood centers in Germany, we cannot ensure that blood centers will understand or act on the potential economic and logistical benefits of using INTERCEPT compared to conventional blood components as well as the potential safety benefits of INTERCEPT-treated blood components. Following the inclusion of pathogen-inactivated platelets for national reimbursement by the German Institute for the Hospital Remuneration System as of January 1, 2018, German customers who do not currently have an approved marketing authorization application, or MAA, will first need to obtain one before using the INTERCEPT Blood System. The review period for a new MAA can be twelve months or longer following submission and we cannot predict which German customers or potential customers will obtain an MAA. Without broad approvals of MAA applications obtained by potential German customers, our ability to successfully commercialize INTERCEPT in Germany will be negatively impacted, which may adversely affect the potential for growth in that region. In addition, the reimbursement awarded to INTERCEPT in Germany may not be considered by German blood centers as attractive enough to implement pathogen reduction or cover the entirety of their blood center platelet collections which may in turn limit the market acceptance in Germany. We do not yet know if or how German blood centers plan to market and sell to their hospital customers nor do we have the ability to influence and control implementation in hospitals in Germany to administer pathogen-reduced platelets. Should German blood centers be ineffective in marketing and selling INTERCEPT-treated platelets or if hospitals object, or are slow implementing the steps needed to procure and administer pathogen reduced platelets, our market in Germany may be limited or be slow to realize acceptance.
In France, broad product adoption is dependent on a central decision by the Établissement Français du Sang, or EFS, a public organization responsible for all collection, testing preparation and distribution of blood products in France. In October 2021, we entered into a new agreement with EFS to supply platelet disposable kits. The agreement for supply of platelet disposable kits provides for a base term of two years, with two options for EFS to extend for one year each. In January 2020, we entered into a new agreement with EFS to supply plasma disposable kits and maintenance services for illuminators for a base term of two years, with two options for EFS to extend for one year each. EFS exercised the second option in September 2022. While EFS has standardized production of its platelets using the INTERCEPT Blood System, we cannot provide any assurance that the national deployment of INTERCEPT to treat platelets in France will be sustainable, or that we will be able to secure any subsequent contracts with EFS or that the terms, including the pricing or committed volumes, if any, of any future contract will be equivalent or superior to the terms under our current contracts. If we are unable to continue to successfully support EFS’ national adoption of the INTERCEPT Blood System for platelets, EFS’ use of the INTERCEPT Blood System for Plasma or the final commercial terms of any subsequent contract for platelet or plasma disposable kits are less favorable than the terms under our existing contracts, our financial results may be adversely impacted.
In England, decisions on product adoption are centralized in the National Blood Service, or NHSBT, which collects, tests, processes and supplies blood products to hospitals in England and North Wales. The National Blood Service has implemented bacterial detection

for platelets for several years. We do not know when, if ever, the NHBST will consider adoption of a product for pathogen reduction, including INTERCEPT.
 In Japan, the Japanese Red Cross controls a significant majority of blood centers and exerts a high degree of influence on the adoption and use of blood safety measures. The Japanese Red Cross has been reviewing preclinical and clinical data on pathogen reduction of blood over a number of years and has yet to make a formal determination to adopt any pathogen reduction approach. Before the Japanese Red Cross considers our products, we understand that we may need to complete certain product configuration changes, which may not be economically or technologically feasible for us to complete.
 The FDA has granted Breakthrough Device Designation and has since approved the INTERCEPT Blood System for Cryoprecipitation, which uses our plasma system to produce IFC for the treatment and control of bleeding, including massive hemorrhage, associated with fibrinogen deficiency and to produce the derivative product, pathogen reduced plasma, cryoprecipitate reduced. We have entered into manufacturing agreements with certain blood centers to produce IFC for us. In addition, we have entered into agreements with certain blood centers and blood center affiliate organizations to sell the INTERCEPT Blood System for Cryoprecipitation. In order to successfully commercialize IFC, we will need to generate commercial use data in order to influence the market and sell directly to hospital users and blood center producers of cryoprecipitate. We are adding to and reorganizing our existing commercial teams to commercialize IFC. We do not know if IFC will be perceived as clinically, operationally, or economically attractive to hospital customers or at what price, if any, or if the investment needed to sell IFC will be sustainable. Should our sale of kits to produce IFC alienate our contracted manufacturing partners, it may put pressure on the pricing for IFC in the marketplace or limit commercialization of IFC in the U.S.
Market adoption of our products is affected by blood center and healthcare facility budgets and the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from governments, managed care payors, such as insurance companies, and/or other third parties. In many jurisdictions, due to the structure of the blood products industry, we have little control over budget and reimbursement discussions, which generally occur between blood centers, healthcare facilities such as hospitals, and national or regional ministries of health and private payors. Even if a particular blood center is prepared to adopt the INTERCEPT Blood System, its hospital customers may not accept or may not have the budget to purchase INTERCEPT-treated blood products. We understand that due to the COVID-19 pandemic, many hospitals have consolidated, laid off workers or have filed for bankruptcy protection, and other hospitals may have such significant budget shortages that they are unable to afford pathogen-reduced blood components. In addition, some hospitals are seeing such a high influx of COVID-19 cases, that, regardless of whether they have sufficient staff to handle the high case load, they may be unable or unwilling to allocate sufficient resources to implement a new technology such as INTERCEPT. Since blood centers would likely not eliminate the practice of screening donors or testing blood for some pathogens prior to transfusion, even after implementing our products, some blood centers may not be able to identify enough cost offsets or hospital pricing increases to afford to purchase our products. Budgetary concerns may be further exacerbated by economic legislation in certain countries and by proposals by legislators at both the federal and, in some cases, state levels, regulators, healthcare facilities and third-party payors to keep healthcare costs down, which may limit the adoption of new technologies, including our products. In some jurisdictions, commercial use of our products may not be covered by governmental or commercial third-party payors for health care services and may never be covered. Even if we received national reimbursement for our products, we may not be able to convince blood center customers to change their operating practices and produce INTERCEPT-treated platelets and plasma. In the U.S., we obtained HCPCS reimbursement codes for hospital outpatient billing and payment of INTERCEPT-treated platelets and plasma in 2015, and for IFC and the derivative, pathogen-reduced plasma, cryoprecipitate reduced in 2021. We cannot guarantee that the HCPCS codes for our products will be assigned payment rates in amounts sufficient to cover the cost of our products to hospital customers.
The costs and expenses incurred by the blood center related to donor blood are typically included in the price that the blood center charges a hospital for a unit of blood. Even after blood components treated with our products are approved for reimbursement by governmental or commercial third-party payors, the costs and expenses specific to the INTERCEPT Blood System may not be directly reimbursed, but instead may be incorporated within the reimbursement structure for medical procedures and/or products at the site of patient care. Governmental or third-party payors may change reimbursement rates, year over year, or in reaction to submitted claims for reimbursement of costs and expenses related to blood components treated with INTERCEPT. If the costs to the hospital for INTERCEPT processed blood products cannot be easily, readily, or fully incorporated into the existing reimbursement structure, or if reimbursement rates are insufficient or decreased in any given year for blood components treated with INTERCEPT, hospital billing and/or reimbursement for these products could be impacted, thus negatively impacting hospitals’ acceptance and uptake of our products.
 We maintain a wholly-owned subsidiary, Cerus Europe B.V., headquartered in the Netherlands, which focuses its efforts on marketing and selling the INTERCEPT Blood System in a number of countries in Europe, the CIS, the Middle East and selected countries in other regions around the world. We have a small scientific affairs group in the U.S. and the Netherlands that supports our commercialization efforts as well as hospital affairs professionals, to help educate hospitals and physicians on our products, clinical trial history and publications. We have a small group of individuals to which we may add to in the future to market and sell IFC in the U.S. We have a small number of employees focused on servicing the markets in Asia-Pacific and Latin American regions and rely primarily on distributors to market and sell our products in those regions.


In February 2021, we entered into an Equity Joint Venture Contract with Shandong Zhongbaokang Medical Implements Co., Ltd., or ZBK, to establish Cerus Zhongbaokang (Shandong) Biomedical Co., LTD., which we refer to as the JV, for the purpose of developing, obtaining regulatory approval for, and eventual manufacturing and commercialization of the INTERCEPT blood transfusion for platelets and red blood cells in the People’s Republic of China. We own 51% of equity in the JV. The JV will need to obtain regulatory approval for the INTERCEPT Blood System for platelets and red blood cells before it can begin commercializing in China. In order to obtain that regulatory approval, the JV may need to run additional clinical studies in China. We cannot assure you the JV will be successful in meeting the endpoint, once defined, or that it will ever receive regulatory approval.
 We have entered into distribution agreements, generally on a geographically exclusive basis, with distributors in countries where we have limited abilities to commercialize our products directly. In certain of these jurisdictions, we rely on these distributors to obtain any necessary in-country regulatory approvals, in addition to marketing and selling the INTERCEPT Blood System, providing customer and technical product support, maintaining inventories, and adhering to our quality system in all material respects, among other activities. Selected areas where we have entered into geographically exclusive distribution agreements include but are not limited to certain countries in the CIS, the Middle East, Latin America, and Southeast Asia. Our success in these regions is dependent on our ability to support our distributors and our distributors’ ability to market and sell our products and to maintain and service customer accounts, including technical service. Our distribution agreements meaningfully contribute to our revenues. As such, declining performance or the outright termination or loss of certain distributor relationships could harm our existing business, may impact our growth potential, and could result in higher operating costs for us. As our distributors play a critical role in our commercialization efforts, we evaluate their performance on an ongoing basis. As we continue to evaluate our distributors, we may take further actions in the future which may have an impact on our operating results. In the past, we have transitioned certain territories to new distribution partners who we felt were capable of improved performance relative to their predecessors as well as transitioned some of these territories to a Cerus direct option for EFS to extend for one year each sales effort, which we believed would provide us with better visibility into and control of sales execution. We may undertake similar changes in the future. As a result, we may experience a decrease in the volume of INTERCEPT disposable kit sales for the impacted territories as outgoing distribution partners sell through their disposable kit inventory. In addition, any new distributors or our own direct sales force may require some time to develop the market with the same proficiency as previous distributors. We cannot provide assurance that any such changes will achieve the same level of operations or proficiency as previous distributors.
 Government Contracts
 We operate directly under three contracts with U.S. Federal Agencies, one with BARDA, one with the FDA, and another with the Department of Defense, or DoD. Revenue from the cost reimbursement provisions under our BARDA and the FDA government contracts varies by year. A portion of our government contract revenue is subject to renegotiation of reimbursement rates or termination of the contract at the election of the U.S. government. Our ability to recognize revenue under our contract with DoD for the development of pathogen reduced, lyophilized cryoprecipitate is based on the application of the cost-to-cost input method, which measures the extent of progress towards completion based on the ratio of actual costs incurred to the total estimated costs. Revenue is recorded as a percentage of the transaction price based on the extent of progress towards completion. In addition, U.S. government contracts typically contain unfavorable provisions and are subject to audit and modification by the government at its sole discretion. Generally, government contracts, including our agreements with BARDA, the FDA, and the DoD, contain provisions permitting unilateral termination or modification, in whole or in part, at the U.S. government’s convenience. See Note 2 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under “Item 15—Financial Statement Schedules—Financial Statements” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information on significant accounting policies related to our government contract revenue and other financial information for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. Further discussion of the factors impacting our government contracts revenue and the related impact on our ability to operate our business can be found under “Item 1A—Risk Factors” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, under the risk factors titled “A significant portion of the funding for the development of the red blood cell system is expected to come from our BARDA agreement, and if BARDA were to eliminate, reduce, delay, or object to extension for funding of our agreement, it would have a significant, negative impact on our government contract revenues and cash flows, and we may be forced to suspend or terminate our U.S. red blood cell development program or obtain alternative sources of funding” and “Unfavorable provisions in government contracts, including in our contracts with BARDA, FDA and DoD, may harm our business, financial condition and operating results.”
Competition
 Our products face a wide variety of competition from entities competing directly with alternative pathogen reduction technologies for platelets and/or plasma, as well as from entities developing and selling diagnostic screening products to detect and prevent contaminated products from being transfused, and from process and procedural decisions involving blood banking operations including but not limited to shortened shelf-life of blood components. Many of our competitors have mature, well-established products or have other products which are sold to U.S. based blood centers and many have more commercial resources than we do. In addition, competitors may choose to seek a lower class of regulatory approval or certification than our products, which may be easier and less costly for them to maintain and may be perceived as sufficient by the marketplace. We believe that the INTERCEPT Blood System has certain competitive advantages over competing blood-borne pathogen reduction methods that are either on the market or known to us to be in development. The INTERCEPT Blood System is designed for use in blood centers, which allows for integration with current blood collection,

processing and storage procedures. Certain competing products currently on the market, such as solvent detergent-treated plasma, use centralized processing that takes blood products away from the blood center in order to be treated at a central facility before being shipped back out to the blood centers or hospitals for ultimate transfusion, which may result in higher costs.
 Our INTERCEPT Blood System for cryoprecipitation competes with traditional cryoprecipitate, a by-product of thawing frozen plasma and with human plasma derived fibrinogen concentrates. While we believe that IFC has many advantages over competitors, conventional cryoprecipitate and fibrinogen concentrates are well established within hospital use. Hospitals may not perceive the advantage of IFC over the competing products, we may be ineffective in selling blood components directly to hospitals or be unable to convince hospitals of the economic or patient advantages relative to the competitors.
 In Europe, several companies, including Grifols, Octapharma AG, MacoPharma International and Kedrion Biopharma, are developing or selling commercial pathogen reduction systems or services to treat fresh frozen plasma. Terumo BCT, a subsidiary of Terumo Corporation, has developed a pathogen reduction system for blood products and has received a Class II CE Certificate of Conformity and affixed the CE Mark for such system for both platelets and plasma and received Swissmedic approval for platelets treated with their system. MacoPharma has received a CE Certificate of Conformity for a UVC-based pathogen reduction product for platelets. MacoPharma completed a Phase 3 clinical trial in Germany to generate additional data for possible expanded approvals. We understand that Terumo BCT also developed a pathogen reduction system for whole blood receiving a Class II CE Certificate of Conformity. Each of these companies’ products may offer competitive advantages over our INTERCEPT Blood System.
In the U.S., INTERCEPT-treated plasma faces competition from Octapharma AG, which is currently commercializing treated fresh frozen plasma for certain indications in the U.S. Our platelet product faces competition from a number of diagnostic and testing companies currently approved for the detection of pathogens including bacterial and viral pathogens in donated blood products and may face competition from other technologies if approved.
 Terumo BCT’s platelet, plasma or whole blood pathogen reduction product may be viewed as favorable by the Japanese Red Cross. Terumo Corporation is a large Japan-based, multinational corporation with more mature products and relationships than we have. Our ability to commercialize our products in certain markets, particularly in Japan, may be negatively affected by Terumo’s resources and their pre-existing relationships with regulators and customers. Should Terumo BCT’s product be approved for use and commercialized in Japan, our products would likely directly compete against its products and we believe we would likely need to either establish operations in Japan or partner with a local Japanese company.
 We believe that the primary competitive factors in the market for pathogen reduction of blood products include the breadth and effectiveness of pathogen reduction processes, the amount of demonstrated reduction in transfusion related adverse events subsequent to adopting pathogen reduction technology, robustness of treated blood components upon transfusion, the scope and enforceability of patent or other proprietary rights, perceived product value relative to perceived risk, product supply, perceived ease of use, perception of safety, efficacy and economics of pathogen reduction systems, and marketing and sales capability. In addition, we believe the length of time required for products to be developed and to receive regulatory and, in some cases, reimbursement approval are also important competitive factors. We believe that the INTERCEPT Blood System will compete favorably with respect to these factors, although there can be no assurance that it will be able to do so. Our success will depend in part on our ability to convince prospective customers of the benefits of and need to adopt pathogen reduction technology and specifically our system relative to other technologies, our ability to obtain and retain regulatory approvals or certifications for our products, and our ability to continue supplying quality and effective products to our customers and prospective customers.
 Patents, Licenses and Proprietary Rights
 Our commercial success will depend in part on our ability to obtain patents, to protect trade secrets, to operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing on our proprietary rights. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing U.S. and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development of our business. As of December 31, 2022, we owned 10 issued or allowed U.S. patents and approximately 70 issued or allowed foreign patents related to the INTERCEPT Blood System. Our patents expire at various dates between 2025 and 2040. Recent patent applications will, if granted, result in patents with later expiration dates. In addition, we have a license from Fresenius to U.S. and foreign patents relating to the INTERCEPT Blood System, which expire at various dates in 2023 and 2024. Due to the complexity of our products, we believe it is the protection afforded to our products by the portfolio of intellectual property rights that best protect our proprietary system rather than any one particular patent or trade secret. Proprietary rights relating to our planned and potential products will be protected from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that they are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets. The laws of certain foreign countries do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the U.S.
 We are aware of an expired U.S. patent issued to a third-party that covers methods to remove psoralen compounds from blood products. We have reviewed the patent and believe there exist substantial questions concerning its validity. We cannot be certain, however, that a court would hold the patent to be invalid or not infringed by our platelet or plasma systems. In this regard, whether or not we have infringed this patent will not be known with certainty unless and until a court interprets the patent in the context of litigation. In the event that we are found to infringe any valid claim of this patent, we may, among other things, be required to pay damages. Further

discussion of the factors impacting our intellectual property and the related impact on our ability to operate our business can be found under “Item 1A—Risk Factors” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, under the risk factor titled “We may not be able to protect our intellectual property or operate our business without infringing intellectual property rights of others.”
 Seasonality
 Our business is dependent on the marketing and commercialization of the INTERCEPT Blood System to customers such as blood banks, hospitals, distributors and other health care providers that have a need for a pathogen reduction system to treat blood products for transfusion. Since we have not experienced purchasing patterns from our customers based on seasonal trends, we do not expect seasonality to have a material effect on our business, although purchasing patterns and inventory levels can fluctuate.
Inventory Requirements and Product Return Rights
 Our platelet and plasma disposable kits have received regulatory approval and certification for shelf lives ranging from 6 to 24 months. Our INTERCEPT Blood System for Cryoprecipitation has received regulatory approval and certification for a shelf life of 12 months. Although we have regulatory approval and certification for our products in most regions for up to a 24 month shelf life, the FDA has limited our platelet product to a six month shelf life and has asked for additional stability and aging data on newly manufactured lots which will require us to manage our U.S. supply chain closely until we generate the requested data and receive approval for longer shelf lives from the FDA. Illuminators and replacement parts do not have regulated expiration dates. We own raw materials, work-in-process inventory for certain components of INTERCEPT disposable kits, finished INTERCEPT disposable kits, illuminators, and certain replacement parts for our illuminators. Our supply chain for certain of these finished goods and separately, components, held as work-in-process on our consolidated balance sheets, may potentially take over one year to sell or complete production before being utilized in finished disposable kits or illuminators. We maintain inventory based on our current and future sales projections, and at each reporting period, we evaluate whether our work-in-process inventory would be used for production within the next 12-month period and evaluate our finished units in order to sell to existing and prospective customers within the next 12-month period. Except for our active pharmaceutical ingredients, illuminators and certain raw materials used in the production of certain components, it is not customary for our production cycle for inventory to exceed twelve months. Instead, we use our best judgment to factor in lead times for the production of our finished units to meet our current demands. Occasionally, we make last-time-buys of certain components or raw materials when such components or raw materials are considered at risk of being discontinued which allows us to ensure continuity of production and sufficient time to develop or identify, qualify and secure alternate raw materials or components. Inventory is recorded at the lower of cost, determined on a first in, first out basis, or market value. We use judgment to analyze and determine if the composition of our inventory is obsolete, slow-moving, or unsalable and frequently review such determinations. We rely on our direct sales team and distributors to provide accurate forecasts of sales in their territory. If our forecasts or those of our distributors are inaccurate, we could face backlog situations or conversely, may produce and carry an abundance of inventory that would consume cash faster than we have currently planned. Generally, we write-down specifically identified unusable, obsolete, slow-moving, or known unsalable inventory that has no alternative use to net realizable value in the period that it is first recognized, by using a number of factors, including product expiration dates, open and unfulfilled orders, and sales forecasts. Any write-down of our inventory to net realizable value establishes a new cost basis and will be maintained even if certain circumstances suggest that the inventory is recoverable in subsequent periods.
 We sell the INTERCEPT Blood System directly to blood banks, hospitals, universities, and government agencies, as well as to distributors in certain regions. Generally, our contracts with our customers do not provide for open return rights, except within a reasonable time after receipt of goods in the case of defective or non-conforming product. We have also entered into agreements with certain blood centers and blood center affiliate organizations to sell the INTERCEPT Blood System for Cryoprecipitation for their production of IFC and sale to their hospital customers. We may encounter pricing challenges and competition between the direct to hospital sales model and kit sale to blood center model.
 Research and Development Expenses
 A significant portion of our operating expenses is related to research and development, and we intend to maintain a balanced yet strong commitment to our research and development efforts. As we look ahead, we anticipate that the regulatory submission processes related to potential PMA supplements for the platelet and plasma systems or post market approval requirements will require substantial continued investment in research and development activities, as will our ongoing clinical, development and chemistry manufacturing and control, or CMC, work for our red blood cell system in Europe as well as our whole-blood initiative in collaboration with the FDA. In the U.S., we expect to incur research and development expenses associated with pursuing licensure of the red blood cell system including the RedeS study, the ReCePI study and an additional Phase 3 clinical trial for chronic anemia, in vitro studies, and other activities to pursue FDA approval of our red blood cell system. To the extent available, many of the U.S. red blood cell activities may be reimbursed by BARDA, though no guarantee can be made that our progress will be satisfactory to BARDA or that funds will be available to either BARDA or us. Similarly, most of our whole blood program is expected to be reimbursed by the FDA, though no guarantee can be made that our progress will be satisfactory to the FDA or that funds will be available to the FDA or us. Our ability to receive funding under our contract with DoD for the development of pathogen reduced, lyophilized cryoprecipitate is based on achievement of milestones which cannot be guaranteed. If we are unable to achieve any of those milestones, funding may be limited, less than expected, or non-existent for that particular milestone, which in all cases would negatively impact our cash flows and financial

results. In addition, we plan to continue spending on new product development and enhancements to our illumination device and next generation of our INTERCEPT Blood System kits, which may increase research and development expenses. See Note 2 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under “Financial Statement Schedules—Financial Statements” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for costs and expenses related to research and development, and other financial information for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020.
 Government Regulation
 We and our products are comprehensively regulated in the U.S. by the FDA and by comparable governmental authorities in other jurisdictions.
 Our European Union investigational plan has been based on the INTERCEPT Blood System being categorized as Class III drug/device combination under the MDD. Medical devices, including INTERCEPT will need to be re-registered and approved under the new MDR which entered into application on May 26, 2021.
We initially received a CE Certificate of Conformity for our platelet system and separately for our plasma system in 2002 and 2006, respectively. In March 2020, we received an extension of the CE Certificate of Conformity to 2024, under the MDD. While our current extension of registration is based on the MDD for the platelet and plasma systems, we cannot assure you that these products will timely meet the requirements of the MDR prior to the expiration of the CE Certificate of Conformity granted on the basis of the MDD. A separate CE Certificate of Conformity in accordance with the MDR must be received for the red blood cell system to be sold in the European Union and in other countries recognizing the CE Mark. We filed our application for a CE Certificate of Conformity of the red blood cell system in December 2018 under the MDD, and in June 2021, we completed the process to resubmit our application under the new MDR. However, we do not expect that a decision under the MDR will occur for at least another 12 months, if ever. In addition, France, Switzerland, Germany, and Austria require separate approvals for INTERCEPT-treated blood products.
 The FDA regulates drugs, medical devices and biologics under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and other laws, including, in the case of biologics, the Public Health Service Act. These laws and implementing regulations govern, among other things, the development, testing, manufacturing, record keeping, storage, labeling, advertising, promotion and pre-market clearance or approval of products subject to regulation. The steps required before a medical device may be approved for marketing in the U.S. pursuant to a PMA include:
 •preclinical laboratory and animal tests;
 •submission to the FDA of an investigational device exemption for human clinical testing, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
 •appropriate tests to show the product’s safety;
 •adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the product’s safety and efficacy for its intended indications;
 •submission to the FDA of a PMA; and
 •FDA review of the PMA in order to determine, among other things, whether the product is safe and effective for its intended uses.
 The FDA has approved the platelet system for ex vivo preparation of pathogen-reduced apheresis platelet components in order to reduce the risk of TTI, including sepsis, and as an alternative to gamma irradiation for prevention of transfusion-associated graft versus host disease, or TA-GVHD. The FDA has also approved the plasma system for ex vivo preparation of pathogen-reduced, whole blood derived or apheresis plasma in order to reduce the risk of TTI when treating patients requiring therapeutic plasma transfusion and as an alternative to gamma irradiation for prevention of TA-GVHD. We have also recently received FDA approval for the INTERCEPT Blood System for Cryoprecipitation, which uses our plasma system to produce IFC for the treatment and control of bleeding, including massive hemorrhage, associated with fibrinogen deficiency and to produce pathogen reduced plasma, cryoprecipitate reduced. We plan to conduct development activities, clinical studies and in vitro studies for our platelet system to expand our label claims in the U.S.
 As a condition to the FDA approval of the platelet system, we were required to conduct two post-approval studies of the platelet system studies - a haemovigilance study to evaluate the incidence of acute lung injury following transfusion of INTERCEPT-treated platelets; and a recovery study of platelets treated with the platelet system. The haemovigilance study has completed, met its end point, and results have been published in a peer-reviewed journal. However, we will need to successfully complete the recovery and survival study of the platelet system. Should we be unsuccessful in meeting the criteria for the recovery and survival study, use of the platelet system may be limited, require label and use restrictions or have a revocation or suspension of approval. In addition to these studies, the FDA has also required us to perform many studies to support changes to our products and to commit to perform other lengthy post-marketing studies, for which we will have to expend significant additional resources. In addition, there is a risk that post-approval studies will show results inconsistent with our previous studies.


Any modifications to the platelet and plasma systems that could significantly affect their safety or effectiveness, including significant design and manufacturing changes, or that would constitute a major change in their intended use, manufacture, design, components, or technology requires FDA approval of a new PMA or PMA supplement. However, certain changes to a PMA-approved device do not require submission and approval of a new PMA or PMA supplement and may only require notice to FDA in a PMA Annual Report. The FDA requires every supplier to make this determination in the first instance, but the FDA may review any supplier’s decision. The FDA may not agree with our decisions regarding whether new submissions or approvals are necessary. Our products could be subject to recall if the FDA or other regulators determine, for any reason, that our products are not safe or effective or that appropriate regulatory submissions were not made. If new regulatory approvals are required, this could delay or preclude our ability to market the modified system. We will need to obtain regulatory approval of any future redesign of the illuminator before it can be commercialized. In addition, certain solvents we used to make the plastic beads in the plasma kit compound adsorption devices are no longer available. We will need to qualify plastic beads produced with a new solvent prior to consuming available inventory levels. Furthermore, in order to address the entire market in the U.S., we will need to develop and test additional configurations of the platelet system, including making the platelet system compatible with random donor platelets. Our failure to obtain FDA or foreign regulatory approvals of new platelet and plasma product configurations could significantly limit product revenues from sales of the platelet and plasma systems.
 With FDA approval of our platelet and plasma systems and the INTERCEPT Blood System for Cryoprecipitation, we are required to continue to comply with applicable FDA and other regulatory requirements related to, among other things, labeling, packaging, storage, advertising, promotion, record-keeping and reporting of safety and other information. In addition, our manufacturers and their facilities are required to comply with extensive FDA and foreign regulatory agency requirements, including, in the U.S., ensuring that quality control and manufacturing procedures conform to FDA-mandated current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, and Quality System Regulation, or QSR, requirements. As such, we and our contract manufacturers are subject to continual review and periodic inspections. The manufacturing facility which produces our platelet and plasma systems was recently audited by the FDA. While there were not objectionable conditions observed during the audit, the FDA or other regulatory agencies may inspect and audit facilities manufacturing or products or components at any time. Complying with and resolving any audit findings may result in additional costs, changes to our manufacturers quality management systems or both. Failure to timely resolve and comply to audit findings, if any, may result in enforcement actions and may result in a disruption to the supply of our products. Accordingly, we and others with whom we work must continue to expend time, money and effort in all areas of regulatory compliance, including manufacturing, production and quality control.
 The changes to the regulatory system implemented in the EU by the MDR include stricter requirements for clinical evidence and pre-market assessment of safety and performance, new classifications to indicate risk levels, requirements for third party testing by Notified Bodies, tightened and streamlined quality management system assessment procedures and additional requirements for the quality management system, additional requirements for traceability of products and transparency as well a refined responsibility of economic operators. We are also required to provide clinical data in the form of a clinical evaluation report. Fulfilment of the obligations imposed by the MDR may cause us to incur substantial costs. We may be unable to fulfill these obligations or our Notified Body may consider that we have not adequately demonstrated compliance with our related obligations to merit a CE Certificate of Conformity under the MDR.
 We are also required to report certain adverse events and production problems, if any, to the FDA, competent authorities of the EU Member States and Notified Bodies, and foreign regulatory authorities, when applicable, and FDA, competent authorities of the EU Member States, or other foreign regulatory authorities may require us to recall products as a result of adverse events or production problems. Additionally, we are required to comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotion for our products. For example, our promotional materials and training methods must comply with FDA and other applicable laws and regulations, including the prohibition of the promotion of unapproved, or off-label, uses. If the FDA, competent authorities of the EU Member States, or other foreign regulatory authorities determine that our promotional materials or training constitute promotion of an off-label use, they could request that we modify our training or promotional materials or subject us to regulatory or enforcement actions, including the issuance of an untitled letter, a warning letter, injunction, seizure, civil fine or criminal penalties. It is also possible that other federal, state, competent authorities of the EU Member States, or foreign authorities might take action if they consider our promotional or training materials to constitute promotion of an off-label use, or a violation or any other federal or state law that applies to us, such as laws prohibiting false claims for reimbursement. Although our policy is to refrain from statements that could be considered off-label promotion of our products, the FDA, competent authorities of the EU Member States, or another regulatory agency could disagree and conclude that we have engaged in off-label promotion. In addition, the off-label use of our products may increase the risk of product liability claims. We are also subject to other broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations, including anti-kickback, health care professional payment transparency, and health information privacy and security laws, which may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we research, as well as, sell, market and distribute our products. Any enforcement action brought by a federal, state or foreign authority could result in significant civil, criminal and/or administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, exclusion from participation in government programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, injunctions, private “qui tam” actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government, or refusal to allow us to enter into government contracts, contractual damages, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings, additional reporting requirements and/or oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement. In addition, our reputation could be damaged and adoption of the products could be impaired. Further discussion of the health care laws and regulations

that may affect our can be found in “Item 1A—Risk Factors” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, under the risk factor titled: “We are subject to federal, state and foreign laws governing our business practices which, if violated, could result in substantial penalties and harm our reputation and business.”
 CBER is the center within the FDA principally responsible for regulating the INTERCEPT Blood System. In addition to regulating our blood safety products, CBER also regulates the blood collection centers and would regulate any blood products that they prepare using the INTERCEPT Blood System. Many U.S.-based blood centers have completed and obtained site-specific licenses from CBER that allows them to make INTERCEPT-treated blood products available to their interstate hospital customers. Any significant product change that we make may require amendments or supplements to those site-specific licenses that could limit availability of INTERCEPT-treated blood products until the amendment or supplement is approved. Additionally, hospital customers of ours or of any of our blood center customers may need to go through the administrative process of generating internal tracking codes to integrate INTERCEPT-treated products into their inventories or may need to amend or adjust those codes in connection with a significant product change that we make, which may adversely impact our ability to sell products in the U.S. Increasingly, the competent authorities of other countries are also developing equivalent rules and obligations.
 We supply the INTERCEPT Blood System for Cryoprecipitation to select blood centers that manufacture IFC for us. We plan to sell the finished IFC made by our manufacturing blood center partners directly to hospitals. Similar to our platelet and plasma products, any blood center manufacturing IFC will need to complete their process validations and obtain site-specific licenses from CBER before we or they can sell finished IFC to hospital customers outside of the states producing IFC. While one of our manufacturing partners received its BLA from CBER in 2021, we plan to continue working with our other U.S.-based blood centers manufacturing partners to support these activities and any delay in obtaining these licenses would adversely impact the nationwide availability of our finished IFC in the U.S. In addition, we have entered into certain agreements with blood centers and blood center affiliate organizations to sell the INTERCEPT Blood System for Cryoprecipitation kits which will allow those blood centers and blood center affiliate organizations to produce finished IFC for their own sales efforts to hospitals.
 The preclinical and clinical studies of the INTERCEPT Blood System for red blood cells have been conducted using prototype system disposables and devices. In addition to the clinical trials, a number of manufacturing and validation activities must be completed before we could sell the red blood cell product.
 We believe that in deciding whether the INTERCEPT Blood System is safe and effective regulatory authorities have taken, and are expected to take, into account whether it adversely affects the therapeutic efficacy of blood components as compared to the therapeutic efficacy of blood components not treated with INTERCEPT. Data from human clinical studies must demonstrate the safety of treated blood components and their therapeutic comparability to untreated blood components. In addition, regulatory authorities will weigh INTERCEPT’s safety, including potential toxicities of the inactivation compounds, and other risks against the benefits of using the system in a blood supply that has become safer. We have conducted many toxicology studies designed to demonstrate the INTERCEPT Blood System’s safety. There can be no assurance that regulatory authorities will not require further toxicology or other studies of our products. Based on discussions with the FDA and European Union regulatory authorities, we believe that data only from laboratory and animal studies, not data from human clinical studies, will be required to demonstrate the system’s efficacy in reducing pathogens. In light of these criteria, our clinical trial programs for the INTERCEPT Blood System consist of studies that differ from typical Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical studies.
 We have relatively little human or commercial use data supporting our IFC product. Accordingly, prospective blood center manufacturing partners, hospitals or physicians may require additional commercially derived data before choosing to use IFC. Such studies may be costly and require the use of third-party clinical research organizations, or CROs, or data capture methods and may take a considerable amount of time to generate sufficient data before we can achieve broad market acceptance, if ever.
 We may be subject to diverse laws and regulations relating to data privacy and security as a result of our employee data or other personal information that we may collect. In addition, if we do collect personal data as part of any clinical trials or other testing, we would be subject to regulatory obligations. This includes, in the U.S., the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, or CCPA, in the European Economic Area, or EEA, the EU General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR (Regulation 2016/679) and the related national rules of the individual EEA countries, and in the United Kingdom, or UK, the UK GDPR. New privacy rules are being enacted in the U.S. and globally, and existing ones are being expanded, updated and strengthened. Effective May 25, 2018, the EU GDPR, a broad data protection framework that expanded the scope of EU data protection laws to entities that process the personal information of EU subjects, including employee data and clinical trial data that may be processed outside the EU entered into application. The EU GDPR introduced more stringent operational requirements than its predecessor legislation.
 Further, the Court of Justice of the European Union ruled in July 2020 that the Privacy Shield, used by thousands of companies to transfer data between the European Union and United States, was invalid and could no longer be used. In September 2020, Switzerland concluded that the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework did not provide an adequate level of protection for data transfers from Switzerland to the United States. Alternative transfer mechanisms may be used, including the standard contractual clauses, or SCCs, while the authorities interpret the decisions and scope of the invalidated Privacy Shield, but the SCCs have also been called into question in the same ruling that invalidated Privacy Shield. Other states have enacted data privacy laws. For example, Virginia passed the

Consumer Data Protection Act, and Colorado passed the Colorado Privacy Act, both of which differ from the CCPA and became effective in 2023.
Also, in June 2018, the State of California enacted the CCPA, which became effective in January 2020. The CCPA establishes a privacy framework for covered businesses, including an expansive definition of personal information and data privacy rights for California residents. The CCPA includes a framework with potentially severe statutory damages and private rights of action. The CCPA requires covered companies to provide new disclosures to California consumers (as that word is broadly defined in the CCPA), provide such consumers new ways to opt-out of certain sales of personal information, and allow for a new cause of action for data breaches.
Further, California voters approved a new privacy law, the California Privacy Rights Act, or CPRA, in the November 3, 2020, election. Effective starting on January 1, 2023, the CPRA significantly modifies the CCPA, including by expanding consumers’ rights with respect to certain sensitive personal information. The CPRA also creates a new state agency that will be vested with authority to implement and enforce the CCPA and the CPRA.
 Further discussion of our regulatory and clinical trial status can be found in “Item 1A—Risk Factors” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, under the risk factors titled “Clinical trials are costly and time consuming, may take longer than we expect or may not be completed at all, and their outcomes are uncertain. A failure to generate data in clinical trials to support expanded label claims or to support marketing approvals or certification for our product candidates could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects” and “The red blood cell system is currently in development and may never receive any marketing approvals or CE Certificates of Conformity,” as well as generally under the heading “Risks Related to Regulatory Approval, CE Certificates of Conformity and Oversight, and Other Legal Compliance Matters.”
 U.S. Health Care Reimbursement and Reform
 Our ability to commercialize our products successfully in the U.S. will depend in part on the extent to which coverage and appropriate reimbursement levels for the cost of the products and related treatment are obtained. The INTERCEPT Blood System is currently sold to U.S. based blood collection entities. Because our INTERCEPT processing kits are not directly reimbursable by governmental or commercial third-party payors, adoption of the INTERCEPT Blood System will, in part, require coverage and adequate reimbursement to be provided for the procedures and treatments which utilize INTERCEPT-processed blood products. There is no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement among third-party payors, as such, coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payor to payor. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for a particular procedure or treatment, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. If the costs to hospitals for INTERCEPT-processed blood products acquired from blood collection entities cannot be easily, readily, or fully incorporated into the hospital’s existing coverage and reimbursement structure, adoption of our products may be negatively affected.
 In the U.S., there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system that could affect our future results of operations. For example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively, the ACA, and ongoing cost saving efforts may have an impact on our ability to profitably commercialize the INTERCEPT Blood System in the U.S. and elsewhere. The ACA and other health care reform in the U.S. include provisions that place downward pressure on the pricing of medical products, which could further impact our profit margins.
 Since its enactment, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to numerous provisions of the ACA. In addition, President Trump signed two Executive Orders and other directives designed to delay the implementation of certain provisions of the ACA or otherwise circumvent some of the requirements for health insurance mandated by the ACA. Concurrently, Congress has considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the ACA. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, it has enacted laws that modify certain provisions of the ACA such as removing penalties as of January 1, 2019, for not complying with the ACA’s individual mandate to carry health insurance and delaying the implementation of certain ACA-mandated fees. On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed a challenge on procedural grounds that argued that the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress. Further, on August 16, 2022, President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, or IRA, into law, which among other things, extends enhanced subsidies for individuals purchasing health insurance coverage in ACA marketplaces through plan year 2025. The IRA also eliminates the “donut hole” under the Medicare Part D program beginning in 2025 by significantly lowering the beneficiary maximum out-of-pocket cost and creating a new manufacturer discount program. It is possible that the ACA will be subject to judicial or Congressional challenges in the future. It is unclear how any such challenges and the health care reform measures of the Biden administration will impact the ACA.
In addition, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny to control the rising cost of healthcare. For example, such scrutiny has resulted in several recent congressional inquiries, presidential executive orders, and federal and state legislative activity designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to pricing and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for pharmaceutical products.
 Further discussion of the impact of health care reform and laws governing our business practices on our business can be found in “Item 1A—Risk Factors” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, under the risk factors titled “Legislative, regulatory, or other healthcare reforms may make it more difficult and costly for us to obtain regulatory approval or CE Certificates of Conformity of our products and

to produce, market and distribute our products after approval or certification is obtained” and “We are subject to federal, state and foreign laws governing our business practices which, if violated, could result in substantial penalties and harm our reputation and business.”
