Item 1. Business.
 
Unless the context otherwise requires, all references in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to “P.A.M.,” the “Company,” “we,” “our,” or “us” mean P.A.M. Transportation Services, Inc. and its subsidiaries.
 
We are a truckload dry van carrier transporting general commodities throughout the continental United States, as well as in certain Canadian provinces. We also provide transportation services in Mexico under agreements with Mexican carriers. Our freight consists primarily of automotive parts, expedited goods, consumer goods, such as general retail store merchandise, and manufactured goods, such as heating and air conditioning units.
 
P.A.M. Transportation Services, Inc. is a holding company incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware in June 1986. We conduct operations and hold assets principally through the following wholly owned subsidiaries: P.A.M. Transport, Inc., Met Express, Inc., Costar Real Estate Holding, Inc., Costar Equipment, Inc., Unmoored Realty, LLC, T.T.X., LLC, P.A.M. Cartage Carriers, LLC, Overdrive Leasing, LLC, Choctaw Express, LLC, Choctaw Brokerage, Inc., Transcend Logistics, Inc., Decker Transport Co., LLC, East Coast Transport and Logistics, LLC, S & L Logistics, Inc., P.A.M. International, Inc, and P.A.M. Mexico Holdings LLC. Our operating authorities are held by P.A.M. Transport, Inc., P.A.M. Cartage Carriers, LLC, Choctaw Express, LLC, Choctaw Brokerage, Inc., T.T.X., LLC, Decker Transport Co., LLC, and East Coast Transport and Logistics, LLC. Effective on January 1, 2010, the operations of most of the Company’s operating subsidiaries were consolidated under the P.A.M. Transport, Inc. name in an effort to more clearly reflect the Company’s scope and available service offerings.
 
We are headquartered and maintain our primary terminal, maintenance facilities, and our corporate and administrative offices in Tontitown, Arkansas, which is located in northwest Arkansas, a major center for the trucking industry and where the support services for most major truck and trailer equipment manufacturers are readily available.
 
Segment Financial Information
 
The Company's operations are all in the motor carrier segment and are aggregated into a single reporting segment in accordance with the aggregation criteria under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”).
Operations
 
Our operations can generally be classified into truckload services or brokerage and logistics services. This designation is based primarily on the ownership of the asset that performed the freight transportation service. Truckload services are performed by Company divisions that generally utilize Company-owned trucks, long-term contractors, or single-trip contractors to transport loads of freight for customers, while brokerage and logistics services coordinate or facilitate the transport of loads of freight for customers and generally involve the utilization of single-trip contractors. Both our truckload operations and our brokerage and logistics operations have similar economic characteristics and are impacted by virtually the same economic factors as discussed elsewhere in this Report. Truckload services operating revenues, before fuel surcharges, represented 66.1%, 67.0% and 76.9% of total operating revenues for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The remaining operating revenues, before fuel surcharge, for the same periods were generated by brokerage and logistics services, representing 33.9%, 33.0% and 23.1%, respectively.
 
Approximately 66% of the Company's revenues are derived from domestic shipments while approximately 34% of the Company’s revenues are derived from freight originating from or destined to locations in Mexico or Canada.

Impact of COVID-19 
 
The Company’s primary concern during the COVID-19 pandemic has been to do its part to protect its employees, customers, vendors and the general public from the spread of COVID-19 while continuing to serve the vital role of supplying essential goods to the nation. Where feasible, our employees are working remotely from their homes. For essential functions, including our driving professionals, we have distributed cleaning and protective supplies to various terminals so that they are available to those that need them, increased cleaning frequency and coverage, and provided employees direction on precautionary measures, such as sanitizing truck interiors, personal hygiene, and social distancing. We will continue to adapt our operations as required to ensure safety while continuing to provide a high level of service to our customers.
 
While we and most of our customers have returned to normal operations and economic activity continued to increase during 2021 and 2022, we continue to monitor ongoing developments with the COVID-19 pandemic. Any future waves or outbreaks of alternative strains of the virus, including the current spread of the Delta and Omicron variants, could adversely impact our future operations and financial results.
 
On September 9, 2021, President Biden announced that he has directed the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) to develop an Emergency Temporary Standard (ETS) mandating either the full vaccination or weekly testing of employees for employers with 100 or more employees. On January 13, 2022, the Supreme Court ruled that the mandate could not be enforced. We will continue to monitor new regulations for any potential impacts to our operations.
 
The ultimate extent of the impact of any future outbreaks or adverse developments with the pandemic on the Company’s financial and operating results, which could be material, will be determined by the length of time such outbreak continues, its severity, further government regulations imposed in response to the pandemic and the effect of any such outbreak on the economy and transportation demand.
 
The Company believes we will be able to continue to finance our near-term needs for working capital over the next twelve months, as well as any planned capital expenditures during such period, with cash balances, cash flows from operations, and borrowings believed to be available from financing sources.
 
Business and Growth Strategy
 
Our strategy focuses on the following elements:
 
Providing a Full Suite of Complimentary Truckload Transportation Solutions. Our objective is to provide our customers with a comprehensive solution to their truckload transportation needs. Our array of asset-based service offerings consists of dedicated, expedited, automotive, local, regional, and long-haul truckload services. Our brokerage and logistics solutions offer similar services but utilize third-party equipment to expand available capacity. Our area of service includes the continental United States, Mexico and to a lesser degree Canada.
Developing Customer Relationships within High Density Traffic Lanes. We strive to maximize utilization and increase revenue per truck while minimizing our time and empty miles between loads. In this regard, we seek to provide equipment to our customers in defined regions and disciplined traffic lanes. This strategy enables us to:

· | maintain more consistent equipment capacity;
--+---------------------------------------------


· | provide a high level of service to our customers, including time-sensitive delivery schedules;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | attract and retain drivers; and
--+--------------------------------


· | maintain a sound safety record as drivers travel familiar routes.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------

Providing Superior and Flexible Customer Service. We strive to provide a very high level of service to our customers, thus creating a level of satisfaction, value and loyalty within our customer base. We closely monitor each shipment for compliance regarding scheduled pickup, delivery and transit times, service levels and customer specific expectations. We provide verbal and electronic updates through various forums to customers to allow visibility of their products as they progress through the transport process.
 
Many of our customers depend on us to deliver shipments on a time-definite basis, meaning that parts or raw materials are scheduled for delivery as they are needed on a manufacturer’s production line. The need for this service is a product of modern manufacturing and assembly methods that are designed to decrease inventory levels and handling costs. Such requirements place a premium on our delivery performance and reliability.
 
Employing Stringent Cost Controls. Throughout our organization, emphasis is placed on gaining efficiency in our processes with the primary goals of decreasing costs and improving customer satisfaction. Maintaining a high level of efficiency and prioritizing our focus on improvements allows us to minimize the number of non-driving personnel we employ and positively influence other overhead costs. Expenses are intensely scrutinized for opportunities for elimination, reduction or to further leverage our purchasing power to achieve more favorable pricing.
Industry
 
According to the American Trucking Association’s “American Trucking Trends 2022” report, the trucking industry generated over $875 billion in revenue during 2021 which represented approximately 80% of the total U.S. freight spend. The truckload industry is highly fragmented and is impacted by several economic and business factors, many of which are beyond the control of individual carriers. The state of the economy, coupled with equipment capacity levels, can impact freight rates. Volatility of various operating expenses, such as fuel and insurance, make the predictability of profit levels uncertain. Availability, attraction, retention and compensation of drivers also affect operating costs, as well as equipment utilization. In addition, the capital requirements for equipment, availability of equipment and potential uncertainty of used equipment values, impact the ability of many carriers to expand their operations.
 
The current operating environment is characterized by the following:
 

· | competition for drivers;
--+-------------------------


· | competition for freight;
--+-------------------------


· | price increases by truck and trailer equipment manufacturers;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


· | volatile fuel costs; and
--+-------------------------


· | pressure on less profitable or undercapitalized carriers to consolidate or exit the industry.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Competition 
 
The trucking industry is highly competitive and includes thousands of carriers, none of which dominates the market in which the Company operates. The Company's market share is less than 1%, and we compete primarily with other medium and long-haul truckload carriers, with private carriage conducted by our existing and potential customers, and, to a lesser extent, with the railroads. We compete on the basis of quality of service and delivery performance, as well as price. Many of the carriers we compete with have substantially greater financial resources, own more equipment or carry a larger total volume of freight as compared to the Company.

Marketing and Significant Customers
 
Our marketing emphasis is directed to that portion of the truckload market which is generally service-sensitive, as opposed to being solely price driven. We seek to become a “core carrier” for our customers in order to maintain high utilization and capitalize on recurring revenue opportunities. Our marketing efforts are diversified and designed to gain access to dedicated, expedited, regional, automotive, and long-haul opportunities (including those in Mexico and Canada) and to expand brokerage and logistics offerings.
 
Our sales efforts are conducted by a staff of eleven employees who are located in our major markets and supervised from our headquarters. These individuals work to improve profitability by maintaining an even flow of freight traffic (taking into account the balance between originations and destinations in a given geographical area), high utilization, and minimizing movement of empty equipment.
 
Our five largest customers, for which we provide carrier services covering a number of geographic locations, accounted for approximately 39%, 33% and 35% of our total revenues in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. General Motors Company accounted for approximately 13%, 11% and 15% of our revenues in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Walmart Inc. accounted for approximately 9%, 9% and 5% of our revenues in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles accounted for approximately 6%, 5% and 5% of our revenues in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
 
We also provide transportation services to other manufacturers who are suppliers for automobile manufacturers. Approximately 31%, 27% and 30% of our revenues were derived from transportation services provided to the automobile industry during 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
 
Revenue Equipment
 
At December 31, 2022, we operated a fleet of 2,451 trucks, which included 407 independent contractor trucks. At December 31, 2022, our trailer fleet consisted of 7,784 trailers. Our company-owned trucks and leased trucks are late model, well-maintained, premium trucks, which we believe help to attract and retain drivers, maximize fuel efficiency, promote safe operations, minimize maintenance and repair costs, and improve customer service by minimizing service interruptions caused by breakdowns. The average age of our trucks and trailers as of December 31, 2022 was 2.1 years and 6.6 years, respectively. We evaluate our equipment purchasing decisions based on factors such as initial cost, useful life, warranty terms, expected maintenance costs, fuel economy, driver comfort, customer needs, manufacturer support, and resale value.
 
We contract with independent contractors to provide greater flexibility in responding to fluctuations in consumer demand. Independent contractors provide their own trucks and are contractually responsible for all associated expenses, including financing costs, fuel, maintenance, insurance, and taxes, among other things. They are also responsible for maintaining compliance with the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration regulations.
 
Technology
 
Our trucks are equipped with cellular-based global positioning and communications systems that allow fleet managers to communicate directly with drivers. Drivers provide location, status, and informational updates directly to our computer system which increases productivity, convenience, and customer visibility. This system provides information that allows us to calculate accurate estimated time of arrival information, which helps to optimize planning and customer service levels.
 
Our information systems manage the data provided by our on-board devices to update system information regarding the location and load status of our trucks, which permits us to better manage customer delivery schedules, respond to customer inquiries, and perform optimized equipment to load matching, among various other planning and support functions. In many instances, our systems also directly provide real-time information electronically to our customers regarding the status of freight shipments and anticipated arrival times, adding flexibility and convenience by extending supply chain visibility.

Maintenance
 
We have a strictly-enforced, comprehensive preventive maintenance program for our trucks and trailers. Inspections and various levels of preventive maintenance are performed at set intervals on both trucks and trailers. A maintenance and safety inspection is performed on all vehicles each time they return to a terminal.
 
Our trucks typically carry full warranty coverage for at least three years or 375,000 miles. Extended truck warranties are often negotiated with the truck manufacturers and manufacturers of major components, such as engine, transmission, and differential manufacturers, for up to five years or 625,000 miles. Our trailers carry full warranties by the manufacturer for up to seven years with certain components covered for up to ten years.
 
Human Capital Resources
 
Overview. At December 31, 2022, we employed 3,395 persons, of whom 2,575 were drivers, 259 were employed in maintenance, 309 were employed in operations, 74 were employed in marketing, 109 were employed in safety and personnel, and 69 were employed in general administration and accounting. A total of 3,379 of our employees were employed on a full-time basis as of December 31, 2022. None of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining unit, and we believe that our employee relations are good.
 
At December 31, 2022, we also had 407 drivers for independent contractors under contract who were compensated on a per mile basis. Our drivers are paid for an array of services, including calculated miles driven, loading and unloading, additional stops, detention and layovers, among other things.
 
We contract with independent contractors to supply one or more trucks and drivers for our use. Independent contractors must pay their own truck expenses, fuel, maintenance, insurance, and driver costs. They must meet and operate within our guidelines with respect to safety. We have a lease-purchase program whereby we offer independent contractors the opportunity to lease a truck, with the option to purchase the truck at the end of the lease term. We believe our lease-purchase program has contributed to our ability to attract and retain independent contractors. At December 31, 2022, approximately 288 independent contractors were leasing 428 trucks in this program.
 
Diversity and Inclusion. We believe diversity, equity, and inclusion are critical to our ability to win in the marketplace and enable our workforce and communities to succeed. Specifically, having a diverse and inclusive workplace allows us to attract and retain the best employees to deliver results for our shareholders. A qualified, diverse and inclusive workforce also helps us represent the broad cross-section of ideas, values, and beliefs of our employees, customers, and communities. Our commitment to diversity and inclusion means that we will continue to strive to establish and improve an inclusive workplace environment where employees from all backgrounds can succeed and be heard.
Employee Health and Safety. We are committed to being an industry leader in health and safety standards. The physical health, wellbeing, and mental health of our employees is crucial to our success. Most recently, our primary concern during the COVID-19 pandemic has been to do our part to protect our employees, customers, vendors and the general public from the spread of COVID-19 while continuing to serve the vital role of supplying essential goods to the nation. For essential functions, including our driving professionals, we have distributed cleaning and protective supplies to various terminals so that they are available to those that need them, increased cleaning frequency and coverage, and provided employees direction on precautionary measures, such as sanitizing truck interiors, personal hygiene, and social distancing. We will continue to adapt our operations as required to ensure safety while continuing to provide a high level of service to our customers.
 
In addition to strict application screening and drug testing, before being permitted to operate a vehicle, our drivers must undergo classroom instruction on our policies and procedures, safety techniques as taught by the Smith System of Defensive Driving, and the proper operation of equipment, and must pass both written and road tests. Instruction in defensive driving and safety techniques continues after hiring, with seminars at several of our terminals. At December 31, 2022, we employed 81 persons on a full-time basis in our driver recruiting, training and safety instruction programs.

Talent Acquisition, Retention and Development. We continually strive to hire, develop and retain the top talent in our industry. Critical to attracting and retaining top talent is employee satisfaction, and we regularly implement programs to increase employee satisfaction. We reward our employees by providing competitive compensation, benefits and incentives throughout all levels in our organization, including for our drivers. Drivers can earn bonuses by recruiting other qualified drivers who become employed by us, and both cash and non-cash prizes are awarded for achieving certain safety and fuel efficiency goals.
 
Intense competition in the trucking industry for qualified drivers has resulted in additional expense to recruit and retain an adequate supply of drivers and has had a negative impact on the industry. Our operations have also been impacted and we have occasionally experienced under-utilization and increased expenses due to a shortage of qualified drivers. We place a high priority on the recruitment and retention of an adequate supply of qualified drivers.
 
Our truck fleet averages 2.1 years old, keeping our drivers safe, comfortable, and on the road. With many dedicated and over-the-road assignments, we allow our drivers to select routes that fit their lifestyles.
 
Available Information
 
The Company maintains a website where additional information concerning its business can be found. The website address is www.pamtransport.com. On our website, under the caption “Investors,” the Company makes available, free of charge, its Annual Report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) as soon as reasonably practicable after it electronically files or furnishes such materials to the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Seasonality
 
Generally, our revenues do not exhibit a significant seasonal pattern; however, revenue is affected by adverse weather conditions, holidays and the number of business days that occur during a given period because revenue is directly related to the available work days of shippers. Operating expenses are typically higher in the winter months primarily due to decreased fuel efficiency and increased maintenance costs associated with inclement weather. In addition, automobile plants for which we transport a large amount of freight typically undergo scheduled shutdowns in July and December, and the volume of automotive freight we ship is reduced during such scheduled plant shutdowns.
Regulation 
 
We are a common and contract motor carrier regulated by various United States federal and state, Canadian provincial, and Mexican federal agencies. These regulatory agencies have broad powers, generally governing matters such as authority to engage in motor carrier operations, motor carrier registration, driver hours-of-service (“HOS”), drug and alcohol testing of drivers, and safety, size, and weight of transportation equipment. The primary regulatory agencies affecting the Company’s operations include the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (“FMCSA”), the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Agency, and the Surface Transportation Board, which are all agencies within the U.S. Department of Transportation (“DOT”). We believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable regulatory requirements relating to our business and operate with a “satisfactory” rating (the highest of three rating categories) from the DOT. In addition, we are subject to compliance with cargo-security and transportation regulations issued by the Transportation Security Administration, a component department within the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. To the extent that we conduct operations outside the United States, we are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which generally prohibits U.S. companies and their intermediaries from offering bribes to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining favorable treatment.
 
In December 2011, the FMCSA released new rules regulating HOS that became effective in July 2013. These rules reduced the maximum hours that could be worked in a consecutive seven-day period from 82 to 70, required that a driver take a mandatory thirty-minute break during each consecutive eight hour driving period, and required that a driver take a 34-hour rest period, or restart, that included two periods between 1:00 a.m. and 5:00 a.m. that could only be used one time every seven calendar days.

In July 2012, Congress passed legislation renewing the mandate for electronic logging devices and designated authority to the FMCSA to propose a new rule. In December 2015, the FMCSA amended the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations to establish minimum performance and design standards for HOS electronic logging devices (“ELDs”), requirements for the mandatory use of these devices by drivers currently required to prepare HOS records of duty status, requirements concerning HOS supporting documents, and measures to address concerns about harassment resulting from the mandatory use of ELDs. In May 2018 the FMCSA released a notice that they would allow a motor carrier that installed and required its drivers to use an Automatic on Board Recording Device (“AOBRD”) before December 18, 2017 and who uses registered ELD capable devices that run compliant AOBRD software to continue to do so until December 16, 2019. The Company was an early adopter of ELD capable devices, requiring the devices to be installed on its entire fleet and requiring its drivers to use AOBRD’s since 2010. These rulings affect the majority of carriers, including us, and the Company’s ELD devices were in compliance with FMCA requirements prior to the December 16, 2019 deadline.
 
The FMCSA administers carrier safety compliance and enforcement through its Compliance, Safety, Accountability (“CSA”) program that became effective in December 2010. CSA is designed to measure and evaluate the safety performance of carriers and drivers through categorization of inspection and crash results into Behavior Analysis and Safety Improvement Categories (“BASICs”) including unsafe/fatigued driving, driver fitness, controlled substances and alcohol, maintenance, cargo, and crashes. BASIC scores are evaluated relative to carrier peer groups to determine carriers that exceed certain thresholds, identifying them for intervention. Intervention status might include targeted roadside inspections, onsite investigations and the development of cooperative safety plans, among other things. Ongoing compliance with CSA may result in additional expenses to the Company or a reduction in the pool of drivers eligible for us to hire. In addition to FMCSA action, a BASIC score that exceeds an intervention threshold might have a negative impact on our ability to attract customers and drivers.
 
The Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (“NHTSA”) jointly developed new standards for various vehicles, including heavy duty trucks, that were adopted in August 2011 and cover model years 2014 through 2018. The standard adopted for heavy duty trucks was intended to achieve a reduction in CO2 and fuel consumption ranging from 7% to 20% by model year 2017. In August 2016, the EPA and NHTSA finalized the second phase of these standards which will further reduce greenhouse gas emissions and fuel consumption for heavy duty trucks through model year 2027. In December of 2022, the EPA finalized an additional phase of standards which is intended to reduce nitrous oxide (NOx) emissions to 0.035 grams per horsepower-hour during normal operation, 0.05 grams at low load and 10.0 grams at idle for vehicles with model years 2027 and above. Compliance with these federal and state requirements has increased the cost of our equipment and may further increase the cost of replacement equipment in the future.
 
The FMCSA Commercial Driver’s License (“CDL”) Drug and Alcohol Clearinghouse (“Clearinghouse”) became effective January 6, 2020. This new database contains information pertaining to violations of the U.S. Department of Transportation controlled substances and alcohol testing program for holders of CDL’s. The Clearinghouse rules requires FMCSA regulated employers, among others, to report to the Clearinghouse information related to violations of the drug and alcohol regulations. Further, the rules require that FMCSA regulated employers query current and prospective employees’ drug and alcohol violations before permitting those employees to operate a commercial motor vehicle on public roads, and to recheck each employee annually. The system is intended to remove the ability of prospective employees to fail to disclose past drug and alcohol violations at previous employers to potential employers. We anticipate enforcement of the Clearinghouse will remove certain drivers from the pool of drivers available to the industry and increase competition and related costs to attract and retain the remaining qualified drivers.

Our motor carrier operations are subject to additional. environmental laws and regulations, including laws and regulations dealing with the transportation of hazardous materials and other environmental matters, and our operations involve certain inherent environmental risks. These laws and regulations have the effect of increasing the costs, risks and liabilities associated with our applicable operations. If current regulatory requirements become more stringent or new environmental laws and regulations are introduced, we could be required to make significant expenditures or abandon certain activities. Our operations involve the risks of fuel spillage or seepage, environmental damage, and hazardous waste disposal, among others. We have instituted programs to monitor and control environmental risks and assure compliance with applicable environmental laws. As part of our safety and risk management program, we periodically perform internal environmental reviews so that we can achieve environmental compliance and avoid environmental risk. We transport a minimal amount of environmentally hazardous substances and, to date, have experienced no significant claims for hazardous materials shipments. If we should fail to comply with applicable regulations, we could be subject to substantial fines or penalties and to civil and criminal liability.
 
As global warming issues become more prevalent, federal, state and local governments, as well as some of our customers, have made efforts to respond to these issues. This increased focus on sustainability may result in new legislation or regulations and customer requirements that could negatively affect us as we may incur additional costs or be required to make changes to our operations in order to comply with any new regulations or customer requirements. Legislation or regulations that potentially impose restrictions, caps, taxes, or other controls on emissions of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, a by-product of burning fossil fuels such as those used in the Company’s trucks, could adversely affect our operations and financial results. More specifically, legislative or regulatory actions relating to climate change could adversely impact the Company by increasing our fuel costs and reducing fuel efficiency and could result in the creation of substantial additional capital expenditures and operating costs in the form of taxes, emissions allowances, or required equipment upgrades.
 
Company operations are often conducted in industrial areas, where truck terminals and other industrial activities are conducted, and where groundwater or other forms of environmental contamination have occurred, which could potentially expose us to claims that we contributed to the environmental contamination.
 
We believe we are currently in material compliance with applicable laws and regulations and that the cost of compliance has not materially affected results of operations.
