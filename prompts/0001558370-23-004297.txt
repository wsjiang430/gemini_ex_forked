Item 1. Business
Overview
 “Southland” is a diverse leader in specialty infrastructure construction with roots dating back to 1900. We design and construct projects in the following end markets: bridges, tunnels, transportation and facilities, marine, steel structures, water and wastewater treatment, and water pipelines.
At Southland, our mission is to build great things that shape our landscape and foster sustainable infrastructure for future generations. We do this with integrity, never compromising our ethics, and putting the safety and well-being of our employees, and stakeholders, first.
Southland is based in Grapevine, Texas. It is the parent company of Johnson Bros. Corporation, American Bridge Company, Oscar Renda Contracting, Southland Contracting, Mole Constructors, and Heritage Materials. With the combined capabilities of these six subsidiaries, Southland has become a diversified industry leader with projects spanning North America in various end markets.
During the year ended December 31, 2022, and prior to the Merger, Legato II was a blank check company incorporated as a Delaware corporation and formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities.
Recent Developments
On February 14, 2023, we consummated the Merger. At the closing of the Merger, among other things, Legato II issued 33,793,111 shares of Common Stock to the former members of Southland LLC in exchange for their membership interests in Southland LLC. 
In connection with the Business Combination, Legato II change its name to “Southland Holdings, Inc.” Our Common Stock and Warrants are now listed on the NYSE under the symbols “SLND” and “SLNDW,” respectively.
Reportable Segments
We manage Southland in two distinct segments: Civil and Transportation.
Our Civil segment operates throughout North America and specializes in services that include the design and construction of water pipeline, pump stations, lift stations, water and wastewater treatment plants, concrete and structural steel, outfall, and tunneling.
Our Transportation segment operates throughout North America and specializes in services that include the design and construction of bridges, roadways, marine, dredging, ship terminals and piers, and specialty structures and facilities. Our Transportation segment is responsible for the construction of bridges and structures throughout North America, and other parts of the world, including many of the most recognizable bridges, convention centers, sports stadiums, marine facilities, and ferris wheels in the world.
Customers
Our customers are a mixture of public and private entities. Our public sector includes certain federal agencies, state departments of transportation, local transit authorities, county and city public works departments, and utilities, while our private customers consist largely of the owners of industrial, commercial, and residential sites. The majority of both our public and private customers are located in the United States; however, we have large projects in Canada and the Bahamas and experience in worldwide markets.

The management within each of our business segments is responsible for cultivating and maintaining successful long-term relationships with customers. Our local management teams build relationships with current and potential customers in order to better understand and serve their needs which benefits us in the competitive bid process.
We believe that our strategic relationships with customers will result in future opportunities. While relationships are important, we realize that future opportunities also require cost effective bids, as pricing is a key element for most construction projects.
Strategy
Southland exists to build great things that shape our landscape and foster reliable infrastructure for future generations. Across our regional base of offices, Southland provides both Civil and Transportation infrastructure projects to a diverse base of public and private clients. These clients benefit from our market intelligence, local relationships, and our expert knowledge of design and construction.

● | Self-Performance and Technical Experts. Our business model emphasizes self-performance of a significant portion of our work. This allows us to better manage costs by minimizing the use of third-party service providers, which can be more difficult to budget and can delay project schedules. Our expertise in a wide range of technical areas allows us to form internal joint ventures which contribute to better cost management.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Significantly Owned Equipment Fleet. Many of our services are equipment intensive. The cost of construction equipment, and in some cases, the availability of construction equipment, provides a significant barrier to entry into several of our businesses. We believe that our preference of ownership, rather than reliance on renting and leasing, of a large and varied construction fleet and maintenance facilities enhances our access to reliable equipment at a favorable cost and allows us to capture additional margin. We currently own and maintain more than 3,500 active pieces of equipment with a fair market value exceeding $300 million.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Selective Bidding. We selectively bid on projects that we believe offer an opportunity to meet our profitability objectives or that offer the opportunity to enter promising new markets. In addition, we review our bidding opportunities to attempt to minimize concentration of work with any one customer, in any one industry, or in stressed labor markets. We believe that by carefully positioning ourselves in market segments that have meaningful barriers to entry, we can continue to be competitive.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Maintain a Strong Balance Sheet and Bonding Capacity. We maintain a strong balance sheet and bonding capacity to target large contract work. This limits the number of competitors we bid against, as smaller, local companies are often not able to bid on larger projects.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Geographically Diverse. We have people and offices across North America which allow us to compete at a national level rather than being restricted to certain regions or states.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Growth Through Controlled Expansion. We continue to grow Southland by expanding the scope of services offered or through growing our market share in our existing specialties. In addition, we continue to evaluate acquisitions that offer growth opportunities and the ability to leverage our resources and expertise as a leader in the Transportation and Civil segments.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Appropriate Mix of Large-Scale and Small-Scale Projects. We target a mix of large-scale and small-scale projects in our bidding which mitigates risk as it relates to specific customers or projects.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Seasonality, Cyclicality, and Variability
The results of our operations are subject to quarterly variations. Much of the variation is the result of weather, particularly rain, ice, snow, heat, wind, and named storms, which can impact our ability to perform construction activities. These weather impacts can affect revenue and profitability in either of our business segments. Any quarter can be affected

either negatively or positively by atypical weather patterns in any part of North America, or other areas in which we operate. Traditionally, our first quarter is the most weather-affected; however, this will not necessarily be true in future periods.
Our business may also be affected by overall economic market declines, delays in new projects, by changes in client schedules, or for other reasons.
Competition and Market Trends
In both our Transportation and Civil segments, we have competitors within the individual markets and geographic areas in which we operate, ranging from small, local companies to larger regional, national, and international companies. Although the construction business is highly competitive, there are few, if any, companies which compete in all of our market areas, both geographically and from an end market perspective. The degree and type of competition is influenced by the type and scope of construction projects within individual markets. Equipment ownership and ability to self-perform across numerous disciplines are two of our significant competitive advantages. These two advantages contribute to what sets us apart from our competition. We believe that the primary factors influencing competition in our industry are price, reputation for quality, safety, schedule certainty, relevant experience, availability of field supervision and skilled labor, machinery and equipment, financial strength, as well as knowledge of local markets and conditions. We believe that we can compete favorably based on these factors.
Many of our competitors have the ability to perform work in either the private or public sectors. When opportunities for work in one sector are reduced, competitors tend to look for opportunities in the other sector. This migration has the potential to reduce revenue growth and/or increase pressure on gross profit margins.
We believe that the combination of our experience, reputation, and technical expertise are unmatched among companies of our size. This combination of skills has allowed us to pursue large-scale projects with fewer competitors.
Contract Provisions and Subcontracting
Our contracts are primarily obtained through competitive bidding. Occasionally, we obtain contracts through direct negotiations with customers. We are often invited to bid on projects with customers who maintain pre-qualified contractor lists. Contractors are selected for the pre-approved contractor lists by virtue of their prior performance for such customers, as well as their reputation, technical expertise, safety record, ability to obtain surety bonds, and experience.
When considering bid opportunities, we evaluate factors such as the customer, the geographic location of the work, the availability of labor, our competitive advantage or disadvantage relative to other bidders, our current and projected workload, the likelihood of additional work, our history with the client, contract terms, the project’s cost and profitability estimates, and other factors. We have an experienced estimating staff using sophisticated estimating systems. The project estimates form the basis of a project budget against which performance is tracked through a project cost system, thereby enabling management to monitor a project’s cost and schedule performance. Project costs are accumulated and monitored regularly against billings and payments to ensure proper tracking of cash flow on the project.
Most of our contracts allow for termination by either us or our customer. The terms of these contracts typically cover the reimbursement of our costs through a specified date, along with additional reimbursement for demobilizing our employees and equipment from the project site. Some contracts are subject to completion schedule requirements which can include liquidated damages in the event schedules are not met.
We serve as the prime contractor on the majority of our projects. In the construction industry, the prime contractor is responsible for the execution of the entire contract scope of work, including subcontract work. As prime contractor, we are responsible for work of our subcontractors, and we are potentially subject to increased costs and reputational risks associated with the failure of one or more of our subcontractors to perform their respective scope as defined in the contract. While we may subcontract specialized activities such as blasting, hazardous waste removal and selected electrical/instrumentation work, we self-perform most of the work on our projects with our own resources, including field supervision, labor, and equipment.

Contract Backlog
Contract backlog (“Backlog”) in our industry is an economic measure of the total value of work remaining to be performed on projects that we have been awarded. Backlog consists of two components: (1) unearned revenue and (2) awarded but not started. Unearned revenue includes the revenue we expect to record in the future on in-progress contracts, including 100% of our consolidated joint venture contracts and our proportionate share of unconsolidated joint venture contracts. Contracts that are awarded, but not yet started, are included in Backlog once a contract has been fully executed and/or we have received formal Notice to Proceed from the project owner.
Although contract backlog reflects business that we consider to be firm; deferrals, cancellations, or scope adjustments may occur. Backlog is adjusted to reflect any known project cancellations, revisions to project scope and cost, foreign currency exchange fluctuations, and project deferrals, as appropriate.
Fixed price contracts, particularly with federal, state, and local government customers, are expected to continue to represent a majority of our total Backlog.

​
Construction Costs and Raw Materials
We manage our business to minimize or eliminate exposure to labor and material price increases, including through inflation, in our bids for projects, when possible. Our contracts typically contain protections in the case of excessive increases in the cost of either labor or equipment. In our fixed price contracts, we bid with assumptions of increases in wages and prices of raw materials. Frequently, we obtain fixed price quotes from major subcontractors and material suppliers early in our project schedules. Our fixed price contract bids also tend to contain contingencies for inflation or other significant increases. The construction and other materials needed to complete our projects tends to be available locally from multiple suppliers which insulates us from being overly reliant on any particular vendor.
Supply-chain disruption has continued for many of the materials and inputs that we need to complete our projects. Specifically, prices of oil, gas, and other fuel sources have increased. Additionally, the cost and availability of many construction materials and labor has impacted project costs and scheduling. We have continued to mitigate these impacts to the extent possible by passing these costs on to our customers when possible and agreeing to fixed-cost contracts with suppliers and subcontractors for labor and materials.
Our operations can be impacted by increases in prices, whether caused by inflation or other economic factors. We attempt to recover anticipated increases in the cost of labor, materials, equipment, and fuel through price escalation provisions in certain contracts and by considering the estimated increases in costs in our bidding on new work. We often seek to get fixed-price bids from subcontractors and suppliers upon signing new contracts to control costs. For the years ended December 31, 2022, December 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, we did not have material impacts to our profitability due to increased costs. This does not mean that we will not incur increased costs due to increased costs in the future.
Due to the “COVID-19” pandemic and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the construction industry has experienced widespread supply chain impacts. Labor costs continue to increase due to shortages of qualified workers. Hiring and retaining our skilled workers continues to be a priority to avoid future potential labor shortages.

Risk Management, Insurance, and Bonding
We are insured to cover a broad range of exposures arising from our work in the construction industry. All of our policies have been procured with limits and deductibles or self-insured retention amounts of varying amounts per occurrence. We believe that our insurance coverage meets or exceeds our needs relating to any casualty or other type of insurance loss.
Our safety team has created an atmosphere of safety at our projects which has results in a favorable loss experience factor. Our safety directors and site-specific safety managers work together to assess and control potential losses and liabilities both before and during our construction projects. Our safety record is in-line with industry standards.
In our industry, we are generally required to possess various types of surety bonds guaranteeing our completion of projects for most public and private customer contracts. Surety bond costs and our ability to obtain surety bonds are largely contingent on our working capital, Backlog, past performance and reputation, capitalization, management and technical expertise, and other factors at the underwriter’s discretion. To date, we have been able to acquire the level of surety bonds necessary to support our business.
Government Regulations
Our business is subject to environmental, health and safety, government procurement, anti-bribery, and other government regulations and requirements. We believe that we have all of the necessary licenses required to conduct our operations and that we are in substantial compliance with applicable regulatory requirements.
Below is a summary of some of the significant regulations that impact our business.
Environmental
Our operations are subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations relating to the environment, including those relating to the Clean Water and Clean Air Acts. In addition, the Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) and other federal, state, local, and international agencies regulate our operations including in regards to the handling, transportation and disposal of non-hazardous and hazardous substances and waste, as well as emission and discharges into the environment; including discharges to air, surface water, groundwater, soil, and others.
We have a substantial investment in construction equipment that utilize diesel and gasoline fuel, which could be negatively impacted by regulations related to greenhouse gas emissions from such sources.
We are subject to laws and regulations governing the liability and cleanup responsibility for the release of hazardous substances into the environment. Under certain of these laws and regulations, liability can be assessed for sites to which hazardous substances or wastes were sent by current, or former operations at our facilities, or for the cleanup of previously owned or leased properties, irrespective of whether our activities were in violation of laws and regulations at the time or whether we directly caused the contamination. The presence of contamination from hazardous substances or wastes at our sites could preclude the sale, lease or use of our properties as collateral for financing.
We evaluate our compliance with environmental laws on a continual basis.
The majority of our revenue was recognized from contracts funded by federal, state, and local government agencies and authorities. Government contracts contain specific procurement regulations, contract provisions, and a variety of other requirements related to the formation, administration, project performance, and accounting. These agreements require certification of compliance.
Our operations are subject to various statutes and executive orders. These include but are not limited to:

● | the Davis-Bacon Act which regulates wages and benefits,
--+--------------------------------------------------------

9




● | Executive Order 11246 which establishes equal employment opportunity and affirmative action requirements,
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the Walsh-Healy Act which prescribes a minimum wage and regulates overtime and other working conditions,
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Executive Order 14063 which requires project labor agreements on all federal construction projects with contract values over $35 million,
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the Drug-Free Workplace Act, and
--+---------------------------------


● | the Federal Acquisition Regulation and the Federal Civil False Claims Act.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------

We are also subject to the rules and regulations promulgated by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) and the Mine Safety and Health Administration and other regulations. In addition, certain contracts within our government agency projects contain minimum Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (“DBE”) participation clauses.
These laws and regulations affect how we transact business and, in some instances, impose additional costs on our business operations, which may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. As further described in “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” violation of specific laws and regulations could lead to fines, contract termination, debarment of contractors and/or suspension of future contracts. Our government customers can also terminate, renegotiate or modify any of their contracts with us at their convenience.
Anti-Corruption and Bribery
We are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”). The FCPA prohibits U.S. and other business entities from making improper payments to foreign government officials, political parties or political party officials. We are also subject to the applicable anti-corruption laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate, thus potentially exposing us to liability and potential penalties in multiple jurisdictions. The anti-corruption provisions of the FCPA are enforced by the Department of Justice while other state or federal agencies may seek recourse against the Company for issues related to FCPA. In addition, the “SEC” requires strict compliance with certain accounting and internal control standards set forth under the FCPA. Failure to comply with the FCPA and other laws can expose us and/or individual employees to potentially severe criminal and civil penalties. Such penalties may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We devote resources to the development, maintenance, communication and enforcement of our Code of Conduct, our anti-bribery compliance policies, our internal control processes and compliance related policies. We strive to conduct timely internal investigations of potential violations and take appropriate action depending upon the outcome of the investigation.
Human Capital Resources
We have built a culture of hard work and excellence with a diverse and inclusive workplace as a business imperative because our people are our single most important asset. In our high-performance culture, everyone is treated fairly and respectfully and has equal access to opportunities based on capabilities and performance, regardless of gender, generation, sexual orientation, mental and physical ability, race, ethnicity, and other protected classes.
Our workforce was made up of approximately 2,500 employees as of December 31, 2022, of which 550 were salaried and 1,950 were hourly.

Union Workforce
Several of our subsidiaries are a signatory to numerous local and regional collective bargaining agreements, both directly and through trade associations, as a union contractor. These agreements cover all necessary union professions and are subject to renewal periodically. As of December 31, 2022, about 660, or 26%, of our employees were represented by a union. Estimated amounts for wage escalation related to the expiration of union contracts are included in our bids on various projects.
Diversity and Inclusion
We employ a dynamic mix of people to create the strongest company possible. Our policy strictly forbids discrimination in employment on the basis of age, culture, gender, national origin, sexual orientation, physical appearance, race, or religion. We are an inclusive, diverse company with people of all backgrounds, experience, culture, styles, talents, and other protected classes.
Professional and Career Development
We strive to develop and sustain a skilled labor advantage by providing thorough on and off-site training programs, project management training, and leadership development programs.
Safety, Health, and Wellness
We are committed to providing a safe environment for our employees. We pride ourselves in our above industry average workplace safety. We track and maintain several key safety metrics, which senior management reviews monthly, and we evaluate management on their ability to provide safe working conditions on job sites and to create a strong safety culture.
Compensation and Benefits
As part of our compensation philosophy, we believe that we must offer and maintain market competitive total compensation and benefit packages for our employees in order to attract and retain superior talent. We benchmark our benefits package against our competitors on a yearly basis.
We also provide additional benefits to our employees, including a 401(k) Match Plan, healthcare and insurance benefits, paid time off, family leave, flexible work schedules, and employee assistance programs.
Code of Conduct
All of our employees are subject to our Code of Conduct, which includes guidance and requirements concerning, among other things, general business ethics, including policies concerning the environment, conflicts of interest, anti-corruption, harassment and discrimination, data security and privacy, and the Anti-Bribery and Corruption Policy, which includes guidance and requirements concerning, among other things, interactions with government officials; provisions of gifts, entertainment and hospitality, and charitable and political contributions.
