 ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
 As used in this Annual Report, the terms “we,” “us,” “our,” “Broadwind” and the “Company” refer to Broadwind Energy, Inc., a Delaware corporation headquartered in Cicero, Illinois, and its wholly‑owned subsidiaries (the “Subsidiaries”). Dollars are presented in thousands unless otherwise stated. Business Overview
 We provide technologically advanced high‑value products to energy, mining and infrastructure sector customers, primarily in the United States of America (the “U.S.”). Our most significant presence is within the U.S. wind energy industry, although we have diversified into other industrial markets in order to improve our capacity utilization, reduce our customer concentrations, and reduce our exposure to uncertainty related to governmental policies currently impacting the U.S. wind energy industry. The December 2015 multi-year extension of the federal Production Tax Credit (the “PTC”) and the Investment Tax Credit (“ITC”) for new wind energy development projects have helped stabilize wind energy markets for the medium term. Within the U.S. wind energy industry, we provide products primarily to wind turbine manufacturers. We also provide precision gearing and heavy fabrications to a broad range of industrial customers for oil and gas (“O&G”), mining, steel and other industrial applications.

 On February 1, 2017, we acquired Red Wolf Company, LLC (“Red Wolf”), a Sanford, North Carolina-based, privately held fabricator, kitter and assembler of industrial systems primarily supporting the global natural gas turbine market, for approximately $18,983. Red Wolf is being operated as a wholly-owned subsidiary, as more fully described in Note 21, “Business Combinations” in the notes to our consolidated financial statements.  The Red Wolf acquisition enables us to expand our market reach, competencies, capabilities and customer relationships.  The Red Wolf acquisition aligns with our growth strategy focused on expanding and diversifying our business through organic growth and strategic bolt-on acquisitions.  Red Wolf’s operations are reported in the “Process Systems” segment. 
 In December of 2015, we substantially completed the divestiture of our Services segment. Consequently, this segment has been reported as a discontinued operation. All current and prior period financial results have been revised to reflect these changes. As a result of the 2017 Red Wolf acquisition and the divestiture of the Services segment, we revised our segment presentation to include three reportable operating segments: Towers and Weldments, Gearing, and Process Systems. See Note 16 “Segment Reporting” in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our segments. In the fourth quarter 2017, the Towers and Heavy Fabrications segment changed its name from “Towers and Weldments” to “Towers and Heavy Fabrications” to more accurately reflect the nature of the segment’s activities.
 In 2018, 49% of our sales were linked to new wind energy installations, representing a reduction in concentration from 72% in 2017, as we diversified our sales across end markets and experienced lower demand for towers. The market for new U.S. wind energy installations is affected by a number of factors, including: (i) economic growth and the associated demand for new electricity generation; (ii) the cost of competing energy sources, primarily natural gas and solar power; (iii) federal and state‑level renewable energy development incentives; (iv) available transmission infrastructure and the proliferation of smart grid technology; (v) improvements in wind energy cost competitiveness resulting from the maturation of technologies and services within the wind energy industry; and (vi) state and federal government actions relating to regulation of carbon emissions. 
 The highest impact development incentive has been the PTC for new wind energy projects. Legislative support for the PTC has been intermittent since its introduction in 1992, which has caused volatility in the demand for new wind energy projects.  The PTC extension in 2015 for a five-year period phases-out the amount of the credit allowed over time based on the year when construction of the wind project is started. The phase-out schedule provides for: 100% extension of the credit for projects commenced before the end of 2016, 80% for projects commenced in 2017, 60% in 2018 and 40% in 2019. Qualifying projects must either be completed within three years from their commencement or the developer must demonstrate that they are in continuous construction between commencement and completion.   
 The market for wind towers is closely correlated to the demand for new wind turbines. However, demand for our towers is also reflective of the level of market competition, the strength of our customer relationships and the proximity of our plants to wind farm development sites, the economics and availability of imported towers, as well as other factors. In 2016, orders for our wind towers were strong, driven by a multi-year baseload order received in response to the PTC extension. Our orders have declined since, and in 2017, were impacted by the consolidation of our two largest customers, and their decision to reduce inventories of towers and other turbine components globally.  In 2018, we were also adversely impacted by steel plate availability and pricing issues primarily attributable to steel tariffs introduced in early 2018. 
 Outside of the market for wind energy installations, we serve a number of other industrial markets, including O&G development and extraction, mining, gas-fired turbines, and steel production. The market for O&G equipment and mining equipment rebounded early in 2017 as prices recovered significantly in response to changes in the supply and demand balance. Due to the rebound in the market conditions, we have raised production in order to meet our customers’ demand. Outside of towers manufactured to support the wind energy market, our products include gearboxes (both new and rebuilt), loose gearing, heavy fabrications and components for gas turbines. The following table details the percentage of our revenue generated in each sector for the past two years:

 | Annual | 
 | Revenue | 
 | 2018 | | 2017 | 
Wind | 49 | % | 72 | %
Industrial | 51 | % | 28 | %
Total | 100 | % | 100 | %

 Business and Operating Strategy
 We intend to capitalize on the markets for wind energy, gas turbines, O&G, mining, and other industrial verticals in North America by leveraging our core competencies in welding, manufacturing, assembling and kitting. Our strategic objectives include the following:
· | Improve our commercial efforts and expand and diversify our customer base. In 2018, sales derived from our top five customers represented 78% of total sales, a modest improvement in customer diversification as compared to 85% in 2017. To reduce the concentration of sales and our wind energy industry concentration, we have focused our market research activities and our sales force on expanding and diversifying our customer base. The Red Wolf acquisition in early 2017 further improved our customer and end market diversification.

· | Improve capacity utilization and profitability. We are working to improve our capacity utilization and financial results by leveraging our existing manufacturing capacity and adjusting capacity where we can, in response to changing market conditions. Tower and gear manufacturing each require significant capital investments. We have manufacturing capacity available that could support a significant increase in our annual revenues, particularly for gearing and heavy fabrications. In 2018, we completed a multi-year rationalization of our operational footprint, which significantly reduced our cumulative square footage through the sale or exit of several operational locations. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Reduce fixed manufacturing costs and operating expenses to improve profitability. In response to decreased tower demand from our customers in 2017, we reduced our cost structure by $2.3 million in 2017 and an additional $2.3 million in 2018. In our Towers and Heavy Fabrications segment, we are expanding production capabilities and leveraging our fabrication competencies to support growth in mining, construction, and other industrial markets. In our Gearing segment, after several years of reducing workforce and selling excess gear cutting and grinding equipment, we are modestly increasing our production capabilities in response to improving market conditions. Outside of Gearing, we have focused on reducing professional fees and expenses, lowering our administrative costs and eliminating non-critical overhead positions. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Improve production technology and operational efficiency. We believe that the proper coordination and integration of the supply chain, consistent use of systems to manage our production activities and “Continuous Improvement” initiatives are key factors that enable high operating efficiencies, increased reliability, better delivery and lower costs. We have introduced robust Advanced Product Quality Processes (APQP) to support the introduction of new products. We have developed better supply chain expertise, worked with lean enterprise resources, upgraded and improved systems utilization and invested capital to help enhance our operational efficiency and flexibility. We have staffed our operations with Continuous Improvement experts in order to optimize our production processes to increase output, leverage our scale and lower our costs while maintaining product quality.

  COMPANY HISTORY
 We were incorporated in 1996 in Nevada as Blackfoot Enterprises, Inc., and through a series of subsequent transactions, became Broadwind Energy, Inc., a Delaware corporation, in 2008. Through acquisitions in 2007 and 2008, we focused on expanding upon our core platform as a wind tower component manufacturer, established our Gearing segment, and developed our Heavy Fabrications capabilities. In early 2017, we acquired Red Wolf, a kitter and assembler of industrial components primarily supporting the global gas turbine market. SALES AND MARKETING
 We market our towers, gearing, kitting and heavy fabrications products through a direct sales force and independent sales agents. Our sales and marketing strategy is to develop and maintain long‑term relationships with our energy and infrastructure sector customers. Within the wind energy industry, our customer base consists primarily of wind turbine manufacturers who supply end‑users and wind farm operators with wind turbines and wind farm operators who use our replacement gears in their installed turbines. Within the O&G and mining industries, our customer base consists of manufacturers of hydraulic fracturing and mud pumps, drilling and production equipment, mining equipment, and off‑highway vehicles. Within the gas turbine industry, our customers supply end-users with natural gas turbines and after-market replacement and efficiency upgrade packages. To support the efforts of our sales force, we utilize a number of

marketing tactics to build our brand and position and promote our products. Our efforts include participation in industry conferences, media relations, use of social media and other channels and use of our website to connect with customers. 
 COMPETITION
 Each of our businesses faces competition from both domestic and international companies. The December 2015 extension of the PTC attracted additional investment and competition for wind towers.  The industrial gearing industry has experienced consolidation of producers and acquisitions by strategic buyers in response to strong international competition, although recent tariff and trade uncertainties have caused buyers to shift more of their purchases to domestic gear manufacturers.
 For our Towers and Heavy Fabrications segment, the largest North American based competitor is Arcosa Inc., which was formerly a Trinity Industries company. Other competitors include Vestas Wind Systems, which has periodically produced towers for third party customers in addition to meeting its own captive tower requirements, and Marmen Industries, a Canadian company that also has a production facility in the U.S. We also face competition from imported towers, although imports from China and Vietnam have substantially ceased following a determination by the U.S. International Trade Commission (“USITC”) in 2013 that wind towers from those countries were being sold in the U.S. at less than fair value. As a result of the determination, the U.S. Department of Commerce (“USDOC”) issued antidumping and countervailing duty orders on imports of wind towers from China and an antidumping duty order on imports of towers from Vietnam, which are currently under review for a five-year extension. In May 2018, the U.S. Court of Appeals affirmed the decision from the U.S. Court of International Trade resulting in CS Wind Vietnam being excluded from the antidumping order. U.S. tariffs have been imposed on imported steel, but have not been applied to fabricated wind towers, which has increased competition from other international competitors.  We continue to monitor wind tower imports.
 In our Gearing segment, which is focused on the O&G, wind energy, mining and steel markets, our key competitors in a fragmented market include Overton Chicago Gear, Cincinnati Gearing Systems, Merit Gear, Milwaukee Gear and Horsburgh & Scott. In addition, we compete with the internal gear manufacturing capacity of relevant equipment manufacturers and face competition from foreign competitors.
 In our Process Systems segment, which is primarily focused on the gas turbine market, our key competitors include Gexpro and other small independent companies.
 ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION AND COMPLIANCE
 Our operations are subject to numerous federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. Although it is our objective to maintain compliance with these laws and regulations, it may not be possible to quantify with certainty the potential impact of actions regarding environmental matters, particularly remediation and other compliance efforts that we may undertake in the future. Several of our facilities have a history of industrial operations, and contaminants have been detected at some of our facilities. BACKLOG
 We sell our towers under either supply agreements or individual purchase orders (“POs”), depending on the size and duration of the purchase commitment. Under the supply agreements, we typically receive a purchase commitment for towers to be delivered in future fiscal quarters, then receive POs on a periodic basis depending upon the customer’s forecast of production volume requirements within the contract terms. For our Gearing and Process Systems segments, sales are generally based on individual POs. As of December 31, 2018, the dollar amount of our backlog believed to be firm under our supply agreements and POs awarded was approximately $96 million. This represents a 30% decrease from the backlog at December 31, 2017, which is due in part to the run-off of a three-year tower framework agreement in mid-2016, against which we are still delivering. The reduction in tower backlog has been partially offset by higher gearing orders due to strong demand from mining and wind customers, and an increase in heavy fabrication orders due to strong mining and industrial demand. SEASONALITY
 The majority of our business is not affected by seasonality.

 EMPLOYEES
 We had 425 employees at December 31, 2018, of which 378 were in manufacturing related functions and 47 were in administrative functions. As of December 31, 2018, approximately 23% of our employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements with local unions in our Cicero, Illinois and Neville Island, Pennsylvania locations. The five-year collective bargaining agreement with the Neville Island union was renegotiated in November 2017, and is expected to remain in effect through October 2022. A new four-year collective bargaining agreement with the Cicero union was negotiated in the third quarter of 2018 and is expected to remain in effect through February 2022. We believe that our relationship with our employees is generally positive. RAW MATERIALS
 The primary raw material used in the construction of wind towers and gearing products is steel in the form of plate, bar stock, forgings or castings. The market for tower steel has become increasingly globalized. Although we are generally responsible for procurement of the raw materials, our global tower customers often negotiate the prices and terms for steel purchases, and, through a “directed buy”, we purchase under these agreements. We then pass the steel cost through to our end customer plus a conversion margin.
 Outside of these directed buys, we operate a multiple supplier sourcing strategy and source our raw materials through various suppliers located throughout the U.S. and abroad. We generally do not have long‑term supply agreements with our raw materials suppliers, and closely match terms with those of our customers to limit our exposure to commodity price fluctuations. We believe that we will be able to obtain an adequate supply of steel and other raw materials in 2019 to meet our manufacturing requirements, although from time to time we have faced shortages of specific grades of steel. Our business has been impacted by steel plate availability and pricing issues primarily attributable to steel tariffs introduced in early 2018. We have made modifications to our supply chain management practices to deal more effectively with potential disruptions arising from these purchasing practices.
 QUALITY CONTROL
 We have a long‑standing focus on processes for ensuring the manufacture of high‑quality products. To achieve high standards of production and operational quality, we implement strict and extensive quality control and inspections throughout our production processes. We maintain internal quality controls over all core manufacturing processes and carry out quality assurance inspections at the completion of each major manufacturing step to ensure the quality of our products. The manufacturing process at our Gearing segment, for example, involves transforming forged steel into precision gears through cutting, heat treating, testing and finishing. We inspect and test raw materials before they enter the assembly process, re‑test the raw materials after rough machining, test the functioning of gear teeth and cores after thermal treatment and accuracy test final outputs for compliance with product specifications. We believe our investment in industry‑leading heat treatment, high precision machining, specialized grinding technologies and cutting‑edge welding has contributed to our high product reliability and the consistent performance of our products under varying operating conditions. All of our core operating facilities are ISO 9001:2015 certified.  CUSTOMERS
 We manufacture products for a variety of customers in the wind energy, O&G, mining and other infrastructure industries. The majority of our wind energy industry customer base consists of wind turbine manufacturers who supply wind farm operators and wind farm developers with completed wind turbines. In the other industrial sectors, we sell our products through our trained sales force or through manufacturers’ representatives to a wide variety of customers. The wind turbine market is very concentrated. According to Wood Mackenzie Power & Renewables 2018 industry data, the top four wind turbine manufacturers constituted approximately 98% of the U.S. market. As a result, although we have historically produced towers for most of these global wind turbine manufacturers, in any given year a limited number of customers have accounted for the majority of our revenues. Sales to Siemens Gamesa Renewable Energy (“SGRE”) and Gardner Denver represented greater than 10% of our consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018. Sales to SGRE represented greater than 10% of our consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017. The loss of one of these customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation or financial condition. As a result, we are seeking to diversify our customer base.

 WORKING CAPITAL
 Our primary customers are wind turbine manufacturers and various other industrial customers. In general, we produce to order rather than to stock. For wind towers, the industry has historically used customized contracts with varying terms and conditions between suppliers and customers, depending on the specific objectives of each party. Our practices mirror this historical industry practice of negotiating agreements on a case‑by‑case basis. As a result, working capital needs, including levels of accounts receivable (“A/R”), customer deposits and inventory, can vary significantly from quarter to quarter based on the contractual terms associated with each quarter’s sales, such as whether and when we are required to purchase and supply steel pursuant to such sales.
 In analyzing our liquidity, an important short-term factor is our use of operating working capital (“OWC”) in relationship to revenue. OWC is comprised of A/R and inventories, net of accounts payable (“A/P”) and customer deposits. Our OWC at December 31, 2018 was $5,000 or 5% of trailing three months of sales annualized. This is a decrease of $6,376 from December 31, 2017, when OWC was $11,376, or 16% of trailing three months of sales annualized. The decrease in total OWC was driven by increased customer deposits received in late 2018, due to higher scheduled production levels in our Towers and Heavy Fabrications segment for 2019.
