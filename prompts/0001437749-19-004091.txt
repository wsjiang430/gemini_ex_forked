Item 1. | Business.
--------+----------

 
When used in this Form 10-K, “Company”, “we”, “us” or “our” refers to Spartan Motors, Inc. and, depending on the context, could also be used to refer generally to the Company and its subsidiaries, which are described below.
 
General
 
Spartan Motors, Inc. was organized as a Michigan corporation on September 18, 1975, and is headquartered in Charlotte, Michigan. Spartan Motors began development of its first product that same year and shipped its first fire truck chassis in October 1975.
 
We are a niche market leader in specialty vehicle manufacturing and assembly for the commercial vehicle (including last-mile delivery, specialty service and vocation-specific up-fit segments), emergency response and recreational vehicle industries. Our products include: walk-in vans and truck bodies used in e-commerce/parcel delivery; up-fit equipment used in the mobile retail and utility trades; fire trucks and fire truck chassis; luxury Class A diesel motor home chassis; military vehicles; and contract manufacturing and assembly services. We also supply replacement parts and offer repair, maintenance, field service and refurbishment services for the vehicles that we manufacture. Our operating activities are conducted through our wholly-owned operating subsidiary, Spartan Motors USA, Inc. (“Spartan USA”), with locations in Charlotte, Michigan; Bristol, Indiana; Ephrata, Pennsylvania; Ladson, South Carolina; Pompano Beach, Florida; Brandon, South Dakota; Snyder and Neligh, Nebraska, along with contract manufacturing in Kansas City, Missouri and Saltillo, Mexico. We employed 2,338 people across all of our business units and corporate location as of January 31, 2019.
 
Our vehicles, parts and services are sold to commercial, original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), dealers, individual end users, and municipalities and other governmental entities. In 2018, 68.6% of our revenue was derived from commercial, original equipment manufacturers, dealers, and end users, while 31.4% was derived from municipalities and other governmental entities. Our product portfolio gives us access to multiple differentiated markets and corresponding customer bases which help to mitigate the impact of business cycles.
 
In 2015 we began executing against an aggressive turnaround plan targeting a return to profitability within three years. 2018 marks the beginning of our growth phase. We will continue to work towards maximizing operational efficiency and profitability, and add in a new focus on growing our revenue and market share through a combination of organic growth, acquisitions and entry into new synergistic markets. As illustrated in the charts below, over the past five years our revenue has increased by $309.4 million, a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 9.9%, while net income and adjusted EBITDA have grown by $13.8 million and $21.0 million respectively. Please see the reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to Net income attributable to Spartan Motors, Inc., below.
 

Our diversification across several sectors provides numerous opportunities while reducing overall risk as the various markets we serve tend to have different cyclicality. We have an innovative team focused on building lasting relationships with our customers by designing and delivering market leading specialty vehicles, vehicle components, and services. Additionally, our business structure provides the agility to quickly respond to market needs, take advantage of strategic opportunities when they arise and correctly size and scale operations to ensure stability and growth. Our expansion of equipment up-fit services in our Fleet Vehicles and Services segment, the award of a $214 million order from the United States Postal Service in 2017, and the growing opportunities that we have capitalized on in last mile delivery as a result of the rapidly changing e-commerce market are excellent examples of our ability to generate growth and profitability by quickly fulfilling customer needs.

Recent Acquisitions
 
On December 17, 2018, the Company acquired all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of Strobes-R-Us, Inc. (“SRUS”), a premier provider of up-fit services for government and non-government vehicles. The acquisition will enable the Company to increase its product offerings to both fleet and emergency response customers, while further expanding its manufacturing capabilities into the southeastern U.S. market. As part of this acquisition, Spartan acquired SRUS’ state-of-the-art up-fit facility and product showroom in Pompano Beach, Florida. The acquisition will be included in the Fleet Vehicles and Services segment.
 
On January 1, 2017, we acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of Smeal Fire Apparatus Co., Smeal Properties, Inc., Ladder Tower Co., and U.S. Tanker Co., resulting in the addition of $61.1 million and $124.7 million of revenue in 2018 and 2017, respectively. When used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, “Smeal” refers to the assets, liabilities, and operations acquired from such entities. The assets acquired consist of the assets used by the former owners of Smeal in the operation of its business designing, manufacturing, and distributing emergency response vehicle bodies and aerial devices for the fire service industry. Smeal has operations in Snyder and Neligh, Nebraska; and Ephrata, Pennsylvania and is operated as part of our Emergency Response Vehicles segment. Our acquisition of Smeal resulted in the expansion of our product portfolio and, with the addition of the Smeal dealer network, an expansion of our geographic reach across 44 states and 13 Canadian provinces and territories. The acquisition strengthened our emergency response vehicle product line with the addition of market leading aerial designs and three manufacturing locations that will allow us to align our product portfolio with location specific manufacturing expertise to further increase efficiency.
 
Our strategy is to accelerate our growth by expanding into additional products and markets through opportunistic, strategic acquisitions. We believe that we have the management expertise, balance sheet strength and capital availability to enable continued growth through both organic expansion and an aggressive acquisition strategy.
 
Competition
 
The principal methods we use to build competitive advantages include short engineering reaction time, custom design capability, high product quality, superior customer service and quick delivery. We employ a solutions-based approach to offer specialized products tailored to customer needs across the spectrum of our products. We compete with companies that manufacture for similar markets, including some divisions of large diversified organizations that have total sales and financial resources exceeding ours. Our competition in the fleet vehicle market ranges from one large manufacturer in the walk-in van market to a number of smaller manufacturers in the truck body and equipment up-fit markets. Our direct competitors in the emergency vehicle apparatus market are principally larger manufacturers that compete throughout the North American market and often have a strong international presence. Certain competitors are vertically integrated and manufacture their own emergency response chassis and/or apparatus, although they generally do not sell their chassis to outside customers (other OEMs). Our competitors in the specialty vehicle market are principally large multi-product line manufacturers of specialty and heavy-duty vehicles.
Suppliers
 
We are dedicated to establishing long-term and mutually beneficial relationships with our suppliers. Through these relationships, we benefit from new innovations, higher quality, reduced lead times, smoother/faster manufacturing ramp-up of new vehicle introductions and lower total costs of doing business. Our accelerating growth and company-wide supply chain management initiatives allow us to benefit from economies of scale and maximize to focus on a common vision.
 
The single largest commodity directly utilized in production is aluminum, which we purchase under purchase agreements based on forecasted production requirements. To a lesser extent we are dependent upon suppliers of lumber, fiberglass and steel for our manufacturing. We have initiated long-term supplier agreements and are consolidating suppliers where beneficial to gain pricing advantages. There are several readily available sources for the majority of these raw materials. However, we are heavily dependent on specific component part products from a few single source vendors. We maintain a qualification, on-site inspection, assistance, and performance measurement system to control risks associated with reliance on suppliers. We normally do not carry inventories of such raw materials or components in excess of those reasonably required to meet production and shipping schedules. Material and component cost increases are passed on to our customers whenever possible. However, there can be no assurance that there will not be any supply issues over the long-term.

In the assembly of our fleet vehicles, we use chassis supplied by third parties, and generally do not purchase these chassis for inventory. For this market, we typically accept shipment of truck chassis owned by dealers or end users, for the purpose of installing and/or manufacturing our specialized commercial vehicles on such chassis, but from time to time we do purchase chassis for use in fulfilling certain customer orders.
 
Research and Development
 
Our success depends on our ability to innovate and add new products and features ahead of changing market demands and new regulatory requirements. Thus, we emphasize research and development and commit significant resources to develop and adapt new products and production techniques. Our engineering team of nearly 200 technical professionals is looking past “current practices” and “best practices” to deliver “next practices” for our customers and shareholders. Our engineering group is organized as a unified team serving one goal throughout the company, to deliver world class products and manufacturing processes regardless of product line or location, a concept that we refer to as “One Spartan Engineering”. The team balances the synergies of One Spartan Engineering with fully integrated teams dedicated to product line specialization. Results are accomplished with the appropriate blend of predictive analysis and physical property testing in our Research and Development facilities along with ride-and-drive analysis. Our efforts range from executing special orders for current production; to new production development for new functionality and product improvements; to exciting technologies that are new to the markets we serve, like vehicle electrification. Our engineering actions are driven by our firm commitment to safety, quality, delivery, and productivity. We spent $7.3 million, $6.5 million and $6.8 million on research and development in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
Product Warranties
 
We provide limited warranties against assembly and construction defects. These warranties generally provide for the replacement or repair of defective parts or workmanship for specified periods, ranging from one year to the life of the product, following the date of sale. With the use of validation testing, predictive analysis tools and engineering and design standards, we strive to continuously improve product quality and durability, and reduce our exposure to warranty claims. The end users also may receive limited warranties from suppliers of components that are incorporated into our chassis and vehicles. For more information concerning our product warranties, see Note 10, Commitments and Contingent Liabilities, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements appearing in this Form 10-K.
 
Patents, Trademarks and Licenses
 
We have 28 United States patents, which include rights to the design and structure of chassis and certain peripheral equipment, and have 12 pending patent applications in the United States. The existing patents will expire on various dates from 2019 through 2033 and all are subject to payment of required maintenance fees. We also own 35 United States trademark and service mark registrations. The trademark and service mark registrations are generally renewable under applicable laws, subject to payment of required fees and the filing of affidavits of use. In addition, we have various international trademark registrations and pending applications.
 
We believe our products are identified by our trademarks and that our trademarks are valuable assets to all of our business segments. We are not aware of any infringing uses or any prior claims of ownership of our trademarks that could materially affect our business. It is our policy to pursue registration of our primary marks whenever possible and to vigorously defend our patents, trademarks and other proprietary marks against infringement or other threats to the greatest extent practicable under applicable laws.
 
Environmental Matters
 
Compliance with federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations has not had, nor is it expected to have, a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position.
 
Spartan believes in the preservation of the environment because it leads to a safer, healthier world for today and in the future. In addition to the various product offerings provided by Spartan, alternative fuel specialty vehicles are offered to help reduce pollutant emissions. Spartan also subscribes to environmentally conscious manufacturing practices while working to obtain ISO 14001 certification by 2020 and strongly encourages its suppliers to have similar manufacturing philosophies. Spartan recycles waste in many aspects of our daily operations and in the office.

Associates
 
We employed 2,338 associates as of January 31, 2019, substantially all of which are full-time, including 382 contracted associates. Management considers its relations with associates to be positive. Our production processes at our non-unionized facilities employ a combination of high- and low-skilled tradespeople and assemblers involved in body, electrical, mechanical, paint, and assembly operations.
Customer Base
 
We serve customers ranging from municipalities to OEMs to commercial customers and vehicle dealers throughout our product lines. Sales to our top 10 customers in 2018 accounted for 59.2% of our revenue. Sales to customers that individually exceeded 10% of our consolidated revenue for 2018 and 2016 are detailed in the chart below. In 2017 no customer individually exceeded 10% of our consolidated revenue.

Year | Customer | Sales ($ millions) | | Percentage of consolidated revenue | | Segment
-----+-------------+--------------------+------+------------------------------------+------+--------
2018 | USPS | $ | 81.7 | | 10.0 | % | Fleet Vehicles and Services 
2016 | Jayco, Inc. | $ | 71.0 | | 12.0 | % | Specialty Chassis and Vehicles

 
We do have other significant customers which, if the relationship changes significantly, could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations. We believe that we have developed strong relationships with our customers and continually work to develop new customers and markets. See related risk factors in Item 1A of this Form 10-K.
 
Sales to customers outside the United States were $50.7 million, $81.2 million and $31.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, or 7.0%, 11.5% and 5.4%, respectively, of sales for those years. All of our long-lived assets are located in the United States.
 
Order Backlog
 
Our order backlog by reportable segment is summarized in the following table (in thousands).
 

 | December 31, 2018 | | December 31, 2017 | | | Increase/(decrease)
-------------------------------+-------------------+---------+-------------------+---+---------+--------------------
Fleet Vehicles and Services | $ | 218,775 | | $ | 267,698 | | $ | (48,923 | )
Emergency Response Vehicles | | 216,526 | | | 233,583 | | | (17,057 | )
Specialty Chassis and Vehicles | | 37,656 | | | 33,806 | | | 3,850 | 
Total consolidated | $ | 472,957 | | $ | 535,087 | | $ | (62,130 | )

 
Our Fleet Vehicles and Services backlog decreased by $48.9 million, or 18.3%, driven by the partial build-out of the $214.3 million contract received in September 2017 to supply delivery vehicles, which will be fulfilled through 2019. Our Emergency Response Vehicles backlog decreased by $17.1 million, or 7.3%, primarily due to our adoption of ASC 606 which resulted in changes to our revenue recognition policy whereby we now recognize revenue on certain of our products as they are produced rather than at the time of shipment to the customer. Our Specialty Chassis and Vehicles segment backlog increased by $3.8 million, or 11.4%, due to strong motor home chassis order intake driven by new model introductions and market share gains.
 
Although the backlog of unfilled orders is one of many indicators of market demand, several factors, such as changes in production rates, available capacity, new product introductions and competitive pricing actions, may affect actual sales. Accordingly, a comparison of backlog from period to period is not necessarily indicative of eventual actual shipments.

Non-GAAP Financial Measure
 
This report contains adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization), which is a non-GAAP financial measure. This non-GAAP measure is calculated by excluding items that we believe to be infrequent or not indicative of our continuing operating performance. For the periods covered by this report such items include expenses associated with restructuring actions taken to improve the efficiency and profitability of certain of our manufacturing operations, expenses related to product recall campaigns, litigation settlements, long-term strategic planning expenses, non-cash charges related to the impairment of assets, expenses related to a recent business acquisition, the impact of the step-up in inventory value associated with the recent business acquisition, and the impact of the business acquisition on the timing of chassis revenue recognition.
 
We present the non-GAAP measure adjusted EBITDA because we consider it to be an important supplemental measure of our performance. The presentation of adjusted EBITDA enables investors to better understand our operations by removing items that we believe are not representative of our continuing operations and may distort our longer term operating trends. We believe this measure to be useful to improve the comparability of our results from period to period and with our competitors, as well as to show ongoing results from operations distinct from items that are infrequent or not indicative of our continuing operating performance. We believe that presenting this non-GAAP measure is useful to investors because it permits investors to view performance using the same tools that management uses to budget, make operating and strategic decisions, and evaluate our historical performance. We believe that the presentation of this non-GAAP measure, when considered together with the corresponding GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations to that measure, provides investors with additional understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business than could be obtained in the absence of this disclosure.
