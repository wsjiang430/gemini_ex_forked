 There are three main components to the Xact Tank Monitoring System: 
 Tank Sensors  Xact offers two sensors, the Xact Ultrasonic sensor and the Xact Gauge Reader. 
 The Xact Ultrasonic sensor incorporates patented technology and is externally mounted to the bottom of the tank with no reliance on existing mechanical gauges. The system employs a small electrical pulse, which is able to calculate the precise fill level inside using patented sonar technology (measurement accuracy to within ±2% for large tanks and ±1% for small tanks). Ultrasonic sensors work with any tank-based liquids including propane, diesel and natural gas. 
 The Xact gauge reader connects to the face of a float gauge and detects the fill level that is reported by the gauge. The system then transmits that data by satellite in the same manner as the Ultrasonic sensor. Float gauges have a typical accuracy range of ±4% to ±8%. Gauge readers are primarily used in the propane industry to monitor propane tanks and support refill optimization for distributors and customers. 
 Satellite Radio Transmitter  The Xact radio transmitter is placed on the top of the tank and is connected by cable to the tank sensor or gauge reader. The transmitter transmits the tank data using the GlobalStar® satellite network to the secure Xact website. Xact satellite telemetry provides global coverage with no dependence on land lines, cellular networks or Wi-Fi signals, making it a reliable monitoring solution for tanks located anywhere in the world. 
 Xact Website  The Xact website is a secured location providing controlled access to the tank data for each customers various tank locations. Customers can access the website to check fill levels and additional information such as temperature, battery status, GPS coordinates and map location. In addition, the data can also be integrated into customer back-office software via API.
