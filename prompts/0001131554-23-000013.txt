Who We Serve
At Synchronoss we focus on delivering carrier-grade solutions to three markets globally: communications service providers/multi-service operators (such as cable and mobile network operators), mobile insurance providers and retailers. We help our customers accelerate and monetize value-add services to drive growth, facilitate retention and enable differentiated experiences. In 2022, we continued to strengthen our focus through the asset sale of our Digital Experience Platform (the “DXP Business”) to iQmetrix.
Communications service providers, multi-service operators and mobile insurance providers market white label implementations of our Synchronoss Personal CloudTM, Advanced Messaging and email products and solutions to their subscribers around the world. Our customers market and re-sell the services powered by our technology to their subscribers as part of stand-alone subscriptions, value-added bundles, or use Personal Cloud to enhance their service offerings to subscribers who purchase and lease mobile devices and network connectivity by providing an easy solution for storing and syncing user generated content (e.g., videos, photos, documents, contacts, music etc.). Additionally, they license Synchronoss Advanced Messaging and Email to enable white label multichannel messaging services including advanced person-to-person (“P2P”) and application-to-person (“A2P”) transactions and to offer brand/advertiser ecosystems. Communications service providers and multi-service operators use our OnboardX and NetworkX solutions to enhance their subscriber journeys and onboarding and to streamline their internal processes. 
Our customers include global service providers such as AT&T, BT, Verizon, Softbank and multi-service operators like Comcast, Altice, Charter and Mediacom. These customers utilize our solutions to service both consumer and enterprise customers.
How We Go to Market
We market our solutions and services directly through our sales organizations in the Americas, Europe, Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”) and Asia-Pacific (“APAC”). 
Sales
We sell our solutions, products, and services through a direct sales force, with strategic partners and in collaboration with our customers to resell services to their end customers and subscribers. Our sales professionals are well versed in our platforms, products and services with an understanding of market trends, demands and conditions that our current and potential customers are facing. 
Marketing
The Synchronoss marketing team’s mission is to deliver the right strategy, tools, and customer acquisition initiatives to accelerate our growth. The team uses a combination of product-specific and company-wide marketing messages and initiatives that leverage digital marketing campaigns, sales support materials, social media, and PR to generate top of the funnel business-to-business (“B2B”) sales leads for the sales team. As a result, they play a vital role in promoting our products, discovering new markets, and driving brand awareness in the North America, EMEA, and APAC regions.
The Marketing team also supports our customers’ direct-to-consumer (D2C) marketing efforts for all global cloud deployments. In partnership with our customers, our go-to-market and awareness campaigns consist of a digitally-led omnichannel approach at critical moments in the subscriber’s purchase lifecycle; including online checkout, retail transactions, customer care interactions, out-of-box setup experiences, and in-app notifications for devices that have our cloud app preloaded.
What We Deliver - Our Platforms
The Synchronoss Experience (syncX) is a collection of products that help our customers create a positive brand experience throughout the subscriber lifecycle. SyncX keeps people, systems, networks, and content in sync to enable a better, more engaging experience.
EngageX products keep subscribers engaged with brands, content and people they love. When loyalty and revenue is won and lost through every experience, it is critical to offer value-added services subscribers love. Our Cloud and Messaging experiences grow, inspire, and build loyalty with our customers’ subscriber base.
Synchronoss Personal CloudTM Platform 
The Synchronoss Personal CloudTM solution is designed to create an engaging and trusted customer experience through ongoing content management and engagement. The Synchronoss Personal CloudTM platform is a secure and highly scalable, white label platform that allows our customers’ subscribers to backup and protect, engage with, and manage their personal content and gives our operator customers the ability to increase average revenue per user (“ARPU”) and reduce churn.
Our Synchronoss Personal CloudTM platform is specifically designed to support smartphones, tablets, desktops computers, laptops, wearables for health and wellness, cameras, TVs, security cameras, routers, as well as connected automobiles and homes. 
Messaging Platform
Synchronoss’ Messaging platform powers mobile messaging and mailboxes for hundreds of millions of telecommunication subscribers. Our Advanced Messaging platform is a powerful, secure, intelligent, white label messaging platform that expands capabilities for communications service provider and multi-service providers to offer P2P messaging via Rich Communications Services (“RCS”). Our Mobile Messaging Platform (“MMP”) is poised to provide a single standard ecosystem for onboarding and management to brands, advertisers and message wholesalers.
•Advanced Messaging: Our Advanced Messaging platform supports rich messaging channel in both RCS and other Real-Time Communication (“RTC”) and enables rich, P2P communications and creates new commerce and revenue opportunities across channels via A2P experiences for our customers and other brands. Our messaging platform operates in tandem with Messaging-as-a-Platform (“MaaP”) Messaging Marketplace as well as dedicated, third-party clients and native original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) clients, providing an end-to-end messaging platform and monetization tools to the operators, Communications-Platform-as-a-Service (“CpaaS”) players and brands.
•E-Mail: Our Email suite provides service providers with a secure, white label, back-end framework for a branded email service that provides the opportunity to introduce and promote services that can be monetized. Our carrier branded Email Suite solution offers leading anti-virus and anti-spam and malware technology to keep the integrity and security of the customer experience and protection of subscriber data to carrier standards. Our Email solution is an important repository for critical communications with an intuitive and feature-rich mobile and desktop email experience ensuring stickiness and increasing customer lifetime value.
OnboardX products simplify subscriber onboarding and drive service adoption at scale. The first impression of a new product or service can either make or break your subscriber relationship. A poor onboarding experience leads to revenue losses and customers feeling stranded. Our customizable service activation, content backup, and device setup experiences make onboarding frictionless. 
•Mobile Content Transfer: Our Synchronoss Mobile Content Transfer® solution is an easy-to-use product whose client enables a secure, peer-to-peer, wireless transfer of content from one mobile smart device to another in a carrier retail location or at home/work, etc. Our solution can transfer select data classes that may include photos, videos, music, messages, documents, contacts, and call logs, across operating systems including iOS and Android.
•Out of Box Experience: Our Synchronoss Out of Box Experience solution is a device setup solution that assists customers in setting up the features of their new device, including Wi-Fi, email, social network accounts and voicemail, as well as prompting restoration of content and enrollment in a cloud service. It also offers the ability to highlight programs and revenue generating initiatives during the setup process, such as loyalty programs, third-party partnerships and value-added services.
NetworkX products streamline networks to be more efficient and profitable. In a world where subscribers expect seamless connectivity and zero network interruptions, delivering superior network quality can be complex and costly. Our physical network asset management, off-network procurement, and expense control solutions reduce the complexity and cost of network management. 
The Synchronoss NetworkX products provide operators with the tools and software to design their physical network, streamline their infrastructure purchases, and manage and optimize comprehensive network expenses for leading top tier carriers around the globe. 
•spatialNX: Our spatialSUITE provides enterprise-wide access to timely, accurate and comprehensive network information – including physical location, specifications, attributes, connectivity and capacity – for every inside-plant and outside-plant asset. It delivers data across the enterprise to support provisioning, planning and design, construction, fault and event management, work order management, customer service, marketing and other critical business functions. The automation and ease of integration of our platform is designed to enable our customers to lower the cost of new subscriber acquisitions and enhance the accuracy and reliability of customer transactions.
•ConnectNX (iNOW): Our iNOW provisioning system eliminates manual handling of service orders and manages the full order lifecycle between customer and supplier via automation and rules-based validation. iNOW includes an interface that powers bulk provisioning needs and an open API to seamlessly integrate to other carrier systems. iNOW also provides an electronically bonded gateway platform enabling rapid electronic order confirmations and status updates between bonded carriers. Finally, completed order information flows to Financial Analytics providing integrated and automated order to billing reconciliation functionality.
•ExpenseNX: Our Financial Analytics Platform is a comprehensive application suite that helps operators reduce costs, mitigate risks, enforce financial compliance and controls, and increase operational efficiencies. Financial Analytics ingests any supplier invoice (in any format) through a unique software-driven process – with 100% of the detail. Invoices are managed via automated audit and payment workflow tightly coupled with a software driven dispute management lifecycle, providing a true procurement-to-payment process on network expenses and disputes across a carrier’s organization. 
What We Deliver - Our Services
Synchronoss offers professional services including consulting, installation and deployment, configuration, customization, systems integration and support to ensure our customers’ successful deployment and utilization of our products and solutions. 
Product Development
At Synchronoss we have focused our product development efforts on expanding the functionality, scalability and security of our products and solutions. We expect our research and development investments to increase as we intend to continue on an aggressive path to develop new features and functionality, upgrade and extend our product offerings and develop new technology. 
Intellectual Property
We rely principally on a combination of trademark, copyright and patent laws in the United States and other jurisdictions in which we do business, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions, which protect our proprietary 
information, technologies and strategies. We also cultivate a culture which encourages creativity and innovation amongst our employees by maintaining a patent award program, hosting events such as an annual Innovation Jam and periodic “hackathons.” We believe this facilitates the development of new features, functionality and products, which are essential to establishing our solutions as the leading solutions in the industry. We enter into proprietary information and invention agreements with all of our employees and consultants during the onboarding process and non-disclosure agreements with all third parties.
In the United States, as of December 31, 2022 we had 71 patents issued and 7 patents pending. Internationally, as of December 31, 2022 we had 75 patents issued and 6 pending. We hold and/or are pursuing patents in the United States, Germany, the United Kingdom, France and Spain and we may seek additional jurisdictions to the extent we determine such coverage is appropriate and cost efficient. Our issued patents cover all aspects of our business including cloud, messaging, e-commerce, and security.
Demand Drivers for Our Business
With faster/higher speeds, lower latency, more capacity, enhanced security and better reliability, 5G capabilities will enable new use cases, applications and business models that were not possible before. Consumer demand for these features alone will shape how Operators offer 5G services and Operators in turn have the opportunity to monetize and earn differentiated revenue streams. According to Market Research Future, Mobile Value-Added-Services (“VAS”) are set to hit $309.1 billion by 2025. The transition to 5G provides an opportunity to strengthen their position in the consumer market and function as a service enabler by bundling VAS into premium offers. Service providers should also become service creators by developing new, immersive products under their own brand. In either case (branded and partner services) powering digital bundles and simplifying onboarding, consumption, billing, and authentication of VAS will drive higher adoption of premium 5G service plans and ARPU. 
Beyond being a buzz word or strategy, 5G is the next wave in Communication Service Providers’ technological future. In 2023, we expect to see continued adoption of 5G use cases and Operators starting to reap returns on their investment in 5G technology. According to Ericsson1, 5G subscriptions grew by 70 million during the first quarter of 2022 to around 620 million and are expected to surpass 1 billion by the end of 2022. In 2027, it is projected that North America will have the highest 5G penetration at 90 percent. 5G adoption among mid-tier smart phones also continues to abound with new devices and capabilities as evidenced by the numerous device demonstrations we saw at Mobile World Congress 2022.
5G will also usher in many more connected device types. In fact, according to the “Deloitte 2021 Connectivity and Mobile Trends Survey”, the average US household has 25 connected devices across 14 categories, up from 11 categories when last measured in 2019. In addition, the number of connected devices globally is estimated to reach 38.6 billion in 2025, up from 22 billion in 2018. More devices will lead to more vulnerabilities around privacy, data, and hardware protection. Consumers have made it clear; they want to understand and feel confident about how their data is being used. Service providers have proven themselves true stewards of consumer data protection and privacy, and therefore differentiated as the market continues to develop. As the provider of both the mobile network and fixed wireless connectivity, service providers are uniquely positioned to become the trusted end-to-end solution of total protection services for subscribers both at home and on the go. The consumer demand around personal cloud data protection, hardware insurance, home and network security will allow service providers to capitalize on their trusted relationship with consumers.
As 5G becomes more saturated in the marketplace, it will drive a need to address the growing cyber-risks that ubiquitous, always-on high-speed access present to organizations. Operators have taken steps to secure the technology's transmission or network segments; however, the threats posed by the endpoints connecting to those networks and the data resident upon them provide a unique opportunity to develop technologies to address this gap. The addressable market for device protection and cloud data storage for these connected devices will continue to increase and presents a hole in coverage that the average consumer still needs to recognize. Organizations that provide services and software for 5G networks, providers, and consumers are in an enviable position to offer security services to ensure the integrity and availability of the data generated by those connected devices and security services to protect those devices. Consequently, as we enter the next 12-18 months, operators and providers will look to this whitespace to boost functionality and services for their customers to position themselves as the security provider of choice for consumers for 5G-connected devices.
We believe our white label Personal Cloud platform helps service providers accelerate the adoption of 5G service and total protection plans. The next generation Personal Cloud gives operators a new way to create, deliver, engage, and monetize more personalized experiences and offers for their subscribers. When operators have millions of active users leveraging cloud, it 
8


becomes a channel for cross selling security services, insurance, merchandise like prints & gifts, and other carrier services, leading to a significant increase in ARPU. As a result, we are fostering new partnerships, building exciting new capabilities, and now enabling subscribers to protect the home. Giving subscribers the ability to protect hardware investments with insurance plans, protect their families from cyber threats with network-based security services, and their personal content - with cloud, will differentiate the value proposition of 5G service plans and deliver significant brand value for our customers.

Competition
Competition across our markets is incredibly diverse, dynamic and nuanced in an increasingly interconnected landscape of rapidly changing technologies, evolving industry standards, new product introductions and converging spaces and services.
We face the following categories of competitors:
Personal Cloud
•Over-the-top (“OTT”) Service & Platform Providers - Apple, Google, Dropbox, Box, Microsoft and Amazon all provide personal cloud services closely integrated to their respective technology or service platforms. However, Synchronoss differentiates from these OTT Service and Platform Providers by offering operator-grade white label solutions. 
•White Label Platform Providers - The field of platform-independent, white label personal cloud providers has consolidated in recent years with Funambol and others competing for Operator distribution deals. However, these providers target second and third tier regional operators with low-risk, revenue share business models and do not generally pose a real threat to Tier 1 world-wide Operators. 
Messaging
•The emerging RCS marketplace is intensely competitive across the globe. Leading OTT device and OS platform providers Google and Samsung, along with prominent online platform providers such as Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, WeChat and LINE have created a radically new market for communication and monetization that is turning “messaging” into a new, virtual OS.
•Our Email suite provides service providers with a secure, white-label, back-end framework for a branded email service that provides the opportunity to introduce and promote services that can be monetized. Our carrier branded Email Suite solution offers leading anti-virus and anti-spam and malware technology to keep the integrity and security of the customer experience and protection of subscriber data to carrier standards. Our Email solution is an important repository for critical communications with an intuitive and feature-rich mobile and desktop email experience ensuring stickiness and increasing customer lifetime value.
Digital Products
•Telecom Expense Management (TEM) Providers –
▪TEOCO and Tangoe are two major providers that offer wholesale and retail TEM software and services. Each of these vendors have large customers/contracts to better account, reconcile and pay out on vendor contracts, network circuits, roaming agreements and other complex expense areas. 
•Telecom Service Order Management Providers –
▪Neustar supports major providers with software that handles the full order lifecycle of telecommunications service orders.
▪Order management applications and processes developed/utilized by Operators also present competition.
•Geospatial Network Planning Providers –
▪Major providers of software that manage the planning and design of physical communication networks include Bentley, GE Smallworld, and 3-GIS.
To compete against global platform providers, we offer a collection of products that help to keep subscribers, systems, networks, and content in sync to enable a better, more engaging experience. Our white label products enable subscribers to connect with one another, the networks they rely on, the brands they love and the services they need. We believe we compete favorably through our differentiated product capabilities, vast reach across global markets, and our 20+ years of experience building carrier grade solutions that are proven to scale.
Compliance and Certifications
We obtain third-party reviews of our controls relating to security. Our Synchronoss white label Personal Cloud has been certified to be compliant with the Service Organization Controls (SOC) 2 type II audit that tests the design and operating effectiveness of controls over time. An independent auditor tests these controls annually and addresses, among other areas, the environmental and physical safeguards for production data centers, legal controls, change management and logical security. In addition, our Financial Analytics hosted solution is certified to be compliant with a SOC 1 type II audit that tests the design and effectiveness of controls related to our customers’ use of this service in financial reporting. Finally, our operations in Bangalore are certified under ISO27000, ensuring best practices for information security management, and ISO9000, ensuring quality management. 
Human Capital
At Synchronoss, we believe that our growth and success are attributable in large part to our diverse employee base and an experienced management team, with a mission to make Synchronoss a great place to work. We continue to invest in our employees, as well as developing and promoting our team-oriented culture, and believe that these efforts provide us with a sustainable competitive advantage. 
As of December 31, 2022 we had 1,391 full-time employees located in India, North America, Europe, and Asia Pacific regions. 
We have a purpose-driven culture, with a focus on employee input and well-being, which we believe enables us to attract and retain exceptional talent. We have moved to a flexible work policy, providing the majority of our employees the flexibility to work remotely from off-site locations at their election. We offer learning and development programs for all employees. Employees are able to actively voice their questions and thoughts through many internal channels, including our company town hall meetings and employee engagement surveys. 
With a continued focus on employee engagement, we formed a global Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DE&I) committee, laying the groundwork to embed DE&I as part of our corporate culture and pave the way for a more comprehensive program. We took initial steps in this space through formal trainings, employee communications, and updating our corporate language to be more inclusive, aligned with industry’s best practices, and compatible with our DE&I philosophy. More recently, we launched a series of employee initiatives designed to strengthen employee morale, with more to come in this area. We also launched the Sync Cares program in 2022 to bring employees and leadership together to lend their time and talent to support causes and communities around the globe. In our initial year hundreds of our employees volunteered and contributed a total of over 450 hours to 15 organizations in the global communities in which we do business.
From a total rewards perspective, Synchronoss offers a competitive compensation and benefits package, which we review and update each year. Our annual compensation planning coincides with our feedback cycle where employees and managers have performance conversations to facilitate learning and career development. As part of our compensation review program, we conduct pay equity analyses annually.
