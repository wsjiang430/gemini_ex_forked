Item 1. BUSINESS
General
 Smith Micro develops software to simplify and enhance the mobile experience, providing solutions to some of the leading wireless service providers and cable multiple service operators (“MSOs”) around the world.  From enabling the family digital lifestyle to providing powerful voice messaging capabilities, our solutions enrich today’s connected lifestyles while creating new opportunities to engage consumers via smartphones and consumer devices for the Internet of Things (“IoT”). Our portfolio also includes a wide range of products for creating, sharing and monetizing rich content, such as visual messaging, optimizing retail content display, analytics capabilities, and 2D/3D graphics applications.
 In general, we offer our customers:
  
• | Valuable digital services for the connected digital lifestyle, including family location and parental controls, as well as enabling connected family and consumer IOT devices to mobile consumers worldwide;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Easy visual access to wirelessly delivered voicemail messages, while also providing easy conversion of voice messages to text and email messages;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Efficient, consistent and measurable retail content that educates consumers, creates awareness of products and services and drives in store sales;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Optimized wireless networks, reduced operational costs, and “best-connected” user experiences; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The ability to design and create 2D and 3D digital illustrations, animation and figure design with easy-to-use, professional-grade graphics software.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We continue to innovate and evolve our business to take advantage of industry trends and opportunities in emerging markets, such as digital lifestyle services and online safety, “Big Data” analytics, automotive telematics, and the consumer IoT marketplace. The key to our longevity, however, is not simply technological innovation, but a never-ending focus on customer value.
 During fiscal year 2018, we built on the steps taken throughout the prior year to improve operations and overall execution of our business, moving to growth and profitability. We stabilized and significantly strengthened our balance sheet during the year with three private placement transactions, which allowed us to repay certain short and long-term debt obligations and allowed us the flexibility to execute on other strategic initiatives. In December 2018, we entered into an asset purchase agreement for our acquisition of substantially all of the assets of the smart retail product suite of ISM Connect, LLC. The acquisition closed in January 2019, and the acquired product suite fits strategically within our wireless business.
 The Company was incorporated in California in November 1983, and reincorporated in Delaware in June 1995. Our principal executive offices are now located at 5800 Corporate Drive, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15237, after recently moving from our California location. Our telephone number is (412) 837-5300. Our website address is www.smithmicro.com, and we make our filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) available on the Investor Relations page of our website. Information contained on our website does not constitute a part of this Report. Our common stock is traded on the NASDAQ under the symbol “SMSI”.
 Business Segments
 Our business is focused on two industry segments: Wireless and Graphics. We do not separately allocate operating expenses, nor do we allocate specific assets to these segments. Therefore, segment information reported includes only revenues. See Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for financial information related to our business segments and geographical information.

Wireless Segment
 The wireless industry continues to undergo rapid change on all fronts, as connected devices, mobile applications, and digital content are consumed by users who want information, high-speed wireless connectivity, and entertainment anytime, anywhere. While most of us think about being “connected” in terms of computers, tablets and smartphones, the consumer IoT market is creating a world where almost anything can be connected to the wireless internet. Wearable devices such as smartwatches, smart home devices, fitness trackers, pet trackers and GPS locators are now commonplace, enabling people and pets to be connected to the “Internet of Everything” as well. These devices have created an entire ecosystem of over-the-top (“OTT”) apps, while expanding how communication service providers can provide value to mobile consumers.
 Although there are numerous business opportunities associated with pervasive connectivity, there are also numerous challenges, including:
  
• | The average age by which most children use smartphones and other connected devices continues to decrease. As such, parents and guardians must be proactive in managing and combating digital lifestyle problems such as excess screen time, cyberbullying, and online safety;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Complexity, congestion, and spectrum scarcity plague wireless networks, making it difficult and expensive to satisfy the demand for mobile services by consumers and businesses;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | As IoT use cases continue to proliferate and scale, management complexity, security and interoperability must be addressed efficiently and correctly;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Mobile Network Operators (“MNOs”) are being marginalized by messaging applications, and face growing competitive pressure from cable MSOs and others deploying Wi-Fi networks to attract mobile users;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Enterprises face increasing pressure to mobilize workforces, operations, and customer engagement, but lack the expertise and technologies needed to leverage mobile securely and cost-effectively; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Consumers, frustrated by slow, congested mobile networks and inconsistent device/app behavior, seek simpler network access and more personalized mobile experiences, while simultaneously demanding faster, cheaper, and more secure wireless services.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 To address these challenges, Smith Micro offers multi-platform, modular solutions such as:
 
SafePath® – The SafePath platform delivers a connected life experience for families and the connected devices that are part of their daily digital lifestyle inside and outside the home. The SafePath platform includes SafePath Family – enabling mobile service providers to meet the needs of their customers for family real time location, protection and parental controls services – and SafePath IoT – allowing service providers to deliver a connected digital life experience to their customers by bringing all of their connected devices like child and elderly wearable locators, pet trackers, car trackers, and connected home security devices under a single pane of glass.
 
CommSuite® – Smith Micro’s CommSuite premium messaging platform helps MNOs deliver a next-generation voicemail experience to mobile subscribers, while enabling them to monetize a legacy cost-center. CommSuite Visual Voicemail (“VVM”) quickly and easily allows users to manage voice messages just like email or SMS – with reply, forwarding and social sharing options. CommSuite also enables multi-language Voice-to-Text (“VTT”) transcription messaging, which facilitates convenient message consumption for users by reading versus listening. In 2018, the CommSuite product was installed on more than 18 million mobile handsets and is available to both postpaid premium subscribers as well as prepaid subscribers. 
 
ViewSpotTM – Our recently acquired smart retail platform provides wireless carriers and retailers with a way to bring powerful on-screen, interactive demos to life. These engaging demos deliver consistent, secure and targeted content that showcases the features of the devices that consumers want to see and learn more about.

Marketing and Sales Strategy
 Because of our broad product portfolio, deep integration experience, and flexible business models, we can quickly bring to market innovative solutions that support our customers’ needs to create new revenue opportunities and differentiate their products and services among their competitors.
 Our marketing and sales strategy is as follows:
 Leverage Operator Relationships. We continue to capitalize on our strong relationships with the world’s leading MNOs and MSOs. These customers serve as our primary distribution channel, providing access to hundreds of millions of end users around the world.
 Focus on High-Growth Markets. We continue to focus on providing digital lifestyle solutions, analytics/Big Data solutions, premium messaging services, and visual retail content marketing solutions.  
 Expand our Customer Base. In addition to growing our business with current customers, we look to expand our carrier and MSO customers worldwide, as well as to expand into new partnerships as we extend the reach of our product platforms within the connected lifestyle ecosystem. 
Key Revenue Contributors
 Revenues attributable to Sprint and their respective affiliates in the Wireless business segment accounted for 81% and 61% of the Company’s total revenues for fiscal years 2018 and 2017, respectively. Revenues attributable to FastSpring in the Graphics business segment accounted for 5% and 14% of the Company’s total revenues for fiscal years 2018 and 2017, respectively. The loss of any of our major customers or decisions by a significant customer to substantially reduce purchases from us for any reason could have a material adverse effect on our business. 
Customer Service and Technical Support
 We provide technical support and customer service through our online knowledge base, email, and live chat. OEM customers generally provide their own primary customer support functions and rely on us for support to their technical support personnel.
Product Development
 The software industry, particularly the wireless market, is characterized by rapid and frequent changes in technology and user needs. We work closely with industry groups and customers, both current and potential, to help us anticipate changes in technology and determine future customer needs. Software functionality depends upon the capabilities of the hardware. Accordingly, we maintain engineering relationships with various hardware manufacturers and we develop our software in tandem with their product development. Our engineering relationships with manufacturers, as well as with our major customers, are central to our product development efforts. We remain focused on the development and expansion of our technology, particularly in the wireless space. Research and development expenditures amounted to $8.6 million and $9.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Competition
 The markets in which we operate are highly competitive and subject to rapid changes in technology. These conditions create new opportunities for Smith Micro, as well as for our competitors, and we expect new competitors to continue to enter the market. We not only compete with other software vendors for new customer contracts, we also compete to acquire technology and qualified personnel.
 We believe that the principal competitive factors affecting the mobile software market include domain expertise, product features, usability, quality, price, customer service, and effective sales and marketing efforts. Although we believe that our products currently compete favorably with respect to these factors, there can be no assurance that we can maintain our competitive position against current and potential competitors. We also believe that the market for our software products has been and will continue to be characterized by significant price competition. A material reduction in the price we obtain for our products would negatively affect our profitability.

Many of our existing and potential customers have the resources to develop products that compete directly with our products. As such, these customers may opt to discontinue the purchase of our products in the future. With this as background, our future performance is substantially dependent upon the extent to which existing customers elect to purchase software from us rather than designing and developing their own software.
 Proprietary Rights and Licenses
 
We protect our intellectual property through a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, foreign intellectual property laws, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions. We have United States and foreign patents and pending patent applications that relate to various aspects of our products and technology. We have also registered, and applied for the registration of, U.S. and international trademarks, service marks, domain names, and copyrights. We will continue to apply for such protections in the future as we deem necessary to protect our intellectual property. We seek to avoid unauthorized use and disclosure of our proprietary intellectual property by requiring employees and third parties with access to our proprietary information to execute confidentiality agreements with us and by restricting access to our source code.
 
Our wireless customers license our products through software license agreements or access our offerings through software as a service (“SaaS”) agreements, and our graphics products are subject to “click-through” end user license agreements. Our license agreements contain restrictions on reverse engineering, duplication, disclosure, and transfer, and our SaaS agreements contain restrictions on access and use.
 
Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary technology and our intellectual property rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or obtain and use our technology to develop applications with the same functionality as our applications. Policing unauthorized use of our technology and intellectual property rights is difficult, and we may not be able to detect unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights or take effective steps to enforce our intellectual property rights.
 Employees
 As of December 31, 2018, we had a total of 153 employees within the following departments: 97 in engineering, 25 in sales and marketing, 10 in operations and customer support, and 21 in management and administration. We are not subject to any collective bargaining agreement and we believe that our relationships with our employees are good.
