ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

Our Company
Mercury Systems, Inc. is a leading commercial provider of secure sensor and safety-critical mission processing subsystems. Headquartered in Andover, Massachusetts, we deliver solutions that power a broad range of critical aerospace, commercial aviation, defense and intelligence programs, configured and optimized for mission success in some of the most challenging and demanding environments. Our innovative next-generation defense electronics business model is designed to meet the industry’s current and emerging technology and business needs by delivering affordable state-of-the-art solutions, rapid time-to-value and service and support to our defense prime contractor and our commercial aerospace customers. Our products and solutions are successfully deployed in more than 300 programs with over 25 different defense prime contractors and commercial aviation customers, a testament to our deep domain expertise and culture of innovation.
Our unique capabilities, technology and research and development (“R&D”) investment strategy combine to differentiate Mercury in our industry. Our technologies and capabilities include secure embedded processing modules and subsystems, mission computers, secure and rugged rack-mount servers, safety-critical avionics, radio frequency (“RF”) components, multi-function assemblies and subsystems. We maintain our technological edge by investing in critical capabilities and intellectual property (“IP” or “building blocks”) in processing and RF, leveraging open standards and open architectures to quickly adapt those building blocks into solutions for highly data-intensive applications for the sensor processing chain, all the way from the sensor to the network. This can encompass multiple sensor and mission processing functions - including emerging needs in artificial intelligence (“AI”). We leverage the Company’s building blocks to design, build and manufacture integrated sensor processing subsystems - often including classified application-specific software and IP - for the command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance ("C4ISR") and electronic warfare (“EW”) markets. These subsystems are deployed by our customers - defense and commercial aerospace companies, defense prime contractors and the U.S. Department of Defense (“DoD”) - in a variety of mission-critical applications. An important component of adapting these technologies and IP for these applications is our investment in specialized packaging, ruggedization and cooling to address size, weight and power (“SWaP”) challenges. These investments, coupled with our domestic design, development, and manufacturing capabilities in mission computing, safety-critical avionics and platform management solutions, and RF, microwave and millimeter wave components and subsystems, brings significant domain expertise to our customers.
Our consolidated revenues, acquired revenues, net income, diluted earnings per share (“EPS”), adjusted earnings per share (“adjusted EPS”) and adjusted EBITDA for fiscal 2019 were $654.7 million, $113.3 million, $46.8 million, $0.96, $1.84 and $145.3 million, respectively. Our consolidated revenues, acquired revenues, net income, earnings per share, adjusted EPS and adjusted EBITDA for fiscal 2018 were $493.2 million, $59.7 million, $40.9 million, $0.86, $1.42 and $114.6 million, respectively. See the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section of this annual report for a reconciliation of our acquired revenues, adjusted EPS and adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. 
Our Business Strategy
Our strategy is built around our key strengths as a leading commercial provider of secure sensor and safety-critical mission processing subsystems. Our strategy includes innovation and investment in scaling existing capabilities, as well as augmenting our capabilities through an acquisition strategy designed to focus on adjacent technologies. We believe our investment in R&D is more than double that of our competitors on a percentage basis. Our consistent strategy allows us to assist our customers, mostly defense prime contractors, to reduce program cost, minimize technical risk, stay on schedule and on budget, and ensure trust and security in the supply chain. In addition, we have earned a reputation for relentless execution on behalf of our customers. As a result we have successfully penetrated strategic government and commercial programs including Aegis, Patriot, Surface Electronic Warfare Improvement Program (“SEWIP”), Gorgon Stare, Predator, F-35, Reaper, F-16 SABR, E2-D Hawkeye, Paveway, Filthy 
Buzzard, PGK, ProVision, P-8, Advanced Integrated Defensive Electronic Warfare Suite (“AIDEWS”), Common Display System (“CDS”) and WIN-T.
We are committed to continued investment and innovation in advanced new products and solutions development to maintain our competitive advantage, including in the fields of RF, analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog conversion, advanced multi- and many-core sensor processing systems including graphics processing units (“GPUs”), safety-critical design and engineering, processing for AI, embedded security, digital storage, and digital radio frequency memory (“DRFM”) solutions, software defined communications capabilities, and advanced security technologies and capabilities. Concurrently, we leverage our engineering and development capabilities, including systems integration, to accelerate our strategy to become a commercial outsourcing partner to the large defense prime contractors as they seek the more rapid design, development and delivery of affordable, commercially-developed, open architecture solutions within the markets we serve. We invest in scalable manufacturing operations in the U.S. to enable rapid, cost-effective deployment of our microelectronics and secure processing solutions to our customers. 
Our unique commercial business model positions us to be compensated for non-recurring engineering which supplements our own internal R&D spend. We team concurrently with multiple defense prime contractors as they pursue new business with unique solutions they develop and market to the government, and engage with our customers early in the design cycle, and well ahead of our competition. Our engagement model can lead to long-term production revenue that will continue after the initial services are delivered. 
Since July 2015, we have added substantial capabilities to our technology portfolio including: embedded security, with the acquisitions of Lewis Innovative Technologies (“LIT”), custom microelectronics, RF and microwave solutions, and embedded security operations, with the carve-out acquisition from the Microsemi Corporation (the “Carve-Out Business”), The Athena Group, Inc. (“Athena”), Delta Microwave, LLC (“Delta”), and Syntonic Microwave LLC (“Syntonic”); mission computing, safety-critical avionics and platform management with the CES Creative Electronic Systems, S.A. (“CES”), Richland Technologies, L.L.C. (“RTL”), and GECO Avionics, LLC (“GECO”) acquisitions; and rugged servers, computers and storage systems with the acquisitions of Themis Computer (“Themis”) and Germane Systems, LC (“Germane”).
We believe we are the only high-tech commercial company with the technology breadth and depth and the domain expertise to build secure sensor and safety-critical processing mission subsystems. We utilize a framework that we call the six Ss (Silicon, Speed, SWaP, Software, Security, and Safety) to invest in technologies that differentiate our solutions at the subsystem level: 
•Silicon. We believe we are a leading conduit for commercial silicon innovation into the aerospace and defense market. We work directly with silicon level technology providers as they target their products toward the defense market. 
•Speed. We believe we have the highest performing processing capability in the defense electronics industry. We also have some of the highest performing broadband RF capability targeting EW applications. 
•SWaP. We have some of the best size, weight, power and cooling capabilities that ensure that our technology is able to run at the highest performance as well as the advanced ruggedization that is required to ensure that these technologies are able to operate consistently and effectively in the harsh environments in which they are required to operate. 
•Software. We have some of the industry’s most advanced open middleware that allows our customers a very low risk integration approach to port their applications on top of our hardware platforms. Our investment in multiple generations of technology provides significant protection for our customers and their applications as we can move from one generation of processing technology to the next without our customers needing to rewrite their applications. 
•Security. We have some of the industry’s most advanced embedded security capabilities. This is an important set of technologies and capabilities to differentiate us from our competitors. 
•Safety. We have the capability to build avionics subsystem solutions up to the highest safety design assurance levels (“DAL-A”), which is critical for both commercial and military aircraft operating in civilian airspace.
Our Solutions and Products
Hardware Products
We offer a broad family of products designed to meet the full range of requirements in compute-intensive, signal processing, image processing and command and control applications. To maintain a competitive advantage, we seek to leverage technology investments across multiple product lines and product solutions. Examples of hardware products include small, custom microelectronics, embedded sensor processing subsystems, RF and microwave components, modules, and subsystems, rugged servers, and avionics mission computers. 
Our hardware products are typically compute-intensive and require extremely high bandwidth and high throughput. These systems often must also meet significant SWaP constraints for use in aircraft, unmanned aerial vehicles (“UAVs”), ships and other platforms and be ruggedized for use in harsh environments. They can be used in both commercial aerospace applications, such as transportation, communications, ground radar air traffic control, as well as advanced defense and intelligence applications, including 
space-time adaptive processing, synthetic aperture radar, airborne early warning, command, control, communication and information systems, mission planning, image intelligence and signal intelligence systems. Our products transform the massive streams of digital data created in these applications into usable information in real time. The systems can scale from a few processors to thousands of processors.
We group our hardware products into the following categories:

• | Components. Components include technology elements typically performing a single, discrete technological function, which when physically combined with other components may be used to create a module or subassembly. Examples include but are not limited to power amplifiers and limiters, switches, oscillators, filters, equalizers, digital and analog converters, chips, MMICs (monolithic microwave integrated circuits), and memory and storage devices. 


• | Modules and Subassemblies. Modules and subassemblies include combinations of multiple functional technology elements and/or components that work together to perform multiple functions but are typically resident on or within a single board or housing. Modules and subassemblies may in turn be combined to form an integrated subsystem. Examples of modules and subassemblies include but are not limited to embedded processing modules, embedded processing boards, switch fabric boards, high speed input/output boards, digital receiver boards, graphics and video processing and Ethernet and input-output (“I/O”) boards, multi-chip modules, integrated radio frequency and microwave multi-function assemblies, tuners, and transceivers.


• | Integrated Subsystems. Integrated subsystems include multiple modules and/or subassemblies combined with a backplane or similar functional element and software to enable a solution. These are typically but not always integrated within a chassis and with cooling, power and other elements to address various requirements and are also often combined with additional technologies for interaction with other parts of a complete system or platform. Integrated subsystems also include spare and replacement modules and subassemblies sold as part of the same program for use in or with integrated subsystems sold by us. 

By providing pre-integrated subsystems to our customers, we enable them to rapidly and cost-effectively port and adapt their applications to changing threats. This approach also saves our customers valuable time and expense, as their costs to integrate modules and components typically minimize the costs of the individual product procurement. This benefit continues over time because we are continually investing research and development into our products. This allows us to provide our customers the latest technologies in our pre-integrated subsystems faster than they can typically do it themselves. We believe this is a better business and technology model to operate within, as it continues to provide value and benefits to us over time.
To address the current challenges facing the warfighter, our government and defense prime contractors, we have developed a new product architecture that supports a more dynamic, iterative, spiral development process by leveraging open architecture standards and leading-edge commercial technologies and products. Our open architecture is carried throughout our entire embedded computing product line from the very small form-factor subsystems to the high-end, where ultimate processing power and reliability is of paramount importance to the mission. Our commercially-developed hardware and software product capabilities cover the entire Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (“ISR”) spectrum from acquisition and digitization of the signal, to processing of the signal, through the exploitation and dissemination of the information. We work continuously to improve our hardware technology with an eye toward optimization of SWaP demands.
We use the latest Intel® server-class processing products as well as GPU products in our embedded high-performance processing technologies. While this multi-computing and embedded processing technology is one of our core skills, the SWaP constraints that are encountered in connection with the high-performance embedded processing applications create unique challenges. For example, to deal with the heat build-up involved in small subsystems, we introduced a key technology called Air-Flow-By™ that enables previously unattainable levels of processing power within a small footprint by effectively removing heat so the server-class processors can perform at maximum designed power limits. In rugged environments where air is limited, such as high-altitude operations, our Liquid-Flow-By™ technology has been successfully customer tested allowing maximum server-class processor performance. These innovative cooling techniques allow full performance server-class processing in rugged environments enabling new and advanced modes of operation that enhance the multi-intelligence, situational awareness and EW capabilities in military platforms.
Embedded systems security has become a requirement for new and emerging military programs, and our security solutions are a critical differentiator from our traditional competition. Our security solutions, combined with our next-generation secure Intel® server-class product line, together with increasingly frequent mandates from the government to secure electronic systems for domestic and foreign military sales, position us well to capitalize on DoD program protection security requirements. Finally, our built-in security framework creates higher product differentiation, drives greater program velocity, while lowering risk.
Open Standards Support
Mercury has a long history of driving modular open systems architectures and has remained committed to creating, advancing, and adopting open standards for all our products, from our smallest components and connectors to our largest, high-performance, 
integrated multi-computer systems. With thirty-five years of technology leadership within the high-performance embedded computing industry, we have pioneered or contributed to the development of many of the defense industry’s current and emerging open standards, including standards such as RACEway, RapidIO, VXS, VPX, REDI and notably OpenVPX. These open standards allow system integrators to benefit from the interoperability of modules produced by multiple vendors. We also continue to be influential in the industry-standard organizations associated with our market segments. As a member of the VMEbus International Trade Association (“VITA”), the Sensor Open Systems Architecture (“SOSA”) initiative, the Future Airborne Capability Environment (“FACE”) consortium, and the Vehicular Integration for C4ISR/EW Interoperability (“VICTORY”) consortium, among other standards bodies, Mercury is helping to guide the defense industry toward greater openness and vendor interoperability, consistent with the DoD’s focus on using modular open systems architectures (“MOSA”) in major programs.
Software Products
We design, market and sell complete software and middleware environments to accelerate development and execution of complex signal and image processing applications on a broad range of heterogeneous, multi-computing platforms that typically operate in mission-critical settings. Our software suite is based on open standards and includes heterogeneous processor support with extensive highly-optimized math libraries, multi-computing switch fabric support, net-centric and system management enabling services, extended operating system services, board support packages and development tools. This software platform delivers on the performance required for highly tuned real-time operation with the flexibility of open standards that are an essential ingredient of technology insertion and software life-cycle support.
In order to efficiently develop, test and integrate software ahead of hardware availability, we use a model that allows for concurrent engineering internally and with customers to accelerate time to deployment, improve quality and reduce development costs. In most cases, our software products are bundled together with broader solutions including hardware and/or services, while in other cases they are licensed separately. Our software framework enables our customers to easily port their applications to the latest hardware without having to rewrite them, preserving their investment. 
Our multi-computer software packages are a key differentiator for our subsystems business. We generally charge a user-based development license fee and bundle software run-time licenses with our hardware. We offer a standards-based software value proposition to our customers and provide this offer through several integrated software packages and service offerings.
For our avionics and safety product offering our BuiltSAFE™ Graphics Suite (“GS”) enables application developers to create content-rich embedded graphics applications and user interfaces for mission and safety-critical systems deployed in aerospace, defense, automotive and industrial environments. Our graphics drivers are certifiable to the highest levels of software criticality recognized by the FAA, EASA, Transport Canada and JAA.
We also design, market and sell software and firmware specifically designed to protect electronic systems that are critical to national security. These capabilities include cryptographic techniques to implement capabilities such as Differential Power Analysis (“DPA”) countermeasures and Physical Unclonable Functions (“PUF”). These products are designed to meet DoD program protection requirements. As multiple technologies are integrated into a secure platform it is essential that common Application Programming Interfaces (“APIs”) and software code have a known and controlled source and can provide clear and known user authentication, information assurance, tamper monitoring and resistance, and secure run-time operation.
Services
As part of our strategy, we are focused on being a commercial outsourcing partner to the large defense prime contractors as they seek the more rapid design, development and delivery of affordable, commercially developed, specialized processing solutions within the markets we serve. We deliver subsystem level engineering expertise as well as ongoing systems integration services addressing our strategy to capitalize on the multi-billion-dollar subsystem market within the defense embedded electronics market segment.
As the U.S. government mandates more outsourcing and open standards, a major shift is occurring within the defense prime contractor community towards procurement of integrated subsystems that enable quick application level porting through standards-based methodologies. We believe that our core expertise in this area is well aligned to capitalize on this trend. By leveraging our open architecture and high-performance modular product set, we provide defense prime contractors with rapid deployment and quick reaction capabilities through our professional services and systems integration offerings. This results in less risk for the defense prime contractors, shortened development cycles, quicker solution deployment and reduced life-cycle costs.
We also offer unique safety-critical engineering service tailored to help our customers achieve their engineering, development, and certification goals for avionics applications.
We define service revenues as revenue from activities that are not associated with the design, development, production, or delivery of tangible assets, software or specific capabilities sold by us. Examples of our service revenues include: analyst services and systems engineering support, consulting, maintenance and other support, testing and installation. We combine our product and service revenues into a single class as services revenues are less than 10 percent of total revenues.

Finally, our CES addition, due to its location in Geneva, is helping to open more opportunities in international markets.
We believe there are a number of evolving trends that are reshaping our target markets and accordingly provide us with attractive growth opportunities. These trends include:

• | The aerospace and defense electronics market is expected to grow in 2019 and beyond. According to Renaissance Strategic Advisors (“RSA”), the global aerospace and defense electronics market is estimated to be $125 billion in 2019, growing to $151 billion by 2023. Within this global market, RSA estimates that the U.S. defense electronics market will be approximately $69 billion in 2019, growing to $85 billion in 2023. The aerospace and defense electronics marketplace consists of two primary subsegments: (i) C4I and (ii) sensor and effector mission systems. C4I encompasses platform and mission management, which include avionics and vetronics, C2I, which includes command and control and intelligence, and dedicated communications processing. Sensor and effector mission systems are primarily different types of sensor modalities such as EW, radar, EO/IR, and acoustics as well as weapons systems such as missiles and munitions. Within the tier 2 C4I market in which we participate, RSA estimates the market for 2019 to be $6.7 billion for platform and mission management, $8.1 billion for C2I, and $8.2 billion for dedicated communications. RSA estimates the compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) from 2018-2023 for these markets to be 6.5% for platform and mission management, 6.2% for C2I, and 5.8% for dedicated communications. Within the tier 2 sensor and effector mission systems market in which we participate, RSA estimates the market for 2019 to be $4.5 billion for EW, $5.1 billion for radar, $1.9 billion for EO/IR, $1.2 billion for acoustics, and $3.1 billion for weapons systems. RSA estimates the 2018-2023 CAGR for these markets to be 5.2% for EW, 6.2% for radar, 6.5% for EO/IR, 6.5% for acoustics, and 8.1% for weapons systems. Within the context of the overall U.S. defense budget and spending for defense electronics specifically, we believe the C4ISR, EW, guided missiles and precision munitions, and ballistic missile defense market segments have a high priority for future DoD spending. We continue to build on our strengths in the design and development of performance optimized electronic subsystems for these markets, and often team with multiple defense prime contractors as they bid for projects, thereby increasing our chance of a successful outcome. We expect to continue our above industry-average growth.


• | The rapidly expanding demand for tactical ISR is leading to significant growth in sensor data being generated, leading to even greater demand for the capability of our products to securely store and process data onboard platforms. An increase in the prevalence and resolution of ISR sensors is generating significant growth in the associated data that needs to be stored and turned into information for the warfighter in a timely manner. In addition, several factors are driving the defense and intelligence industries to demand greater capability to collect, store, and process data onboard the aircraft, UAVs, ships and other vehicles, which we refer to collectively as platforms. These factors include the limited communications bandwidth of existing platforms, the need for platforms that can operate more autonomously and possibly in denied communications environments, the need for platforms with increased persistence to enable them to remain in or fly above the battlefield for extended periods, and the need for greater onboard processing capabilities. In addition, the advent of sophisticated AI algorithms is beginning to revolutionize the ability of sensor processing systems to intelligently and efficiently process and act upon these large data sets. Standard computing architectures and computing platforms currently do not offer the level of performance needed to optimize existing AI algorithms, creating an additional opportunity for advanced processing capabilities onboard the platform.


• | Rogue nations’ missile programs and threats from peer nations are causing greater investment in advanced new radar, EW and ballistic missile defense capabilities. There are a number of new and emerging threats, such as peer nations developing stealth technologies, including stealth aircraft, new anti-ship ballistic missiles and a variety of other advanced missile capabilities. Additionally, U.S. armed forces require enhanced signals intelligence and jamming capabilities. In response to these emerging threats, we have participated in key DoD programs, including Aegis, Patriot, SEWIP, a large ground-based radar, F-22, Raptor, F-35 Joint Strike Fighter and upgrade programs for the F-15 and F-16.


• | The long-term DoD budget pressure is pushing more dollars toward upgrades of the electronic subsystems on existing platforms, which may increase demand for our products. The DoD is moving from major new weapons systems developments to upgrades of the electronic subsystems on existing platforms. These upgrades are expected to include more sensors, signal processing, ISR algorithms, multi-intelligence fusion and exploitation, computing and communications. We believe that upgrades to provide new urgent war fighting capability, driven by combatant commanders, are occurring more rapidly than traditional defense prime contractors can easily react to. We believe these trends will cause defense prime contractors to increasingly seek out our high-performance, cost-effective open architecture products.


• | Defense procurement reform is causing the defense prime contractors to outsource more work to commercial companies and we believe that prime contractor outsourcing is our largest secular growth opportunity. RSA estimates that in 2019 the U.S. defense tier 2 embedded computing and RF market addressable by suppliers such as Mercury is approximately $19 billion. RSA estimates that the U.S. defense prime contractors currently outsource only a small percentage of their work. On a global basis the tier 2 embedded computing and RF market in 2019 is estimated by RSA to be $39 billion. The U.S. government is intensely focused on making systems more affordable and shortening their development time. In addition, the U.S. government is challenging defense prime contractors to leverage commercial technology wherever possible. This trend, along with a scarcity of technical and engineering talent in the market, is causing defense prime contractors to outsource to companies like Mercury, which we believe is our largest secular growth opportunity. As a company that provides commercial items to the defense industry, we believe our products and subsystem solutions are often more affordable than solutions with the same functionality developed by a defense prime contractor. Several factors are providing incentives for defense prime contractors to outsource more work to subcontractors with significant expertise and cost-effective technology capabilities and solutions, and we have transformed our business model over the last several years to address these long-term outsourcing trends and other needs.


• | DoD security and program protection requirements are creating new opportunities for domestic sourcing and our advanced secure processing capabilities. The government is focused on ensuring that the U.S. military protects its defense electronic systems and the information held within them from nefarious activities such as tampering, reverse engineering, and other forms of advanced attacks, including cyber. The requirement to add security comes at a time when the commercial technology world continues to offshore more of the design, development, manufacturing, and support of such capabilities, making it more difficult to protect against embedded vulnerabilities, tampering, reverse engineering and other undesired activities. The DoD has a mandate to ensure both the provenance and integrity of the technology and its associated supply chain. These factors have created a unique opportunity for us to expand beyond sensor processing into the provision of technologies ranging from advanced secure processing subsystems to miniaturized custom microelectronics devices and capabilities for other on-board critical computing applications designed, developed, manufactured, and supported in the U.S.A. In addition, advanced systems sold to foreign military buyers also require protection so that the technologies, techniques and data associated with them do not become more widely available, which further enhances our market opportunity.

Our Competitive Strengths 
We believe the following competitive strengths will allow us to take advantage of the evolving trends in our industry and successfully pursue our business strategy:

• | Subsystem Solutions Provider for the C4ISR and EW Markets. Through our commercially developed, specialized processing subsystem solutions, we address the challenges associated with the collection and processing of massive, continuous streams of data and dramatically shorten the time that it takes to give information to U.S. armed forces at the tactical edge. Our solutions are specifically designed for flexibility and interoperability, allowing our products to be easily integrated into larger system-level solutions. Our ability to integrate subsystem-level capabilities allows us to provide solutions that most effectively address the mission-critical challenges within the C4ISR market, including multi-intelligence data fusion and AI processing onboard the platform. We leverage our deep expertise in embedded multicomputing, embedded sensor processing, with the addition of our RF microwave and millimeter subsystems and components, along with strategic investments in research and development to provide solutions across the sensor processing chain.


• | Diverse Mix of Stable, Growth Programs Aligned with DoD Funding Priorities. Our products and solutions have been deployed on more than 300 different programs and over 25 different defense prime contractors. We serve high priority markets for the DoD and foreign militaries, such as UAVs, ballistic missile defense, guided missiles and precision munitions, airborne reconnaissance, EW, and have secured positions on mission-critical programs including Aegis, Predator and Reaper UAVs, F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, Patriot missile, SEWIP, and Paveway. In addition, we consistently leverage our technology and capabilities across multiple programs, providing significant operating leverage and cost savings. Our recent acquisitions allow us to participate in a broader array of programs, many with key strategic customers of ours.


• | We are a leading commercial provider of secure processing subsystems designed and made in the U.S.A. We have a portfolio of Open Standards Architecture (“OSA”) technology building blocks across the entire sensor processing chain. We offer embedded secure processing capabilities with advanced packaging and cooling technologies that ruggedize commercial technologies while allowing them to stay cool for reliable operation. These capabilities allow us to help our customers meet the demanding SWaP requirements of today’s defense platforms. Our pre-integrated subsystems improve affordability by substantially reducing customer system integration costs and time-to-market for our solutions. System integration costs are one of the more substantial costs our customers bear in developing and deploying technologies in defense programs and platforms. Our pre-integrated solutions approach allows for more rapid and affordable modernization of existing platforms and faster deployment of new platforms.

Our strengths in this area include our position as an early and leading advocate for OSA in defense, offering Intel® server class processing form factors across 3/6U OpenVPX, ATCA and rack-mount architectures, and high density, secure solutions across multiple hardware architectures to seamlessly scale to meet our customers’ SWaP requirements. In addition, we have a 30-year legacy of system management and system integration expertise that allows us to reduce technical risk, while improving affordability and interoperability. Our system integration expertise is a cornerstone in helping us support our customers in deploying pre-integrated, OSA subsystems.
As more commercial technology companies move the design, development, manufacturing, and support of their technologies offshore, the DoD is looking to domestic technology providers to develop a sustainable, U.S.-based trusted supply chain. Over the several years we have been building out our capacity for domestic manufacturing through our Advanced Microelectronics Centers (“AMCs”). These facilities provide significant scale and capacity for our defense prime customers, who have been increasingly willing to outsource to partners with the scale needed to meet large program production requirements. In addition, our Phoenix, Arizona AMC is a Defense Microelectronics Activity (“DMEA”)-certified, trusted manufacturing facility, which represents a significant competitive advantage. Our Phoenix AMC also includes a surface mount technology manufacturing capability which we refer to as our U.S. Manufacturing Operations (“USMO”).

• | We provide advanced, integrated security features for our products and subsystems, addressing an increasingly prevalent requirement for DoD program security. We offer secure processing expertise that is built-in to our pre-integrated subsystems. By doing this we are able to provide secure building blocks that allow our customers to also incorporate their own security capabilities. This assists our customers in ensuring program protection as they deploy critical platforms and programs, all in support of DoD missions. The acquisition of the Carve-Out Business brought us new security technologies and also allowed us to provide enhanced security capabilities in areas such as memory and storage devices. Our acquisitions of the Carve-Out Business, LIT, and Athena also added to our portfolio of sophisticated firmware and software specifically designed to secure microelectronic devices that can be leveraged across our product portfolio.


• | We are pioneering a next generation business model. The DoD and the defense industrial base is currently undergoing a major transformation. Domestic political and budget uncertainty, geopolitical instability and evolving global threats have

become constants. The defense budget, while stabilized in the short term, remains under pressure and R&D and technology spending are often in budgetary competition with the increasing costs of military personnel requirements, health care costs, and other important elements within the DoD and the federal budget generally. Finally, defense acquisition reform calls for the continued drive for innovation and competition within the defense industrial base, while also driving down acquisition costs. Our approach is built around a few key pillars:

• | We continue to leverage our expertise in building pre-integrated subsystems in support of critical defense programs, driving out procurement costs by lowering integration expenses of our customers.


• | We have been a pioneer in driving OSA for both embedded computing and RF.


• | The DoD has asked defense industry participants to invest their own resources into R&D. This approach is a pillar of our business model.


• | Security and program protection are now critical considerations for both program modernizations as well as for new program deployment. We are now in our third generation of building secure embedded processing solutions.

We have a next generation business model built to meet the emerging needs of the DoD.

• | Value-Added Subsystem Solution Provider for Defense Prime Contractors. Because of the DoD’s continuing shift toward a firm fixed price contract procurement model, an increasingly uncertain budgetary and procurement environment, and increased budget pressures from both the U.S. and allied governments, defense prime contractors are accelerating their move toward outsourcing opportunities to help mitigate the increased program and financial risk. Our differentiated secure sensor and safety-critical processing solutions offer meaningful capabilities upgrades for our customers and enable the rapid, cost-effective deployment of systems to the end customer. We believe our open architecture subsystems offer differentiated sensor processing and data analytics capabilities that cannot be easily replicated. Our solutions minimize program risk, maximize application portability, and accelerate customers’ time to market, all within a fixed-pricing contracting environment.


• | Delivery of Platform-Ready Solutions for Classified Programs. We believe our integration work through our Cypress, California facility provides us with critical insights as we implement and incorporate key classified government intellectual property, including critical intelligence and signal processing algorithms, into advanced systems. This integration work provides us the opportunity to combine directly and integrate our technology building blocks along with our intellectual property into our existing embedded processing products and solutions, enabling us to deliver more affordable, platform-ready integrated ISR subsystems that leverage our OSA and address key government technology and procurement concerns. Our operations in this environment also help us identify emerging needs and opportunities to influence our future product development, so that critical future needs can be met in a timely manner with commercially-developed products and solutions.


• | We have invested in advanced, domestic design and manufacturing capabilities. Over the past several years we have prioritized investments to build our internal capabilities and capacity for defense electronics design and manufacturing in the U.S. These investments include the consolidation of a number of sub-scale microelectronics manufacturing facilities into our modern AMCs as well as the establishment of our USMO in Phoenix, Arizona. In addition to the consolidation of facilities into scalable engineering and manufacturing centers of excellence, we have made the necessary investments to outfit these facilities with modern, scalable, and redundant tools and equipment to promote quality, efficiency, throughput, and redundancy. In addition we invested in our information technology (“IT”) infrastructure and business systems to meet Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (“DFARS”) requirements for cybersecurity. These investments taken together are intended to demonstrate our commitment to meeting DoD expectations for a trusted and secure defense industrial base. Our AMCs in Hudson, New Hampshire, West Caldwell, New Jersey, Oxnard, California, Huntsville, Alabama and Phoenix, Arizona are strategically located near key customers and are purpose-built for the design, build and test of RF components and subsystems in support of a variety of key customer programs. Our USMO is built around scalable, repeatable, secure, affordable, and predictable manufacturing. The USMO is a DMEA certified secure trusted site, certified to AS9100 quality standards and it utilizes Lean Six Sigma methodologies throughout manufacturing. The USMO is designed for efficient manufacturing, enabling our customers to access the best proven technology and high performing, secure processing solutions. This allows for the most repeatable product performance, while optimizing affordability and production responsiveness.


• | Long-Standing Industry Relationships. We have established long-standing relationships with defense prime contractors, the U.S. government and other key organizations in the defense industry over our 30 years in the defense electronics industry. Our customers include Airbus, BAE Systems, Boeing, General Atomics, General Dynamics, L3Harris Technologies, Leonardo, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, and Raytheon. Over this period, we have become recognized for our ability to develop new technologies and meet stringent program requirements. We believe we are well-positioned to maintain these high-level customer engagements and enhance them through the additional relationships that our recently acquired businesses have with many of the same customers.


• | Proven Management Team. Our senior management team has developed a long-term compelling strategy for the aerospace and defense markets. Our senior management team has a history of identifying and evaluating successful business acquisition opportunities, performing in-depth due diligence, negotiating with owners and management, structuring, financing, and closing transactions and then integrating the acquired business resulting in the creation of synergies and enhanced overall returns. Having completed these critical steps with a senior management team with significant experience in growing, scaling and acquiring businesses, we believe that we have demonstrated our operational capabilities and we are well-positioned to continue growing and scaling our business.


• | Leading M&A Origination and Execution Capability. We have a strong track-record of identifying and executing strategic acquisitions. Since July 1, 2015 we have acquired ten businesses, successfully completing integration of the earlier acquired businesses with the integration of the more recent acquisitions progressing well, which are strategically aligned with Mercury. We have established an internal team that brings decades of experience across more than 100 transactions. We have developed internal processes to identify and source strategic acquisitions on a proprietary basis. A number of our acquisitions have been sourced on a proprietary basis and negotiated directly with owners. In addition, we have developed relationships with a number of investment banks and other sell-side advisors, as well as a reputation as a preferred acquirer, which allow us access to targeted or widely-marketed M&A processes. Our internal capabilities include financial, legal, and other transaction diligence, deal valuation, and deal negotiations. Where appropriate, we leverage third party advisors to supplement our internal diligence. We have a proven ability to execute numerous transactions simultaneously effectively and efficiently.


• | Proven M&A Integration Capability. We have developed the internal processes and capability to integrate acquired businesses to deliver value through revenue and cost synergies. We leverage our common cultures and values as well as common processes, business systems, tools, channels and manufacturing infrastructure to accelerate growth and improve profitability in our acquired businesses.

Competition
We operate in a highly competitive marketplace characterized by rapidly changing technology, frequent product performance improvements, increasing speed of deployment to align with warfighters’ needs, and evolving industry standards and requirements coming from our customers or the DoD. Competition typically occurs at the design stage of a prospective customer’s product, where the customer evaluates alternative technologies and design approaches. We work with defense prime contractors as well as directly with the DoD. We help drive subsystem development and deployment in both classified and unclassified environments.
The principal competitive factors in our market are price/performance value proposition, available new products at the time of design win engagement, services and systems integration capability, effective marketing and sales efforts, and reputation in the market. Our competitive strengths include rapid, innovative engineering in both hardware and software products, subsystem design expertise, advanced packaging capability to deliver the most optimized SWaP solution possible, our ability to respond rapidly to varied customer requirements, and a track record of successfully supporting many high profile programs in the defense market. There are a limited number of competitors across the market segments and application types in which we compete. Some of these competitors are larger and have greater resources than us. Some of these competitors compete against us at purely a component or board-level, others at a subsystem level. We also compete with in-house design teams at our customers. The DoD as well as the defense prime contractors are pushing for more outsourcing of subsystem designs to mitigate risk and to enable concurrent design of the platform which ultimately leads to faster time to deployment. We have aligned our strategy to capitalize on that trend and are leveraging our long standing subsystem expertise to provide this value to our customers.

Our Silchester, England facility provides engineering, development and integration services and is AS9100 quality systems certified.
We rely on both vertical integration and subcontracting to contract manufacturers to meet our manufacturing needs. Our USMO and Geneva facilities have the manufacturing capabilities to complete the assembly and testing for certain of our embedded multi-computing products. We subcontract as needed a portion of the assembly and testing for our other embedded multi-computing products to contract manufacturers in the U.S. to build to our specifications. Our printed circuit board assemblies and chassis subsystems' manufacturing operations also consist of materials planning and procurement, final assembly and test and logistics (inventory and traffic management). Our vertically integrated subsystem product solutions rely on strong relationships with strategic suppliers to ensure on-time delivery and high quality products. We manage supplier performance and capability through quality audits and stringent source, incoming and/or first article inspection processes. We have a comprehensive quality and process control plan for each of our products, which include an effective supply chain management program and the use of automated inspection and test equipment to assure the quality and reliability of our products. We perform most post sales service obligations (both warranty and other lifecycle support) in-house through a dedicated service and repair operation. We periodically review our contract manufacturing capabilities to ensure we are optimized for the right mix of quality, affordability, performance and on-time delivery.
Our AMC in Phoenix, Arizona is built around scalable, repeatable, secure, affordable, and predictable manufacturing.
