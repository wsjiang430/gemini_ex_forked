Item 1. Business. 
 All references in this report to “Registrant,” “Company,” “Schlumberger,” “we” or “our” are to Schlumberger Limited (Schlumberger N.V., incorporated in Curaçao) and its consolidated subsidiaries.
 Founded in 1926, Schlumberger is the world’s leading provider of technology for reservoir characterization, drilling, production and processing to the oil and gas industry.  Having invented wireline logging as a technique for obtaining downhole data in oil and gas wells, today Schlumberger supplies the industry’s most comprehensive range of products and services, from exploration through production, and integrated pore-to-pipeline solutions that optimize hydrocarbon recovery to deliver reservoir performance.  As of December 31, 2018, the Company employed approximately 100,000 people of over 140 nationalities operating in more than 85 countries. Schlumberger has executive offices in Paris, Houston, London and The Hague. 
 Schlumberger operates in each of the major oilfield service markets, through four segments: Reservoir Characterization, Drilling, Production and Cameron.  Each segment consists of a number of technology-based service and product lines, or Technologies.  These Technologies cover the entire life cycle of the reservoir and correspond to a number of markets in which Schlumberger holds leading positions. The role of the Technologies is to support Schlumberger in providing the best possible service to customers and to ensure that Schlumberger remains at the forefront of technology development and services integration.  The Technologies are collectively responsible for driving excellence in execution throughout their businesses; overseeing operational processes, resource allocation and personnel; and delivering superior financial results.
 The segments are as follows:

SPM creates alignment between Schlumberger and the asset holder and/or the operator whereby Schlumberger receives remuneration in line with its value creation.  These projects are generally focused on developing and co-managing production of customer assets under long-term agreements.    Schlumberger will invest its own services and products, and in some cases cash, into the field development activities and operations.  Although in certain arrangements Schlumberger is paid for a portion of the services or products it provides, generally Schlumberger will not be paid at the time of providing its services or upon delivery of its products.  Instead, Schlumberger is generally compensated based upon cash flow generated or on a fee-per-barrel basis.  This includes certain arrangements whereby Schlumberger is only compensated based upon incremental production that it helps deliver above a mutually agreed baseline.  SPM represented less than 5% of Schlumberger’s consolidated revenue during each of 2018, 2017 and 2016.

--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Supporting the Technologies is a global network of research and engineering centers.  Through this organization, Schlumberger is committed to advanced technology programs that enhance oilfield efficiency, lower finding and producing costs, improve productivity, maximize reserve recovery and increase asset value while accomplishing these goals in a safe and environmentally sound manner.
 A network of GeoMarket* regions, within each of four major geographic areas of North America, Latin America, Europe/CIS/Africa and Middle East & Asia, provides logistical, technical and commercial coordination. 
 The GeoMarket structure offers customers a single point of contact at the local level for field operations and brings together geographically focused teams to meet local needs and deliver customized solutions.  The GeoMarkets are responsible for providing the most efficient and cost-effective support possible to the operations.
 Schlumberger primarily uses its own personnel to market its offerings.  The customer base, business risks and opportunities for growth are essentially uniform across all services and products.  Manufacturing and engineering facilities as well as research centers are shared, and the labor force is interchangeable.  Technological innovation, quality of service and price differentiation are the principal methods of competition, which vary geographically with respect to the different services and products offered.  While Schlumberger has numerous competitors, both large and small, Schlumberger believes it is an industry leader in providing geophysical equipment and  services, wireline logging, well production testing, exploration and production software, rig equipment, surface equipment, subsea equipment, artificial lift, hydraulic fracturing, cementing, coiled-tubing services, drilling and completion fluids, solids control and waste management, drilling pressure control, drill bits, measurement-while-drilling, logging-while-drilling, directional-drilling services, and surface data (mud) logging.
 GENERAL 
 Intellectual Property 
 Schlumberger owns and controls a variety of intellectual property, including but not limited to patents, proprietary information and software tools and applications that, in the aggregate, are material to Schlumberger’s business. While Schlumberger seeks and holds numerous patents covering various products and processes, no particular patent or group of patents is material to Schlumberger’s business. 
Seasonality 
 Seasonal changes in weather and significant weather events can temporarily affect the delivery of oilfield services. For example, the spring thaw in Canada and consequent road restrictions can affect activity levels, while the winter months in the North Sea, Russia and China can produce severe weather conditions that can temporarily reduce levels of activity. In addition, hurricanes and typhoons can disrupt coastal and offshore operations. Furthermore, customer spending patterns for multiclient data, software and other oilfield services and products generally result in higher activity in the fourth quarter of each year as clients seek to fully utilize their annual budgets. 
 Customers and Backlog of Orders 
 For the year ended December 31, 2018, no single customer exceeded 10% of consolidated revenue. Other than the OneSubsea, Drilling Systems and WesternGeco businesses, Schlumberger has no significant backlog due to the nature of its businesses.  The combined backlog of these businesses was $2.7 billion at December 31, 2018 (of which approximately 50% is expected to be recognized as revenue during 2019) and $2.5 billion at December 31, 2017.
