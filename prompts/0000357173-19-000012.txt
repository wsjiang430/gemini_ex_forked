         Completed Merger with Greater Chicago Financial Corp.
     On April 20, 2018, we completed our acquisition of Greater Chicago Financial Corp., and its wholly-owned bank subsidiary, ABC Bank.  In connection with the merger, Greater Chicago Financial Corp. merged with and into the Company, with the Company as the surviving company in the merger.  Immediately following the merger, ABC Bank, an Illinois state-chartered bank and wholly-owned subsidiary of Greater Chicago Financial Corp., merged with and into the Bank, with the Bank as the surviving bank.  With the acquisition of ABC Bank, we acquired four branches in the Chicago, Illinois, metropolitan area.  ABC Bank had total assets with a fair value of $336.9 million as of April 20, 2018, including $227.6 million of loans, net of purchase accounting adjustments.     Market Area
     Our main office is located at 37 South River Street, Aurora, Illinois 60507. The city of Aurora is located in northeastern Illinois, approximately 40 miles west of Chicago. The Bank operates primarily in Cook, DeKalb, DuPage, Kane, Kendall, LaSalle, and Will counties in Illinois, and it has developed a strong presence in these counties.  The Bank offers its services to retail, commercial,

industrial, and public entity customers in the Aurora, North Aurora, Batavia, St. Charles, Burlington, Elburn, Elgin, Kaneville, Sugar Grove, Lisle, Joliet, Yorkville, Plano, Wasco, Ottawa, Oswego, Sycamore, Frankfort, Chicago, Bensenville, and Chicago Heights communities and surrounding areas through its 29 banking locations that are located primarily west and south of the Chicago metropolitan area.      Lending Activities
     We provide a broad range of commercial and retail lending services to corporations, partnerships, individuals and government agencies.  We actively market our services to qualified borrowers, and our lending officers actively solicit the business of new borrowers entering our market areas as well as long-standing members of the local business community.  We have established lending policies that include a number of underwriting factors to be considered in making a loan, including location, amortization, loan to value ratio, cash flow, pricing, documentation and the credit history of the borrower.  In 2018, we originated approximately $658.7 million in loans.  Our total loan portfolio grew $279.4 million in 2018 due to our acquisition of ABC Bank, organic originations and select portfolio purchases of leases and home equity loans from third parties. In addition, we originated approximately $173.1 million of residential mortgage loans in 2018, which includes originations of loans held for sale of $133.9 million.  Proceeds from the sales of residential mortgage loans to third parties were $137.6 million in 2018.    
     Our loan portfolio is comprised primarily of loans in the areas of commercial real estate, residential real estate, general commercial, construction real estate, leases, and consumer lending.  As of December 31, 2018, commercial real estate loans represented approximately 43.5% (46.4% at year-end 2017) of our loan portfolio, residential mortgages represented approximately 21.6% (19.4% at year-end 2017), general commercial loans represented approximately 16.7% (16.9% at year-end 2017), home equity lines of credit represented 7.4% (7.0% at year-end 2017), construction lending represented approximately 5.7% (5.3% at year-end 2017), leases represented approximately 4.2% (4.2% at year-end 2017), and consumer and other lending represented less than 1.0% (less than 1.0% at year-end 2017).  It is our policy to comply at all times with the various consumer protection laws and regulations including, but not limited to, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Community Reinvestment Act, the Truth in Lending Act, and the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act.
     Commercial Loans. We continue to focus on identifying commercial and industrial prospects in our new business pipeline with favorable results in 2018.  As noted above, we are an active commercial lender in the Chicago metropolitan area, with primary markets in the city of Chicago, as well as west and south of Chicago.  Commercial lending reflects revolving lines of credit for working capital, lending for capital expenditures on manufacturing equipment and lending to small business manufacturers, service companies, medical and dental entities as well as specialty contractors.  We also have commercial and industrial loans to customers in food product manufacturing, food process and packing, machinery tooling manufacturing as well as service and technology companies.  Collateral for these loans generally includes accounts receivable, inventory, equipment and real estate.  In addition, we often secure personal guarantees to help assure repayment.  Loans may be made on an unsecured basis if warranted by the overall financial condition of the borrower.  Commercial term loans range principally from one to seven years with the majority falling in the one to five year range.  Interest rates on commercial loans are a mixture of fixed and variable rates, with these rates often tied to the prime rate, a spread over the FHLB Chicago index rate, or LIBOR.  
     Repayment of commercial loans is largely dependent upon the cash flows generated by the operations of the commercial borrower.  Our underwriting procedures identify the sources of those cash flows and seek to match the repayment terms of the commercial loans to the sources.  Secondary repayment sources are typically found in collateralization and guarantor support.
     Lease Financing Receivables.  We continued growth of our lease portfolio in 2018 primarily with organic lease originations. The collateral for lease financing receivables primarily includes manufacturing and transportation equipment, and lease terms typically range from one to seven years, with the majority falling in the one to five year range.  Growth in this portfolio reflects management’s efforts to diversify lending product offerings, and improve loan concentration metrics.
     Commercial Real Estate Loans. While management has been actively working to reduce our concentration in real estate loans, a large portion of the loan portfolio continues to be comprised of commercial real estate loans.  As of December 31, 2018, approximately $358.1 million, or 43.6% (42.2%, at year-end 2017) of the total commercial real estate loan portfolio of $820.9 million consisted of loans to borrowers secured by owner occupied property.  A primary repayment risk for a commercial real estate loan is interruption or discontinuance of cash flows from operations, which are usually derived from rent in the case of non-owner occupied commercial properties.  Repayment could also be influenced by economic events, which may or may not be under the control of the borrower, or changes in regulations that negatively impact the future cash flow and market values of the affected properties.  Repayment risk can also arise from general downward shifts in the valuations of classes of properties over a given geographic area such as the significant price adjustments that were observed by the Bank in 2008 through 2011.  Property valuations could continue to be affected by changes in demand and other economic factors, which could further influence cash flows associated with the borrower and/or the property.  We seek to mitigate these risks by staying apprised of market conditions and by maintaining underwriting practices that provide for adequate cash flow margins and multiple repayment sources as well as remaining in regular contact with our borrowers.  In most cases, we have collateralized these loans and/or have taken personal guarantees to help assure repayment.  Commercial real estate loans are primarily made based on the identified cash flow of the borrower and/or the property at origination and secondarily on the underlying

real estate acting as collateral.  Additional credit support is provided by the borrower for most of these loans and the probability of repayment is based on the liquidation value of the real estate and enforceability of personal and corporate guarantees if any exist.
     Construction Loans. Our construction and development portfolio increased from $85.2 million at December 31, 2017, to $108.4 million at December 31, 2018, due to the ABC Bank acquisition as well as organic loan originations in strengthening markets.  We use underwriting and construction loan guidelines to determine whether to issue loans on build-to-suit or build out arrangements of existing borrower properties.
     Construction loans are structured most often to be converted to permanent loans at the end of the construction phase or, infrequently, to be paid off upon receiving financing from another financial institution.  Construction loans are generally limited to our local market area.  Lending decisions have been based on the “as-is” and “prospective” appraised value of the property as determined by an independent appraiser, an analysis of the potential marketability and profitability of the project and identification of a cash flow source to service the permanent loan or verification of a refinancing source.  Construction loans generally have terms of 12 to 18 months, with extensions as needed.  The Bank disburses loan proceeds in increments as construction progresses and as inspections warrant.
     Development lending often involves the disbursement of substantial funds with repayment dependent, in part, on the success of the ultimate project rather than the ability of the borrower or guarantor to repay principal and interest.  Therefore, development lending generally involves more risk than other lending because it is based on future estimates of value and economic circumstances.  While appraisals are required prior to funding, loan advances are limited to the “prospective” value determined by the appraisal, therefore there is the possibility of an unforeseen event affecting the value and/or costs of the project.  Development loans are primarily used for multi-family developments, where the leasing of units is tied to local demand and rental rates, and commercial developments, where the success of the project is tied to the demand for commercial space, cap rates and leasing rates.  If the borrower defaults prior to completion of the project, we may be required to fund additional amounts so that another developer can complete the project.  We are located in an area where a large amount of development activity has occurred as rural and semi-rural areas are being suburbanized.  This type of growth presents some economic risks should local demand for commercial buildings and multi-family housing shift.  We address these risks by closely monitoring local real estate activity, adhering to proper underwriting procedures, closely monitoring construction projects, and limiting the amount of construction development lending.
     Residential Real Estate Loans. Residential first mortgage loans and second mortgages are included in this category.  First mortgage loans may include fixed rate loans that are generally sold to investors.  We are a direct seller to the Federal National Mortgage Association (“FNMA”), Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (“FHLMC”) and to several large financial institutions.  We retain servicing rights for mortgages sold to FNMA and FHLMC.  The retention of such servicing rights is a source of noninterest income and also allows us an opportunity to have regular contact with mortgage customers and can help to solidify our community involvement.  Other loans that are not sold include adjustable rate mortgages, lot loans, and construction loans that are held in our portfolio.  Loans sold to other investors, such as Federal Housing Administration (“FHA”), and the Veterans Administration (“VA”), are sold with servicing released.  We had a moderate level of residential mortgage purchase activity in 2018; however, with interest rates rising in 2018 in our market area, our residential mortgage lending portfolio reflected a reduction in volume and mixture of both refinance and purchase financing opportunities.  
     Home Equity Lines of Credit.   Our home equity lines of credit, or HELOCs, consist of originated as well as purchased HELOCs.  We had growth in our home equity lending in 2018, due to two portfolio purchases in March 2018 and November 2018 from a third party of $20.9 million and $20.7 million, respectively.  We purchased these HELOCs at a 4.25% premium, and the average annualized yield on the total purchased HELOC portfolio in 2018 was 5.09%, net of the premium accretion.
     Consumer Loans. We also provide many types of consumer loans including primarily motor vehicle, home improvement and signature loans.  Consumer loans typically have shorter terms and lower balances with higher yields as compared to other loans but generally carry higher risks of default. Consumer loan collections are dependent on the borrower’s continuing financial stability and thus are more likely to be affected by adverse personal circumstances.
     Competition
     Our  market area is highly competitive and our business activities require us to compete with many other financial institutions.  A number of these financial institutions are affiliated with large bank holding companies headquartered outside of our principal market area as well as other institutions that are based in Aurora's surrounding communities and in Chicago, Illinois.  All of these financial institutions operate banking offices in the greater Chicago area or actively compete for customers within our market area.  We also face competition from finance companies, insurance companies, credit unions, mortgage companies, securities brokerage firms, money market funds, loan production offices and other providers of financial services, including nontraditional financial technology companies or FinTech companies.  Many of our nonbank competitors which are not subject to the same extensive federal regulations that govern bank holding companies and banks, such as the Company and the Bank, may have certain competitive advantages.
     We compete for loans principally through the quality of our client service and our responsiveness to client needs in addition to competing on interest rates and loan fees.  Management believes that our long-standing presence in the community and personal one-on-one service philosophy enhances our ability to compete favorably in attracting and retaining individual and business customers.  We

actively solicit deposit-related clients and compete for deposits by offering personal attention, competitive interest rates, and professional services made available through experienced bankers and multiple delivery channels that fit the needs of our market. In wealth management and trust services, we compete with a variety of custodial banks as well as a diverse group of investment managers.
     We believe the financial services industry will likely continue to become more competitive as further technological advances enable more financial institutions to provide expanded financial services without having a physical presence in our market.
     Employees
     At December 31, 2018, the Company employed 518 full-time equivalent employees.

SUPERVISION AND REGULATION
 General
 FDIC-insured institutions, their holding companies and their affiliates, are extensively regulated under federal and state law.  As a result, our  growth and earnings performance may be affected not only by management decisions and general economic conditions, but also by the requirements of federal and state statutes and by the regulations and policies of various bank regulatory agencies, including the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the “OCC”), the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve”), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the “FDIC”) and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the “CFPB”).  Furthermore, taxation laws administered by the Internal Revenue Service and state taxing authorities, accounting rules developed by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, securities laws administered by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and state securities authorities, and anti-money laundering laws enforced by the U.S. Department of the Treasury (“Treasury”) have an impact on our business.  The effect of these statutes, regulations, regulatory policies and accounting rules are significant to our operations and results.
 Federal and state banking laws impose a comprehensive system of supervision, regulation and enforcement on the operations of FDIC-insured institutions, their holding companies and affiliates that is intended primarily for the protection of the FDIC-insured deposits and depositors of banks, rather than stockholders.  These laws, and the regulations of the bank regulatory agencies issued under them, affect, among other things, the scope of our business, the kinds and amounts of investments we may make, reserve requirements, required capital levels relative to assets, the nature and amount of collateral for loans, the establishment of branches, our ability to merge, consolidate and acquire, dealings with our insiders and affiliates and the Company’s payment of dividends. In the last several years, we have experienced heightened regulatory requirements and scrutiny following the global financial crisis approximately 8 years ago, and as a result of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”).  Although the reforms primarily targeted systemically important financial service providers, their influence filtered down in varying degrees to community banks over time, and the reforms have caused our compliance and risk management processes, and the costs thereof, to increase.  
 This supervisory and regulatory framework subjects banks and their bank holding companies to regular examination by their respective regulatory agencies, which results in examination reports and ratings that are not publicly available and that can impact the conduct and growth of their business.  These examinations consider not only compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but also capital levels, asset quality and risk, management ability and performance, earnings, liquidity, and various other factors.  The regulatory agencies generally have broad discretion to impose restrictions and limitations on the operations of a regulated entity where the agencies determine, among other things, that such operations are unsafe or unsound, fail to comply with applicable law or are otherwise inconsistent with laws and regulations or with the supervisory policies of these agencies. 
 The following is a summary of certain of the material elements of the supervisory and regulatory framework applicable to the Company and the Bank.  It does not describe all of the statutes, regulations and regulatory policies that apply, nor does it restate all of the requirements of those that are described.  The descriptions are qualified in their entirety by reference to the particular statutory and regulatory provision.

     Regulatory Emphasis on Capital
     Regulatory capital represents the net assets of a banking organization available to absorb losses. Because of the risks attendant to their business, FDIC-insured institutions are generally required to hold more capital than other businesses, which directly affects our earnings capabilities. While capital has historically been one of the key measures of the financial health of both bank holding companies and banks, its role became fundamentally more important in the wake of the global financial crisis, as the banking regulators recognized that the amount and quality of capital held by banks prior to the crisis was insufficient to absorb losses during periods of severe stress.  Certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and Basel III, discussed below, establish strengthened capital standards for banks and bank holding companies that are meaningfully more stringent than those in place previously.
 Minimum Required Capital Levels. Banks have been required to hold minimum levels of capital based on guidelines established by the bank regulatory agencies since 1983.  The minimums have been expressed in terms of ratios of capital divided by total assets.  As discussed below, bank capital measures have become more sophisticated over the years and have focused more on the quality of capital and the risk of assets.  Bank holding companies have historically had to comply with less stringent capital standards than their bank subsidiaries and have been able to raise capital with hybrid instruments such as trust preferred securities.  The Dodd-Frank Act mandated the Federal Reserve to establish minimum capital levels for holding companies on a consolidated basis as stringent as those required for FDIC-insured institutions.  A result of this change is that the proceeds of hybrid instruments, such as trust preferred securities, are being excluded from capital over a phase-out period. However, if such securities were issued prior to May 19, 2010 by bank holding companies with less than $15 billion of assets, they may be retained, subject to certain restrictions.  Because the Company has assets of less than $15 billion, the Company is able to maintain its trust preferred proceeds as capital but the Company has to comply with new capital mandates in other respects and will not be able to raise capital in the future through the issuance of trust preferred securities.
     The Basel III Rule.  In July of 2013, the U.S. federal banking agencies approved the implementation of the Basel III regulatory capital reforms in pertinent part, and, at the same time, promulgated rules effecting certain changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act (the “Basel III Rule”).  In contrast to capital requirements historically, which were in the form of guidelines, Basel III was released in the form of enforceable regulations by each of the regulatory agencies.  The Basel III Rule is applicable to all banking organizations that are subject to minimum capital requirements, including federal and state banks and savings and loan associations, as well as to bank and savings and loan holding companies, other than “small bank holding companies” generally holding companies with consolidated assets of less than $3 billion. The Company is currently considered a “small bank holding company.”  More stringent requirements are imposed on “advanced approaches” banking organizations—those organizations with $250 billion or more in total consolidated assets, $10 billion or more in total foreign exposures, or that have opted in to the Basel II capital regime.
 The OCC’s final capital rules included new risk-based capital and leverage ratios and refined the definition of what constitutes “capital” for purposes of calculating those ratios. The minimum capital-level requirements applicable to us under the final rule are: 
    
· | a new Common Equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 4.5%;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


· | a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6% (increased from the former 4% requirement);
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | a total risk-based capital ratio of 8% (unchanged from the former requirement); and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | a leverage ratio of 4% (also unchanged from the former requirement).
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------

      The final rules also established a “capital conservation buffer” above the new regulatory minimum capital requirements, which must consist entirely of Common Equity Tier 1 capital, which was phased in over several years. The phase-in of the capital conservation buffer began on January 1, 2016, at a level of 0.625% of risk-weighted assets for 2016, increased to 1.250% for 2017, and 1.875% for 2018. The fully phased-in capital conservation buffer of 2.500%, which became effective on January 1, 2019, resulted in the following effective minimum capital ratios beginning in 2019: (i) a Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 7.0%, (ii) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5%, and (iii) a total capital ratio of 10.5%. Under the final rules, institutions are subject to limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying discretionary bonuses if their capital levels fall below the buffer amount. These limitations establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that could be utilized for such actions. 
     The Basel III Rule also changed the definition of capital by establishing more stringent criteria that instruments must meet to be considered Additional Tier 1 Capital (primarily non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock that meets certain requirements) and Tier 2 Capital (primarily other types of preferred stock and subordinated debt, subject to limitations).  A number of instruments that previously qualified as Tier 1 Capital no longer qualify, or their qualifications changed.  For example, noncumulative perpetual preferred stock, which used to qualify as simple Tier 1 Capital, does not qualify as Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, but qualifies as Additional Tier 1 Capital. The Basel III Rule also constrained the inclusion of minority interests, mortgage-servicing assets, and deferred tax assets in capital and requires deductions from Common Equity Tier 1 Capital in the event that such assets exceed a certain percentage of a banking institution’s Common Equity Tier 1 Capital.  
     Well-Capitalized Requirements.  The ratios described above are minimum standards in order for banking organizations to be considered “adequately capitalized.”  Bank regulatory agencies uniformly encourage banks to hold more capital and be “well-

capitalized” and, to that end, federal law and regulations provide various incentives for banking organizations to maintain regulatory capital at levels in excess of minimum regulatory requirements.  For example, a banking organization that is well-capitalized may: (i) qualify for exemptions from prior notice or application requirements otherwise applicable to certain types of activities; (ii) qualify for expedited processing of other required notices or applications; and (iii) accept, roll-over or renew brokered deposits.  Higher capital levels could also be required if warranted by the particular circumstances or risk profiles of individual banking organizations.  For example, the Federal Reserve’s capital guidelines contemplate that additional capital may be required to take adequate account of, among other things, interest rate risk, or the risks posed by concentrations of credit, nontraditional activities or securities trading activities.  Further, any banking organization experiencing or anticipating significant growth would be expected to maintain capital ratios, including tangible capital positions (i.e., Tier 1 Capital less all intangible assets), well above the minimum levels.
 Under the capital regulations of the OCC, in order to be well‑capitalized, a banking organization must maintain:

· | A Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio to risk-weighted assets of 6.5% or more;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | A ratio of Tier 1 Capital to total risk-weighted assets of 8%; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


· | A ratio of Total Capital to total risk-weighted assets of 10%; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


· | A leverage ratio of Tier 1 Capital to total adjusted average quarterly assets of 5% or greater.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      It is possible under the Basel III Rule to be well-capitalized while remaining out of compliance with the capital conservation buffer discussed above.
 As of December 31, 2018 the Bank was well-capitalized, as defined by OCC regulations.  As of December 31, 2018, the Company had regulatory capital in excess of the Federal Reserve’s requirements and met the Basel III Rule requirements to be well-capitalized.
 Prompt Corrective Action.  An FDIC-insured institution’s capital plays an important role in connection with regulatory enforcement as well. Federal law provides the federal banking regulators with broad power to take prompt corrective action to resolve the problems of undercapitalized institutions.  The extent of the regulators’ powers depends on whether the institution in question is “adequately capitalized,” “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized” or “critically undercapitalized,” in each case as defined by regulation.  Depending upon the capital category to which an institution is assigned, the regulators’ corrective powers include: (i) requiring the institution to submit a capital restoration plan; (ii) limiting the institution’s asset growth and restricting its activities; (iii) requiring the institution to issue additional capital stock (including additional voting stock) or to sell itself; (iv) restricting transactions between the institution and its affiliates; (v) restricting the interest rate that the institution may pay on deposits; (vi) ordering a new election of directors of the institution; (vii) requiring that senior executive officers or directors be dismissed; (viii) prohibiting the institution from accepting deposits from correspondent banks; (ix) requiring the institution to divest certain subsidiaries; (x) prohibiting the payment of principal or interest on subordinated debt; and (xi) ultimately, appointing a receiver for the institution. 
 Regulation and Supervision of the Company
 General. The Company, as the sole stockholder of the Bank, is a bank holding company.  As a bank holding company, the Company is registered with, and subject to regulation, supervision and enforcement by, the Federal Reserve under the Bank Holding Company Act, as amended (the “BHCA”).  The Company is legally obligated to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to the Bank and to commit resources to support the Bank in circumstances where the Company might not otherwise do so.  Under the BHCA, the Company is subject to periodic examination by the Federal Reserve and is required to file with the Federal Reserve periodic reports of the Company's operations and such additional information regarding the Company and the Bank as the Federal Reserve may require.  
 Acquisitions, Activities and Change in Control. The primary purpose of a bank holding company is to control and manage banks. The BHCA generally requires the prior approval of the Federal Reserve for any merger involving a bank holding company or any acquisition by a bank holding company of another bank or bank holding company.  Subject to certain conditions (including deposit concentration limits established by the BHCA), the Federal Reserve may allow a bank holding company to acquire banks located in any state of the United States. In approving interstate acquisitions, the Federal Reserve is required to give effect to applicable state law limitations on the aggregate amount of deposits that may be held by the acquiring bank holding company and its FDIC-insured institution affiliates in the state in which the target bank is located (provided that those limits do not discriminate against out-of-state institutions or their holding companies) and state laws that require that the target bank have been in existence for a minimum period of time (not to exceed five years) before being acquired by an out-of-state bank holding company.  Furthermore, in accordance with the Dodd-Frank Act, bank holding companies must be well-capitalized and examiners must rate them well-managed in order to effect interstate mergers or acquisitions.  For a discussion of the capital requirements, see “Regulatory Emphasis on Capital” above.
 The BHCA generally prohibits the Company from acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares of any company that is not a bank and from engaging in any business other than that of banking, managing and controlling banks or furnishing services to banks and their subsidiaries.  This general prohibition is subject to a number of exceptions.  The principal exception allows bank holding companies to engage in, and to own shares of companies engaged in, certain businesses found by the Federal Reserve prior to November 11, 1999, to be “so closely related to banking ... as to be a proper incident thereto.”  This authority would permit the Company to engage in a variety of banking-related businesses, including the ownership and operation of a savings association, or any entity engaged in consumer finance, equipment leasing, the operation of a computer service bureau (including software development) and mortgage banking and brokerage services.  The BHCA does not place territorial restrictions on the domestic activities of nonbank subsidiaries of bank holding companies.

 Additionally, bank holding companies that meet certain eligibility requirements prescribed by the BHCA and elect to operate as financial holding companies may engage in, or own shares in companies engaged in, a wider range of nonbanking activities, including securities and insurance underwriting and sales, merchant banking and any other activity that the Federal Reserve, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, determines by regulation or order is financial in nature or incidental to any such financial activity or that the Federal Reserve determines by order to be complementary to any such financial activity and does not pose a substantial risk to the safety or soundness of FDIC-insured institutions or the financial system generally.  The Company has not elected to operate as a financial holding company.  
 The BHCA prohibits a company from, directly or indirectly, acquiring 25% or more (5% if the acquirer is a bank holding company) of any class of our voting stock or obtaining the ability to control in any manner the election of a majority of our directors or otherwise directing the management or policies of the Bank without prior application to and the approval of the Federal Reserve. Moreover, under the Change in Bank Control Act, any person or group of persons acting in concert who intends to acquire 10% or more of any class of our voting stock or otherwise obtain control over us would be required to provide prior notice to and obtain the non-objection of the OCC.
 Capital Requirements. Bank holding companies are required to maintain capital in accordance with Federal Reserve capital adequacy requirements.  For a discussion of capital requirements, see “Regulatory Emphasis on Capital” above.
 Dividend Payments. The Company’s ability to pay dividends to its stockholders may be affected by both general corporate law considerations and policies of the Federal Reserve applicable to bank holding companies. As a Delaware corporation, the Company is subject to the limitations of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the “DGCL”).  The DGCL allows the Company to pay dividends only out of its surplus (as defined and computed in accordance with the provisions of the DGCL) or if the Company has no such surplus, out of its net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared and/or the preceding fiscal year.  
 As a general matter, the Federal Reserve has indicated that the board of directors of a bank holding company should eliminate, defer or significantly reduce dividends to stockholders if: (i) the company's net income available to stockholders for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid during that period, is not sufficient to fully fund the dividends; (ii) the prospective rate of earnings retention is inconsistent with the company's capital needs and overall current and prospective financial condition; or (iii) the company will not meet, or is in danger of not meeting, its minimum regulatory capital adequacy ratios.  The Federal Reserve also possesses enforcement powers over bank holding companies and their non-bank subsidiaries to prevent or remedy actions that represent unsafe or unsound practices or violations of applicable statutes and regulations. Among these powers is the ability to proscribe the payment of dividends by banks and bank holding companies.  In addition, under the Basel III Rule, financial institutions that seek to pay dividends will have to maintain 2.5% in Common Equity Tier 1 Capital attributable to the capital conservation buffer.  See “Regulatory Emphasis on Capital – Capital and Related Requirements” above.
 Incentive Compensation. There have been a number of developments in recent years focused on incentive compensation plans sponsored by bank holding companies and banks, reflecting recognition by the bank regulatory agencies and Congress that flawed incentive compensation practices in the financial industry were one of many factors contributing to the global financial crisis. Layered on top of that are the abuses in the headlines dealing with product cross-selling incentive plans. The result is interagency guidance on sound incentive compensation practices and proposed rulemaking by the agencies required under Section 956 of the Dodd-Frank Act. 
 The interagency guidance recognized three core principles; effective incentive plans are required to: (i) provide employees incentives that appropriately balance risk and reward; (ii) be compatible with effective controls and risk-management; and (iii) be supported by strong corporate governance, including active and effective oversight by the organization’s board of directors. Much of the guidance addresses large banking organizations and, because of the size and complexity of their operations, the regulators expect those organizations to maintain systematic and formalized policies, procedures, and systems for ensuring that the incentive compensation arrangements for all executive and non-executive employees covered by this guidance are identified and reviewed, and appropriately balance risks and rewards.  Smaller banking organizations like the Company that use incentive compensation arrangements are expected to be less extensive, formalized, and detailed than those of the larger banks.  
 Section 956 of the Dodd-Frank Act required the banking agencies, the National Credit Union Administration, the SEC and the Federal Housing Finance Agency to jointly prescribe regulations that prohibit types of incentive-based compensation that encourage inappropriate risk taking and to disclose certain information regarding such plans.  On June 10, 2016, the agencies released an updated proposed rule for comment. Section 956 will only apply to banking organizations with assets of greater than $1 billion.  The Company has consolidated assets greater than $1 billion and less than $50 billion and the Company is considered a Level 3 banking organization under the proposed rules.  The proposed rules contain mostly general principles and reporting requirements for Level 3 institutions so there are no specific prescriptions or limits, deferral requirements or claw-back mandates. Risk management and controls are required, as is board or committee level approval and oversight.  No final rule has been issued yet.
 Monetary Policy.  The monetary policy of the Federal Reserve has a significant effect on the operating results of financial or bank holding companies and their subsidiaries.  Among the tools available to the Federal Reserve to affect the money supply are open market transactions in U.S. government securities, changes in the discount rate on bank borrowings and changes in reserve requirements against bank deposits.  These means are used in varying combinations to influence overall growth and distribution of bank loans, investments and deposits, and their use may affect interest rates charged on loans or paid on deposits.

 Federal Securities Regulation. The Company’s common stock is registered with the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).  Consequently, the Company is subject to the information, proxy solicitation, insider trading and other restrictions and requirements of the SEC under the Exchange Act.
 Corporate Governance. The Dodd-Frank Act addressed many investor protection, corporate governance and executive compensation matters that affect most U.S. publicly traded companies.  The Dodd-Frank Act (i) grants stockholders of U.S. publicly traded companies an advisory vote on executive compensation and so-called “golden parachute” payments, (ii) enhances independence requirements for compensation committee members, (iii) requires the SEC to adopt rules directing national securities exchanges to establish listing standards requiring all listed companies to adopt incentive-based compensation clawback policies for executive officers, and (iv) provides the SEC with authority to adopt proxy access rules that would allow stockholders of publicly traded companies to nominate candidates for election as a director and have those nominees included in a company’s proxy materials.  The SEC has completed the bulk (although not all) of the rulemaking necessary to implement these provisions.
 Regulation and Supervision of the Bank
 General. The Bank is a national bank, chartered by the OCC under the National Bank Act.  The deposit accounts of the Bank are insured by the FDIC’s Deposit Insurance Fund (the “DIF”) to the maximum extent provided under federal law and FDIC regulations, currently $250,000 per insured depositor category, and the Bank is a member of the Federal Reserve System.  As a national bank, the Bank is subject to the examination, supervision, reporting and enforcement requirements of the OCC, the chartering authority for national banks.  The FDIC, as administrator of the DIF, also has regulatory authority over the Bank.
 Deposit Insurance. As an FDIC-insured institution, the Bank is required to pay deposit insurance premium assessments to the FDIC.  Effective July 1, 2016, the FDIC changed its pricing system for banks under $10 billion, so that minimum and maximum initial base assessment rates are based on supervisory ratings.  The initial base assessment rates currently range from three basis points to 30 basis points.  At least semi-annually, the FDIC updates its loss and income projections for the DIF and, if needed, increases or decreases the assessment rates, following notice and comment on proposed rulemaking.
 The assessment base against which an FDIC-insured institution’s deposit insurance premiums paid to the DIF are calculated based on its average consolidated total assets less its average tangible equity.  This method shifts the burden of deposit insurance premiums toward those large depository institutions that rely on funding sources other than U.S. deposits.  
 The reserve ratio is the DIF balance divided by estimated insured deposits.  The Dodd-Frank Act altered the minimum reserve ratio of the DIF, increasing the minimum from 1.15% to 1.35% of the estimated amount of total insured deposits, and eliminating the requirement that the FDIC pay dividends to FDIC-insured institutions when the reserve ratio exceeds certain thresholds.  The reserve ratio reached 1.36% on September 30, 2018.  Because the reserve ratio has reached 1.35%, two deposit insurance assessment changes occurred under FDIC regulations:  (1) surcharges on insured depository institutions with total consolidated assets of $10 billion or more (large institutions) will cease; and (2) banks with assets of less than $10 billion, such as us, will receive assessment credits for the portion of their assessments that contributed to the growth in the reserve ratio from between 1.15% and 1.35%, to be applied when the reserve ratio is at or above 1.38%, with credits starting with the March 31, 2019 assessment invoiced in June 2019.
 FICO Assessments. In addition to paying basic deposit insurance assessments, the FDIC collects Financing Corporation (“FICO”) assessments to pay interest on FICO bonds.  FICO bonds were issued in the late 1980’s to recapitalize the (former) Federal Savings & Loan Insurance Corporation.  The last of the remaining FICO bonds will mature in September 2019.  The FICO assessment rate is adjusted quarterly and for the fourth quarter of 2018 was 0.35 basis points (35 cents per $100 dollars of assessable deposits).  We were informed by the FDIC that our final FICO assessments will be collected on March 31, 2019.
 Supervisory Assessments. National banks are required to pay supervisory assessments to the OCC to fund the operations of the OCC.  The amount of the assessment is calculated using a formula that takes into account the bank’s size and its supervisory condition. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Bank paid supervisory assessments to the OCC totaling $504,000.
 Capital Requirements. Banks are generally required to maintain capital levels in excess of other businesses.  For a discussion of capital requirements, see “Regulatory Emphasis on Capital” above.
 Liquidity Requirements. Liquidity is a measure of the ability and ease with which bank assets may be converted to cash.  Liquid assets are those that can be converted to cash quickly if needed to meet financial obligations.  To remain viable, FDIC-insured institutions must have enough liquid assets to meet their near-term obligations, such as withdrawals by depositors. Because the global financial crisis was in part a liquidity crisis, Basel III also includes a liquidity framework that requires FDIC-insured institutions to measure their liquidity against specific liquidity tests.  One test, referred to as the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (“LCR”), is designed to ensure that the banking entity has an adequate stock of unencumbered high-quality liquid assets that can be converted easily and immediately in private markets into cash to meet liquidity needs for a 30-calendar day liquidity stress scenario.  The other test, known as the Net Stable Funding Ratio (“NSFR”) is designed to promote more medium and long-term funding of the assets and activities of FDIC-insured institutions over a one-year horizon.  These tests provide an incentive for banks and holding companies to increase their holdings in Treasury securities and other sovereign debt as a component of assets, increase the use of long-term debt as a funding source and rely on stable funding like core deposits (in lieu of brokered deposits). 
 In addition to liquidity guidelines already in place, the federal bank regulatory agencies implemented the Basel III LCR in 2014 and have proposed the NSFR.  While the LCR only applies to the largest banking organizations in the country, as will the NSFR, certain elements are expected to filter down to all FDIC-insured institutions. The Company has adopted a modified version of the LCR as a

part of measuring the liquidity at the Bank.  The Company has no plans to adopt the NSFR and has not received regulatory guidance indicating a requirement to do so.
 Dividend Payments. The primary source of funds for the Company is dividends from the Bank. Under the National Bank Act, a national bank may pay dividends out of its undivided profits in such amounts and at such times as the bank’s board of directors deems prudent.  Without prior OCC approval, however, a national bank may not pay dividends in any calendar year that, in the aggregate, exceed the bank’s year-to-date net income plus the bank’s retained net income for the two preceding years. The payment of dividends by any FDIC-insured institution is affected by the requirement to maintain adequate capital pursuant to applicable capital adequacy guidelines and regulations, and an FDIC-insured institution generally is prohibited from paying any dividends if, following payment thereof, the institution would be undercapitalized.  As described above, the Bank exceeded its capital requirements under applicable guidelines as of December 31, 2018.  Notwithstanding the availability of funds for dividends, however, the OCC may prohibit the payment of dividends by the Bank if it determines such payment would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice.  In addition, under the Basel III Rule, institutions that seek the freedom to pay dividends will have to maintain 2.5% in Common Equity Tier 1 Capital attributable to the capital conservation buffer.  See “Regulatory Emphasis on Capital” above.
 Insider Transactions. The Bank is subject to certain restrictions imposed by federal law on “covered transactions” between the Bank and its “affiliates.”  The Company is an affiliate of the Bank for purposes of these restrictions, and covered transactions subject to the restrictions include extensions of credit to the Company, investments in the stock or other securities of the Company and the acceptance of the stock or other securities of the Company as collateral for loans made by the Bank.  The Dodd-Frank Act enhanced the requirements for certain transactions with affiliates, including an expansion of the definition of “covered transactions” and an increase in the amount of time for which collateral requirements regarding covered transactions must be maintained.
 Certain limitations and reporting requirements are also placed on extensions of credit by the Bank to its directors and officers, to directors and officers of the Company and its subsidiaries, to principal stockholders of the Company and to “related interests” of such directors, officers and principal stockholders.  In addition, federal law and regulations may affect the terms upon which any person who is a director or officer of the Company or the Bank, or a principal stockholder of the Company, may obtain credit from banks with which the Bank maintains a correspondent relationship.  
 Safety and Soundness Standards/Risk Management. The federal banking agencies have adopted guidelines that establish operational and managerial standards to promote the safety and soundness of FDIC-insured institutions.  The guidelines set forth standards for internal controls, information systems, internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth, compensation, fees and benefits, asset quality and earnings.
 In general, the safety and soundness guidelines prescribe the goals to be achieved in each area, and each institution is responsible for establishing its own procedures to achieve those goals.  If an institution fails to comply with any of the standards set forth in the guidelines, the FDIC-insured institution’s primary federal regulator may require the institution to submit a plan for achieving and maintaining compliance.  If an FDIC-insured institution fails to submit an acceptable compliance plan, or fails in any material respect to implement a compliance plan that has been accepted by its primary federal regulator, the regulator is required to issue an order directing the institution to cure the deficiency.  Until the deficiency cited in the regulator’s order is cured, the regulator may restrict the FDIC-insured institution’s rate of growth, require the FDIC-insured institution to increase its capital, restrict the rates the institution pays on deposits or require the institution to take any action the regulator deems appropriate under the circumstances.  Noncompliance with the standards established by the safety and soundness guidelines may also constitute grounds for other enforcement action by the federal bank regulatory agencies, including cease and desist orders and civil money penalty assessments.
 During the past decade, the bank regulatory agencies have increasingly emphasized the importance of sound risk management processes and strong internal controls when evaluating the activities of the FDIC-insured institutions they supervise.  Properly managing risks has been identified as critical to the conduct of safe and sound banking activities and has become even more important as new technologies, product innovation, and the size and speed of financial transactions have changed the nature of banking markets.  The agencies have identified a spectrum of risks facing a banking institution including, but not limited to, credit, market, liquidity, operational, legal and reputational risk.  In particular, recent regulatory pronouncements have focused on operational risk, which arises from the potential that inadequate information systems, operational problems, breaches in internal controls, fraud, or unforeseen catastrophes will result in unexpected losses.  New products and services, third-party risk and cybersecurity are critical sources of operational risk that FDIC-insured institutions are expected to address in the current environment.  The Bank is expected to have active board and senior management oversight; adequate policies, procedures, and limits; adequate risk measurement, monitoring, and management information systems; and comprehensive internal controls.
 Branching Authority.  National banks headquartered in Illinois, such as the Bank, have the same branching rights in Illinois as banks chartered under Illinois law, subject to OCC approval.  Illinois law grants Illinois-chartered banks the authority to establish branches anywhere in the State of Illinois, subject to receipt of all required regulatory approvals.
 The Dodd-Frank Act permits well-capitalized and well-managed banks to establish new interstate branches or acquire individual branches of a bank in another state (rather than the acquisition of an out-of-state bank in its entirety) without impediments.
 Financial Subsidiaries. Under federal law and OCC regulations, national banks are authorized to engage, through “financial subsidiaries,” in any activity that is permissible for a financial holding company and any activity that the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Federal Reserve, determines is financial in nature or incidental to any such financial activity, except (i) insurance underwriting, (ii) real estate development or real estate investment activities (unless otherwise permitted by law), (iii) insurance company

portfolio investments and (iv) merchant banking.  The authority of a national bank to invest in a financial subsidiary is subject to a number of conditions, including, among other things, requirements that the bank must be well-managed and well-capitalized (after deducting from capital the bank’s outstanding investments in financial subsidiaries).  The Bank has not applied for approval to establish any financial subsidiaries.
 Federal Home Loan Bank System. The Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago (the “FHLBC”), which serves as a central credit facility for its members.  The FHLBC is funded primarily from proceeds from the sale of obligations of the FHLBC system.  It makes loans to member banks in the form of FHLBC advances.  All advances from the FHLBC are required to be fully collateralized as determined by the FHLBC.
 Transaction Account Reserves. Federal Reserve regulations require FDIC-insured institutions to maintain reserves against their transaction accounts (primarily NOW and regular checking accounts).  For 2018, the first $16.0 million of otherwise reservable balances are exempt from reserves and have a zero percent reserve requirement; for transaction accounts aggregating more than $16.0 million to $122.3 million, the reserve requirement is 3% of total transaction accounts; and for net transaction accounts in excess of $122.3 million, the reserve requirement is 3% up to $122.3 million plus 10% of the aggregate amount of total transaction accounts in excess of $122.3 million.  These reserve requirements are subject to annual adjustment by the Federal Reserve.
 Community Reinvestment Act Requirements. The Community Reinvestment Act requires the Bank to have a continuing and affirmative obligation in a safe and sound manner to help meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods.  Federal regulators regularly assess the Bank’s record of meeting the credit needs of its communities. Applications for additional acquisitions would be affected by the evaluation of the Bank’s effectiveness in meeting its Community Reinvestment Act requirements.  The Bank received an overall “outstanding” rating on its most recent CRA performance evaluation.
 Anti-Money Laundering. The Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (the “Patriot Act”) is designed to deny terrorists and criminals the ability to obtain access to the U.S. financial system and has significant implications for FDIC-insured institutions, brokers, dealers and other businesses involved in the transfer of money.  The Patriot Act mandates financial services companies to have policies and procedures with respect to measures designed to address any or all of the following matters: (i) customer identification programs; (ii) money laundering; (iii) terrorist financing; (iv) identifying and reporting suspicious activities and currency transactions; (v) currency crimes; and (vi) cooperation between FDIC-insured institutions and law enforcement authorities. Bank regulators routinely examine institutions for compliance with these obligations, and this area has become a particular focus of the regulators in recent years. In addition, the regulators are required to consider compliance in connection with the regulatory review of certain applications. In recent years, regulators have expressed concern over banking institutions’ compliance with anti-money laundering requirements and, in some cases, have delayed approval of their expansionary proposals. The regulators and other governmental authorities have been active in imposing “cease and desist” orders and significant money penalty sanctions against institutions found to be in violation of the anti-money laundering regulations.
     Concentrations in Commercial Real Estate. Concentration risk exists when FDIC-insured institutions deploy too many assets to any one industry or segment.  A concentration in commercial real estate is one example of regulatory concern.  The interagency Concentrations in Commercial Real Estate Lending, Sound Risk Management Practices guidance (“CRE Guidance”) provides supervisory criteria, including the following numerical indicators, to assist bank examiners in identifying banks with potentially significant commercial real estate loan concentrations that may warrant greater supervisory scrutiny: (i) non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans exceeding 300% of capital and increasing 50% or more in the preceding three years; or (ii) construction and land development loans exceeding 100% of capital.  The CRE Guidance does not limit banks’ levels of commercial real estate lending activities, but rather guides institutions in developing risk management practices and levels of capital that are commensurate with the level and nature of their commercial real estate concentrations.  On December 18, 2015, the federal banking agencies issued a statement to reinforce prudent risk-management practices related to CRE lending, having observed substantial growth in many CRE asset and lending markets, increased competitive pressures, rising CRE concentrations in banks, and an easing of CRE underwriting standards.  The federal bank agencies reminded FDIC-insured institutions to maintain underwriting discipline and exercise prudent risk-management practices to identify, measure, monitor, and manage the risks arising from CRE lending.  In addition, FDIC-insured institutions must maintain capital commensurate with the level and nature of their CRE concentration risk.
 Based on the Bank’s loan portfolio as of December 31, 2018, concentrations in commercial real estate did not exceed the 300% guideline for non-owner occupied commercial real estate loans, or the 100% guideline for construction and development loans.
 Financial Privacy and Cybersecurity.  Under privacy protection provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 and related regulations, we are limited in our ability to disclose non-public information about consumers to nonaffiliated third parties.  These limitations require disclosure of privacy policies to consumers and, in some circumstances, allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to a nonaffiliated third party.  Federal banking agencies have adopted guidelines for establishing information security standards and cybersecurity programs for implementing safeguards under the supervision of the board of directors.  These guidelines, along with related regulatory materials, increasingly focus on risk management and processes related to information technology and the use of third parties in the provision of financial services. 
     Consumer Protection Regulations.  The activities of the Bank are subject to a variety of statutes and regulations designed to protect consumers.  Interest and other charges collected or contracted for by the Bank are subject to state usury laws and federal laws concerning interest rates. The loan operations of the Bank are also subject to federal laws applicable to credit transactions, such as:

 The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the “CFPB”) is an independent regulatory authority housed within the Federal Reserve. The CFPB has broad authority to regulate the offering and provision of consumer financial products.  The CFPB has the authority to supervise and examine depository institutions with more than $10 billion in assets for compliance with federal consumer laws. The authority to supervise and examine depository institutions with $10 billion or less in assets, such as the Bank, for compliance with federal consumer laws remains largely with those institutions’ primary regulators.  However, the CFPB may participate in examinations of these smaller institutions on a “sampling basis” and may refer potential enforcement actions against such institutions to their primary regulators.  As such, the CFPB may participate in examinations of the Bank.  
     The CFPB has issued a number of significant rules that impact nearly every aspect of the lifecycle of a residential mortgage loan. These rules implement Dodd-Frank Act amendments to the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, TILA and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (“RESPA”).  Among other things, the rules adopted by the CFPB require banks to: (i) develop and implement procedures to ensure compliance with a “reasonable ability-to-repay” test; (ii) implement new or revised disclosures, policies and procedures for originating and servicing mortgages, including, but not limited to, pre-loan counseling, early intervention with delinquent borrowers and specific loss mitigation procedures for loans secured by a borrower’s principal residence, and mortgage origination disclosures, which integrate existing requirements under TILA and RESPA; (iii) comply with additional restrictions on mortgage loan originator hiring and compensation; and (iv) comply with new disclosure requirements and standards for appraisals and certain financial products.  
     Bank regulators take into account compliance with consumer protection laws when considering approval of any proposed expansionary proposals.

          1  Interest income from loans is shown on a tax equivalent basis, which is a non-GAAP financial measure as discussed below, and includes fees of $1.1 million, $2.4 million and $2.5 million for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.  Nonaccrual loans are included in the above stated average balances.
     For purposes of discussion, net interest income and net interest income to interest earning assets have been adjusted to a non-GAAP tax equivalent (“TE”) basis using a marginal rate of 21% for 2018 and 35% for 2017 and 2016 to more appropriately compare returns on tax-exempt loans and securities to other earning assets.  The table below provides a reconciliation of each non-GAAP TE measure to the GAAP equivalent:

Net interest income to total interest earning assets (TE) | | 3.96 | % | | 3.70 | % | | 3.31 | %

          The following table allocates the changes in net interest income to changes in either average balances or average rates for interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities.  Interest income is measured on a tax-equivalent basis using a 21% marginal rate for 2018 and a 35% marginal rate for 2017 and 2016.  Interest income not yet received on nonaccrual loans is reversed upon transfer to nonaccrual status; future receipt of interest income is a reduction to principal while in nonaccrual status.

      1  The changes in net interest income are created by changes in both interest rates and volumes.  In the table above, volume variances are computed using the change in volume multiplied by previous year’s rate. Rate variances are computed using the change in rate multiplied by the previous year’s volume.  The change in interest due to both rate and volume has been allocated between factors in proportion to the relationship of absolute dollar amounts of the change in each.

          Some of our holdings of U.S. government agency mortgage-backed securities (“MBS”) and collateralized mortgage obligations (“CMOs”) are issuances of government-sponsored enterprises, such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which are not backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government.  Some holdings of MBS and CMOs are issued by Ginnie Mae, which does carry the full faith and credit of the U.S. government.  We also hold some MBS and CMOs that were not issued by U.S. government agencies and are typically credit-enhanced via over-collateralization and/or subordination.  Holdings of asset-backed securities (“ABS”) were largely comprised of securities backed by student loans issued under the U.S. Department of Education’s (“DOE”) FFEL program, which generally provides a minimum 97% U.S. DOE guarantee of principal.  These ABS securities also have added credit enhancement through over-collateralization and/or subordination.  The majority of holdings issued by states and political subdivisions are general obligation or revenue bonds that have S&P or Moody’s ratings of AA- or higher.  Other state and political subdivision issuances are unrated and generally consist of smaller investment amounts that involve issuers in our markets.  The credit quality of these issuers is monitored and none have been identified as posing a material risk of loss.  We also hold collateralized loan obligation (“CLOs”) securities that are generally backed by a pool of debt issued by multiple middle-sized and large businesses.  The Company’s CLO S&P or Moody’s ratings distribution consists of 58% rated A, 26% rated AA and 14% rated AAA.  CLO credit enhancement is achieved through over-collateralization and/or subordination.
     Securities Portfolio Maturity and Yields
     The following table presents the expected maturities or call dates and weighted average yield (nontax equivalent) of securities by major category as of December 31, 2018.  Securities not due at a single maturity date are shown only in the total column.

          As of December 31, 2018, net unrealized losses on available-for-sale securities totaled $5.6 million, which offset by deferred income taxes resulted in an overall decrease to equity capital of $4.0 million.  As of December 31, 2017, net unrealized gains on available-for-sale securities totaled $3.8 million, which offset by deferred income taxes resulted in an overall increase to equity capital of $2.2 million.

 Risk Elements
     The following table sets forth the amounts of nonperforming assets at December 31 for the years indicated:
    
 | 2018 | | 2017 | | 2016 | | 2015 | | 2014 | 
Nonaccrual loans | $ | 13,741 | | $ | 14,388 | | $ | 15,283 | | $ | 14,389 | | $ | 26,926 |

Total nonperforming assets | $ | 23,516 | | $ | 23,995 | | $ | 27,917 | | $ | 33,760 | | $ | 59,062 | 
PCI loans, net of purchase accounting adjustments | $ | 10,965 | | $ | - | | $ | - | | $ | - | | $ | - | 
Other real estate owned ("OREO") as % of nonperforming assets, excluding PCI loans | | 30.5 | % | | 34.9 | % | | 42.7 | % | | 56.7 | % | | 54.1 | %

      We do not consider our purchased credit impaired (“PCI”) loans, which showed evidence of deteriorated credit quality at acquisition, to be nonperforming assets as long as their cash flows and the timing of such cash flows continue to be estimable and probable of collection.  Therefore, interest income is recognized through accretion of the difference between the carrying value of these loans and the present value of expected future cash flows.  As a result, management has excluded PCI loans from the nonperforming assets in the table above.  Accrual of interest is discontinued on a loan when principal or interest is 90 days or more past due, unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection.  When a loan is placed on nonaccrual status, interest previously accrued but not collected in the current period is reversed against current period interest income.  Interest income of approximately $335,000, $47,000 and $230,000 was recorded and collected during 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, on loans that subsequently went to nonaccrual status by year-end.  Interest income, which would have been recognized during 2018, 2017 and 2016, had these loans been on an accrual basis throughout the year, was approximately $952,000, $781,000 and $918,000, respectively.  There were approximately $6.6 million and $5.7 million in restructured residential mortgage loans that were still accruing interest based upon their prior performance history at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.  Additionally, the nonaccrual loans above include $2.1 million and $2.5 million in restructured loans for the years ending December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
     Potential Problem Loans
     We utilize an internal asset classification system as a means of reporting problem and potential problem assets.  At the scheduled board of directors meetings of the Bank, loan listings are presented, which show significant loan relationships listed as “Special Mention,” “Substandard,” and “Doubtful.”  Loans classified as Substandard include those that have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt.  They are characterized by the distinct possibility that we will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected.  Assets classified as Doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent as those classified Substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions and values, highly questionable and improbable.  Assets that do not currently expose us to sufficient risk to warrant classification in one of the aforementioned categories, but possess weaknesses that deserve management’s close attention, are deemed to be Special Mention.
     Management defines potential problem loans as performing loans rated Substandard that do not meet the definition of a nonperforming loan.  These potential problem loans carry a higher probability of default and require additional attention by management.  A more detailed description of these loans can be found in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

         The provision for loan and lease losses is based upon management’s estimate of losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio and its evaluation of the adequacy of the ALLL.  Factors which influence management’s judgment in estimating loan and lease losses are the composition of the portfolio, past loss experience, loan delinquencies, nonperforming loans, national and local economic conditions, and other credit risk considerations that, in management’s judgment, deserve evaluation in estimating loan and lease losses.

 The ALLL is a valuation allowance, which increased by the provision for loan and lease losses of $1.2 million, $1.8 million and $750,000 in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, adjusted for charge-offs less recoveries.  Allocations of the allowance may be made for specific loans, but the entire allowance is available for losses inherent in the loan portfolio.  In addition, the OCC, as part of their examination process, periodically reviews the ALLL.  Regulators can require management to record adjustments to the allowance level based upon their assessment of the information available to them at the time of examination.  The OCC, in conjunction with the other federal banking agencies, has adopted an interagency policy statement on the ALLL.  The policy statement provides guidance for financial institutions on both the responsibilities of management for the assessment and establishment of adequate allowances and guidance for banking agency examiners to use in determining the adequacy of general valuation guidelines.  Generally, the policy statement recommends that (1) institutions have effective systems and controls to identify, monitor and address asset quality problems; (2) management has analyzed all significant factors that affect the collectability of the portfolio in a reasonable manner; and (3) management has established acceptable allowance evaluation processes that meet the objectives set forth in the policy statement and that the Company is in full compliance with the policy statement.  Management believes it has established an adequate estimated allowance for probable loan and lease losses.  Management reviews its process quarterly as evidenced by an extensive and detailed loan review process, makes changes as needed, and reports those results at meetings of the Company’s Board of Directors and Audit Committee.  Although management believes the ALLL is sufficient to cover probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio, there can be no assurance that the allowance will prove sufficient to cover actual loan and lease losses or that regulators, in reviewing the loan portfolio, would not request us to materially adjust our ALLL at the time of their examination.

 VII.Short-Term Borrowings
     Other short-term borrowings, which consisted of FHLBC advances and a short-term line of credit at U.S. Bank, totaled $149.5 million as of December 31, 2018, and reflected a weighted average rate of 2.50%.  Average other short-term borrowings totaled $71.0 million, and reflected a weighted average rate of 2.01%, for the year ended December 31, 2018; this average borrowing balance was 33.6% of total equity as of the year ended December 31, 2018.  The maximum amount of other short-term borrowings outstanding at any month end in 2018 was $149.5 million as of December 31, 2018.  FHLBC advances are short-term, usually overnight, and amounts borrowed are dependent upon the daily cash flow needs of the Company.  The short-term line of credit totaled $20.0 million, with $4.0 million outstanding as of December 31, 2018. This line is held for the Company’s operating needs at the holding company level, and was repaid in late January 2019.
     There were no other categories of short-term borrowings that had an average balance greater than 30% of the Company’s stockholders’ equity as of December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016.
