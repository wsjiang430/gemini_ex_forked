ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

Company Overview
 CalAmp Corp. (referred to herein as “CalAmp”, “the Company”, “we”, “our”, or “us”), incorporated in 1996,  is a telematics solutions pioneer leading transformation in a global connected economy. We help reinvent businesses and improve lives around the globe with technology solutions that streamline complex mobile Internet of Things (“IoT”) deployments through wireless connectivity solutions and derived data intelligence. Our software applications, scalable cloud services, and intelligent devices collect and assess business-critical data anywhere in the world including industrial machines, commercial and passenger vehicles, their drivers and contents. We call this The New How, powering autonomous IoT interaction, facilitating efficient decision making, optimizing resource utilization, and improving road safety.

 Since our inception, we have sold over 20 million telematics devices and related products, and have built an industry-leading brand in the global connected vehicle and industrial Internet of Machines marketplace. Our products, software and services are sold into a broad array of market verticals including automotive, insurance, transportation and logistics, government, construction, and utilities to customers in the United States, Latin America, Western Europe, Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa. Our brands and technological leadership have driven the adoption of our connectivity solutions with small to mid-size customers as well as large global enterprises such as Caterpillar, AT&T, Verizon, TransUnion, Trimble, and Omnitracs. With our global network of LoJack licensees and a strong ecosystem of industry partnerships, we bring intelligence to the edge in the mobile connected economy to help drive business efficiencies. CalAmp is headquartered in Irvine, California, and is growing rapidly with recent expansion in international markets spawned by our telematics technology. 
 Recent Acquisitions 
 
In February 2019, CalAmp acquired Tracker Network (UK) Limited (“TRACKER”), a LoJack licensee and market leader in stolen vehicle recovery (“SVR”) and telematics services across the United Kingdom. This acquisition builds on our March 2016 acquisition of the LoJack® Corporation, establishing a strong position for CalAmp to drive the broad adoption of connected vehicle and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) applications and solutions with customers worldwide. We believe TRACKER will be strategically aligned with LoJack Italia and help drive CalAmp’s European expansion by leveraging the Company’s complete, vertically integrated portfolio of telematics devices, and cloud and software services to develop advanced connected car solutions targeting auto dealers, OEMs, insurance providers and other enterprise customers. The acquisition brings strong brand awareness across the U.K. and extensive law enforcement relationships with an opportunity to create synergies by integrating two of Europe’s most advanced SVR and telematics solutions providers to support key enterprise customer opportunities on a pan-European basis.
 
In March 2019, we acquired Car Track, S.A. de C.V. (“Car Track”), the exclusive licensee of LoJack® technology for the Mexican market. Car Track, known under the LoJack Mexico brand will leverage CalAmp’s full stack of telematics and SaaS solutions to expand product offerings to its substantial subscriber base of consumers, auto dealers and original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”), insurance providers and leasing companies throughout Mexico. This acquisition provides us with a profitable business and world-class brand with strong channels, consumer awareness and law enforcement relationships in major cities across Mexico.
 
In April 2019, we acquired Synovia Solutions (“Synovia”), a North American market leader in fleet safety and management for K-12 school bus and state and local government fleets. Combined with the recent acquisitions of TRACKER and Car Track, the Synovia acquisition expands our fleet management and vehicle safety services portfolio. This acquisition also accelerates our transformation to high-value subscription-based services.

Our technology platform combines customized programmable telematics devices and the CTC platform with a broad portfolio of SaaS applications and other subscription services such as CrashBoxx. These high-value solutions are delivered to our global customers through CalAmp iOnTM, a tightly integrated cloud-based platform that enables seamless management of a diverse set of assets, from service vehicles to high-value equipment. Targeted vertical markets for these solutions include automotive, fleet and asset management, transportation and logistics, construction, utilities and government. In February 2019, we began offering fully integrated vehicle telematics with asset management, which allows enterprise fleet, construction, government and rental companies to better track their mobile workforce and high-value assets in a fully integrated fashion through the CalAmp iOn platform. 
 

One feature of the CalAmp SC iOn CommandTM platform provides customers in the pharmaceutical, healthcare, biotech, food and consumer goods industries with supply chain visibility and environmental condition monitoring as goods travel from manufacturing through distribution and on to the end consumer. Another feature, our iOn TagTM smart sensors, delivers granular visibility into product temperature, humidity, light, shock and movement at the package and pallet-level as shipments travel through the global supply chain to prevent loss, maintain compliance with business rules and regulatory requirements, and secure brand integrity. We also deployed this technology for tracking pets being transported via air.
 
CalAmp iOn HoursTM allows long haul trucking markets to maintain compliance with the Electronic Logging Device (“ELD”) federal mandate. 
 
We have also developed telematics applications under our LoJack brand with our LoJack® SureDriveTM, connected car app for the consumer telematics segment and LoJack® LotSmartTM, a vehicle inventory lot management solution, for the automobile dealer market. 
 
Our broad range of applications combined with our CTC platform and services have enabled us to steadily grow our base of recurring revenue subscribers to over one million at fiscal year-end.

Our Growth Strategy – Capitalize on $30B Total Available Market
 

6


We intend to grow our core business and expand into new markets and geographic regions. Our business resides at the nexus of several large market opportunities including the connected vehicle ecosystem, enterprise asset tracking, and fleet management product and services markets. We believe these market opportunities constitute a total available market (“TAM”) of approximately $30 billion. In order to capitalize on this TAM, we have devised the following key elements to our growth strategy:   

• | Drive SaaS and DaaS Applications Across Market Verticals. We are relentlessly pursuing our goal to grow our software and subscription services business. To accomplish this goal, we are focused on continued product innovation coupled with providing value-added cloud-based, service enablement solutions. We believe that our existing brand presence and customer base in market verticals such as transportation, construction, government and automotive aftermarket presents a significant growth opportunity for us to drive growth in our SaaS applications. As we steadily grow our base of SaaS subscribers, we continue to migrate to a pure-play solution provider of subscription services by combining our core CTC cloud-based platform, programmable telematics devices and a broad portfolio of SaaS applications with micro services that can be delivered through applications or as discrete over the top services. Additionally, we plan to leverage our recently introduced DaaS subscription business model to enable enterprise customers to access more of our research and development investments and full portfolio of connected car software services to lower their business costs and drive new revenue streams from subscription services.

• | Expand Presence in Industrial IoT. We believe that our current distribution footprint covers a significant portion of the global industrial telematics market due to our strong relationships with large enterprises such as Caterpillar. We believe there is an opportunity for us to leverage our core competencies of working with these global enterprises and expand our presence with other industrial OEMs.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Continue Expansion into International Markets. We are leveraging our existing customer relationships, international subscribers, recent TRACKER and LoJack Mexico acquisitions and access to the network of international LoJack licensees to further expand into global markets including Latin America, Europe, Middle East, Africa and Asia Pacific. Our global expansion strategy is focused on countries with anticipated demand for our full stack of telematics devices, cloud technology, software applications and micro-services.

Manufacturing and Operations
 
While the vast majority of our products are designed in the U.S., we currently outsource a substantial portion of our manufacturing to certain contract manufacturers, which are located primarily in Hong Kong, mainland China, Malaysia and other Pacific Rim countries. Our electronic devices, components and made-to-order assemblies used in our products can be obtained from these manufacturers, although certain components are obtained from sole source suppliers. Although we do not have any long-term purchase contracts, we have executed product supply agreements with these manufacturers, which provide for certain product quality requirements. We are not vertically integrated, 
 7


which provides us with flexibility and an ability to adapt to changes in the market, product supply and pricing while keeping our fixed costs low. Our relationships with our manufacturers are critical to new product introduction and the success of our business. We have strong relationships with our manufacturers, helping us meet our supply and support requirements. As we announced in the first quarter of our fiscal year 2019, we commenced a plan to streamline over global operations including further outsourcing of our manufacturing functions to increase supplier diversification and reduce operating expenses. This plan is in process at this time.
 
We focus on driving alignment of our product roadmaps with our manufacturers and determining what we can do collectively to reduce costs across the supply chain. Our operations team based in the U.S. coordinates with our manufacturers’ engineers and quality control personnel to develop the requisite manufacturing processes, quality checks and testing as well as general oversight of the manufacturing activities. We believe this model has allowed us to effectively deliver high quality and innovative products while enabling us to minimize costs, manage inventory risk and maintain flexibility. 
 
We are certified to the ISO (International Organization for Standardization) 9001: 2008 Quality management systems standard.
 Research and Development
 We compete in markets characterized by industry disruption, rapid technological change, evolving industry standards and new product features. We believe that our future success depends upon our ability to continue to develop innovative new products and solutions as well as enhancements to our existing products and solutions with advanced functionality and ease of use to drive customer demand and to further enhance our global brand and drive recurring revenue. We will continue to focus our research and development resources primarily on developing telematics products, services and software solutions for fleet management, heavy equipment, stolen vehicle recovery, consumer aftermarket telematics, trailer & asset tracking, transportation & logistics, and industrial monitoring & controls applications. We have developed technology platforms that can be leveraged across many of our vertical markets, applications and geographic regions. These include cloud-based telematics application enablement platforms and end-user software applications, cellular and satellite communications network-based asset tracking units, as well as 3G and 4G LTE broadband router products primarily for mobile applications. In addition, our development resources have been allocated to rationalizing existing product lines, reducing product costs, and improving performance through product redesign efforts.
 Research and development expenses in fiscal years ended February 28, 2019, 2018 and 2017 were $27.7 million, $25.8 million and $22.0 million, respectively. During this three-year period, our research and development expenses have ranged between 6% and 8% of annual consolidated revenues.
 Sales and Marketing
 
We market and sell our products and services through our global direct sales organization, Channel Partner Program and an international network of licensees and sales representatives as well as our websites and digital presence. Our global direct sales organization is comprised of teams of field sales people, key account managers and business development managers, who work closely with product and applications specialists and other internal sales support personnel based primarily at our U.S. locations. We have organized our field sales personnel, together with internal sales and field support personnel, into teams within each business group based on their specialized knowledge and expertise relating to specific product and service areas, geographies and customer groups. These sales teams are closely aligned with their respective product management, engineering and operations organizations.  
 
We sell our products and services to large global enterprises, small to mid-size companies, channel accounts and distributors as well as industrial OEM customers. These categories of customers require very different selling approaches and support requirements, and we have organized our sales teams to address these different requirements. Additionally, certain customers often have unique technical requirements and manufacturing processes, and may request specific product configurations, feature sets and designs. Sales to large enterprise customers often involve complex program management and long sales cycles, and require close cooperation between sales, operations and engineering personnel. As such, we have developed teams of key account managers and business development managers to serve the unique requirements of these customers.

We also actively sell our products in certain markets through our LoJack subsidiaries and network of international LoJack licensees, independent sales representatives and distributors. We have entered into agreements with substantially all of our licensees and distributors. In some cases, we have granted representatives and distributors exclusive authorization to sell certain products in a specific geographic area. These agreements generally have terms of one year, which automatically renew on an annual basis, and are generally terminable by either party for convenience following a specified notice period.  
 We expect that our reputation for providing innovative and high-quality products will continue to play a significant role in our growth and success, and that high customer satisfaction will continue to fuel referrals of our brand to new customers. Through our trademarked name – CalAmp – we have built a highly recognizable brand in the global enterprise asset tracking and fleet management market verticals. Also, in connection with the acquisition of LoJack, we acquired a highly recognizable consumer-facing brand in the global connected vehicle market. 
 In fiscal 2018, we embarked on an extensive brand refresh of the CalAmp and LoJack tradenames, which included a repositioning of both brands as well as a comprehensive communication and media outreach campaign. We believe this investment is focused on enhancing our brand awareness, continuing to build brand equity and driving market demand for our products. We also redesigned our websites and digital presence by launching a new corporate and investor relations website for CalAmp and a consumer-facing website for LoJack in order to drive consumer traffic and engagement with our new products and services.  
 We will continue our investment in sales and marketing programs that further build brand awareness, drive deeper customer engagement and foster long-term relationships with our customers. Our marketing programs are now focused on supporting multi-channel product launches in new geographic markets including launching our LoJack Beyond campaign into the dealer channels nationwide. The LoJack Beyond campaign was launched in March 2018 in an effort to modernize the dealer-consumer engagement platform beyond legacy SVR-only products and to digitize the LoJack sales experience – both of which are expected to increase and track customer engagement and return on investment. Driving additional sales through our TRACKER and LoJack Mexico subsidiaries will be a primary focus throughout the fiscal year 2020.
 Additionally, we are focused on maximizing our efficiency and reach of our marketing spend by investing in public relations, social media and digital marketing programs. These programs are developed to educate our potential customers and other industry influencers to fuel active engagement with our products and services. Our activities around public relations, thought leadership, social media and digital marketing will be aligned with our customary product launches, media campaigns and presence at tradeshows and high exposure venues such as Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain, Mobile World Congress Americas in Los Angeles among other high-profile industry events.  
 Our revenues derived from customers in the U.S. represented 73.8%, 72.6% and 74.0% of consolidated revenues in fiscal years ended February 28, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
 Competition
 Our markets are highly competitive. We face competition from small to large competitors some of which have greater financial, distribution, marketing and other resources as well as greater economies of scale than we do. We believe the principal competitive factors impacting the market for our products and services are global scale, innovation, reputation, customer service, product quality, functionality and reliability, time-to-market, responsiveness and price. We believe that we compete favorably in all of these areas. Our continued success in our vertical markets will depend in part upon our ability to continue to innovate, design quality products and deploy solutions at competitive prices and with superior support services to our customers.
 Some of the more established competitors for telematics systems and related connected products include Danlaw, Mobile Devices, Orbcomm, Quake Global, Queclink, Sierra Wireless, Spireon, Teltonika and Xirgo. Additionally, the market for Software and Subscription Services is also highly competitive and include well-established companies such as Geotab, Octo Telematics, Omnitracs, OnStar, Trimble, Verizon Connect and Zonar Systems as well as numerous small players.

BACKLOG 
 Total backlog for our hardware products as of February 28, 2019 and 2018 was $18.4 million and $38.4 million, respectively. Substantially all of the backlog at February 28, 2019 is expected to be shipped in fiscal 2020. Our backlog for hardware products decreased year-over-year as we continue to grow our base of software SaaS subscribers and continue to migrate to becoming a pure-play solution provider of subscription services. 
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
 Intellectual property is an important aspect of our business, and we seek protection for our intellectual property as appropriate. We rely upon a combination of patent, trade secret, and trademark laws and contractual restrictions, such as confidentiality agreements and licenses, to establish and protect our proprietary rights. In addition, we often rely on inbound licenses of intellectual property for use in our business. One approach to our risk management of patent infringement claims was to become a client of RPX Corporation (“RPX”). RPX helps companies reduce patent-related risks and expenses through its defensive patent aggregation, under which RPX acquires patents and licenses to patents that are being, or may be, asserted against its clients. The licenses for these patent assets are made available to RPX’s clients to protect them from potential patent infringement assertions.
 We own and utilize the tradenames “CalAmp” and “LoJack” as well as the related logos and trademarks on all of our products and solutions. We believe that having distinctive marks that are registered and readily identifiable is an important factor in identifying our brand. We own 199 active trademark applications and registrations throughout the world, with 30 pending and registered trademarks in the U.S.. 
 In addition to the foregoing protections, we generally control access to and the use of our proprietary and other confidential information through the use of internal and external controls, including contractual protections with employees, manufacturers, and others. We will continue to file and prosecute patent applications when appropriate to attempt to protect our rights in our proprietary technologies.  
 At February 28, 2019, we had 73 U.S. patents and 200 foreign patents. In addition to our awarded patents, we have 59 patent applications in process. Although a number of these trademarks, copyrights, and patents relate to software and products that are significant to our business and operations, we do not believe we are dependent on a single trademark, copyright or patent. 
 EMPLOYEES
 At February 28, 2019, we had approximately 882 employees and approximately 49 contracted workers. None of our employees or contract workers are represented by a labor union. The contracted production workers are engaged through independent temporary labor agencies.
EXECUTIVE OFFICERS
 Our executive officers are as follows:
