ITEM 1. BUSINESS
----------------

General Overview 
We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on March 13, 2013. From inception, it was our intent to import small farming, household gardening and general small tools directly from manufacturers and market to consumers in the Republic of India. Management of our company is currently evaluating our future strategic business plans.

On June 24, 2016, Katiuska Moran our former CEO and Director and Surjeet Singh, our former secretary and a substantial shareholder cancelled any and all loans they made to our company.

On June 24, 2016, in connection with the sale of a controlling interest our company, Katiuska Moran our former CEO and Director and Surjeet Singh (individually and collectively the “Seller(s)”) our company, entered into and closed on certain Share Purchase Agreements (the “Agreements”) with Aureas Capital Co., Ltd., whereby Aureas purchased from the Sellers a total of 6,918,800 shares of our company’s common stock (the “Shares”) for an aggregate price of $100,000.00. The Shares acquired represented approximately 70.6% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of our company.

Concurrently with the closing of the Agreements, Ming Chun Lung was appointed a director, Chief Executive Officer, President and Secretary and Katiuska Moran and Surjeet Singh resigned from all positions held as an officer and director of our company.

On June 8, 2017, Ming Chun Lung resigned as Chief Executive Officer, President, Secretary, and as a director of our company and Kong Nguan Hong was appointed Chief Executive Officer, President, Secretary, Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer, and as a director.

Pursuant to a stock purchase agreement (the “Agreement”), effective as of April 4, 2018, by and among Aureas Capital Co Ltd, Chen Yi-Dou, Ming-Chun Lung, NYJJ Investments, Ti-Jung Chen, Yi-Fang Lin and Zhiqing Wu (together, the “Sellers”) and Haiping Hu (the “Purchaser”), the Sellers sold an aggregate of 9,797,600 shares of Common Stock of our company, to the Purchaser for cash consideration of $360,000 from personal funds of the Purchaser (the “Transaction”). Of the net proceeds, $7,500 have been held back in escrow for the payment of past due taxes. Following consummation of the Transaction on April 4, 2018, the Purchaser holds 99.5% of the voting securities of our company, based on 9,850,000 shares issued and outstanding as at that date. The Transaction resulted in a change in control of our Company.

In connection with the Transaction, Kong Nguan Hong, the sole officer and director of the Company, resigned from all of his officer positions with our company, including Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Secretary, effective immediately upon the consummation of the Transaction, and remained a director of our company until April 16, 2018, which date was ten (10) days following the date on which our company filed a Schedule 14F-1 with the SEC and mailed same to the holders of record of our company, in connection with the Transaction.

Our address is 986 Dongfang Rd., One Hundred Shanshan Bldg 25th Fl, Pudong, Shanghai, China 200122. Our telephone number is +86 136 1833 3008.

We do not have any subsidiaries. We do not have a corporate website.

We have not ever declared bankruptcy, been in receivership, or involved in any kind of legal proceeding. 

Our Current Business

We are currently seeking new business opportunities with established business entities for merger with or acquisition of a target business. In certain instances, a target business may wish to become our subsidiary or may wish to contribute assets to us rather than merge. We have not yet begun negotiations or entered into any definitive agreements for potential new business opportunities, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to enter into any definitive agreements.

Any new acquisition or business opportunities that we may acquire will require additional financing. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to acquire the financing necessary to enable us to pursue our plan of operation. If our company requires additional financing and we are unable to acquire such funds, our business may fail.

Management of our company believes that there are benefits to being a reporting company with a class of securities quoted on the OTCMarkets, such as: (i) the ability to use registered securities to acquire assets or businesses; (ii) increased visibility in the financial community; (iii) the facilitation of borrowing from financial institutions; (iv) potentially improved trading efficiency; (v) potential stockholder liquidity; (vi) potentially greater ease in raising capital subsequent to an acquisition; (vii) potential compensation of key employees through stock awards or options; (viii) potentially enhanced corporate image; and (ix) a presence in the United States’ capital market.

We may seek a business opportunity with entities that have recently commenced operations, or entities who wish to utilize the public marketplace in order to raise additional capital in order to expand business development activities, to develop a new product or service, or for other corporate purposes. We may acquire assets and establish wholly-owned subsidiaries in various businesses or acquire existing businesses as subsidiaries.

In implementing a structure for a particular business acquisition or opportunity, we may become a party to a merger, consolidation, reorganization, joint venture, or licensing agreement with another corporation or entity. We may also acquire stock or assets of an existing business. Upon the consummation of a transaction, it is anticipated that our sole officer and two directors will continue to manage the Company.

As of the date hereof, we have not entered into any formal written agreements for a business combination or opportunity. When any such agreement is reached, we intend to disclose such an agreement by filing a current report on Form 8-K.

We anticipate that the selection of a business opportunity in which to participate will be complex and without certainty of success. Business opportunities may be available in many different industries and at various stages of development, all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult and complex. Business opportunities that we believe are in the best interests of our company may be scarce, or we may be unable to obtain the ones that we want. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to locate compatible business opportunities.

Currently, we do not have a source of revenue. We are not able to fund our cash requirements through our current operations. We have been reliant on loans by affiliated and non-affiliated parties to provide financial contributions and services to keep our company operating. Further, we believe that our company may have difficulties raising capital from other sources until we locate a prospective merger candidate through which we can pursue our plan of operation. If we are unable to secure adequate capital to continue our acquisition efforts, our shareholders may lose some or all of their investment and our business may fail. We currently have no written or oral agreement from our majority shareholder to continue to provide financial contributions.

Research and Development

We have incurred $Nil in research and development expenditures over the last two fiscal years.

Intellectual Property

We do not currently have any intellectual property.

Employees

Our company has no employees. Our sole director and officer is donating their time to the development of our company, and intends to do whatever work is necessary to bring us to the point of earning revenues. We estimate that our sole officer and director will be able to complete his required work and complete whatever work is necessary by spending 20 hours per week without lending our company additional funds. If this is not the case and additional time and funds will be require then he is willing to commit additional time funds although he has no commitment or contractual obligation to do so. We have no other employees, and do not foresee hiring any additional employees in the near future. We will be engaging independent contractors to design and develop our website and manage our internet marketing efforts.
