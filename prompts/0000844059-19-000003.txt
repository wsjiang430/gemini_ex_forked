Item 1. BUSINESS.
 
FRP Holdings, Inc. was incorporated on April 22, 2014 in connection with a corporate reorganization that preceded the Spin-off of Patriot Transportation Holding, Inc. The Company’s successor issuer was formed on July 20, 1998. The business of the Company is conducted through our wholly-owned subsidiaries FRP Development Corp., a Maryland corporation and Florida Rock Properties, Inc., a Florida corporation, and the various subsidiaries of each.
 
Our Business. FRP Holdings, Inc. (the “Company”) is a holding company engaged in various real estate businesses. The segments of the Company include: (i) leasing and management of commercial properties owned by the Company (the “Asset Management Segment”), (ii) leasing and management of mining royalty land owned by the Company (the “Mining Royalty Lands Segment”), (ii) real property acquisition, entitlement, development and construction primarily for apartment, retail, warehouse, and office buildings either alone or through joint ventures (the “Development Segment”), (iv) leasing and management of a residential apartment building (the “Stabilized Joint Venture Segment”).
 
On May 21, 2018, the Company completed the disposition of 40 industrial warehouse properties and three additional land parcels to an affiliate of Blackstone Real Estate Partners VIII, L.P. for $347.2 million. One warehouse property valued at $11.7 million was excluded from the sale due to the tenant exercising its right of first refusal to purchase the property. These properties comprised substantially all the assets of our Asset Management segment and have been reclassified as discontinued operations for all periods presented.
 
The Asset Management Segment owns, leases and manages commercial properties. Price, location, rental space availability, flexibility of design and property management services are the major factors that affect competition in the office rental market. The Company experiences considerable competition in all of its markets. Our tenants are not concentrated in any one particular industry.
 
Our Mining Royalty Lands Segment owns several properties comprising approximately 15,000 acres currently under lease for mining rents or royalties (not including the 4,280 acres owned in our Brooksville joint venture with Vulcan Materials).  Other than one location in Virginia, all of these properties are located in Florida and Georgia. 
 
Our Development Segment owns and continuously monitors the “highest and best use” of parcels of land that are in various stages of development. The overall strategy for this segment is to convert all of our non-income producing property into income-producing property through (i) an orderly process of constructing new apartment, retail, warehouse, and office buildings to be operated by the Company or (ii) a sale to, or joint venture with, third parties. Additionally, our Development segment will form joint ventures on new developments of land not previously owned by the Company.
 
The Stabilized Joint Venture Segment owns, leases and manages a 305-unit residential apartment building with approximately 18,000 sq. ft. of first floor retail space. We have renamed this segment from RiverFront on the Anacostia to the Stabilized Joint Venture segment as we intend to transfer additional joint ventures from our Development segment into this segment as they reach stabilization.
 
Competition. As a developer, we compete with numerous developers, owners and operators of real estate, many of whom own properties similar to ours in the same submarkets in which our properties are located. Price, location, rental space availability, flexibility of design and property management services are the major factors that affect competition.
 
Customers. In the Mining Royalty Lands segment, we have a total of five tenants currently leasing our mining locations and one particular tenant (Vulcan Materials Company) accounted for 29.9% of the

Company’s consolidated revenues in 2018. An event affecting Vulcan’s ability to perform under its lease agreements could materially impact the Company’s results.
 
Sales and Marketing. We use national brokerage firms to assist us in marketing our vacant properties. Our hands on in-house management team focuses on tenant satisfaction during the life of the lease which we have found to be very beneficial with respect to our tenant renewal success rate over the years.
 
Financial Information. Financial information is discussed by industry segment in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements included in the accompanying 2018 Annual Report to Shareholders, which is incorporated herein by reference.
 
Environmental Matters. The Company incurs costs from time to time to investigate and remediate environmental contamination on its real estate. The Company's mining leases contain provisions under which the lessee is responsible for environmental liabilities and reclamation of mining sites at least to the extent required by law.
 
Seasonality. The Company’s business is subject to limited seasonality factors due to the cyclical nature of our mining customers’ businesses. Revenues generally decline slightly during winter months.
 
Employees. The Company employed 10 people and was provided services by 3 executive officers under a related party agreement at December 31, 2018.
 
Company Website. The Company’s website may be accessed at www.frpholdings.com. All of our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission are accessible through our website promptly after filing. This includes annual reports on Form 10-K, proxy statements, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports filed or furnished on Form 8-K and all related amendments.
