ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 
MassRoots, Inc. (“MassRoots” or the “Company”) was formed in April 2013 as a technology platform for the cannabis industry. Powered by more than one million registered users, MassRoots enables consumers to rate cannabis products and strains based on their efficacy (i.e., effectiveness for treating ailments such as back-pain or epilepsy) and then presents this information in easy-to-use formats for consumers to make educated purchasing decisions at their local dispensary. Businesses are able to leverage MassRoots by strategically advertising to consumers based on their preferences and tendencies.
 
“Registered users” (“Users”) are defined as users who currently have an account with MassRoots. It does not include users who have deleted their account nor does it reflect active usage over any set period of time.
 
Over the past six years, MassRoots has established itself as a leading technology company in the emerging cannabis industry, building a User-base of more than one million registered Users, partnering with some of the most recognized brands in the industry and raising significant capital from institutional and private investors. Since inception, the Company has generated approximately $1.2 million in revenue.
 
Historically, we have focused on building a consumer-facing application and have not spent significant resources on developing our advertising portal for dispensaries. However, we are now focusing our efforts on developing our advertising portal so as to automate the processes and platform needed to deliver our underlying services. In the summer of 2018, we launched a revamped MassRoots Business Portal and a consumer rewards program, WeedPass®, accessible through the MassRoots mobile app. After an introductory free trial period, we charge dispensaries a monthly fee for their dispensary listing and access to our consumer rewards program. With MassRoots’ wide-spread audience and following in some of the leading medical cannabis markets in the country, we believe our business portal will be well-received by our client base. According to ArcView Market Research, there are projected to be over 2,700 state-regulated dispensaries in the United States by 2020.
 
Background
 
We were incorporated in the state of Delaware on April 26, 2013 as a technology platform for the cannabis industry.
 
Our principal executive office is located at 7083 Hollywood Blvd., Office 4084, Los Angeles, CA 90028, and our telephone number is (833) 467-6687.
 
On January 25, 2017, we consummated a reverse triangular merger (the “Whaxy Merger”) pursuant to which we acquired all of the outstanding common stock of DDDigtal Inc (“DDDigtal”), a Colorado corporation. Upon closing of the Whaxy Merger, each share of DDDigtal’s common stock was exchanged for such number of shares of our common stock (or a fraction thereof) based on an exchange ratio equal to approximately 5.273-for-1, such that 1 share of our common stock was issued for every 5.273 shares of DDDigtal’s common stock. At the closing of the Whaxy Merger, all shares of common stock of our newly-formed merger subsidiary formed for the sole purpose of effectuating the Whaxy Merger, were converted into and exchanged for one share of common stock of DDDigtal, and all shares of DDDigtal’s common stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the closing of the Whaxy Merger were automatically cancelled and retired. Upon the closing of the Whaxy Merger, DDDigtal continued as our surviving wholly-owned subsidiary, and the merger subsidiary ceased to exist.
 
On July 13, 2017, we consummated a reverse triangular merger (the “Odava Merger”) pursuant to which we acquired all of the outstanding common stock of Odava Inc (“Odava”), a Delaware corporation. Upon closing of the Odava Merger, each share of Odava’s common stock was exchanged for such number of shares of our common stock (or a fraction thereof), based on an exchange ratio equal to approximately 4.069-for-1, such that 1 share of our common stock was issued for every 4.069 shares of Odava’s common stock. At the closing of the Odava Merger, all shares of common stock of our newly-formed merger subsidiary formed for the sole purpose of effectuating the Odava Merger, were converted into and exchanged for one share of common stock of Odava, and all shares of Odava’s common stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the closing of the Odava Merger automatically cancelled and retired. Upon the closing of the Odava Merger, Odava continued as our surviving wholly-owned subsidiary, and the merger subsidiary ceased to exist.

Through this portal companies can edit their profiles, distribute information to Users and view analytics such as impressions, views and clicks.
 
Blockchain Technologies
 
MassRoots Blockchain Technologies, Inc. (“MassRoots Blockchain”) was formed in December 2017 as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company to continue the Company’s efforts in exploring how new technologies may be utilized in the cannabis industry. Initially, we are focusing on blockchain technology for several reasons, including, but not limited to:

● | that it may enable better tracking of impressions, views, and interactions with posts, advertisements and dispensary listings; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | that it has the potential to streamline the collection and organization of data while eliminating traditional security risks; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | that it may provide a greater degree of reliability and accuracy with respect to data; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | that it may allow us to implement an intelligent newsfeed to deliver high-quality and more relevant content to our Users; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | that it may enable the development of contracts that are automatically executed when certain parameters are met; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | that it has the potential to reduce friction in the cannabis market-place and save businesses valuable and resources; and 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | that it may provide greater transparency to government regulators. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In December 2017, we commenced the re-development of the MassRoots Business Portal, a platform where dispensaries and other industry participants, such as producers and other ancillary businesses, may advertise their goods and services. To date, we have used approximately $370,000 for the initial development of the MassRoots Business Portal, including features that allow for tracking of advertising impressions, enhanced targeting and serving of advertisements, as well as a program that would be designed to reward Users of the MassRoots platform for providing high quality reviews on cannabis strains and products. The development and implementation of these any other features, including the possible use of digital instruments, is currently contemplated to be made within the MassRoots App and platform, and is intended to generate the growth of Users of the MassRoots platform and stimulate the MassRoots platform’s overall activity.

All initial development has been outsourced to third party development firms and consultants. Specifically, we have outsourced the following services: software development services, including, but not limited to, web and mobile development services, blockchain development and integration services, and infrastructure development, automation, support and management services. As stated in “Risk Factors,” the development of features based upon the use of blockchain technology is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, and there can be no assurance as to when, or if, any such features will be successfully developed, or that if developed, that they will be accepted or adopted. Further, the likelihood of our development and implementation of features based upon new technology must be considered in light of the problems, expenses, difficulties, complications and delays frequently encountered in connection with the inception and development of a product or service based upon any such relatively new and developing technology.
 
While MassRoots Blockchain and the Company intend to devote resources to exploring the feasibility of developing these or other solutions, there can be no assurances that we will be successful in implementing such solutions, that any such solutions will be economically viable, or that any of them will result in the generation of User interest, participation or revenue.
 
We currently anticipate that MassRoots Blockchain and/or the Company will need to raise additional funds to continue to explore and develop potential uses and applications of blockchain technologies and uses for our business and other businesses in the cannabis industry; however, no assurance can be given that additional financing will be available on terms favorable to us, or at all.
 
App/Play Store Issues, User Support and Similar Matters
 
On November 4, 2014, the MassRoots App was removed from Apple’s iOS App Store because the App Store changed its guidelines to prohibit the promotion of social cannabis applications. Although existing iOS Users were still able to access and use the MassRoots App, new users were prohibited from downloading our app. After correspondences with Apple, other cannabis companies and cannabis advocates, in February 2015 Apple advised us that it revised its enforcement guidelines to permit cannabis applications in the Apple App Store which restricted access to users located in the states where use of cannabis was permitted. On February 12, 2015, our application was reinstated to the Apple App Store and can now only be accessed by users in the states which permit the use of cannabis. Although our app has been reinstated to the Apple App Store, we cannot provide any assurance that Apple’s policy will not change in the future or that our application will not once again be removed from the Apple App Store.
 
The Apple App Store is one of the largest content distribution channels in the world and is the only way to effectively distribute software to the large percentage of the United States population who own iPhones and iPads. The Apple App Store review team effectively operates as our iOS App’s regulator; they decide what guidelines iOS apps must operate under and how to enforce such guidelines. The Apple guidelines related to cannabis-related apps are not published, enforcement of such guidelines is difficult to predict, and the review and appeal processes are conducted without public oversight. Although we will continue advocating for a more open and transparent Apple App Store review process that will allow decisions that affect a significant portion of the United States smartphone owning population to be open to public scrutiny, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in these efforts.
 
MassRoots, along with other cannabis apps, regularly encounter issues with the Google Play Store review team in the normal course of business due to Google Play Store’s absence of clear guidelines regarding cannabis-related apps. On November 8, 2016, the MassRoots App was removed from the Google Play Store due to a compliance review. However, on March 21, 2017, Google approved the MassRoots App for distribution to Android devices through the Google Play Store, making it available for download on the Google Play Store once again.

On December 1, 2016, MassRoots’ Android application received approval from the Amazon App Store for listing, and is currently available for download on the Amazon App Store.
 
Under their respective developer license agreements, Apple, Inc., Google, Inc. and Amazon.com, Inc. have the right to update the Apple App Store, Google Play Store and Amazon App Store policies, respectively, to prohibit cannabis-related applications at any time. This could result in many prospective users being unable to access and join our network and existing Users being unable to access our app.
 
Our activities outside of the application stores have also faced backlash and resistance due to our status as a cannabis-related company. For example, our Instagram account is followed by more than 400,000 users and we utilize this following to help expand our user-base. However, in a situation similar to the removal of our application from the Apple App Store, our Instagram account was suspended in January 2016 without notice or explanation. Our account was reinstated on February 26, 2016. While management believes that our platform is at the point where any potential suspensions effecting our Company will not affect our User growth, we expect to continue to face similar situations in the future that may cause disruptions to the execution of our business plan.
 
Market Conditions
 
MassRoots is poised to take advantage of two rapidly growing industries: cannabis and mobile technology.
 
Cannabis Market Growth and Current Trends
 
On January 4, 2018, Attorney General Jefferson B. Sessions, III issued a memo which rescinded the Cole Memo (as described below) which was adopted by the Obama administration as a policy of non-interference with marijuana-friendly state laws.
The Cole Memo
 
On August 29, 2013, Deputy Attorney General James Cole issued a memo (the “Cole Memo”) in response to certain states passing measures to regulate the medical and adult-use of cannabis. In the Cole Memo, the Department of Justice made clear that marijuana remains an illegal drug under the Controlled Substances Act and that federal prosecutors will continue to aggressively enforce the statute. The Department of Justice identified eight enforcement areas that federal prosecutors should prioritize. Outside of such enforcement priorities, the federal government has traditionally relied on state and local authorities to address marijuana activity. The Cole Memo established several basic guidelines by which state-regulated cannabis businesses could operate to minimize the risk of intervention and enforcement by the Department of Justice. The guidelines focused on ensuring that cannabis did not cross state lines, keeping dispensaries away from schools and public facilities and strict-enforcement of state laws by regulatory agencies, among other priorities.
The Sessions Memo
 
On January 4, 2018, Attorney General Jefferson B. Sessions, III issued a memo (the “Sessions Memo”) on federal marijuana enforcement policy announcing a return to the rule of law and the rescission of previous nationwide guidance by the Department of Justice (including, but not limited to, the Cole Memo). In the memorandum, Attorney General Jefferson Sessions directs all U.S. attorneys to enforce the laws enacted by Congress and to follow the well-established principles when pursuing prosecutions related to marijuana activities. These principles include weighing all relevant considerations, including federal law enforcement priorities set by the Attorney General, the seriousness of the crime, the deterrent effect of criminal prosecution, and the cumulative impact of particular crimes on the community.

Guidance to Banks Relating to the Marijuana Industry
 
On February 14, 2014, the Department of Justice and the Department of Treasury issued guidance to banks about how to serve the marijuana industry without running afoul of federal regulations. Prior to such guidance, dispensaries were forced to operate on a cash basis, presenting significant security and accounting issues. Although banks have remained reluctant to work with marijuana businesses because of federal prohibition laws, this guidance was a major step in legitimizing and accepting the cannabis industry on a national level. In addition, the adoption of the Joyce Amendment (formerly known as the Rohrabacher-Farr Amendment) (as discussed below) indicates some level of support in Congress for medicinal cannabis, even if its actual effect is still undetermined.
 
For additional information concerning the Cole Memo, the Sessions Member, the Joyce Amendment and regulatory conditions, see the section entitled “Business – Government Regulation.”
 
Current States with Laws Permitting the Medical or Adult Use of Cannabis
 
Recreational marijuana is regulated in ten states and the District of Columbia and medical marijuana is regulated in 33 states. In addition, thirteen additional states have legalized low-tetrahydrocannabinol (“THC”)/high-cannabidiol(“CBD”) extracts for select medical conditions. The states which have enacted such laws are listed in the following table:

Public Support for Regulation of Cannabis Increasing
 
A Gallup poll conducted in October 2018 found that 66% of Americans supported regulating the use of cannabis, and a February 2017 Quinnipiac poll found that 71% of Americans were opposed to federal government interference with state marijuana programs. These statistics continue the trend over the past decade toward public support for cannabis.

Market Conditions that Could Limit Our Business
 
Cannabis is a Schedule I controlled substance under Federal law and, as such, there are several factors that could limit our business operations including, but not limited to:

● | The Federal government and many private employers prohibit drug use of any kind, including cannabis, even where it is permissible under state law. Random drug screenings and potential enforcement of such employment provisions may significantly reduce the size of the potential cannabis market; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Enforcement of Federal law prohibiting cannabis occurs randomly and often without notice. This could scare many potential investors away from cannabis-related investments and makes it difficult to make accurate market predictions; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | On January 4, 2018, the Department of Justice issued the Sessions Memo announcing a return to the rule of law and the rescission of previous guidance documents. The Sessions Memo rescinded the Cole Memo. Although there is no guarantee that additional states will pass measures to regulate cannabis use under state law, the Sessions Memo may further deter states from passing such measures. Furthermore, irrespective of the Sessions Memo, in many states, public support of regulation initiatives may not maintain enough support to pass. This is especially true when a supermajority is needed to pass measures, like in Florida where a state constitutional amendment permitting medical cannabis required 60% approval to pass. Changes due to the Sessions Memo and in voters’ attitudes and turnout have the potential to slow or stop the cannabis regulation movement and potentially reverse recent cannabis regulation victories; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | There has been some resistance and negativity as a result of recent cannabis regulation at the state level, especially as it relates to drugged driving. The lack of clearly defined and enforced laws at the state level has the potential to sway public opinion against marijuana regulation; and 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | In the event that the Federal government does not enforce the Federal law prohibiting cannabis, state laws regarding the regulation of cannabis are being challenged through lawsuits. Lawsuits have been brought by private groups and local law enforcement officials. If these lawsuits are successful, state laws permitting cannabis sales may be overturned which will significantly reduce the size of the potential cannabis market and have a material adverse effect on our business. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Please see “Government Regulation” below for additional information.
 
Government Regulation
 
Marijuana is a categorized as a Schedule I controlled substance by the Drug Enforcement Agency and the United States Department of Justice and is illegal to grow, possess and consume under Federal law. However, 33 states have passed state laws that permit doctors to recommend cannabis for medical-use and ten of those states and the District of Columbia have enacted laws that regulate the adult-use of cannabis for any reason. In addition, thirteen additional states have legalized low-THC/high- CBD extracts for select medical conditions. Because doctors are prohibited from prescribing a Schedule I controlled substance, the passage of a state medical marijuana does not necessarily guarantee the implementation of a regulated, commercial system through which patients can purchase cannabis products. This has created an unpredictable business-environment for dispensaries and collectives that operate under certain state laws but in violation of Federal law.
 
7

 

Cole Memo
 
On August 29, 2013, United States Deputy Attorney General James Cole issued the Cole Memo to United States attorneys guiding them to prioritize enforcement of Federal law away from the cannabis industry operating as permitted under certain state laws, so long as:

● | cannabis is not being distributed to minors and dispensaries are not located around schools and public buildings; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the proceeds from sales are not going to gangs, cartels or criminal enterprises; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | cannabis grown in states where it is legal is not being diverted to other states; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | cannabis-related businesses are not being used as a cover for sales of other illegal drugs or illegal activity; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | there is not any violence or use of firearms in the cultivation and sale of marijuana; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | there is strict enforcement of drugged-driving laws and adequate prevention of adverse health consequences; and 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | cannabis is not grown, used, or possessed on Federal properties.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------

 
The Cole Memo was a guide for United States attorneys and did not alter in any way the Department of Justice’s authority to enforce Federal law, including Federal laws relating to cannabis, regardless of state law. As described below, as a result of the issuance of the Sessions Memo by the Department of Justice, on January 4, 2018, the Cole memo was rescinded. Prior to the issuance of the Sessions Memo, we had implemented standard operating procedures and policies to ensure that we were operating in compliance with the Cole Memo. We cannot provide assurance that our actions were, are or will be in compliance with the Cole Memo, the Sessions Memo or any other laws or regulations that currently exist or may be amended or adopted in the future.
 
Pursuant to our currently existing Terms and Conditions:
 

● | Users must agree that they are located in a state where medical-use or adult-use of cannabis is regulated; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Users must be of age to consume cannabis in their particular state (18 or 21 years old, depending on the state); 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Users may only post content that is in compliance with their state’s laws; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Users may not solicit or distribute cannabis through MassRoots unless they are a licensed dispensary; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Posting of any of the following materials to MassRoots is prohibited and will result in account termination: 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Posting other drugs or substances, including prescription pain pills; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Posting of any violence or threat of violence;
--+-----------------------------------------------


● | Posting of any drugged-driving content; and
--+--------------------------------------------


● | Posting of any copyright-protected content.
--+--------------------------------------------

We have implemented an aggressive content and account review program to ensure compliance with our Terms and Conditions. Users have the ability to report any status or account that is in violation of our Terms and Conditions and we encourage Users to do so as any illegal content jeopardizes the network for all our Users. When a status or account is reported, the post is automatically removed from the network until further review. A MassRoots employee then reviews the content within 24 hours and either approves it as in compliance within our Terms and Conditions or permanently deletes it and bans the User’s account.
 
In addition, as part of the agreement to allow our app to return to the Apple App Store, we implemented geographic restrictions to restrict new Users to our mobile apps to the District of Columbia and the 33 states in which the use of marijuana is permitted.
 
Our business plan includes allowing cannabis dispensaries to advertise on our network, which we believe could be deemed to be aiding and abetting illegal activities, a violation of Federal law. We continue to evaluate the effects of the Sessions Memo; however, we cannot provide assurance that we were, are or will be in compliance with the Cole Memo, the Sessions Memo or any other laws or regulations.
 
Joyce Amendment (formerly known as the Rohrabacher-Farr Amendment)
 
On December 16, 2014, H.R. 83 - Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 was enacted and included a provision now known as the “Joyce Amendment” which states:
 
None of the funds made available in this Act to the Department of Justice may be used, with respect to the States of Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin, to prevent such States from implementing their own State laws that authorize the use, distribution, possession, or cultivation of medical marijuana.
 
The Joyce Amendment would appear to protect the right of the states to determine their own laws on medical cannabis use; however, the actual effects of the amendment are still unclear. The Joyce Amendment did not remove the federal ban on medical cannabis and cannabis remains regulated as a Schedule I controlled substance. Further, the United States Department of Justice has interpreted the Joyce Amendment as only preventing federal action that prevents states from creating and implementing cannabis laws - not against the individuals or businesses that actually carry out cannabis laws – and has continued to sporadically initiate enforcement actions against individuals or businesses participating in the cannabis industry despite such participation being regulated under state law. Whether this interpretation is appropriate is still being litigated, and, while an initial district court decision has not supported the Department of Justice’s interpretation, such decision is currently under appellate review. In addition, no matter what the interpretation is adopted by the courts, there is no question that the Joyce Amendment does not protect any party not in full compliance with state medicinal cannabis laws.
 
The Joyce Amendment represents one of the first times in recent history that Congress has taken action indicating support of medical cannabis. The Joyce Amendment was renewed by Congress in 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 and is in effect until September 30, 2019.


Sessions Memo
 
On January 4, 2018, Attorney General Jefferson B. Sessions, III issued a memo on federal marijuana enforcement policy announcing a return to the rule of law and the rescission of previous nationwide guidance by the Department of Justice (including, but not limited to, the Cole Memo). In the memorandum, Attorney General Jefferson Sessions directs all U.S. attorneys to enforce the laws enacted by Congress and to follow well-established principles when pursuing prosecutions related to marijuana activities. These principles include weighing all relevant considerations, including federal law enforcement priorities set by the Attorney General, the seriousness of the crime, the deterrent effect of criminal prosecution, and the cumulative impact of particular crimes on the community. The effect of this memo is to shift federal policy from a hands-off approach adopted by the Obama administration to permitting federal prosecutors across the country to determine how to prioritize resources to regulate marijuana possession, distribution and cultivation in states where marijuana use is legal.

While we do not directly harvest or distribute cannabis today, we still may be deemed to be violating federal law, or aiding and abetting the violation of Federal law and may be irreparably harmed by a change in enforcement by the federal or state governments.
 
Additional Government Regulations
 
We are subject to general business regulations and laws as well as Federal and state regulations and laws specifically governing the Internet and e-commerce. These regulations and laws cover among others, sweepstakes, taxation, tariffs, user privacy, data protection, pricing, content, copyrights, distribution, electronic contracts and other communications, consumer protection, broadband residential Internet access and the characteristics and quality of services. Any noncompliance with the foregoing laws and regulations may harm our business and results of operations.
Competitors
 
We compete with other cannabis information platforms such as WeedMaps and Leafly, which provide information with respect to dispensary locations, strain information, and news relating to the cannabis industry. We believe our primary competitive advantage is the community we have created and the significant reviews and data we have collected on key cannabis markets.
Recent Developments
 
In February 2019, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with MassRoots Supply Chain, Inc., our wholly-owned subsidiary (“Merger Subsidiary”), COWA Science Corporation, a Delaware corporation (“COWA”), and Christopher Alameddin, an individual acting solely in his capacity as a stockholder representative pursuant to which Merger Subsidiary will be merged with and into COWA, whereby the separate corporate existence of Merger Subsidiary will cease and COWA will be the surviving entity (the “Surviving Entity”) and our wholly-owned subsidiary (the “Merger”). Upon effectiveness of the Merger, we will issue an aggregate of 50,000,000 shares of our common stock to the stockholders of COWA and each share of the common stock of Merger Subsidiary will be converted into one newly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock of the Surviving Entity. If COWA attains certain revenue targets, its stockholders may receive up to an additional 50 million shares of our common stock. The closing of the Merger is subject to various conditions, including, but not limited to, approval of the Merger and the Merger Agreement by COWA stockholders and the delivery of audited financial statements by COWA, In the event the Merger has not closed by May 15, 2019, the Company may terminate the Merger Agreement upon providing written notice to COWA.
