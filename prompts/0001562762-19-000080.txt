 ﻿
 Business Strategy
 ﻿
 Our business strategy is to operate as a well-capitalized, profitable and independent community-oriented financial institution dedicated to providing the highest quality customer service. Management’s and the Board of Directors’ extensive knowledge of the markets we serve helps to differentiate us from our competitors. Our business strategy incorporates the following elements: maintaining a community focus, focusing on profitability, strengthening our balance sheet, concentrating on real estate- based lending, capitalizing on market dynamics, providing attentive and personalized service, and attracting highly qualified and experienced personnel. These attributes coupled with our desire to seek out under-served markets for banking products and services, facilitate our plan to grow our franchise footprint organically and synergistically.
 ﻿
 Maintaining a community focus.  Our management and Board of Directors have strong ties to the communities we serve. Many members of the management team are New Jersey natives and are active in the communities we serve through non-profit board membership, local business development organizations, and industry associations.  In addition, our board members are well-established professionals and business leaders in the communities we serve. Management and the Board are interested in making a lasting contribution to these communities, and they have succeeded in attracting deposits and loans through attentive and personalized service.
 ﻿
 Focusing on profitability. The Company intends to continue its growth through opening new branches and acquisitions. While this will serve to expand our geographic footprint, it should also provide additional sources of liquidity and as new branches mature, increase profitability. Management continues to be committed to managing and controlling our non-interest expenses to improve our efficiency ratio, and to remain as a well-capitalized institution.
 ﻿
 Strengthening our balance sheet.  For the year ended December 31, 2018, our return on average equity was 8.86% and our return on average assets was 0.70%. Our earnings per diluted share was $1.01 for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $0.75 for the year ended December 31, 2017. Management remains committed to strengthening the Bank’s statements of financial condition and maintaining profitability by diversifying the products, pricing and services we offer.
 ﻿
 Concentrating on real estate-based lending.  A primary focus of our business strategy is to originate loans secured by commercial and multi-family properties. Such loans generally provide higher returns than loans secured by one- to four-family properties. As a result of our underwriting practices, including debt service requirements for commercial real estate and multi-family loans, management believes that such loans offer us an opportunity to obtain higher returns without a significant increased level of risk.
 ﻿
 Capitalizing on market dynamics. The consolidation of the banking industry in northeast New Jersey has provided a unique opportunity for a customer-focused banking institution, such as the Bank. We believe our local roots and community focus provide the Bank with an opportunity to capitalize on the consolidation in our market area. This consolidation has moved decision making away from local, community-based banks to much larger banks headquartered outside of New Jersey. We believe our local roots and community focus provide the Bank with an opportunity to capitalize on the consolidation in our market area.
 ﻿
 Providing attentive and personalized service.  Management believes that providing attentive and personalized service is the key to gaining deposit and loan relationships in the markets we serve and their surrounding communities. Since we began operations, our branches have been open seven days a week.
 ﻿
 Attracting highly experienced and qualified personnel.   An important part of our strategy is to hire bankers who have prior experience in the markets we serve, as well as pre-existing business relationships. Our management team averages over 20 years of banking experience, while our lenders and branch personnel have significant experience at community banks and regional banks throughout the region. Management believes that its knowledge of these markets has been a critical element in the success of the Bank. Management’s extensive knowledge of the local communities has allowed us to develop and implement a highly focused and disciplined approach to lending, and has enabled the Bank to attract a high percentage of low cost deposits.
 ﻿
 Our Market Area
 ﻿
 We are located in Bayonne, Jersey City and Hoboken in Hudson County, Carteret, Colonia, Edison, Monroe Township, Plainsboro and Woodbridge in Middlesex County, Lodi, Lyndhurst, and Rutherford in Bergen County and Fairfield, Maplewood, and South Orange in Essex County, Holmdel in Monmouth County, Parsippany in Morris County, and Union in Union County, New Jersey. The Bank also operates two branches in Staten Island, New York and one in Hicksville, New York. The Bank’s locations are easily accessible and provide convenient services to businesses and individuals throughout our market area. These areas are all considered “bedroom” or “commuter” communities to Manhattan. Our market area is well-served by a network of arterial roadways, including Route 440 and the New Jersey Turnpike.  
 ﻿
 Our market area has a high level of commercial business activity. Businesses are concentrated in the service sector and retail trade areas. Major employers in our market area include certain medical centers and local boards of education.
 ﻿
 Competition
 ﻿
 The banking industry in northeast New Jersey and New York City is extremely competitive. We compete for deposits and loans with existing New Jersey and out-of-state financial institutions that have longer operating histories, larger capital reserves and more established customer bases. Our competition includes large financial services companies and other entities, in addition to traditional banking institutions, such as savings and loan associations, savings banks, commercial banks and credit unions. Our larger competitors have a greater ability to finance wide-ranging advertising campaigns through greater capital resources. Our marketing efforts depend heavily upon referrals from officers, directors, stockholders, advertising in local media and through a social media presence. We compete for business principally on the basis of personal service to customers, customer access to our business development and other officers and directors, and competitive interest rates and fees.
 ﻿
 In the financial services industry in recent years, intense market demands, technological and regulatory changes, and economic pressures have eroded industry classifications that were once clearly defined. Banks have diversified their services, competitively priced their deposit products and become more cost-effective as a result of competition with each other and with new types of financial service companies, including non-banking competitors. Some of these market dynamics have resulted in a number of new bank and non-bank competitors, increased merger activity, and increased customer awareness of product and service differences among competitors.

 ﻿
 Commercial and Multi-family Real Estate Loans.  Commercial real estate loans are secured by improved property such as office buildings, mixed use buildings retail stores, shopping centers, warehouses, and other non-residential buildings. Loans secured by multi-family residential units are properties consisting of five or more residential units. The Bank offers fully amortizing loans on commercial and multi-family properties at loan amounts up to 75% of the appraised value of the property. Commercial and multi-family real estate loans are generally made at rates that adjust above the five year Federal Home Loan Bank of New York interest rate, with terms of up to 30 years. The Bank also offers balloon loans with fixed interest rates which generally mature in three to five years with amortization periods up to 30 years. As of December 31, 2018, the Bank’s largest commercial real estate loan had an outstanding principal balance of $21.0 million. This loan is secured by an office/retail building located in Hoboken, NJ. This loan is performing in accordance with its terms at December 31, 2018.   
 ﻿
 Loans secured by commercial and multi-family real estate are generally larger and involve a greater degree of risk than one-to-four family residential mortgage loans. The borrower’s creditworthiness and the feasibility and cash flow potential of the project is of primary concern in commercial and multi-family real estate lending. Loans secured by owner occupied properties are generally larger and involve greater risks than one-to-four family residential and non-owner occupied commercial mortgage loans because payments on loans secured by owner occupied properties are often dependent on the successful operation or management of the business. The Bank intends to continue emphasizing the origination of loans secured by commercial real estate and multi-family properties.
 ﻿
 Construction Loans. The Bank offers loans to finance the construction of various types of commercial and residential properties. Construction loans to builders generally are offered with terms of up to thirty months and interest rates tied to the prime rate plus a margin. These loans generally are offered as adjustable rate loans.  The Bank will originate construction loans to customers provided all necessary plans and permits are in order. Construction loan funds are disbursed as the project progresses. The Bank also offers construction loans that convert to a permanent mortgage on the property upon completion of the construction and adherence to conditions established at the time the construction loan was first approved. Terms of such permanent mortgage loans are similar to other mortgage loans secured by similar properties, with the interest rate established at the time of conversion. As of December 31, 2018, the Bank’s largest construction loan has a borrowing capacity of $19.0 million, of which $8.2 million has been disbursed. This loan is performing in accordance with its terms at December 31, 2018.
 ﻿
 Construction financing is generally considered to involve a higher degree of risk than commercial real estate loans or one-to-four family residential lending. To mitigate these risks the Bank will obtain a plan and cost review from a third party vendor to review the proposed construction budget in an effort to avoid cost overruns. The Bank also obtains multiple appraised values based upon various possible outcomes of the project. These values include “As Is,” “As Completed,” “As a Rental,” “As Sellout,” and “As a Bulk Sale.”    ﻿
 Commercial Business Loans. The Bank offers a variety of commercial business loans in forms of either lines of credit or term loans that are fully amortized. Lines of credit are typically utilized for working capital purposes. These loans are either revolving or non-revolving and provide loan terms between one to three years. The re-payment is generally interest only and the interest rate is adjustable based upon, the prime rate. Term loans are typically for purchasing a business or equipment for a business. Term loans have terms between five to twenty-five years and are fully amortizing. The interest rate is adjustable and tied to the five year Federal Home Loan Bank of New York rate. Commercial business loans are underwritten on the basis of the borrower’s ability to service such debt from income. These loans are generally made to small and mid-sized companies located within the Bank’s primary and secondary lending areas. A commercial business loan may be secured by equipment, accounts receivable, inventory, chattel or other assets. As of December 31, 2018, the Bank’s largest commercial business loan is a revolving line of credit to a school district in Hudson County, NJ secured by plant, equipment, and accounts receivable. The borrowing capacity at December 31, 2018 was $15.0 million, of which no dollars have been dispersed. Additionally, the Bank has a Warehouse Line of Credit secured by commercial real estate with a borrowing capacity of $15.0 million at December 31, 2018, of which $12.2 million has been disbursed. This loan is performing in accordance with its terms at December 31, 2018.
 ﻿
 Commercial business loans generally have higher rates and shorter terms than one to four family residential loans, but they may also involve higher average balances and a higher risk of default since their repayment generally depends on the successful operation of the borrower’s business.
 ﻿
 SBA Lending. The Bank offers qualifying business loans guaranteed by the U.S. Small Business Administration (“SBA”). Amongst other characteristics, SBA borrowers are often sound businesses, but may have lower equity funds to invest in their businesses, may be at an earlier stage of business development, or have other characteristics that may make them ineligible for conventional unguaranteed bank loans. There is a well-developed market for the sale of the guaranteed portion of SBA 7(a) loans.  During 2018, we originated approximately $26.1 million SBA loans, sold $20.2 million guaranteed portions, with a recognition of gains of approximately $1.93 million from the sale of such loans. As of December 31, 2018, the Bank’s largest SBA loan is secured by a hotel building located in Brooklyn, NY. The borrowing capacity is $4.9 million. This loan is performing in accordance with its terms at December 31, 2018.
 ﻿
 Residential Lending. Residential loans are secured by one-to-four family dwellings, condominiums and cooperative units. Residential mortgage loans are secured by properties located in our primary lending areas of Bergen, Essex, Middlesex, Hudson, Monmouth and Richmond Counties; adjoining counties are considered as our secondary lending areas. We generally originate residential mortgage loans up to 80% loan-to-value at a maximum loan amount of $1.5 million and 75% loan-to-value at a maximum loan amount of $3.0 million for primary residences. The loan-to-value ratio is based on the lesser of the appraised value or the purchase price without the requirement of private mortgage insurance. We will originate loans with loan-to-value ratios up to 90%, provided the borrower obtains private mortgage insurance approval. We originate both fixed rate and adjustable rate residential loans with a term of up to 30 years. We offer 15, 20, and 30 year fixed, 15/30 year balloon and 3/1, 5/1, 7/1 and 10/1 adjustable rate loans with payments being calculated to include principal, interest, taxes and insurance. The 3/1 and 5/1 adjustable rate loans are qualified at 2% above the start rate; all other loans are qualified at the start rate. We have a number of correspondent relationships with third party lenders in which we deliver closed first mortgage loans. Our correspondent banking relationships allow us to offer customers competitive long term fixed rate and adjustable rate loans we could not otherwise originate, while providing the Bank a source of fee income. During 2018, 63 loans were sold for approximately $22.8 million in the secondary market and recognized gains of approximately $381,000 from the sale of such loans.
 ﻿
 Home Equity Loans and Home Equity Lines of Credit. The Bank offers home equity loans and lines of credit that are secured by either the borrower’s primary residence, a secondary residence or an investment property. Our home equity loans can be structured as loans that are disbursed in full at closing or as lines of credit. Home equity lines of credit are offered with terms up to 30 years. Virtually all of our home equity loans are originated with fixed rates of interest and home equity lines of credit are originated with adjustable interest rates tied to the prime rate. Home equity loans and lines of credit are underwritten under the same criteria that we use to underwrite one to four family residential loans. Home equity lines of credit may be underwritten with a loan-to-value ratio of up to 80% in a first lien position. At December 31, 2018, the outstanding balances of home equity loans and lines of credit totaled $72.9 million.
 ﻿
 Consumer Loans. The Bank makes secured passbook, automobile and occasionally unsecured consumer loans. Consumer loans generally have terms between one and five years. They generally are made on a fixed rate basis, fully-amortizing. 
 ﻿
 Loan Approval Authority and Underwriting. The Bank’s Lending Policy has established lending limits for executive management. Two Officers with authority, one of which is a Senior Credit Officer and one Executive Officer, have authority to approve loan requests up to $2.5 million. Loan requests in excess of $2.5 million but not exceeding $4.0 million shall be presented to the Chairman of the Loan Committee. Loan requests exceeding $4.0 million shall be presented to the Bank’s Board of Directors Loan Committee, which shall be comprised of a quorum of the Bank’s Board of Directors.
 ﻿
 Upon receipt of a completed loan application including all appropriate financial information from a prospective borrower, the Bank will conduct its due diligence analysis. Property valuations or appraisals are required for all real estate collateralized loans. Appraisals are prepared by a state certified independent appraiser approved by the Bank Board of Directors.
 ﻿
 Loan Commitments. Written commitments are given to prospective borrowers on all approved loans. Generally, we honor commitments for up to 60 days from the date of issuance. At December 31, 2018, our outstanding loan origination commitments totaled $27.9 million, standby letters of credit totaled $3.1 million, undisbursed construction funds totaled $96.7 million, and undisbursed lines of credit funds totaled $112.2 million.
 ﻿
 Loan Delinquencies.  Notices of nonpayment are generated to borrowers once the loan account(s) becomes either 10 or 15 days past due, as specified in the applicable promissory note. A nonresponsive borrower will receive collection calls and a site visit from a bank representative in addition to follow-up delinquency notices. If such payment is not received after 60 days, a notice of right to cure default is sent to the borrower providing 30 additional days to bring the loan current before foreclosure or other remedies are commenced. The Bank utilizes various reporting tools to closely monitor the performance and asset quality of the loan portfolio. The Bank complies with all federal, state and local laws regarding collection of its delinquent accounts. 
 ﻿
 Non-Accrual Status.  Loans are placed on a non-accrual status when the loan becomes more than 90 days delinquent or when, in our opinion, the collection of payment is doubtful. Once placed on non-accrual status, the accrual of interest income is discontinued until the loan has been returned to normal accrual.  At December 31, 2018, the Bank had $7.2 million in non-accruing loans. The largest exposure of non-performing loans was a commercial real estate loan with an outstanding principal balance of approximately $920,000 fully collateralized by a residential property.
 ﻿
 Impairment Status.  A loan is considered impaired when it is probable the borrower will not repay the loan according to the original contractual terms of the loan agreement. Impaired loans can be loans which are more than 90 days delinquent, troubled debt restructured, part of our special residential program, in the process of foreclosure, or a forced Bankruptcy plan. We have determined that an insignificant delay (less than 90 days) will not cause a loan to be classified as impaired if we expect to collect all amounts due including interest accrued at the contractual interest rate for the period of delay. We independently evaluate all loans identified as impaired. We estimate credit losses on impaired loans based on the present value of expected cash flows or the fair value of the underlying collateral if the loan repayment will be derived from the sale or operation of such collateral. Impaired loans, or portions of such loans, are charged off when we determine a realized loss has occurred. Until such time, an allowance for loan losses is maintained for estimated losses. Cash receipts on impaired loans are applied first to accrued interest receivable unless otherwise required by the loan terms, except when an impaired loan is also a nonaccrual loan, in which case the portion of the receipts related to interest is applied to principal. At December 31, 2018, we had 127 loans with carrying balance totaling $42.4 million which are classified as impaired and on which loan loss allowances totaling $2.2 million have been established.  
 ﻿
 Troubled Debt Restructuring. A troubled debt restructuring (“TDR”) is a loan that has been modified whereby the Bank has agreed to make certain concessions to a borrower to meet the needs of both the borrower and the Bank to maximize the ultimate recovery of a loan. A TDR occurs when a borrower is experiencing, or is expected to experience, financial difficulties and the loan is modified using a modification that would otherwise not be granted to the borrower. The types of concessions granted generally included, but were not limited to, interest rate reductions, limitations on the accrued interest charged, term extensions, and deferment of principal. The total troubled debt restructured loans were $26.6 million at December 31, 2018.  
 ﻿
 The Bank had allocated $772,000 and $666,000 of specific reserves to customers whose loan terms have been modified in troubled debt restructurings as of December 31, 2018, and December 31, 2017, respectively.  
 ﻿
 If management determines that the value of the modified loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan, impairment is recognized through an allowance estimate or charge-off to the allowance. This process is used, regardless of loan type, and for loans modified as TDRs that subsequently default on their modified terms.
 ﻿
 Criticized and Classified Loans.  The Bank’s Lending Policy contains an internal rating system which evaluates the overall risk of a problem loan. When a loan is classified and determined to be impaired, the Bank may establish specific allowances for loan losses. General allowances represent loss allowances which have been established to recognize the inherent risk associated with lending activities, but which, unlike specific allowances, have not been allocated to particular problem assets. A portion of general loss allowances established to cover possible losses related to assets classified as substandard or doubtful may be included in determining our regulatory capital. Specific valuation allowances for loan losses generally do not qualify as regulatory capital. At December 31, 2018, the Bank reported $26.2 million in classified assets. The loans classified are represented by loans secured either by one-to-four family, commercial business, or commercial real estate.
 ﻿
 The Company’s internal credit risk grades are based on the definitions currently utilized by the banking regulatory agencies.  The grades assigned and definitions are as follows, and loans graded excellent, above average, good and watch list (risk ratings 1-5) are treated as “pass” for grading purposes. The “criticized” risk rating (6) and the “classified” risk rating (7-9) are detailed below:
 ﻿
 6 – Special Mention- Loans currently performing but with potential weaknesses including adverse trends in borrower’s operations, credit quality, financial strength, or possible collateral deficiency.
 ﻿
 7 – Substandard- Loans that are inadequately protected by current sound worth, paying capacity, and collateral support. Loans on “nonaccrual” status. The loan needs special and corrective attention.
 ﻿
 8 – Doubtful- Weaknesses in credit quality and collateral support make full collection improbable, but pending reasonable factors remain sufficient to defer the loss status.
 ﻿
 9 – Loss- Continuance as a bankable asset is not warranted. However, this does not preclude future attempts of recovery.
 ﻿
 The grades are determined through the uses of a qualitative matrix taking into account various characteristics of the loan such as quality of management, principals’/guarantors’ character, balance sheet strength, collateral quality, cash flow coverage, position within the industry, loan structure and documentation.
 ﻿
 Allowances for Loan Losses.  A provision for loan losses is charged to operations based on management’s evaluation of the losses that may be incurred in our loan portfolio. In addition, our determination of the amount of the allowance for loan losses is subject to review by the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance and the FDIC, as part of their examination process. After a review of the information available, our regulators might require the establishment of an additional allowance. Any increase in the loan loss allowance required by regulators would have a negative impact on our earnings. Management reviews the adequacy of the allowance on at least a quarterly basis to ensure that the provision for loan losses has been charged against earnings in an amount necessary to maintain the allowance at a level that is adequate based on management’s assessment of probable estimated losses. The Bank’s methodology for assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses consists of several key elements. These elements include a general allocated allowance for non-impaired loans, a specific allowance for impaired loans, and an unallocated portion.
 ﻿
 The Bank consistently applies the following comprehensive methodology.  During the quarterly review of the allowance for loan losses, the Bank considers a variety of factors that include:
 ﻿

· | Lending Policies and Procedures
--+--------------------------------


· | Personnel responsible for the particular portfolio - relative to experience and ability of staff
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Trend for past due, criticized and classified loans
--+----------------------------------------------------


· | Relevant economic factors
--+--------------------------


· | Quality of the loan review system
--+----------------------------------


· | Value of collateral for collateral dependent loans
--+---------------------------------------------------


· | The effect of any concentrations of credit and the changes in the level of such concentrations
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Other external factors
--+-----------------------

  ﻿
 The methodology includes the segregation of the loan portfolio into two divisions of performing loans and loans determined to be impaired. Loans which are performing are evaluated homogeneously by loan class or loan type. The allowance for performing loans is evaluated based on historical loan loss experience with an adjustment for qualitative factors due to economic conditions in the market. Impaired loans can be loans which are more than 90 days delinquent, troubled debt restructured, part of our special residential program, in the process of foreclosure, or a forced bankruptcy plan. These loans are individually evaluated for loan loss either by current appraisal, or net present value. Management reviews the overall estimate for feasibility and bases the loan loss provision accordingly. As of December 31, 2018, non-accrual loans differed from the amount of total loans past due greater than 90 days due to troubled debt restructurings of loans which are maintained on non-accrual status for a minimum of six months until the borrower has demonstrated their ability to satisfy the terms of the restructured loan. The Bank also maintains an unallocated allowance.  The unallocated allowance is used to cover any factors or conditions which may cause a potential loan loss but are not specifically identifiable.  It is prudent to maintain an unallocated portion of the allowance because no matter how detailed an analysis of potential loan losses is performed, these estimates lack some element of precision.  Management must make estimates using assumptions and information that is often subjective and subject to change.

 There were $26.6 million of troubled debt restructured loans at December 31, 2018, of which $22.5 million were classified as accruing and $4.1 million were classified as non-accrual.
 ﻿
 For the year ended December 31, 2018, gross interest income which would have been recorded had our non-accruing loans been current in accordance with their original terms amounted to $1.0 million. We received and recorded $1.1 million in interest income for loans which were returned to accruing status during the for the year ended December 31, 2018.
 ﻿
 Non-accrual loans in the preceding table do not include loans acquired with deteriorated credit, which were recorded at fair value at acquisition and totaled $7.0 million at December 31, 2018 and $0 at December 31, 2017.

  Investment Activities
 ﻿
 Investment Securities. We are required under federal regulations to maintain a minimum amount of liquid assets that may be invested in specified short-term securities and certain other investments. The level of liquid assets varies depending upon several factors, including: (i) the yields on investment alternatives, (ii) our judgment as to the attractiveness of the yields then available in relation to other opportunities, (iii) expectation of future yield levels, and (iv) our projections as to the short-term demand for funds to be used in loan origination and other activities. Investment securities, including mortgage-backed securities, are classified at the time of purchase, based upon management’s intentions and abilities, as securities held-to-maturity or securities available for sale. Debt securities acquired with the intent and ability to hold to maturity may be classified as held-to-maturity and stated at cost and adjusted for amortization of premium and accretion of discount, which are computed using the level yield method and recognized as adjustments of interest income. All other debt and equity securities are classified as available for sale to serve principally as a source of liquidity.
 ﻿
 As of December 31, 2018, there were no securities classified as held-to-maturity. We had $119.3 million in securities classified as available for sale, and no securities classified as trading. Securities classified as available for sale were reported for financial reporting purposes at the fair value with net changes in the fair value from period to period included as a separate component of stockholders’ equity, net of income taxes. Changes in the fair value of securities classified as held-to-maturity or available for sale do not affect our income, unless we determine there to be an other-than-temporary impairment for those securities in an unrealized loss position. As of December 31, 2018, management concluded that all unrealized losses were temporary in nature since they were related to interest rate fluctuations rather than any underlying credit quality of the issuers. Additionally, the Bank has no plans to sell these securities and has concluded that it is unlikely it would have to sell these securities prior to the anticipated recovery of the unrealized losses.
 ﻿
 As of December 31, 2018, our investment policy allowed investments in instruments such as: (i) U.S. Treasury obligations; (ii) U.S. federal agency or federally sponsored enterprise obligations; (iii) mortgage-backed securities; (iv) municipal obligations, (v) equity securities (preferred stock); and (vi) certificates of deposit. The Board of Directors may authorize additional investments.
 ﻿
 As a source of liquidity and to supplement our lending activities, we have invested in residential mortgage-backed securities. Mortgage-backed securities generally yield less than the loans that underlie such securities because of the cost of payment guarantees or credit enhancements that reduce credit risk. Mortgage-backed securities can serve as collateral for borrowings and, through repayments, as a source of liquidity. Mortgage-backed securities represent a participation interest in a pool of single-family or other type of mortgages. Principal and interest payments are passed from the mortgage originators, through intermediaries (generally government-sponsored enterprises) that pool and repackage the participation interests in the form of securities, to investors, like us. The government-sponsored enterprises guarantee the payment of principal and interest to investors and include Freddie Mac, Ginnie Mae, and Fannie Mae.
 ﻿
 Mortgage-backed securities typically are issued with stated principal amounts. The securities are backed by pools of mortgage loans that have interest rates that are within a set range and have varying maturities. The underlying pool of mortgages can be composed of either fixed rate or adjustable rate mortgage loans.  Mortgage-backed securities are generally referred to as mortgage participation certificates or pass-through certificates. The interest rate risk characteristics of the underlying pool of mortgages (i.e., fixed rate or adjustable rate) and the prepayment risk, are passed on to the certificate holder. The life of a mortgage-backed pass-through security is equal to the life of the underlying mortgages. Expected maturities will differ from contractual maturities due to scheduled repayments and because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without prepayment penalties.

  Sources of Funds
 ﻿
 Our major external source of funds for lending and other investment purposes are deposits. Funds are also derived from the receipt of payments on loans, prepayment of loans, maturities of investment securities and mortgage-backed securities and borrowings. Scheduled loan principal repayments are a relatively stable source of funds, while deposit inflows and outflows and loan prepayments are significantly influenced by general interest rates and market conditions.
 ﻿
 Deposits.  Consumer and commercial deposits are attracted principally from within our primary market area through the offering of a selection of deposit instruments including demand, NOW, savings and club accounts, money market accounts, and term certificate accounts. Deposit account terms vary according to the minimum balance required, the time period the funds must remain on deposit, and the interest rate.
 ﻿
 The interest rates paid by us on deposits are set at the direction of our senior management. Interest rates are determined based on our liquidity requirements, interest rates paid by our competitors, our growth goals, and applicable regulatory restrictions and requirements. As of December 31, 2018 we had $248.0 million in brokered deposits, of which $72.8 million are reciprocal and are not considered brokered deposits under recent regulatory reform.

 Borrowings. The Overnight Advance Program permits the Bank to borrow overnight up to its maximum borrowing capacity at the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York (“FHLB”). At December 31, 2018, the Bank’s total credit exposure cannot exceed 50% of its total assets, or $1.337 billion, based on the borrowing limitations outlined in the FHLB member products guide. The total credit exposure limit to 50% of total assets is recalculated each quarter. Additionally, at December 31, 2018 we had a floating rate junior subordinated debenture of $4.1 million which has been callable at the Bank’s option since June 17, 2009, and quarterly thereafter, and a fixed-to-floating rate 10-year subordinated debenture of $33.5 million.    ﻿

 Employees
 ﻿
 At December 31, 2018, we had 365 full-time equivalent employees. None of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining group. We believe that our relationship with our employees is good.
 ﻿
 Subsidiaries
 ﻿
 We have five non-bank subsidiaries. BCB Holding Company Investment Corp. was established in 2004 for the purpose of holding and investing in securities. Only securities authorized to be purchased by BCB Community Bank are held by BCB Holding Company Investment Corp. At December 31, 2018, this company held $127.0 million in securities. With the merger with Pamrapo Bancorp. Inc., we acquired Pamrapo Service Corporation which has been inactive since May 2010. BCB New York Management, Inc. was established in October 2012 for the purpose of holding and investing in various loan products and investing in securities. For the year ended December 31, 2018, there was no activity related to this subsidiary. As a part of the merger with IA Bancorp, the Company acquired Special Asset REO 1, LLC and Special Asset REO 2, LLC, both of which were inactive at December 31, 2018.
 ﻿
 Supervision and Regulation
 ﻿
 Bank holding companies and banks are extensively regulated under both federal and state law. These laws and regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors and the deposit insurance funds, rather than to protect shareholders and creditors. The description below is limited to certain material aspects of the statutes and regulations addressed, and is not intended to be a complete description of such statutes and regulations and their effects on the Company or the Bank.
 ﻿
 Set forth below is a summary of certain material regulatory requirements applicable to the Company and the Bank. These and any other changes in applicable laws or regulations, whether by Congress or regulatory agencies, may have a material effect on the business and prospects of the Company and the Bank.
 ﻿
 The Dodd-Frank Act
 ﻿
 The Dodd-Frank Act significantly changed bank regulation and has affected the lending, investment, trading and operating activities of depository institutions and their holding companies. The Dodd-Frank Act also created a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau with extensive powers to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has broad rule-making authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks and savings institutions, including the authority to prohibit “unfair, deceptive or abusive” acts and practices. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau also has examination and enforcement authority over all banks and savings institutions with more than $10 billion in assets. Banks and savings institutions with $10 billion or less in assets, such as the Bank, will continue to be examined by their applicable federal bank regulators. The Dodd-Frank Act required the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to issue regulations requiring lenders to make a reasonable good faith determination as to a prospective borrower’s ability to repay a residential mortgage loan. The final “Ability to Repay” rules, which were effective beginning January 2014, established a “qualified mortgage” safe harbor for loans whose terms and features are deemed to make the loan less risky. In addition, on October 3, 2015, the new TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure (TRID) rules for mortgage closings took effect for new loan applications.  
 ﻿
 The Dodd-Frank Act broadened the base for FDIC assessments for deposit insurance and permanently increased the maximum amount of deposit insurance to $250,000 per depositor. The legislation also, among other things, requires originators of certain securitized loans to retain a portion of the credit risk, stipulates regulatory rate-setting for certain debit card interchange fees, repealed restrictions on the payment of interest on commercial demand deposits and contains a number of reforms related to mortgage originations. The Dodd-Frank Act increased the ability of stockholders to influence boards of directors by requiring companies to give stockholders a non-binding vote on executive compensation and so-called “golden parachute” payments. The legislation also directed the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the "Federal Reserve Board") to promulgate rules prohibiting excessive compensation paid to company executives, regardless of whether the company is publicly traded or not. The Dodd-Frank Act also gave state attorneys general the ability to enforce applicable federal consumer protection laws.
 ﻿
 On May 24, 2018, The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act of 2018 (the “Regulatory Relief Act”) was enacted, which repeals or modifies certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and eases regulations on all but the largest banks. The Regulatory Relief Act’s provisions include, among other things: (i) exempting banks with less than $10 billion in assets from the ability-to-repay requirements for certain qualified residential mortgage loans held in portfolio; (ii) not requiring appraisals for certain transactions valued at less than $400,000 in rural areas; (iii) exempting banks that originate fewer than 500 open-end and 500 closed-end mortgages from HMDA’s expanded data disclosures; (iv) clarifying that, subject to various conditions, reciprocal deposits of another depository institution obtained using a deposit broker through a deposit placement network for purposes of obtaining maximum deposit insurance would not be considered brokered deposits subject to the FDIC’s brokered-deposit regulations; (v) raising eligibility for the 18-month exam cycle from $1 billion to banks with $3 billion in assets; and (vi) simplifying capital calculations by requiring regulators to establish for institutions under $10 billion in assets a community bank leverage ratio (tangible equity to average consolidated assets) at a percentage not less than 8% and not greater than 10% that such institutions may elect to replace the general applicable risk-based capital requirements for determining well-capitalized status.  In addition, the FRB raised the asset threshold under its Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement from $1 billion to $3 billion for bank or savings and loan holding companies that are exempt from consolidated capital requirements, provided that such companies meet certain other conditions such as not engaging in significant nonbanking activities.  
 ﻿
 Bank Holding Company Regulation
 ﻿
 As a bank holding company registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, the Company is subject to the regulation and supervision applicable to bank holding companies by the Federal Reserve Board. The Company is also subject to the provisions of the New Jersey Banking Act of 1948 (the “New Jersey Banking Act”) and the regulations of the Commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance (“Commissioner”). The Company is required to file reports with the Federal Reserve Board and the Commissioner regarding its business operations and those of its subsidiaries.
 ﻿
 Federal Regulation. The Company is required to obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board to acquire all, or substantially all, of the assets of any bank or bank holding company. Prior Federal Reserve Board approval would be required for the Company to acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting securities of any bank or bank holding company if it would, directly or indirectly, own or control more than 5% of any class of voting shares of the bank or bank holding company. 
 ﻿
 A bank holding company is generally prohibited from engaging in, or acquiring, direct or indirect control of more than 5% of the voting securities of any company engaged in non-banking activities. One of the principal exceptions to this prohibition is for activities found by the Federal Reserve Board to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. Some of the principal activities that the Federal Reserve Board has determined by regulation to be closely related to banking are: (i) making or servicing loans; (ii) performing certain data processing services; (iii) providing securities brokerage services; (iv) acting as fiduciary, investment or financial advisor; (v) leasing personal or real property under certain conditions; (vi) making investments in corporations or projects designed primarily to promote community welfare; and (vii) acquiring a savings association. 
 ﻿
 The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 authorizes a bank holding company that meets specified conditions, including depository institutions subsidiaries that are “well capitalized” and “well managed,” to opt to become a “financial holding company.” A “financial holding company” may engage in a broader array of financial activities than permitted a typical bank holding company. Such activities can include insurance underwriting and investment banking. The Company has not elected “financial holding company” status.
 ﻿
 A bank holding company is generally required to give the Federal Reserve Board prior written notice of any purchase or redemption of then outstanding equity securities if the gross consideration for the purchase or redemption, when combined with the net consideration paid for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding 12 months, is equal to 10% or more of the company’s consolidated net worth. The Federal Reserve Board may disapprove such a purchase or redemption if it determines that the proposal would constitute an unsafe and unsound practice, or would violate any law, regulation, Federal Reserve Board order or directive, or any condition imposed by, or written agreement with, the Federal Reserve Board. The Federal Reserve Board has adopted an exception to that approval requirement for well-capitalized bank holding companies that meet certain other conditions.
 ﻿
 The Federal Reserve Board has issued a policy statement regarding the payment of dividends by bank holding companies. In general, the Federal Reserve Board’s policies provide that dividends should be paid only out of current earnings and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention by the bank holding company appears consistent with the organization’s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. The Federal Reserve Board’s policies also require that a bank holding company serve as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary banks by using available resources to provide capital funds during periods of financial stress or adversity and by maintaining the financial flexibility and capital-raising capacity to obtain additional resources for assisting its subsidiary banks where necessary. The Dodd-Frank Act codified the source of strength policy and requires the promulgation of implementing regulations. Under the prompt corrective action laws, the ability of a bank holding company to pay dividends may be restricted if a subsidiary bank becomes undercapitalized. These regulatory policies could affect the ability of the Company to pay dividends or otherwise engage in capital distributions. 
 ﻿
 The Company's status as a registered bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act will not exempt it from certain federal and state laws and regulations applicable to corporations generally, including, without limitation, certain provisions of the federal securities laws.
 ﻿
 New Jersey Regulation. Under the New Jersey Banking Act, a company owning or controlling a bank is regulated as a bank holding company and must file certain reports with the Commissioner and is subject to examination by the Commissioner. Under the New Jersey Banking Act, as well as Federal law, no person may acquire control of the Company or the Bank without first obtaining approval of such acquisition of control from the Federal Reserve and the Commissioner. 
 ﻿
 Bank Regulation
 ﻿
 As a New Jersey-chartered commercial bank, the Bank is subject to the regulation, supervision, and examination of the Commissioner. As a state-chartered Bank, the Bank is subject to the regulation, supervision and examination of the FDIC as its primary federal regulator. The regulations of the FDIC and the Commissioner impact virtually all of our activities, including the minimum level of capital we must maintain, our ability to pay dividends, our ability to expand through new branches or acquisitions and various other matters.
 ﻿
 Capital Requirements.  Federal regulations require FDIC-insured depository institutions to meet several minimum capital standards: a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 6.0%, a total capital to risk-based assets of 8%, and a 4% Tier l capital to total assets leverage ratio. The existing capital requirements were effective January 1, 2015 and are the result of a final rule implementing regulatory amendments based on recommendations of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act.
 ﻿
 In addition to establishing the minimum regulatory capital requirements, the regulations limit capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments to management if the institution does not hold a “capital conservation buffer” consisting of 2.5% of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted asset above the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements. The capital conservation buffer requirement was phased in beginning January 1, 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and increasing each year and now fully implemented at 2.5% on January 1, 2019.
 ﻿
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, pursuant to the Regulatory Relief Act, the FDIC proposed a rule that establishes a community bank leverage ratio (tangible equity to average consolidated assets) at 9% for institutions under $10 billion in assets that such institutions may elect to utilize in lieu of the general applicable risk-based capital requirements under Basel III.  Such institutions that meet the community bank leverage ratio and certain other qualifying criteria will automatically be deemed to be well-capitalized.  Until the FDIC’s proposed rule is finalized, the Basel III risk-based and leverage ratios remain in effect.  
 ﻿
 Standards for Safety and Soundness. As required by statute, the federal banking agencies adopted final regulations and Interagency Guidelines Establishing Standards for Safety and Soundness to implement safety and soundness standards. The guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards that the federal banking agencies use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired. The guidelines address internal controls and information systems, internal audit system, credit underwriting, loan documentation, interest rate exposure, asset growth, asset quality, earnings, compensation, fees and benefits and, more recently, safeguarding customer information. If the appropriate federal banking agency determines that an institution fails to meet any standard prescribed by the guidelines, the agency may require the institution to submit to the agency an acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the standard. 
 ﻿
 Business and Investment Activities.  Under federal law, all state-chartered FDIC-insured banks have been limited in their activities as principal and in their equity investments to the type and the amount authorized for national banks, notwithstanding state law. Federal law permits exceptions to these limitations. For example, certain state-chartered banks may, with FDIC approval, continue to exercise state authority to invest in common or preferred stocks listed on a national securities exchange and in the shares of an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. The maximum permissible investment is the lesser of 100.0% of Tier 1 capital or the maximum amount permitted by New Jersey law.    ﻿
 The FDIC is also authorized to permit state banks to engage in state authorized activities or investments not permissible for national banks (other than non-subsidiary equity investments) if they meet all applicable capital requirements and it is determined that such activities or investments do not pose a significant risk to the FDIC insurance fund. The FDIC has adopted regulations governing the procedures for institutions seeking approval to engage in such activities or investments. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 specified that a state bank may control a subsidiary that engages in activities as principal that would only be permitted for a national bank to conduct in a “financial subsidiary,” if a bank meets specified conditions and deducts its investment in the subsidiary for regulatory capital purposes. 
     Prompt Corrective Regulatory Action. Federal law requires, among other things, that federal bank regulatory authorities take “prompt corrective action” with respect to banks that do not meet minimum capital requirements. For these purposes, the law establishes five capital categories: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized. 
 ﻿
 The applicable FDIC regulations were amended to incorporate the previously mentioned increased regulatory capital standards that were effective January 1, 2015. Under the amended regulations, an institution is deemed to be “well capitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, a leverage ratio of 5.0% or greater and a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 6.5% or greater. An institution is “adequately capitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0% or greater, a leverage ratio of 4.0% or greater and a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 4.5% or greater. An institution is “undercapitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 8.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a leverage ratio of less than 4.0% or a common equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 4.5%. An institution is deemed to be “significantly undercapitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.0%, a leverage ratio of less than 3.0% or a common equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 3.0%. An institution is considered to be “critically undercapitalized” if it has a ratio of tangible equity (as defined in the regulations) to total assets that is equal to or less than 2.0%.
 ﻿
 As noted above, the Regulatory Relief Act has eliminated the Basel III requirements for banks with less than $10.0 billion in assets who elect to follow the community bank leverage ratio once the FDIC’s rule is finalized. The FDIC’s proposed rule provides that the Bank will be well-capitalized with a community bank leverage ratio of 9% or greater, adequately capitalized with a community bank leverage ratio of 7.5% or greater, undercapitalized if the Bank’s community bank leverage ratio is less than 7.5% and greater than 6% and significantly undercapitalized if the Bank’s community bank leverage ratio is less than 6%. The definition of critically undercapitalized is unchanged from the current regulations.
 ﻿
 “Undercapitalized” banks must adhere to growth, capital distribution (including dividend) and other limitations and are required to submit a capital restoration plan. A bank’s compliance with such a plan must be guaranteed by any company that controls the undercapitalized institution in an amount equal to the lesser of 5% of the institution’s total assets when deemed undercapitalized or the amount necessary to achieve the status of adequately capitalized. If an “undercapitalized” bank fails to submit an acceptable plan, it is treated as if it is “significantly undercapitalized.” “Significantly undercapitalized” banks must comply with one or more of a number of additional measures, including, but not limited to, a required sale of sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized, a requirement to reduce total assets, cessation of taking deposits from correspondent banks, the dismissal of directors or officers and restrictions on interest rates paid on deposits, compensation of executive officers and capital distributions by the parent holding company. “Critically undercapitalized” institutions are subject to additional measures including, subject to a narrow exception, the appointment of a receiver or conservator within 270 days after it obtains such status. 
 ﻿
 Enforcement. The FDIC has extensive enforcement authority over insured state banks, including the Bank. That enforcement authority includes, among other things, the ability to assess civil money penalties, issue cease and desist orders and remove directors and officers. In general, enforcement actions may be initiated in response to violations of laws and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices. The FDIC also has authority under federal law to appoint a conservator or receiver for an insured bank under certain circumstances. The FDIC is required, with certain exceptions, to appoint a receiver or conservator for an insured state non-member bank if that bank was “critically undercapitalized” on average during the calendar quarter beginning 270 days after the date on which the institution became “critically undercapitalized.”    ﻿
 Federal Insurance of Deposit Accounts.  The Dodd-Frank Act permanently increased the maximum amount of deposit insurance for banks, savings institutions and credit unions to $250,000 per depositor.     ﻿
 The Dodd-Frank Act increased the minimum target Deposit Insurance Fund ratio from 1.15% of estimated insured deposits to 1.35% of estimated insured deposits. The FDIC must seek to achieve the 1.35% ratio by September 30, 2020. Insured institutions with assets of $10 billion or more funded the increase. The FDIC indicated that the 1.35% ratio was exceeded in November, 2018. The Dodd-Frank Act eliminated the 1.5% maximum fund ratio, instead leaving it to the discretion of the FDIC and the FDIC has exercised that discretion by establishing a long-term fund ratio of 2%.
 ﻿
 Under the FDIC’s risk-based assessment system, insured institutions were assigned to one of four risk categories based on supervisory evaluations, regulatory capital levels and certain other risk factors. Rates were based on each institution’s risk category and certain specified risk adjustments. Stronger institutions paid lower rates while riskier institutions paid higher rates. Assessments were based on an institution’s average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity, with the assessment rate schedule ranging from 2.5 to 45 basis points.
 ﻿
 Effective July 1, 2016, the FDIC adopted changes that eliminated the risk categories. Assessments for most institutions are now based on financial measures and supervisory ratings derived from statistical modeling estimating the probability of failure within three years. In conjunction with the Deposit Insurance Fund reserve ratio achieving 1.5% the assessment range (inclusive of possible adjustments) was reduced for most banks and savings associations from 150 basis points to 30 basis points.
 ﻿
 In addition to the FDIC assessments, the Financing Corporation (“FICO”) is authorized to impose and collect, with the approval of the FDIC, assessments for anticipated payments, issuance costs and custodial fees on bonds issued by the FICO in the 1980s to recapitalize the former Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation. The bonds issued by the FICO began to mature in 2017 and will continue to mature through 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2018, BCB Community Bank paid a FICO premium of approximately $59,000 and expects to pay a similar amount in 2019.
 ﻿
 The FDIC has authority to increase insurance assessments. Any significant increases would have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and results of operations of the Bank. Management cannot predict what assessment rates will be in the future.
 ﻿
 Insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that an institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC. We do not currently know of any practice, condition or violation that may lead to termination of our deposit insurance.  
 ﻿
 Community Reinvestment Act. Under the Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”), a bank has a continuing and affirmative obligation, consistent with its safe and sound operation, to help meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low and moderate income neighborhoods. The CRA does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions nor does it limit an institution’s discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community. The CRA does require the FDIC, in connection with its examination of a bank, to assess the institution’s record of meeting the credit needs of its community and to take such record into account in its evaluation of certain applications by such institution, including applications to establish or acquire branches and merger with other depository institutions. The CRA requires the FDIC to provide a written evaluation of an institution’s CRA performance utilizing a four-tiered descriptive rating system. BCB Community Bank’s latest FDIC CRA rating, dated June 30, 2018 was “satisfactory.”
 ﻿
 Transactions with Affiliates. Transactions between banks and their related parties or affiliates are limited by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act. An affiliate of a bank is any company or entity that controls, is controlled by or is under common control with the bank. In a holding company context, the parent bank holding company and any companies which are controlled by such parent holding company are affiliates of the bank. Generally, Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation W (i) limit the extent to which the bank or its subsidiaries may engage in “covered transactions” with any one affiliate to an amount equal to 10.0% of such institution’s capital stock and surplus, and contain an aggregate limit on all such transactions with all affiliates to an amount equal to 20.0% of such institution’s capital stock and surplus and (ii) require that all such transactions be on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable, to the institution or subsidiary as those provided to non-affiliates. The term “covered transaction” includes the making of loans, purchase of assets, issuance of a guarantee and other similar transactions. In addition, loans or other extensions of credit by the financial institution to the affiliate are required to be collateralized in accordance with the requirements set forth in Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 generally prohibits loans by a company to its executive officers and directors. However, the law contains a specific exception for loans by a depository institution to its executive officers and directors in compliance with federal banking laws assuming such loans are also permitted under the law of the institution’s chartering state. Under such laws, the Bank’s authority to extend credit to executive officers, directors and 10% shareholders (“insiders”), as well as entities such person’s control, is limited. The law limits both the individual and aggregate amount of loans the Bank may make to insiders based, in part, on the Bank’s capital position and requires certain board approval procedures to be followed. Such loans are required to be made on terms substantially the same as those offered to unaffiliated individuals and not involve more than the normal risk of repayment. There is an exception for loans made pursuant to a benefit or compensation program that is widely available to all employees of the institution and does not give preference to insiders over other employees. Loans to executive officers are further limited by specific categories.
 ﻿
 Dividends. The Bank may pay dividends as declared from time to time by the Board of Directors out of funds legally available, subject to certain restrictions. Under the New Jersey Banking Act of 1948, as amended, the Bank may not pay a cash dividend unless, following the payment, the Bank’s capital stock will be unimpaired and the Bank will have a surplus of no less than 50% of the Bank capital stock or, if not, the payment of the dividend will not reduce the surplus. In addition, the Bank cannot pay dividends in amounts that would reduce the Bank’s capital below regulatory imposed minimums.
