Item 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

 
Technical Communications Corporation was organized in 1961 as a Massachusetts corporation to engage primarily in consulting activities. Since the late 1960s, the business has consisted entirely of the design, development, manufacture, distribution, marketing and sale of communications security devices, systems and services. The secure communications solutions provided by TCC protect vital information transmitted over a wide range of data, video, fax and voice networks. TCC’s products have been sold into a significant number of countries to governments, military agencies, telecommunications carriers, financial institutions and multinational corporations. The Company’s business consists of one industry segment, which is the design, development, manufacture, distribution, marketing and sale of communications security devices, systems and services.
 
Overview
 
The Government Systems product line has traditionally been the Company’s core product base and typically generates the majority of the Company’s revenue. Fiscal 2018 was unusual in that only 6% of the Company’s revenue was generated by our Government Systems product line; 85% of the Company’s revenue during fiscal year 2018 was generated by our engineering services. Although we expect engineering services to remain strong, we also expect that revenue of our Government Systems products will constitute the majority of our revenue in the future. These products, such as the internet protocol data encryption systems and the DSP 9000/HSE 6000 radio encryption system, have proven to be highly durable, and have led to significant repeat business from our government customers. The Company believes that these products and their derivatives will continue to be the Company’s most significant source of near-term future revenues.
 
The Company’s products consist of sophisticated electronic devices that enable users to transmit information in an encrypted format and permit recipients to reconstitute the information in a deciphered format if the recipient possesses the right decryption “key”. The Company’s products can be used to protect confidentiality in communications between radios, landline telephones, mobile phones, facsimile machines and data network equipment over wires, fiber optic cables, radio waves, and microwave and satellite links. The principal markets for the Company’s products are foreign and domestic governmental entities, law enforcement and military agencies, telecommunications carriers, financial institutions, and multinational companies requiring protection of mission-critical information.
 
TCC historically and presently designs and develops its own equipment and software to meet the requirements of general secure communications applications, as well as the custom-tailored requirements of specific users. A customer may order equipment that is specially programmed to encrypt transmissions in accordance with a code to which only the customer has access. Management believes the coordinated development of cryptographic software and associated hardware allows TCC to provide high-strength encryption security products with efficient processing and transmission. Both criteria, the Company believes, are essential to customer satisfaction.
 
TCC manufactures most of its products using third-party vendors for the supply of components and selected processing. Final assembly, software loading, testing and quality assurance are performed by TCC at its factory. This manufacturing approach allows TCC to competitively procure the components from multiple suppliers while maintaining control of the manufacture and performance of the final product.

TCC’s products are sold worldwide through a variety of channels depending on the country and the customer. Generally, TCC does not use stocking distributors because the Company’s products are required to be sold under an applicable U.S. government license, which generally requires end-user information. Rather, the Company sells directly to customers, original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) and value-added resellers using its in-house sales force as well as domestic and international representatives, consultants and distributors. The marketing and selling approach varies with each country and often involves extensive test and demonstration activity prior to the consummation of a sale. TCC has a network of in-country representatives and consultants who conduct performance demonstrations, market the products and close the sale, and who handle on behalf of TCC many of the ancillary requirements pertaining to importation duties, taxes, registration fees, and product receipt and acceptance. After-sale, in-country support by the representatives maintains customer satisfaction and provides a liaison for the Company’s customer support services.
 
Providing secure communications systems and services for government and military markets worldwide remains a principal focus for TCC, as the Company believes continued concerns over security will sustain demand for increased protection of both voice and data networks. Our focus in the government market also now includes law enforcement special operations customers. Additionally, we see increased interest for secure communications in the corporate industrial sector. The Company is pursuing selected, evolutionary upgrades and product derivatives of our government/military products both to provide entry into these markets and meet new requirements of our existing customers.
 
2018 Highlights and Recent Events
 
The Company reduced its loss in fiscal year 2018 by $434,000. Revenues for fiscal 2018 were $3,685,000, with a net loss of $1,480,000 or $0.80 per share, consisting of $449,000 in product revenue and $3,236,000 from revenue of our engineering services. While expected major domestic and international contracts did not materialize during the fiscal year due to long government procurement cycles, the Company did complete delivery of several foreign and domestic contracts for its DSP 9000/HSE 6000 radio encryption products. It also provided significant engineering services under both contracts received in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 and an additional contract received in fiscal 2018. TCC had backlog at the end of fiscal 2018 of $2,118,000 and deferred revenue of $2,107,000, as compared to $1,975,000 and $484,000 of backlog and deferred revenue, respectively, at the end of fiscal 2017.
 
Offering high-end custom cryptographic services and solutions is an established market niche for the Company and we believe an important competitive differentiator. In fiscal 2018, custom TCC equipment and services continued to provide recurring revenue opportunities within the Company’s established government systems product line; such equipment sales consisted primarily of the DSP 9000/HSE 6000 radio encryption and digital encryption CX72XX products, along with custom solution engineering services. The Company also has several significant opportunities it is pursuing for foreign government custom network security systems, which work began in fiscal 2018 and will continue during our 2019 fiscal year.
 
The market for high-end communications security systems is competitive and subject to long government procurement cycles, unpredictable order fulfillment lead times and fluctuating market conditions. While TCC has a pipeline of potential contracts and initiatives in development, the timing and outcome of these potential contracts is unknown. As such, in fiscal 2018, TCC continued to closely monitor and reduce operating expenses as appropriate, while strategically investing in business development efforts.
 
Technical work continued to focus on three principal areas: development of solutions that meet the needs of OEMs; product enhancements that include expanded features, planned capability and applications growth; and custom solutions that tailor our products and services to meet the unique needs of our customers. Going forward, the Company expects to continue focusing technical efforts in these areas while also increasing our systems design and integration capabilities and services offering portfolio. The following are highlights of our product development efforts in fiscal 2018:
 

• | Continuation of the development of the next generation IP encryptors, the Cipher X 7220 and 7210;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Completion of the development of the aircraft-compatible HSE 6000 radio encryption product variants;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Continuation of advanced algorithm development for voice applications; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Provision of custom engineering services.
--+------------------------------------------

 
Escalating and continued turmoil around the world presents both significant opportunities and challenges for TCC. The threat of terrorism and political unrest increase the demand for security products that provide both strategic and tactical benefits, and are readily available. At the same time, political disruptions can cause unpredictable and erratic delays in the processing of procurements, delivery of products and receipt of payments. The combined effects challenge both our sales capture teams and our production capabilities. The Company believes these market conditions will provide opportunities to build a successful future through its efforts to enlarge and enhance its product line and expand its customer base by both identifying new customers for existing and new products and offering such products to current customers.
 
Products and Services
 
Described below is TCC’s portfolio of communications security solutions for mission-critical voice, data and video networks for military, government and corporate/industrial applications.
 
The Government Systems product line has traditionally been the Company’s core product base and typically generates the majority of the Company’s revenue. Fiscal 2018 was unusual in that only 9% of the Company’s revenue was generated by our Government Systems product line; 85% of the Company’s revenue during fiscal year 2018 was generated by our engineering services. Although we expect engineering services to remain strong, we also expect that revenue of our Government Systems products will constitute the majority of our revenue in the future. These products, such as our internet protocol data encryption systems and DSP 9000/HSE 6000 radio encryption system, have proven to be highly durable, and have led to significant repeat business from our government customers. The Company believes that these products and their derivatives will continue to be the Company’s most significant source of near-term future revenues.
 
With the availability of our next-generation IP encryptors and the ability to integrate customer-specific national algorithms, the Company believes that its Network Security Systems are competitive for a growing niche of mission-critical government and industrial/corporate network applications worldwide. TCC expects that future derivatives of its IP encryptor and KEYNET IP Manager system will expand the market opportunity for these products.
 
The Company’s Secure Office Systems product line had primarily consisted of products that were originally acquired through an asset and rights purchase from a subsidiary of AT&T in 1995. These products are no longer being marketed. While one of these products, the CSD 4100 secure executive telephone, is still available and remains profitable, demand for it has diminished in recent years. We will continue to offer this product from existing inventory, which we anticipate will be sufficient for several more years. Remaining available is the CSD 3324 SE, our encrypted office telephone that offers secure voice, fax and radio communications. TCC also continues to offer CipherTalk® secure mobile phone communication solutions. The Cipher Talk 8500, a secure mobile IP-based phone that targets the high-end secure wireless mobile phone market, is competitive but product demand has not developed as expected. We will continue to market this product with reduced expectations.
 
The Company also provides customized tools, products and training upon a customer’s request, as well as design solutions for OEM requirements. In addition, the Company actively sells its engineering services in support of funded research and system development. These services are typically billed to a customer on a time and materials basis and can run for several months to several years depending on the scope of the project. As noted above, fiscal year 2018 was a significant year for engineering services sales and we expect demand for such services to remain strong in the future.
 
Government Systems
 
The Company’s DSP 9000 and HSE 6000 secure radio product lines offer strategic-level security for voice and data communications sent over HF, VHF and UHF channels. Designed for military environments, the Company believes these products provide high voice quality over poor line connections, making them an attractive security solution for military aircraft, naval, base station and man-pack radio applications. These products provide automated key distribution for security and ease of use. They are also radio independent because software programmable interfaces allow radio interface levels to be changed without configuring the hardware. Base station, handset and embedded board configurations are available options. All versions interoperate with TCC’s HSE 6000 Squad Radio Headset and Telephone Encryptor for cross-network secure voice conferencing. The DSP 9000 base station model also interoperates with the Company’s CSD 3324 SE secure telephone system to enable “office-to-field” communications.

TCC’s HSE 6000 Squad Radio Headset and Telephone Encryptor is designed for public safety special operations, land mobile radio applications, as well as military applications. With the optional telephone interconnect kit, the HSE 6000 connects to corded handset telephones for secure voice communications and radio-to-telephone conferencing over Voice over IP, digital, and analog telephone networks. It is also interoperable with the DSP 9000 radio security product family, enabling secure voice communications and cross-network conferencing across and between air, land, sea and office.
 
The Company’s CSD 3324 SE Secure Telephone, Fax and Data system provides strategic-level communications security for voice, fax and data encryption in a telephone package designed for government applications needing high reliability. The product has a fallback mode, which was originally developed for poor HF channels. As a result, secure communications are possible even over poor line conditions. TCC's high-level encryption and automated key distribution system protect sensitive information, and internal storage of 800 keys provides hands-off security.
 
The Company’s CSD 3324 SP telephone and fax system provides integrated secure voice and fax security in a telephone package designed for government and corporate applications. The CSD 3324 SPV secure telephone secures voice communications over the public switched telephone network and interoperates with the CSD 3324 SP system.
 
Government customers can also utilize the Company’s Cipher X 7211 IP encryption systems, described below, to achieve superior-grade network encryption and secure communications.
 
The Government Systems product line also includes the Company’s DSD 72A-SP Military Bulk Ciphering System, a rugged military system that provides a high level of cryptographic security for military data networks operating at up to 34 million bits per second. The product supports a wide variety of interfaces and is designed to integrate into existing networks. Due to diminished demand in recent years, this product is no longer being marketed. However, we will continue to support a large installed base of such equipment still in use with our customers, as there remains a demand for spare parts and small network upgrades. Foreign military requirements for the DSD 72A-SP are expected to transition over time to the data encryption systems product line using the Internet Protocol, described below.
 
Network Security Systems
 
TCC offers network encryption systems with centralized key and device management for IP, SONET/SDH and frame relay networks to secure data in transit from local area network to local area network and across wide area networks. TCC’s KEYNET IP Manager is designed to centrally configure and manage a network of encryption appliances for secure communications and can be used globally. During 2014, the Company introduced KEYNET Lite, a version of KEYNET for small networks.
 
The Company supports the industry standard Advanced Encryption Standard (“AES”) 256-bit cryptographic algorithm and can integrate customer-specific national algorithms to meet customer-specific needs. All of TCC’s encryption systems are designed to seamlessly overlay onto existing networks without requiring infrastructure changes. Network performance impact is negligible and we believe the systems are easy to deploy, use, monitor and manage. Additionally, the Cipher X family offers scalable performance to higher speeds without changing hardware. This minimizes the entry cost of deploying a security solution and provides a cost-effective path to meet evolving business needs. Upgrades are licensed and made available on-demand via the KEYNET management system. All performance levels interoperate and are designed to have identical functionality.
 
Cipher X 7211 IP Encryption with KEYNET IP Manager provides strategic-level secure communications for large global IP networks for point-to-point and multicast applications such as video conferencing. It offers a unique combination of flexibility, scalable 1 gigabit per second performance and KEYNET IP Manager for ease of use. The Cipher X 7211 is a hardware-based, FIPS 140-2 Level 3 designed encryption device.

Secure Office Systems
 
The CipherTalk 8500 secure mobile phone is designed to provide military-grade encrypted voice and text communications anywhere in the world over GSM and Wi-Fi networks. Introduced in fiscal 2016, the CipherTalk 8500 IP-based secure wireless phone is built on a hardened AndroidTM smartphone platform for security and ease of use. TCC also offers a server-based, network management system that provides the customer with total control of network connectivity.
 
The Company’s CSD 4100 Executive Secure Telephone offers strategic-level voice and data security in an executive telephone package. Exceptional voice quality can be achieved with three different voice-coding algorithms. The product provides ease-of-use security features such as automated key management, authentication, certification and access control. Due to diminished demand in recent years, this product is no longer being marketed but we continue to provide support to existing customers who have installed equipment bases requiring expansion or modification.
 
Services
 
The Company performs funded research and development and technology development for commercial companies and government agencies under both cost reimbursement and fixed-price contracts. Cost reimbursement contracts provide for the reimbursement of allowable costs and, in some situations, the payment of a fee. These contracts may contain incentive clauses providing for increases or decreases in the fee depending on how actual costs compare with a budget. On fixed-price contracts that are expected to exceed one year in duration, revenue is recognized pursuant to the proportional performance method based upon the proportion of actual costs incurred to the total estimated costs for the contract. The Company receives periodic progress payments.
 
TCC offers general communications security education for businesses and other users, including military and government entities, as well as product-specific training for its customers. TCC also specializes in developing and designing custom cryptographic solutions for customers’ unique secure voice, data and video communications requirements and integrating such solutions into existing systems. The Company has designed embedded secure radio encryption solutions, national algorithms for military data applications, cryptographic modules for National Secure Mode Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) systems, as well as rocket-borne telemetry encryption modules, and country-unique secure telephone and fax algorithms. In addition, TCC has partnered with network and telecom equipment providers to add security in unique applications.
 
Competition
 
The market for communications security devices and systems is highly competitive and characterized by rapid technological change. The Company has several competitors, including foreign-based companies, in the communications security device field. The Company believes its principal competitors include Crypto AG, Thales Group, Codan Limited, Motorola Solutions, Inc., General Dynamics Corporation, Omnisec AG, Certes Networks, Inc., Gemalto N.V., Harris Corporation and Communication Security Group.
 
The Company competes based on its service, the operational and technical features of its products, its customization abilities, its sales expertise, and pricing. Many of TCC’s competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, sales and marketing, distribution and other resources, greater name recognition and longer standing relationships with customers. Competitors with greater financial resources can be more aggressive in marketing campaigns, can survive sustained price reductions in order to gain market share and can devote greater resources to support existing products and develop new competing products.
 
Our competitive position also depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, obtain and maintain intellectual property protection or otherwise develop proprietary products or processes, and secure sufficient capital resources for product, research and development efforts. We believe the ability of TCC to custom-tailor cryptographic functions and systems to satisfy unique customer requirements is an important competitive differentiator, and will meet a growing demand as customers become more sophisticated in defining their communications security needs.

Net Revenue and Backlog
 
In fiscal 2018, the Company had one customer representing 87% of total net revenue. This revenue consisted primarily of our engineering services. In fiscal 2017, the Company had two customers representing 89% of total net revenue. This revenue consisted primarily of our engineering services representing 21% of net revenue and shipments of our narrowband radio encryptors to a domestic customer for deployment into Afghanistan representing 68% of net revenue.
 
The Company sells directly to customers, original equipment manufacturers and value-added resellers using its in-house sales force as well as domestic and international representatives, consultants and distributors. International sales are made primarily through our main office. We seldom have long-term contractual relationships with our customers and, therefore, generally have no assurance of a continuing relationship within a given market.
 
Orders for our products are usually placed by customers on an as-needed basis and we typically ship products within 30 to 180 days of receipt of a customer's firm purchase order. Our backlog consists of orders received where the anticipated shipping date or services to be performed are within 12 months of the order date. Because of the possibility of customer changes in delivery schedules or the cancellation of orders, our backlog as of any particular date may not be indicative of revenue in any future period. Our backlog as of September 29, 2018 and September 30, 2017 was approximately $2,118,000 and $1,975,000, respectively.
 
For certain services contracts, the Company will bill customers in accordance with the terms of the contract, but recognize revenue as the services are performed. The billings in excess of revenue are recorded as deferred revenue on the balance sheet. These deferred revenues will be recognized in future periods as we perform the services. Our deferred revenue as of September 29, 2018 and September 30, 2017 was approximately $2,107,000 and $484,000, respectively.
 
Consistent with TCC’s historical experience, the Company expects that sales to a relatively small number of customers will continue to account for a high percentage of the Company’s revenues for the foreseeable future. A reduction in orders from any such customer, or the cancellation of any significant order and failure to replace such order with orders from other customers, would have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.
 
Regulatory Matters
 
As a party to a number of contracts with the U.S. government and its agencies, the Company must comply with extensive regulations with respect to bid proposals and billing practices. Should the U.S. government or its agencies conclude that the Company has not adhered to federal regulations, any contracts to which the Company is a party could be canceled and the Company could be prohibited from bidding on or participating in future contracts. Such a prohibition would have a material adverse effect on the Company.
 
All payments to the Company for work performed on contracts with agencies of the U.S. government are subject to adjustment upon audit by the U.S. Defense Contract Audit Agency, the U.S. Government Accountability Office, and other agencies. The Company could be required to return any payments received from U.S. government agencies if it is found to have violated federal regulations. There have been no government audits in recent years and the Company believes the result of such audits, should they occur, would not have a material adverse effect on its financial position or results of operations, although we can give no assurances. In addition, U.S. government contracts may be canceled at any time by the government with limited or no notice or penalty. Contract awards are also subject to funding approval from the U.S. government, which involves political, budgetary and other considerations over which the Company has no control.
 
The Company’s security products are subject to export restrictions administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce and U.S. Department of State, which license the export of encryption products, subject to certain technical restrictions. In addition, U.S. export laws prohibit the export of encryption products to a number of hostile countries. Although to date the Company has been able to secure necessary U.S. government export licenses, there can be no assurance that the Company will continue to be able to secure such licenses in a timely manner in the future, or at all.
 
6

 
The U.S. government controls, through a licensing process, the distribution of encryption technology and the sale of encryption products. The procedure for obtaining the applicable license from either the Department of Commerce or the Department of State (depending on the U.S. government’s determination of jurisdiction) is well documented. The Company submits a license request application, which contains information pertaining to:
 

• | the type of equipment being sold;
--+----------------------------------


• | detailed technical description (if required);
--+----------------------------------------------


• | the buyer;
--+-----------


• | the end-user and use;
--+----------------------


• | quantity; and
--+--------------


• | destination location.
--+----------------------

 
The appropriate departments of the U.S. government review the application and a licensing decision is provided to the Company. Pursuant to the receipt of the license, the Company may ship the product.
 
Many of TCC’s products can be sold under existing “blanket” licenses that have been obtained through a variant of the licensing process that approves products for sale to certain classes of customers (e.g., financial institutions, civilian government entities and commercial users). The Company has obtained “blanket” licenses for its secure telephone and office system products and its family of network encryptors. Licenses for sales of certain other products and/or to certain end users must be submitted for specific approval as described above. Although the U.S. government retains the right and ability to restrict product exports, the Company does not believe that U.S. government licensing will become more restrictive or an impediment to its business. The trend has been for the U.S. government to reduce the restrictions on the foreign sale of cryptographic equipment. TCC believes this trend is driven by the government’s recognition of the technology available from foreign sources and the need to allow domestic corporations to compete in foreign markets. However, should the regulations become more restrictive, it would have a negative impact on the Company’s international business, the impact of which could be material.
 
The costs and effects of compliance by the Company with applicable environmental laws during fiscal 2018 were, and historically have been, immaterial. In 2003, the European Union adopted the “Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive 2002/95/EC”. In the event the Company’s sales to Europe increase, the Company may have to incur additional costs to provide for the disposal of its products in compliance with that directive.
 
Manufacturing
 
TCC has several manufacturing subcontractors and suppliers that provide outside processing of electronic circuit boards, fabrication of metal components, and supply of electronic components. For the majority of purchased materials and services, TCC has multiple suppliers that are able to deliver materials and services under short-term delivery purchase orders. Payment is typically made after delivery, based upon standard credit arrangements. For a small minority of parts, there are limited sources of supply. In such cases, TCC monitors source availability and usually stocks for anticipated long-term requirements to assure manufacturing continuity. Notwithstanding the Company’s efforts to maintain material supplies, shortages can and do develop, resulting in delays in production, significant engineering development effort to find alternative solutions and, if production cannot be maintained, the discontinuation of the affected product design.
 
The Company’s internal manufacturing process consists primarily of adding critical components, final assembly, system burn-in, quality control and testing. Delivery times vary depending on the products and options ordered.

Technological Expertise
 
TCC’s technological expertise and experience, including certain proprietary rights which it has developed and maintains as trade secrets, are crucial to the conduct of the Company’s business. TCC has been designing and producing secure, cryptography-based communications systems for over 50 years, during which time the Company has developed many technological techniques and practices. This expertise and experience are in the areas of cryptographic algorithm design and implementation, key distribution and management systems, cryptographic processors, voice and fax encryption, and electronic hardware design. TCC relies on its internal technical expertise and experience, which TCC considers to be proprietary. These proprietary technologies are owned by TCC, are under TCC’s control, and have been documented consistent with standard engineering practices. It is estimated that the majority of revenue during the past two years and during the next two years will be of products that are based upon TCC-proprietary designs.
 
Such technological experience and expertise are important as they enable an efficient design and development process. Loss of this experience and expertise would have an adverse impact on the Company. However, TCC’s practices governing the internal documentation of design data mitigate some of the risk associated with the loss of personnel who are skilled in the core competencies described above.
 
TCC’s existing intellectual property portfolio includes a number of registered and unregistered trademarks; while eight patents have been issued to the Company, such patents have expired. Management is of the opinion that, while patent protection was desirable with respect to certain products, none of the Company's patents are currently material to the conduct of its business and the expiration of such patents is not expected to have any significant impact.
 
TCC has an on-going technology license for communications protocol software used in the CipherONE family of Network Security System products. The license is royalty-based and runs without a specified termination date. The cost of this license is immaterial.
 
With the exception of the technology license referred to above, TCC has no material third party rights upon which the Company relies. Revenue of the products associated with this license have not been and are not anticipated to be significant to the Company’s revenues.
 
Research and Development
 
Research and development efforts are undertaken by the Company primarily on its own initiative. In order to compete successfully, the Company must improve existing products and develop new products as well as attract and retain qualified personnel. No assurances can be given that the Company will be able to hire and train such technical management and sales personnel or successfully improve and develop its products.
 
During the fiscal years ended September 29, 2018 and September 30, 2017, the Company spent $521,000 and $1,584,000, respectively, on internal product development. The Company also spent $2,028,000 and $437,000 on billable development efforts during fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively. In fiscal 2018, the Company’s total product development costs were approximately 26% higher than fiscal 2017 and reflected the costs of custom development, product capability enhancements and production readiness. It is expected that product development expenses in fiscal 2019 will be consistent with fiscal 2018 levels.
 
Technical work continued to focus on three principal areas: development of solutions that meet the needs of OEMs; product enhancements that include expanded features, planned capability and applications growth; and custom solutions that tailor our products and services to meet the unique needs of our customers. Going forward, the Company expects to continue focusing technical efforts in these areas while also increasing our systems design and integration capabilities and services offering portfolio. The following are highlights of our product development efforts in fiscal 2018:
 

• | Continuation of the development of the next generation IP encryptors, the Cipher X 7220 and 7210;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Completion of the development of the aircraft-compatible HSE 6000 radio encryption product variants;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Continuation of advanced algorithm development for voice applications; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Provision of custom engineering services.

Foreign Operations
 
The Company’s results of operations are dependent upon its foreign revenue, including domestic sales shipped to foreign end-users. Sales to foreign markets have been and will continue to be affected by, among other things, the stability of foreign governments, foreign and domestic economic conditions, export and other governmental regulations, and changes in technology. The Company attempts to minimize the financial risks normally associated with foreign sales by utilizing letters of credit confirmed by U.S. and foreign banks. Foreign sales contracts are usually denominated in U.S. dollars.
 
The Company utilizes the services of sales representatives, consultants and distributors in connection with foreign sales. Typically, representatives are paid commissions and consultants are paid fixed amounts on a stipulated schedule in return for services rendered. Distributors are granted discounted pricing.
 
The export from the United States of many of the Company’s products may require the issuance of a license by the U.S. Department of State under the Arms Export Control Act of 1976, as amended, or by the U.S. Department of Commerce under the Export Administration Act as kept in force by the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977, as amended. The licensing process is discussed in more detail under the “Regulatory Matters” section above.
 
In fiscal years 2018 and 2017, sales directly to international customers accounted for approximately 7% and 10%, respectively, of our net revenue. During fiscal 2017, a significant portion of domestic revenue (68%) was made to a domestic radio manufacturer that shipped our radio encryption products overseas for use in Afghanistan. Based on our historical results we expect that international revenue, including sales to domestic customers that ship to foreign end-users, will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future. As a result, we are subject to the risks of doing business internationally, including:
 

• | changes in regulatory requirements,
--+------------------------------------


• | domestic and foreign government policies, including requirements to expend a portion of program funds locally and governmental industrial cooperation requirements,
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | delays in placing orders,
--+--------------------------


• | fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates,
--+-------------------------------------------------


• | the complexity and necessity of using foreign representatives, consultants and distributors,
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the uncertainty of the ability of foreign customers to finance purchases,
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | uncertainties and restrictions concerning the availability of funding credit or guarantees,
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | imposition of tariffs or embargoes, export controls and other trade restrictions,
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the difficulty of managing and operating an enterprise spanning several countries,
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | compliance with a variety of foreign laws, as well as U.S. laws affecting the activities of U.S. companies abroad, and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | economic and geopolitical developments and conditions, including international hostilities, acts of terrorism and governmental reactions, inflation, trade relationships and military and political alliances.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
While these factors and their impact are difficult to predict, any one or more of these factors could adversely affect our operations in the future.
 
We also may not be successful in obtaining the necessary licenses to conduct operations abroad, and the U.S. government may prevent proposed sales to foreign governments or other end-users.
 
Employees
 
As of September 29, 2018, the Company employed 23 full-time employees and two part-time employees, as well as several consultants. The Company believes that its relationship with its employees is good.
