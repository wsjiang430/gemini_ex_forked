Overview
 
We are a late-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of novel, first-in-class pharmaceuticals to address the needs of patients with renal and vascular disease. Our product candidate, vonapanitase, is a recombinant human elastase that we are developing to improve vascular access outcomes in patients with chronic kidney disease, or CKD, undergoing or planning for hemodialysis, a lifesaving treatment that cannot be conducted without a functioning vascular access. We believe data from our completed Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials of vonapanitase support that a one-time, local application of investigational vonapanitase during surgical creation of a radiocephalic fistula for hemodialysis may improve fistula use for hemodialysis and secondary patency (time to fistula abandonment), thereby improving patient outcomes and reducing the burden on patients and the healthcare system.
 
Arteriovenous fistulas are the gold standard of vascular access for hemodialysis, given they are associated with fewer complications and reduced rates of hospitalization as compared to other forms of vascular access. We estimate there are approximately 130,000 fistulas created in the United States annually, 35-40% of which are radiocephalic fistulas. To create an arteriovenous fistula, a surgeon transects a vein and sutures it to the side of a nearby artery, typically in the arm. Radiocephalic fistulas created in the forearm are the preferred form of arteriovenous fistula because they preserve the maximum number of future sites for vascular accesses (i.e., the potential use of other vascular access sites further up in the arm) and are associated with the lowest rate of serious complications such as steal syndrome (hand ischemia).
 
However, radiocephalic fistulas suffer from a high rate of failure, typically due to insufficient blood flow, precluding hemodialysis. Recent data demonstrate that within one year of surgical creation of a radiocephalic fistula:
 

• | Up to 55% will fail to become usable for hemodialysis because the fistula either has inadequate blood flow or cannot be successfully cannulated;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Up to 40% will be abandoned (secondary patency loss); and
--+----------------------------------------------------------


• | Up to 70% will experience either a thrombosis or undergo a corrective procedure to restore or maintain blood flow (primary patency loss).
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The need to improve vascular access outcomes for patients is well established in the hemodialysis community. Achieving a usable fistula for vascular access and maintaining the patency (blood flow) of such fistula enables the hemodialysis patient to avoid use of a dialysis catheter, the worst form of vascular access because of the increased risk of serious infection, hospitalization and death. Patients with a usable fistula also avoid the need for additional surgical procedures to create new forms of vascular access. Finally, as each patient has only a limited number of vascular access sites, fistula abandonment increases the risk that the patient may exhaust all permanent access sites and be subjected to chronic use of a dialysis catheter.
 
Vascular access failure also results in substantially higher healthcare costs. It was reported that fistulas that fail to become usable resulted in incremental costs to Medicare of more than $21,000 in the first year and more than $10,000 in each of the second and third years following fistula creation. A recent study indicated that the total cost to Medicare for managing hemodialysis vascular access in patients with End Stage Renal Disease, or ESRD was more than $2.8 billion in 2013. This amount excludes costs of managing vascular access in predialysis patients and dialysis patients covered by Medicare Advantage HMOs or other non-Medicare payers, as well as patient co-pays and deductibles.
 
Because the clinical implications of fistula non-use and abandonment are severe, health care providers are aggressive in monitoring and intervening upon fistulas in an attempt to increase fistula use and reduce the rate of fistula abandonment. In less than a decade, the rate of procedures has approximately doubled. The function of usable fistulas can usually be restored via corrective procedures, either an intervention such as angioplasty, which is dilation of a blood vessel with a balloon, or a surgical revision. These procedures, however, are invasive, painful and associated with a number of complications. These procedures are also costly and often need to be repeated. Fistula patients in the United States on average require greater than 1.5 procedures per year, each of which typically costs Medicare between $5,000 and $15,000.

For a fistula to become usable for hemodialysis, it must experience substantial increases in lumen diameter and blood flow through a process known as outward vascular remodeling. The acute increase in blood flow following fistula creation stimulates a cell signaling process that leads to an upregulation of endogenous elastases in the fistula. Elastases bind to and fragment elastin fibers that in turn stimulate cellular proliferation and differentiation. These stimulated cells, known as myofibroblasts, remodel the fistula leading to increased lumen diameter and blood flow. While vonapanitase’s exact mechanism is not known, nonclinical studies have shown that vonapanitase fragments elastin fibers in the vessel wall and thus may augment endogenous elastase activity in the fistula. Nonclinical research has also demonstrated that elastin fragments stimulate myofibroblast proliferation and differentiation necessary for outward vascular remodeling and that elastin fragments may inhibit the migration of myofibroblasts to the vessel lumen that can cause intimal hyperplasia. In our fistula program, we are studying the administration of vonapanitase once at the time of fistula creation, whereby a surgeon would administer drops of vonapanitase onto the surface of the artery and vein of a fistula for 10 minutes followed by a saline irrigation. Based on clinical and nonclinical studies, we believe that a one-time, local application of investigational vonapanitase to the external surface of the vessels during fistula surgical creation may enhance outward vascular remodeling and inhibit neointimal hyperplasia, thereby reducing the risk of fistula failure.
 
PATENCY-1, the first of two multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials, evaluated the safety and efficacy of a single dose of investigational vonapanitase in patients with CKD who underwent surgical creation of a radiocephalic arteriovenous fistula for hemodialysis. We reported top-line data from the PATENCY-1 trial in December 2016. While this trial did not meet the primary endpoint of improving primary unassisted patency, we are encouraged that vonapanitase demonstrated clinically meaningful improvements in other efficacy endpoints, including:
 

• | 45% relative increase (20% absolute increase) in the proportion of patients who had a fistula that was used for hemodialysis (p=0.006);
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | 34% reduction in the risk of secondary patency loss (fistula abandonment) over 12 months (p=0.048); and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | 56% relative increase (14% absolute increase) in the proportion of patients who had a fistula that was used for hemodialysis without prior corrective procedures such as angioplasty (p=0.035).
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Reported adverse events were also comparable between the vonapanitase and placebo arms of the study. These events were consistent with the medical events experienced by patients with CKD undergoing surgical creation of a radiocephalic fistula.
 
Our ongoing Phase 3 clinical trial, PATENCY-2, is the second Phase 3 trial of investigational vonapanitase in patients with CKD undergoing surgical creation of a radiocephalic fistula for hemodialysis. After announcing top-line results from the PATENCY-1 trial in December 2016, we had discussions with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, regarding changes to the PATENCY-2 trial. Following our review of the complete data sets from the PATENCY-1 trial and discussions with the FDA, we amended the protocol for the PATENCY-2 trial. The protocol amendment reordered the endpoints for this ongoing trial, establishing fistula use for hemodialysis and secondary patency as co-primary endpoints. The protocol amendment also increased the planned enrollment for this trial from 300 to 500 patients, which we subsequently increased to 600 patients. The increased sample size for the PATENCY-2 trial provides power to detect the differences observed in the PATENCY-1 trial for fistula use for hemodialysis and secondary patency of 98% and 88%, respectively, with a p-value ≤0.05 for each of the co-primary endpoints. In connection with these changes, we received written confirmation from the FDA that, if PATENCY-2 is successful in showing statistical significance (p≤0.05) on each of the co-primary endpoints, the PATENCY-2 trial together with data from previously completed studies would provide the basis for a Biologics License Application, or BLA, submission as a single pivotal study, in which case no additional studies would need to be conducted prior to submitting the BLA. We completed enrollment in the PATENCY-2 trial in March 2018 and expect to report top-line data in late March 2019. If the PATENCY-2 trial is successful, we expect to submit a BLA to the FDA in the fourth quarter of 2019 and a Marketing Authorization Application, or MAA, to the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, in first half of 2020.
 
Vonapanitase received Breakthrough Therapy designation from the FDA in May 2017 for hemodialysis vascular access indications. The FDA awards Breakthrough Therapy designations to expedite the development and review of investigational drugs that are intended to treat serious or life-threatening conditions when preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the treatment may offer a substantial improvement over currently available therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. Vonapanitase previously received Fast Track designation from the FDA which is also designed to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drugs and biologics to treat serious conditions and address an unmet medical need. We also received orphan drug designations for vonapanitase in the United States and European Union for hemodialysis vascular access indications.
 
We believe that, if our ongoing Phase 3 clinical trial is successful and vonapanitase is approved, vonapanitase will potentially become the standard of care for patients with CKD undergoing surgical creation of a radiocephalic fistula. We retain worldwide commercial rights to vonapanitase. If approved by regulatory authorities, we intend to commercialize this product in the United States ourselves with a specialty sales force, focused primarily on vascular surgeons. We also intend to seek one or more collaborators to commercialize the product in additional markets, including Europe and China. Our patents include claims covering formulations, methods of manufacturing and use of elastases, providing protection in the United States into 2030 and European Union through 2028, with potential extension into 2033 in the United States and in the European Union.

Our Strengths 
 
We believe our company and vonapanitase possess the following attributes that increase the likelihood that we will be successful in developing and commercializing vonapanitase:
 

• | Completed enrollment in pivotal Phase 3 trial. We completed enrollment in the PATENCY-2 trial in March 2018 and expect to report top-line data in late March 2019. Previously, we made important changes to the protocol for the PATENCY-2 trial based on the results of our first Phase 3 trial, PATENCY-1. The protocol amendment for the PATENCY-2 trial reordered the existing endpoints, establishing co-primary endpoints of fistula use for hemodialysis and secondary patency (time to fistula abandonment), each of which demonstrated improvements in the PATENCY-1 trial. We also increased the planned enrollment for the PATENCY-2 trial from 300 to 600 patients. The increased sample size for the PATENCY-2 trial provides power to detect the differences observed in the PATENCY-1 trial for fistula use for hemodialysis and secondary patency of 98% and 88%, respectively, with a p-value ≤0.05 for each of the co-primary endpoints. We have also received written confirmation from the FDA that, if PATENCY-2 is successful in showing statistical significance (p≤0.05) on each of the co-primary endpoints, the PATENCY-2 trial together with data from previously completed studies would provide the basis for a BLA submission. If the PATENCY-2 trial is successful, we expect to submit a BLA to the FDA in the fourth quarter of 2019 and a MAA to the EMA in the first half of 2020.

• | Safety profile supports approval. Based on results from our clinical trials and preclinical studies, we believe investigational vonapanitase, which is administered once and only acts locally, has demonstrated a favorable safety profile. Vonapanitase is applied to the outside of blood vessels for ten minutes and then washed away, which limits the potential for any absorption into the body and systemic activity. Any vonapanitase that might enter the bloodstream would be inactivated by anti-proteases, substances in the blood that inhibit the activity of vonapanitase. In clinical trials, there were no material increases in adverse events in the vonapanitase treatment groups as compared to placebo and no material findings related to physical examinations or clinical laboratory testing including chemistry, hematology and antibodies to vonapanitase. At our end of Phase 2 meeting with the FDA in 2013, we confirmed that we do not need to conduct any additional preclinical studies to support a BLA submission.

• | Expedited programs to address unmet medical need. Vonapanitase has received Breakthrough Therapy and Fast Track designations from the FDA, which are designed to expedite the development and review of drugs and biologics to treat serious or life-threatening conditions and fill an unmet medical need. While radiocephalic fistulas are considered the preferred form of vascular access by the medical community, they are associated with high failure rates, most critically fistula non-use and abandonment. Achieving a usable fistula and maintaining patency (blood flow) enables the patient to avoid the temporary or permanent use of a dialysis catheter, the worst form of vascular access because of the increased risk of serious infection, hospitalization and death. Patients with a usable fistula also avoid the adverse effects of under-dialysis and the need for additional surgical procedures to create new fistulas. We are not aware of any products approved in the United States or Europe that would compete with vonapanitase for the improvement of fistula use for hemodialysis and secondary patency.

• | Substantial and readily-addressable market opportunity. If vonapanitase is approved, we intend to commercialize this product in the United States ourselves with a specialty sales force, focused primarily on vascular surgeons. We also intend to seek one or more collaborators to commercialize the product in markets outside of the United States, including Europe and China. In the United Sates, we estimate a sales force of approximately 75-100 representatives will enable us to call on the approximately 1,000 providers that account for more than 50% of the fistula surgical creations covered by Medicare annually. We believe vonapanitase will be supported by key stakeholders, including referring nephrologists, patient advocacy groups, large dialysis organizations and payors. We also believe that, if our ongoing Phase 3 clinical trial is successful and vonapanitase is approved, it will potentially become the standard of care for patients with CKD undergoing surgical creation of a radiocephalic fistula by increasing the use of fistulas for hemodialysis and reducing the rate of fistula abandonment and, in doing so, reduce the overall burden on patients and the healthcare system. We also believe vonapanitase will be reimbursed adequately by Medicare, Medicaid and other public and commercial payors. Costs related to fistula surgical creation, which is typically performed in the hospital outpatient setting, are not included in the ESRD bundle, the single bundled payment from Medicare for a number of the costs of hemodialysis treatments, medications, labs and supplies for patients with end-stage renal disease. Vascular access failure results in substantially higher healthcare costs. A recent study indicated that the total cost to Medicare for managing hemodialysis vascular access was more than $2.8 billion in 2013, which excludes costs of managing vascular access in predialysis patients and dialysis patients covered by Medicare Advantage HMOs or other non-Medicare payers as well as patient co-pays and deductibles. It was also reported that fistulas that fail to become usable resulted in incremental costs to Medicare of more than $21,000 in the first year and more than $10,000 in each of the second year and third years following fistula creation.

• | Experienced team. Our executive management team has extensive experience in the renal and vascular disease fields through their substantial involvement in companies such as Abbott, AMAG, GelTex, Genzyme, Glaxo and Merck. Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Medical Officer were senior executives at GelTex, a biopharmaceutical company, where they played leading roles in the development and commercialization of Renagel, a treatment for hemodialysis patients that led to Genzyme's acquisition of GelTex for more than $1 billion. Our Senior Vice President of Commercial was a senior executive at AMAG Pharmaceuticals, a biopharmaceutical company, where he played a leading role in the commercialization of Feraheme for iron-deficiency anemia in adults with CKD.

Our Strategy
 
Our strategy is to develop and commercialize vonapanitase for patients suffering from renal and vascular diseases, beginning with patients with CKD undergoing surgical creation of a radiocephalic fistula. Key elements of our strategy include our plans to:

• | Complete clinical development of vonapanitase and seek regulatory approval in the United States in its lead indication. We completed enrollment in the PATENCY-2 trial, our second Phase 3 trial for patients with CKD, in March 2018 and expect to report top-line data in late March 2019. If PATENCY-2 is successful, we expect to submit a BLA to the FDA in the fourth quarter of 2019.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Commercialize vonapanitase directly in the United States. If vonapanitase is approved by the FDA, we intend to commercialize it ourselves in the United States with a specialty sales force focused primarily on vascular surgeons. Based on various third-party sources, we estimate that approximately 130,000 arteriovenous fistulas are created annually. We believe a specialty sales force of approximately 75-100 representatives will enable us to call on the approximate 1,000 providers that account for more than 50% of the fistula surgical creations covered by Medicare in the United States annually. We believe that, if our current Phase 3 clinical trial is successful and vonapanitase is approved, it will potentially become the standard of care for patients with CKD undergoing surgical creation of a radiocephalic fistula.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Establish partnerships for the development and commercialization of vonapanitase in all or parts of Europe and other countries outside of the United States. We are currently evaluating our existing clinical program to support filing in Europe. We may, based on additional data including the data from our Phase 3 clinical trials in the United States and if sufficient funds become available, choose to undertake clinical development of vonapanitase in Europe. We estimate that there are approximately 375,000 hemodialysis patients in Europe. We completed the EMA’s scientific advice process in 2018 and, if the PATENCY-2 trial is successful, we expect to submit an MAA to the EMA in the first half of 2020. In addition, in 2018, we submitted a Pediatric Investigation Plan, or PIP, to the EMA’s Pediatric Committee, or PDCO. The PDCO agreed to waive the obligation to conduct a pediatric clinical trial prior to regulatory approval in the European Union. However, if we decide to conduct additional clinical trials of vonapanitase in Europe or if such clinical trials are necessary for regulatory approval, we expect results from such trials to be available two to three years after the first patient is enrolled. We intend to seek one or more collaborators to develop and commercialize the product in European countries. In addition, we may enter into collaborations for the development and commercialization of vonapanitase in other countries outside of the United States with large populations of hemodialysis patients, such as China and Japan. We estimate that there are approximately 450,000 patients on hemodialysis in China, 320,000 patients on hemodialysis in Japan and more than 2,800,000 hemodialysis patients worldwide, with an annual worldwide growth rate of 6-7%. Approximately 90% of hemodialysis patients in China and Japan dialyze using an arteriovenous fistula.

• | Pursue additional vascular access indications for vonapanitase. We believe that our clinical data support further development of vonapanitase in brachiocephalic fistula creation. We may, based on additional data including the data from our Phase 3 clinical trials and if sufficient funds become available, study the effects of a 30 microgram dose of vonapanitase versus placebo on brachiocephalic fistulas. Further, if sufficient funds become available and after reviewing the results from our ongoing Phase 3 clinical trial, we may commence a clinical trial of vonapanitase in patients undergoing placement of an arteriovenous graft. If these trials were to successfully meet their primary endpoints, we would expect to submit a supplemental BLA to the FDA and a supplemental MAA to the EMA. We believe vonapanitase could offer a significant medical benefit in these patients.

• | Pursue indications for vonapanitase in peripheral artery disease. In addition to vascular access indications, we are investigating vonapanitase as a treatment for patients with symptomatic peripheral artery disease, or PAD. In 2016, we initiated a Phase 1, multicenter, dose-escalation trial designed to evaluate the safety and technical feasibility of a single administration of vonapanitase as an adjunct to angioplasty for patients with PAD below the knee. We completed the enrollment and treatment of 24 patients in this study before the end of 2018. We expect to enroll up to an additional 16 patients, for a total of 40 patients, before the end of 2019 and to follow each of these patients for a period of up to seven months. We may, if sufficient funds become available, begin patient enrollment in a Phase 1, multicenter, dose-escalation trial evaluating vonapanitase as a monotherapy for PAD above the knee.

Background on Hemodialysis Vascular Access
 
Healthy kidneys serve many functions, including eliminating metabolic waste products and excess water, helping to control blood pressure, and keeping electrolytes such as sodium and potassium in balance. Patients with CKD have lost kidney function, most commonly due to diabetes or hypertension. Kidney disease is progressive and once a patient has reached end-stage CKD, the kidneys are no longer able to perform their normal functions. At this point, some form of renal replacement therapy is required, such as hemodialysis, in which blood is processed by a hemodialysis machine; peritoneal dialysis, a process using a cavity in the abdomen called the peritoneum as a membrane across which fluids are exchanged from the blood; or kidney transplant.
 
Hemodialysis is the most common form of treatment for end-stage CKD, a patient population that in the United States is expected to grow at an annual growth rate of approximately 3% between 2015 and 2030 according to recent publications. According to the U.S. Renal Data System 2018 Annual Data Report, in 2016 there were approximately 458,000 hemodialysis patients in the United States with approximately 109,000 new incident patients having started hemodialysis during the year. We believe that there are approximately 330,000 hemodialysis patients in Europe, 450,000 hemodialysis patients in China, 320,000 hemodialysis patients in Japan and 2.6 million hemodialysis patients worldwide, with an annual worldwide growth rate of 6-7%.
 
Hemodialysis is a chronic therapy performed by cannulating, or piercing, a vein with a large bore needle so that blood can be pumped through a hemodialysis machine, which removes metabolic waste and excess water normally excreted by the kidney. The cleansed blood is then returned to the same vein via a second needle. A hemodialysis session typically lasts three to four hours and is performed three times a week in an outpatient dialysis clinic.
 
To enable sufficient blood to pass through the hemodialysis machine to complete treatment within four hours, a vein must have blood flow of at least 500 milliliters per minute. The arm is the most convenient location for accessing the blood stream on a recurring basis, but blood flow in the arm is approximately 50 milliliters per minute. Therefore, most hemodialysis patients undergo a surgical procedure in which a surgeon establishes a direct connection between an artery and a vein, referred to as a fistula, to create a high flow circuit of sufficient diameter, most often in an arm. The fistula bypasses the capillary circulation in the hand and leads to a process known as maturation, where the internal diameter, or lumen, of the vein and blood flow increase over a period of weeks, resulting in a lumen diameter greater than 4 millimeters and blood flow of 500-2,000 milliliters per minute in successful cases.
 
Arteriovenous fistulas are the gold standard for vascular access. Arteriovenous fistulas are preferred because they are associated with fewer complications and reduced rates of hospitalization as compared to other forms of vascular access. As compared to grafts, fistulas require approximately 40% fewer interventional or surgical procedures and suffer from a rate of vascular access infection that is 54% lower. Patients dialyzing with a fistula have lower rates of thrombosis and hospitalization, longer survival, reduced mortality and lower cost of care. Beyond the substantial medical advantages of a fistula, available data from the U.S. Renal Data System show that patients who dialyze with a fistula cost Medicare approximately $15,000 less annually than patients who dialyze with a graft and approximately $25,000 less annually than patients who dialyze with a catheter. According to published data, approximately 68% of hemodialysis patients in the United States dialyze with a fistula compared to 67-83% of patients in the major European countries and approximately 90% of patients in China and Japan.
 
Based on various third-party sources, we estimate there were approximately 130,000 fistulas created in the United States annually. There are a limited number of potential artery-vein combinations in the arm that can be used to create a fistula, principally the following:
 

• | radiocephalic fistulas at the forearm (radial artery connected to cephalic vein), which we estimate are created in 35 - 40% of new fistula creations;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | brachiocephalic fistulas at the elbow (brachial artery sutured to cephalic vein), which we estimate are created in 50 - 55% of new fistula creations; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | brachiobasilic fistulas in the upper arm (brachial artery sutured to basilic vein), which we estimate are created in 10% of new fistula creations.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The medical community endorses radiocephalic fistulas as the optimal form of vascular access and the recommended first choice for new hemodialysis patients. Creating the vascular access site at the forearm preserves the potential future use of other accesses further up in the arm, is simpler to create, and is less likely to create heart failure due to very high blood flow or steal syndrome, where the diversion of flow through the fistulas reduces blood to the hand. Radiocephalic fistulas are also less likely to suffer from symptomatic central stenoses in the shoulder and chest, remote from the site of the fistula. The Kidney Disease Outcome Quality Initiative Guidelines, or KDOQI Guidelines, authored by the National Kidney Foundation, or NKF, specifically recommend starting with a radiocephalic fistulas if possible, stating that “starting [closer to the hand] and moving [further up the arm] provides for the possibility of preserving as many potential sites as possible for future access creation.” If a radiocephalic fistula must be abandoned, a surgeon can create a new vascular access higher up the arm, most likely a brachiocephalic fistula. However, if a brachiocephalic fistula is created first, the surgeon cannot later move down that same arm to create a radiocephalic fistula because the cephalic vein has already been transected for use in the brachiocephalic fistula.

While radiocephalic fistulas are considered the most desirable form of vascular access, radiocephalic fistulas suffer from high rates of patency loss and non-use for hemodialysis. Up to 40% of radiocephalic fistulas are abandoned within 12 months after their surgical creation. Additionally, up to 55% of radiocephalic fistulas fail to become usable for hemodialysis. Some patients never receive a radiocephalic fistula because the surgeon believes the risk of failure is too high for those patients. These patients who tend to be older and sicker will undergo creation of a fistula higher up on the arm and permanently lose at least one of their access sites. We believe that the number of radiocephalic fistulas created annually may rise if vonapanitase improves outcomes and allows vascular surgeons to create radiocephalic fistulas in patients that they previously considered to be at an unacceptably high risk of failure.
 
The second choice for vascular access after a fistula is an arteriovenous graft in which a surgeon connects an artery and vein using a synthetic tube. Approximately 20% of hemodialysis patients in the United States dialyze with a graft, compared to approximately 5-12% of patients in the major European countries and approximately 2% and 7% of patients in China and Japan, respectively.
 
The least desirable type of vascular access is a catheter, a plastic tube that is placed directly through the skin into a vein, typically via an incision in the neck enabling placement of the catheter into a large vein that leads directly to the heart. The catheter connects the patient's vasculature to the hemodialysis machine. Because the catheter penetrates the skin continuously, it is subject to a high risk of infection and increased mortality. One of the primary goals of hemodialysis care is to keep patients off catheters. However, in the United States approximately 80% of patients initiate hemodialysis through a catheter until a fistula or graft is ready to be used, and are dialyzed through a catheter when the fistula or graft does not become usable for hemodialysis or must be abandoned and a new one has to be created. Approximately 12% of hemodialysis patients in the United States dialyze with a permanent catheter, compared to 10-28% of patients in the major European countries and approximately 10% and 2% of patients in China and Japan, based on published data.
 
Established Medical Need 
 
The need to improve vascular access outcomes is well established in the hemodialysis community. The health-related and economic costs of creating vascular accesses and addressing access dysfunction and associated complications have led to a global effort to address the problem. Over the last twenty years, the NKF has established guidelines in an effort to increase the use of fistulas while reducing the rate of complications, mostly through the identification and promulgation of best practices. The National Institutes of Health, or NIH, joined the effort in 2000 with the creation of a multi-center consortium of medical centers, the Dialysis Access Clinical Trials Consortium, to coordinate the testing of new treatments designed to improve fistula and graft outcomes. The intensity of these efforts increased markedly in 2004, when the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, reacting to health and economic data, announced the “Fistula First” initiative to increase the use of fistulas while reducing complications. According to Fistula First, fistulas should be considered for every patient needing hemodialysis because, compared to other forms of vascular access, fistulas last longer, require fewer surgical and endovascular interventions, are associated with lower rates of infection, hospitalization and death, and are less costly. As a result of these efforts, fistula use has approximately doubled since 2004 to 67% of United States hemodialysis patients in 2018.
 
Although arteriovenous fistulas are the preferred form of vascular access, they suffer from a high rate of failure, typically due to insufficient blood flow, precluding hemodialysis. The increased use of fistulas has also led to a concurrent increase in the number of fistulas created in patients with higher risks of dysfunction. Manifestations of fistula failure can include the following:
 

• | failure of the fistula to become usable for hemodialysis, in which the fistula either has inadequate blood flow or cannot be successfully cannulated;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | loss of primary patency, in which the fistula experiences a thrombosis or requires a corrective procedure to restore blood flow; or
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | loss of secondary patency, in which the fistula is abandoned.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 
We are not aware of products approved in the United States or Europe that would compete with vonapanitase for the improvement of fistula use for hemodialysis and secondary patency.
 
For patients on hemodialysis, fistula non-use or abandonment is associated with a number of poor outcomes, many of which are associated with prolonged catheter exposure. Patients whose fistula fails to become usable or is abandoned are often subjected to the following:
 

• | Interrupted and missed dialysis sessions, which are associated with an increased risk of morbidity and mortality.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


11
--


• | Surgical placement of a new permanent access, often in the same arm but in a more proximal location, which is associated with increased complications such as steal syndrome (hand ischemia). A recent study indicated that subsequent accesses are at a greater risk of infectious and noninfectious complications compared to an initial access.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | New vascular accesses may also require additional corrective procedures to promote use of the fistula or maintain its function.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Some patients may be considered poor candidates for a new fistula, resulting in placement of an arteriovenous graft, which are associated with higher rate of infection, thrombosis and patency loss compared to a fistula.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Until a new permanent access is available for use, a process that typically requires a minimum of three months for fistulas in patients on hemodialysis, patients must dialyze with a catheter. If the new access fails to become usable, catheter exposure will be further lengthened. A recent study indicated that patients whose fistula fails to become usable are subjected to more than twice the time of catheter exposure in the first year after surgical creation of the fistula.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Finally, some patients may be forced to dialyze with a catheter chronically, either because the patient has depleted all of his or her vascular access options or the patient refuses to undergo an additional surgical procedure to create a permanent access.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
One of the primary goals of the Fistula First campaign is to reduce the use of catheters, which is considered the worst form of vascular access. As a foreign body, a catheter may incite chronic inflammation resulting in malnutrition, anemia and cardiovascular disease. Catheters are also subject to low blood flow, predisposing patients to underdialysis. In addition, patients dialyzing with a catheter are at heightened risk of hospitalization compared to patients dialyzing with a fistula. Patients dialyzing with a catheter average 18 hospital days per patient-year, which is approximately twice the rate of patients dialyzing with a fistula. Catheter exposure results in a substantially higher rate of infections, especially catheter-related bacteremia, due to the challenges of inserting and maintaining a foreign body through the skin. Infection is the second leading cause of death in hemodialysis patients, and catheter use is independently associated with increased risk of infectious, cardiovascular, and all-cause mortality compared to fistula use.
 
Among pre-dialysis patients, fistula failure can result in the patient initiating hemodialysis using a catheter instead of a fistula, which has been shown to be associated with increased risk of subsequent fistula failure and hospitalization. Patients who initiate hemodialysis on a catheter have two times the rate of admissions for infection in the first month of hemodialysis and a higher risk of all-cause hospitalization compared to patients initiating with a fistula. A recent study indicated an incremental cost increase of $30,000 in the first year of hemodialysis for patients initiating hemodialysis on a catheter.
 
Because the clinical implications of fistula non-use and abandonment are severe, health care providers are aggressive in monitoring and intervening upon fistulas in an attempt to increase fistula use and reduce the rate of fistula abandonment. In less than a decade, the rate of procedures has approximately doubled. Such procedures include balloon angioplasty and surgical revision, which are invasive, painful and associated with a number of complications. The procedures also often fail to provide a durable benefit, resulting in a cycle of interventions for the patient. Recent data indicate that 50% of fistulas that undergo angioplasty to treat patency loss experience another episode of patency loss within 12 months, resulting in the need for additional procedures to restore patency. Additionally, the procedures are not always successful in restoring patency, with up to 27% of the procedures failing to restore function, resulting in fistula abandonment. Patients in the United States using a fistula on average require more than 1.5 procedures per year, each of which typically costs Medicare between $5,000 and $15,000. It was also reported that fistulas that fail to become usable resulted in incremental costs to Medicare of up to more than $21,000 in the first year and more than $10,000 in each of the second and third years following fistula creation. In addition, a recent study indicated that the total cost to Medicare for managing hemodialysis vascular access was more than $2.8 billion in 2013. This amount excludes costs of managing vascular access in predialysis patients and dialysis patients covered by Medicare Advantage HMOs or other non-Medicare payers, as well as patient co-pays and deductibles.
 
Vonapanitase 
 
Vonapanitase is a recombinant human elastase under development as a treatment to improve vascular access outcomes in patients with CKD undergoing or planning for hemodialysis, a lifesaving treatment that cannot be conducted without a functioning vascular access. We have completed four multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies evaluating vonapanitase compared to placebo in patients with CKD, including the first of two Phase 3 clinical trials, PATENCY-1. We also completed patient enrollment in our second Phase 3 clinical trial, PATENCY-2, in March 2018 and expect to release top-line data in late-March 2019. Vonapanitase received Breakthrough Therapy designation from the FDA in May 2017 for hemodialysis vascular access. The FDA awards Breakthrough Therapy designations to expedite the development and review of investigational drugs that are intended to treat serious or life-threatening conditions when preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the treatment may offer a substantial improvement over currently available therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. Vonapanitase previously received Fast Track designation from the FDA which is also designed to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drugs and biologics to treat serious conditions and address an unmet medical need. We also received orphan drug designations for vonapanitase in the United States and European Union for hemodialysis vascular access indications.

Mechanism of Action 
 
Based on clinical and nonclinical studies, we believe that a one-time, local application of investigational vonapanitase to the external surface of the blood vessels during fistula surgical creation may enhance outward vascular remodeling and inhibit neointimal hyperplasia, thereby reducing the risk of fistula failure.
 
For a fistula to become usable for hemodialysis, it must experience substantial increases in lumen diameter and blood flow through a process known as outward vascular remodeling. The acute increase in blood flow following fistula creation stimulates a cell signaling process that leads to an upregulation of endogenous elastases in the fistula. Elastases bind to and fragment elastin fibers that in turn stimulate cellular proliferation and differentiation. These stimulated cells, known as myofibroblasts, remodel the fistula leading to increased lumen diameter and blood flow.
 
In newly created fistulas, there are two primary causes of fistula failure:
 

• | First, the fistula may not outwardly remodel due to inadequate cell signaling and insufficient upregulation of elastases, resulting in a fistula with insufficient diameter and blood flow for hemodialysis.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Second, the fistula may experience an obstruction known as intimal hyperplasia, in which myofibroblasts that normally remodel the fistula instead migrate to the vessel lumen where they proliferate and form a blockage, reducing blood flow.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
While vonapanitase’s exact mechanism is not known, we demonstrated through nonclinical studies that vonapanitase, at the concentrations being studied in arteriovenous fistulas, causes partial fragmentation of elastin fibers, primarily in the adventitial layer of the vessel wall, and thus may augment endogenous elastase activity in the fistula. Nonclinical research has also demonstrated that elastin fragments stimulate myofibroblast proliferation and differentiation necessary for outward vascular remodeling and that elastin fragments may inhibit the migration of myofibroblasts to the vessel lumen that can cause intimal hyperplasia. In animal models of vascular injury, the porcine homologue of vonapanitase applied to the adventitial surface of veins and arteries fragmented elastin and directed the migration of proliferating cells away from the vessel lumen, significantly reducing neointimal hyperplasia.
 
Clinical Development of Vonapanitase
 
Our First Phase 3 Clinical Trial, PATENCY-1
 
In December 2016, we announced that the PATENCY-1 trial did not meet its primary endpoint of improved primary unassisted patency compared to placebo (p=0.254). Primary unassisted patency was defined as the length of time from fistula surgical creation to the first occurrence of a fistula thrombosis or corrective procedure to restore or maintain patency (blood flow). While not statistically significant, vonapanitase treated patients demonstrated a 17% reduction in the risk of primary unassisted patency loss over one year. At the end of one year, 42% of vonapanitase-treated patients maintained primary unassisted patency, compared to 31% of placebo-treated patients. Median patency, the time at which 50% of patients in a group lost primary unassisted patency, was 171 days in the placebo group and 214 days in the vonapanitase treatment group based on the Kaplan-Meier estimates.
 
Kaplan-Meyer curves for primary unassisted patency in PATENCY-1:
 


Secondary patency, the secondary endpoint in the PATENCY-1 trial, was defined as the length of time from surgical creation until fistula abandonment. Results suggested that vonapanitase may have improved secondary patency compared to placebo, as vonapanitase-treated patients demonstrated a 34% reduction in the risk of secondary patency loss (p=0.048). At the end of one year, 74% of vonapanitase-treated patients maintained secondary patency, compared to 61% of placebo-treated patients.

Kaplan-Meyer curves for secondary patency in PATENCY-1:
 


Results also suggested that vonapanitase may have improved fistula use for hemodialysis, one of the PATENCY-1 trial’s tertiary endpoints. 39% of vonapanitase-treated patients achieved unassisted use of their fistula for hemodialysis, compared to 25% of placebo-treated patients (p=0.035). 64% of vonapanitase-treated patients used their fistula for dialysis (unassisted or assisted), compared to 44% of placebo-treated patients (p=0.006). Use for hemodialysis was defined as use of the fistula for hemodialysis for at least 90 days or, if hemodialysis was not initiated at least 90 days prior to the patient’s last visit, for at least 30 days prior to the patient’s last visit and in use at the patient’s last visit. Unassisted use was defined as use without prior loss of primary unassisted patency.
 


Results from the PATENCY-1 trial’s other tertiary endpoints include the following:
 

• | Unassisted and Assisted Maturation. 63% of vonapanitase-treated patients achieved unassisted maturation, compared to 53% of placebo-treated patients (p=0.109). Unassisted maturation by ultrasound criteria was defined as achieving a vein diameter ≥4 millimeters and blood flow ≥500 milliliters per minute by three months without loss of primary patency. 66% of vonapanitase-treated patients achieved maturation without regard for prior procedures (i.e., unassisted or assisted) compared to 58% of placebo-treated patients (p=0.170).
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Rate of Procedures. Over one year, the rate per patient per year of procedures to restore or maintain patency was 1.10 in vonapanitase-treated patients compared to 1.48 in placebo-treated patients (p=0.479). Such procedures included thrombectomy, angioplasty, stent deployment and surgical revision. The rate per patient per year of all procedures was 1.54 in vonapanitase-treated patients compared to 2.07 in placebo-treated patients (p=0.149).
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We continued to follow patients who completed 12 months of follow-up in the initial trial with a patent fistula and consented to be enrolled in a patient registry to obtain long-term follow-up efficacy information. Data from the patient registry are expected to be presented later in 2019 at a scientific conference.
 
Safety Data
 
Vonapanitase is administered topically at the vascular access and only acts locally. We have not observed systemic activity or systemic toxicity in our preclinical animal studies, even following single-dose intravenous administration at very high multiples of the Phase 3 clinical trial doses. Safety evaluations in Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials included ascertainment of adverse events, physical examinations, ultrasounds of the fistulas and nearby vessels, vital signs and laboratory studies. In the PATENCY-1 trial, no significant safety signals were identified, and no patients were considered positive for anti-drug antibodies. Most patients reported adverse events, the most common of which are summarized in the table set forth below, as compared to placebo. These events were generally consistent with the medical events experienced by CKD patients undergoing fistula creation surgery.

Proportions of Patients in PATENCY-1 Experiencing Most Common Adverse Events 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Adverse Events | Vonapanitase N=209 | Placebo N=102
Vascular stenosis | 38.3% | 40.2% 
Fistula thrombosis | 19.6% | 26.5% 
Hypoaesthesia (numbness) | 5.3% | 4.9% 
Procedural pain | 4.8% | 5.9% 
Note: Includes any adverse event that occurred in at least 5% of patients in either treatment group.

 
The percentages of serious adverse events, or SAEs, was also similar between the treatment groups in the PATENCY-1 trial (placebo 14.7%, vonapanitase 13.9%). Individual SAEs were never reported by more than one (1%) placebo patient or two (1%) vonapanitase patients with the exception of pneumonia reported by three (2.9%) placebo patients and myocardial infarction reported by two (2.0%) placebo patients. No SAEs were related to study drug with the exception of one (0.5%) arteriovenous fistula thrombosis in a vonapanitase patient. The percentages of severe SAEs were similar between treatment groups (placebo 4.9%, vonapanitase 4.8%) as were the percentages with life-threatening SAEs (placebo 4.9%, vonapanitase 3.3%). Life-threatening SAEs included acute myocardial infarctions, one cardiac arrest, and two pneumonias in the placebo group and single occurrences of coronary artery disease, cardiac arrest, pulseless electrical activity, death, injury, hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, and shock in the vonapanitase group. Four (3.9%) placebo patients and seven (3.3%) vonapanitase patients died during the study. All 11 deaths were considered unrelated to study drug.
 
Our Ongoing Phase 3 Clinical Trial, PATENCY-2
 
Our ongoing Phase 3 clinical trial, PATENCY-2, is the second of two randomized, double-blind Phase 3 trials, comparing a 30 microgram dose of investigational vonapanitase to placebo. As in PATENCY-1, PATENCY-2 enrolled patients with CKD undergoing surgical creation of a radiocephalic fistula for hemodialysis. Patients were randomized 2:1, vonapanitase to placebo, and are being followed for a period of 12 months. In March 2018, we completed enrollment of a total of 603 treated patients at 39 centers in the U.S. and Canada. We expect to report top-line data in late March 2019.
 
Following our review of the complete data sets from the PATENCY-1 trial and discussions with the FDA, we amended the protocol for the PATENCY-2 trial. The protocol amendment reordered the existing endpoints for the study, establishing fistula use for hemodialysis and secondary patency (time to fistula abandonment) as co-primary endpoints, each of which demonstrated improvements in the PATENCY-1 trial. Other efficacy endpoints in the amended protocol include unassisted fistula use for hemodialysis, primary unassisted patency, unassisted fistula maturation by ultrasound criteria, fistula maturation by ultrasound criteria, the rate of procedures performed to the fistula, and the rate of procedures to restore or maintain fistula patency. We also increased the planned enrollment for this study from 300 to 600 patients. The increased sample size for the PATENCY-2 trial provides power to detect the differences observed in the PATENCY-1 trial for fistula use for hemodialysis and secondary patency of 98% and 88%, respectively, with a p-value ≤0.05 for each of the co-primary endpoints. We received written confirmation from the FDA that, if PATENCY-2 is successful in showing statistical significance (p-value≤0.05) on each of the co-primary endpoints, the PATENCY-2 trial together with data from previously completed studies would provide the basis for a BLA submission as a single pivotal study, in which case no additional studies would need to be conducted prior to submitting the BLA.

Our Phase 2 Fistula Clinical Trial 
 
In 2012, we completed a multicenter, randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 trial of vonapanitase in 151 patients undergoing surgical creation of a radiocephalic fistula (n=67) or brachiocephalic fistula (n=84). Patients were treated with vonapanitase at doses of 10 or 30 micrograms or placebo at the time of fistula creation and were followed for up to 12 months. The primary efficacy endpoint was primary unassisted patency, defined as the time from surgical creation of the fistula to occurrence of a thrombosis or a procedure, such as angioplasty, to restore or maintain patency. In the primary analysis for all fistulas, the risk of primary patency loss was not significantly reduced versus placebo for vonapanitase at doses of 10 micrograms (HR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.39-1.22) or 30 micrograms (HR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.38-1.19). Median patency, based on the Kaplan-Meier estimates, was 224 days in the placebo group and greater than 365 days in each of the vonapanitase treatment groups, indicating that vonapanitase prolonged primary unassisted patency. Ninety-two patients with a patent fistula who completed 12 months of follow-up in the initial trial were followed in a registry to obtain additional data related to the efficacy endpoints. In this follow-up, the vonapanitase 30 microgram benefit on primary unassisted patency persisted out over a median of three years.
 
An analysis of the primary endpoint data revealed an uneven distribution in patency loss events in patients with a brachiocephalic fistula due to central stenosis in the shoulder and chest, remote from the site of a fistula. Central stenoses commonly exist prior to fistula creation and are unmasked following creation of brachiocephalic fistulas, which have higher blood flow than radiocephalic fistulas. These stenoses are unrelated to treatment with vonapanitase. To correct for this uneven distribution, we conducted a non-prespecified analysis of the primary endpoint that excluded patency loss events due to central stenoses. This analysis demonstrated a significant reduction in the risk of primary unassisted patency loss in the 30 microgram vonapanitase dose group (HR 0.52; 95% CI, 0.28-0.97; P=0.04) compared to placebo.
 
The benefit of vonapanitase in the Phase 2 trial on primary unassisted patency was most pronounced in the subset of patients undergoing creation of a radiocephalic fistula. The risk of primary patency loss was significantly reduced by vonapanitase at doses of 30 micrograms versus placebo (HR, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.15-.91; p=0.02). The subset analysis of this endpoint for radiocephalic fistula patients receiving the 30 microgram dose, which was not pre-specified, showed a significant increase in median primary unassisted patency of more than 365 days as compared to 125 days in the placebo group. The apparent benefit of the vonapanitase 30 microgram dose on primary unassisted patency persisted for these patients in the two-year registry period.
 
As with the primary efficacy analyses, we performed a number of prespecified and exploratory analyses of the data on additional efficacy endpoints, including secondary patency loss and unassisted use for hemodialysis. We observed no significant differences in the risk of secondary patency loss, which was defined as abandonment of the fistula, in the overall fistula population in the Phase 2 trial. However, a trend toward prolonged secondary patency was seen in patients receiving radiocephalic fistulas. In this non-prespecified subset analysis, treatment with vonapanitase at doses of 30 micrograms was associated with a reduction of 73% in the risk of secondary patency loss. However, this reduction in the risk of secondary patency loss was not statistically significant (HR, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.006-1.29; p=0.08). Additionally, in a recent publication of three-year follow-up data from the Phase 2 trial, a trend toward increased fistula use for hemodialysis was seen in the patients receiving radiocephalic fistulas when applying the definition of use for hemodialysis from the Phase 3 clinical trials of vonapanitase. While the differences observed in this prospective analysis were not statistically significant, 80% of patients receiving radiocephalic fistulas in the vonapanitase 30 microgram group used their fistula for hemodialysis compared with 56% in the placebo group (p=0.14).
 
In the Phase 2 trial, patients treated with vonapanitase reported adverse events comparable to placebo. These events were consistent with the medical events experienced by patients with CKD undergoing fistula creation surgery. Based on the results of this Phase 2 trial and our end of Phase 2 meeting with the FDA in April 2013, we selected the 30 microgram dose for further study in the Phase 3 trials.
 
Our Phase 1/2 Fistula Clinical Trial
 
We submitted an investigational new drug application, or IND, for vonapanitase as a treatment for patients undergoing fistula creation on April 30, 2008. Our initial clinical trial of vonapanitase was a Phase 1/2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation safety and exploratory efficacy trial in 66 patients undergoing creation of a radiocephalic or brachiocephalic fistula. Patients were treated with vonapanitase at nine dose levels ranging from 3.3 micrograms to 9 milligrams or placebo at the time of fistula creation and were followed for up to one year. This trial did not meet its primary endpoint, an endpoint we did not pursue in our Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials. However, doses of vonapanitase at 3.3, 10 and 33 micrograms were associated with a trend toward prolonged primary unassisted patency (secondary endpoint p=0.66 in the All Treated population and p=0.15 in the All Treated Minus 3 population), fewer procedures to restore or maintain patency (collected as supportive data) and less hemodynamically significant lumen stenosis (collected as supportive data) compared with placebo treated patients or patients treated with higher vonapanitase doses. Higher doses showed results similar to placebo and no dose met the primary efficacy endpoint with statistical significance. No dose-related increases in adverse events were observed in the trial. Based on the results of this trial, we selected 10 microgram and 30 microgram doses for further study in the Phase 2 trial.
Preclinical Development
 
We have conducted an extensive preclinical program to evaluate the safety and tolerability of single doses of vonapanitase administered locally in animal models of fistula and arteriovenous graft creation, by percutaneous and endovascular injection in animal models of PAD as well as intravenously. We have conducted preclinical studies in multiple species at doses up to 50 milligrams of vonapanitase, which is over 1,500 times higher than the dose we used in our Phase 3 clinical trials. We observed no systemic activity or systemic toxicity for vonapanitase in any of our preclinical studies. We observed no toxicity in any of the doses that we subsequently studied or plan to study in our Phase 3 clinical trial in humans. Only local toxicity was observed at surgical sites at high doses (10 and 50 milligrams, which is over 300-1500 times higher than the dose we are studying in our Phase 3 clinical trial). These changes were reversible, with normal wound healing observed at 14 days except at the highest (50 milligrams) dose, in which there were some mild persistent changes in the jugular vein and subcutaneous tissue. Normal wound healing was observed in all the fistula studies in rabbits at doses up to 10 milligrams and in all the arteriovenous graft studies in dogs and pigs at doses up to 20 milligrams (the highest doses tested).

Other Programs, Indications and Trials 
 
Other Fistula Trials 
 
European clinical program 
 
We are currently evaluating our clinical program to support filing in Europe. We may, based on additional data including the data from our Phase 3 clinical trials in the United States and if sufficient funds become available, choose to conduct a clinical trial of vonapanitase in Europe.  
Brachiocephalic Fistula 
 
We believe that our clinical data support further development of vonapanitase in brachiocephalic fistula creation. We may, based on additional data, including the data from our ongoing Phase 3 clinical trial, and if sufficient funds become available, study the effects of a 30 microgram dose of vonapanitase versus placebo on brachiocephalic fistulas. Prior to initiation of this trial, we expect to seek guidance from the FDA regarding trial design.
Arteriovenous Grafts 
 
An arteriovenous graft is a synthetic tube to connect a vein and an artery placed in a surgical procedure. In 2012, we completed a Phase 1/2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation trial in 89 patients undergoing placement of an arteriovenous graft. Patients were treated with placebo or eight different doses of vonapanitase ranging from 10 micrograms to 9 milligrams at the time of graft placement and were followed for up to one year. Those patients who had not lost secondary patency were subsequently enrolled in a registry to obtain additional follow-up information on the arteriovenous graft.
 
The primary outcome measure was safety. Adverse events were consistent with the medical conditions experienced by patients with CKD undergoing graft surgery and showed no significant differences between groups. Some of the data showed indications of efficacy, especially in secondary patency, which is an approvable endpoint for hemodialysis access, for the groups treated with vonapanitase at doses of 10 micrograms and 30 micrograms.
 
After reviewing the results from our second Phase 3 clinical trial, and if sufficient funds become available, we may commence a clinical trial of vonapanitase in patients undergoing placement of an arteriovenous graft.
 
Peripheral Artery Disease 
 
In addition to vascular access indications, we are investigating vonapanitase as a treatment for patients with symptomatic peripheral artery disease, or PAD. Patients with lower extremity PAD suffer from stenosis formation in the arteries providing blood to the legs. These patients typically present with exercise-induced leg pain, a condition known as intermittent claudication. Patients with claudication are unable to adequately maintain their activities of daily living because they quickly experience pain that can be resolved only through rest. Severe cases result in critical limb ischemia, or lack of oxygen, and the possibility of amputation. PAD is a global problem affecting a large number of people throughout the industrialized world. Approximately 8 million Americans suffer from PAD.
 
Patients with early stage PAD typically undergo lifestyle management such as smoking cessation, weight reduction and/or diabetes management, and treatment with oral medications. Approximately 800,000 patients in the United States who do not respond to lifestyle management and have worsening symptoms undergo an endovascular procedure, typically balloon angioplasty with or without stenting or vein bypass surgery. While these procedures work acutely to restore blood flow, they suffer from poor long-term durability, resulting in the need for repeat procedures.
 
We believe that vonapanitase may improve the outcomes associated with angioplasty procedures, resulting in prolonged intervention-free patency while reducing the need for implantation of a permanent stent. We submitted an IND for vonapanitase as a treatment for PAD patients on April 9, 2012. Our initial PAD clinical trial was a Phase 1, open-label, dose-escalation safety/technical feasibility trial in 14 patients undergoing balloon angioplasty of the superficial femoral or popliteal arteries in the leg above the knee. Following successful angioplasty, patients were treated with vonapanitase via an FDA-cleared, drug-delivery catheter that allows vonapanitase to be administered locally in the outer layer of the vessel wall. Patients were followed for up to 12 months. The study met its stated objectives, as data indicated that catheter-based treatment with vonapanitase was generally well-tolerated and technically feasible. In the fourth quarter of 2016, we initiated another Phase 1 study of vonapanitase delivered via a drug-delivery catheter in symptomatic PAD patients undergoing angioplasty of an artery below the knee. We completed the enrollment and treatment of 24 patients before the end of 2018 in this Phase 1 study. We expect to follow each of these patients for period of up to seven months. We expect to enroll up to an additional 16 patients in this study before the end of 2019 and to follow each of these patients for a period of up to seven months .

We also believe that vonapanitase may be an alternative to traditional angioplasty. Vonapanitase may be delivered via a percutaneous approach, in which a physician inserts a needle through the skin to inject vonapanitase to the artery around the area of blockage. We believe that vonapanitase may dilate the artery, resulting in increased lumen artery diameter, higher blood flow, and an improvement in clinical symptoms. In the fourth quarter of 2016 we initiated a Phase 1 study of vonapanitase delivered as a monotherapy in patients with a clinical diagnosis of PAD due to an atherosclerotic lesion in an artery above the knee. Based on our current operating plan, we have decided not to begin patient enrollment at this time.
 
We believe that vonapanitase may improve the outcomes associated with vein bypass surgery, resulting in prolonged intervention-free patency. During vein bypass surgery, a surgeon places a vein, typically obtained from the patient’s leg, as an alternative conduit for blood to flow around the area of blockage restoring direct flow to the lower leg and foot. We believe that vonapanitase, administered to the outside of the vein concurrently with the surgery, may improve the outcomes associated with vein bypass surgery, resulting in prolonged intervention-free patency.
 
Manufacturing and Supply 
 
We depend on third-party contract manufacturers for the production of vonapanitase. Our API is produced at our contract manufacturer, Lonza LTD, or Lonza, which is required to comply with the FDA’s Current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, regulations. Vonapanitase finished product is produced at our contract fill/finisher providers, Jubilant HollisterStier and Patheon Manufacturing Services, LLC (formerly DSM Pharmaceuticals, Inc.), which is required to comply with cGMP regulations.
 
We used API manufactured at Lonza to create finished drug product that was used in our Phase 3 fistula clinical trials. We also plan to manufacture API at Lonza for our commercial launch and future fistula trials. We also have a separate 5 milligram formulation that was used in our completed Phase 1 fistula study, Phase 2 fistula study, Phase 1 arteriovenous graft study, and Phase 1 PAD study. We plan to use this 5 milligram formulation in our Phase 1 PAD studies.
 
We modified our finished product at Jubilant HollisterStier for our Phase 3 trials and potential commercial launch in order to facilitate ease of administration and fill and finish at the 30 microgram doses. The modified finished product is reconstituted with sterile water to create a dosing solution containing 30 micrograms of vonapanitase. We demonstrated that the modified finished product had the same elastase activity using synthetic and natural elastin substrates and the same elastin removal from blood vessels following ex vivo treatments as the previous finished product. The modified finished product formulation was similar to the previous finished product formulation in maintaining the health and viability of live cells in culture. These data suggest the modified finished product will have the same efficacy and safety in clinical trials as the previous finished product.
 
Release and stability testing for API and drug product are performed at PPD, Inc. The tests indicate stability of at least five years for our API and at least two years for our drug product.
 
In anticipation of a potential BLA submission, we manufactured three batches of API and plan to manufacture three batches of drug product as part of process validation. We plan to test these batches for stability with a goal of establishing a commercial shelf-life of at least two years for finished product and a longer expiry for API.
 
Sales and Marketing 
 
Our commercialization strategy is to develop vonapanitase into a leading therapy worldwide for the treatment of fistulas in patients with CKD undergoing or planning for hemodialysis and to improve vascular access outcomes in patients with other vascular diseases. If the PATENCY-2 trial is successful, we expect to be able to submit a BLA in the fourth quarter of 2019.
 
We have not yet established a commercial infrastructure, however, our Chief Executive Officer and other members of our executive management team have significant commercial experience in the industry, including commercial launch experience in the renal market. We intend to recruit an in-house specialty sales force in the United States focused on promoting vonapanitase. We plan to target our marketing and sales efforts at vascular surgeons who create fistulas. There are approximately 2,800 vascular surgeons in the United States. We believe a sales force of approximately 75-100 representatives, supported by reimbursement specialists and a medical affairs team, will enable us to call on the approximately 1,000 providers that account for more than 50% of the fistula creations covered by Medicare in the United States annually.
 
We believe that vonapanitase will be reimbursed appropriately by Medicare, Medicaid and private payers. Costs related to fistula surgical creation, which is typically performed in the hospital outpatient setting, are not included in the ESRD bundle.

If vonapanitase is approved by the EMA, we expect to commercialize vonapanitase in Europe with one or more commercial partners. We also may enter into collaborations for the development and commercialization of vonapanitase in China, Japan and other countries outside of the United States.
 
Intellectual Property 
 
We strive to protect and enhance the proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are commercially important to our business, including seeking, maintaining and defending patent rights. We also rely on know-how that may be important to the development of our business. We additionally expect to rely on regulatory protection afforded through data exclusivity, market exclusivity and patent term extensions where available.
 
Our commercial success may depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business, as well as our ability to defend and enforce our patents and to operate without infringing the valid enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties.
 
Our ability to prevent third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing competing products to ours, including a competitor to vonapanitase, depends on the scope of our patents. We have several patents and patent applications relating to the vonapanitase formulation and its therapeutic uses, and we possess substantial know-how relating to the development and commercialization of vonapanitase. We cannot be sure that any of our pending patent applications or future patent filings will lead to the issuance of new patents, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be adequate to protect our market.
 
We plan on pursuing in-licensing opportunities to develop, strengthen and maintain our proprietary position for our products. We expect to use trademark protection for our products as they are marketed.
 
Patents 
 
As of December 31, 2018, we own 41 issued patents and 15 pending patent applications. The patents and applications primarily fall into two families, a first relating to the vonapanitase formulation and its manufacture and use, as well as other formulations of elastases (the “formulation family”), and the second relating to certain therapeutic uses of vonapanitase, and associated systems and kits that include a catheter and are suitable for a subset of those therapeutic uses (the “therapy family”). The formulation family includes two issued United States patents, two issued European patents, additional patents issued in Australia, China, Hong Kong, India, Israel, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Russia, South Korea and Taiwan, and patent applications pending in several major jurisdictions worldwide, including Japan, China, South Korea, Brazil, Mexico, Europe and the United States. The expected expiration date for any patents that have issued or may issue from the formulation family is December 4, 2028, exclusive of possible patent term extension available for one patent covering vonapanitase under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments or comparable provisions in other jurisdictions, except in the United States where our two formulation family patents were awarded patent term adjustments of 199 and 668 days, respectively, due to United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO delays taking their expiration dates to June 20, 2029 and October 3, 2030, respectively. The therapy family includes eight issued United States patents, three issued European patents, one issued Canadian patent, one issued Hong Kong patent, and an application pending in the United States. The expected expiration date for any patents that have issued or may issue from the therapy family patents is September 24, 2020, except in the United States where several patents were awarded a patent term adjustment and the expected expiration date of two therapy family patents related to systems and kits including elastase and a catheter is June 30, 2021, exclusive of possible patent term extension.
Patent Term 
 
The base term of a U.S. patent is 20 years from the filing date of the earliest-filed non-provisional patent application from which the patent claims priority. The term of a U.S. patent can be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates the owner of the patent for administrative delays at the USPTO. In some cases, the term of a U.S. patent is shortened by terminal disclaimer that reduces its term to that of an earlier-expiring patent.
 
The term of a U.S. patent may be eligible for patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Amendment, to account for at least some of the time a product is under development and regulatory review after the patent is granted. With regard to a product for which FDA approval is the first permitted marketing of the active ingredient, the Hatch-Waxman Act allows for extension of protection of one U.S. patent that includes at least one claim covering the composition of matter of an FDA-approved product, an FDA-approved method of treatment using the product, and/or a method of manufacturing the FDA-approved product. The extended protection cannot exceed the shorter of five years beyond the non-extended expiration of the patent or 14 years from the date of the FDA approval of the product. Some foreign jurisdictions, including Europe, have analogous patent extension provisions, which allow for extension of the protection of a patent that covers a drug approved by the applicable foreign regulatory agency. In the future, if and when vonapanitase receives FDA approval, we expect to apply for patent extension to extend the protection of one of our patents covering vonapanitase or its use.

Assignment of Rights and License Agreement 
 
As successor to Proteon Therapeutics, LLC by merger, we acquired all of the assets of the LLC, including all of the intellectual property rights in a patent family entitled “Local, Transcatheter Delivery of Proteases to Reopen Obstructed Biological Conduits” (the “JHU patent family”). This patent family was originally developed by our founder, Dr. F. Nicholas Franano, at The Johns Hopkins University, or Johns Hopkins, and includes United States patent Nos. 7,063,838; 7,153,505; 7,361,335; 7,632,494; 7,883,699; 8,524,226; 8,562,983; and 8,568,716. Johns Hopkins assigned all of the intellectual property rights to Dr. Franano who in turn assigned the rights to the LLC. Under the terms of the assignment of rights and license agreement with Johns Hopkins, Dr. Franano reimbursed certain costs of Johns Hopkins and agreed to pay the future costs and expenses of patent prosecution and maintenance, as well as any costs related to infringement. In addition, under the agreement, Dr. Franano granted to Johns Hopkins rights to practice under the intellectual property rights for non-profit purposes. Our rights are further subject to any rights the United States Government may have in inventions that are the subject matter of the acquired patents under the Bayh Dole Act due to its sponsorship of research that led to certain of such inventions. The agreement does not specify a term and does not include any termination provisions. Dr. Franano agreed that upon commercialization of the assigned invention, he would remit to Johns Hopkins 2.5% of any revenues or fees received from certain net sales of any product covered by the JHU patent family. We assumed, and are the successor to, all of Dr. Franano's payment and other obligations to Johns Hopkins. Seven U.S. patents in the JHU patent family, and their foreign counterparts, described above as the therapy family, relate to certain therapeutic uses of vonapanitase, and the associated systems and kits that include a catheter and are suitable for a subset of those therapeutic uses.
Competition 
 
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. We face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions.
 
Some of our potential competitors have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Smaller or early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies.
 
The key competitive factors that will differentiate vonapanitase, if approved, are likely to be its efficacy, safety, convenience, price, and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors. Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, more convenient or less expensive than products that we may develop. Our competitors may also obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours.
 
We are not aware of products approved in the United States or Europe that would compete with vonapanitase for the improvement of fistula use for hemodialysis and secondary patency. We are aware of other therapies in development by companies including Vascular Therapies, Enceladus Pharmaceuticals, Symic Biomedical, Aplagon and Athera Biotechnologies. In addition, we are aware of companies that have received FDA marketing authorization for catheter-based devices for percutaneous fistula creation, including Becton, Dickinson and Company (as successor to TVA Medical) and Avenu Medical. We are also aware of companies developing vascular access technologies, including BioConnect Systems, Phraxis, Brookhaven Medical, Fist Assist, Laminate Medical Technologies and Stent Tek. Other technologies in development include new synthetic grafts, including those that may be developed by companies that currently compete in the graft market, such as W.L. Gore, C.R. Bard and Maquet; tissue engineered grafts, including those in development by Cytograft and Humacyte; and stem cells. Finally, vonapanitase’s commercial success could be adversely affected by the development of technologies to improve the outcomes of interventions to restore patency, including stents, stent grafts and drug-coated balloons.
 
Government Regulation and Approval 
 
United States—FDA process 
 
In the United States, pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Biological products used for the prevention, treatment, or cure of a disease or condition of a human being are subject to regulation under the FDCA, except the section of the FDCA which governs the approval of new drug applications, or NDAs. Biological products, such as vonapanitase, are approved for marketing under provisions of the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, via a BLA. The application process and requirements for approval of BLAs are very similar to those for NDAs, and biologics are associated with similar approval risks as drugs. Failure to comply with applicable United States requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending NDAs or BLAs, warning or untitled letters, clinical holds, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties and criminal prosecution.

Approval process 
 
FDA approval is required before any new unapproved product or a product with certain changes to a previously approved product may be marketed in the United States. FDA approval is required before any new unapproved drug, which includes biologics, or dosage form, including a new use of previously approved products, can be marketed in the United States. The steps required to be completed before a drug or biologic may be marketed in the United States include:
 

• | preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies, and formulation studies, all performed in accordance with the FDA's Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, regulations;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an IND application for human clinical testing, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin and must be updated annually;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug or biologic for each indication to FDA's satisfaction;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of a BLA;
--+--------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the drug or biologic is produced to assess compliance with cGMP regulations;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of FDA clinical site data audits; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of the BLA.
--+------------------------------------

 
Satisfaction of FDA pre-market approval requirements typically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity, and novelty of the product or disease.
 
Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation, and toxicity, as well as animal trials to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including GLP. The results of preclinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND along with other information, including information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls, and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Long term preclinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted.
 
A 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. If the FDA has neither commented on nor questioned the IND within this 30-day period, the clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin. However, the FDA may within the 30-day time period raise concerns or questions relating to one or more proposed clinical trials and place the clinical trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. Accordingly, submission of an IND may or may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence. A separate submission to an existing IND must also be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development.
 
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug or biologic to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted: (i) in compliance with federal regulations; (ii) in compliance with good clinical practice, or GCP, an international standard meant to protect the rights and health of patients and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators, and monitors; as well as (iii) under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing on United States patients and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND.
 
The FDA may order the temporary, or permanent, discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time, or impose other sanctions, if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. The trial protocol and informed consent information for patients in clinical trials, including any changes to the protocols and informed consent forms, must also be submitted to an institutional review board, or IRB, for approval. An IRB may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB's requirements or if the trial poses an unexpected serious harm to subjects, or may impose other conditions.
 
Clinical trials to support NDAs or BLAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. In Phase 1, the initial introduction of the drug or biologic into a limited population of healthy human subjects or patients, the product is tested to assess metabolism, pharmacokinetics, pharmacological actions, side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, early evidence on effectiveness. Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population to evaluate preliminarily the effectiveness of the drug or biologic for a particular indication, dosage tolerance, and optimum dosage, and to identify common adverse effects and safety risks. If a compound demonstrates evidence of effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 evaluations, Phase 3 trials are undertaken in a larger number of patients, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to provide substantial evidence of clinical efficacy, to further test for safety in an expanded and diverse patient population, to permit the FDA to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug or biologic and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product. In reviewing an NDA or a BLA, the FDA will consider all information submitted in the NDA or BLA, including the results of all clinical trials conducted. In most cases, the FDA requires two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug or biologic. A single Phase 3 trial with other confirmatory evidence such as supportive results from Phase 1 and Phase 2 trials, including non-prespecified analyses, may be sufficient in rare instances where the trial is a large multicenter trial demonstrating internal consistency and a statistically very persuasive finding of a clinically meaningful effect on mortality, irreversible morbidity or prevention of a disease with a potentially serious outcome and confirmation of the result in a second trial would be practically or ethically impossible.

In addition, the manufacturer of an investigational drug in a Phase 2 or Phase 3 clinical trial for a serious or life-threatening disease is required to make available, such as by posting on its website, its policy on evaluating and responding to requests for expanded access to such investigational drug.
 
Progress reports detailing the status of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA, and safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious, related and unexpected side effects.  Progress and safety reporting must also be submitted to the applicable IRBs.   NDA or BLA applicants must also report certain investigator financial interests to FDA.
 
The manufacture of investigational drugs and biologics for the conduct of human clinical trials is subject to cGMP requirements.  Investigational drugs, biologics, and active pharmaceutical ingredients imported into the United States are also subject to regulation by the FDA relating to their labeling and distribution.  Further, the export of investigational drug products and biologics outside of the United States is subject to regulatory requirements of the receiving country as well as U.S. export requirements under the FDCA.
 
Sponsors must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the product and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements.  The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, purity, and potency of the final product.  Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
 
After completion of the required clinical testing, an NDA or BLA is prepared and submitted to the FDA. FDA approval of the NDA or BLA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the United States. The NDA or BLA must include, among other things, the results of all trials and preclinical testing, and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the product's pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture, and controls, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings. The cost of preparing and submitting an NDA or BLA is substantial. The submission of most NDAs and BLAs is additionally subject to a substantial application user fee, currently $2,588,478 for Fiscal Year 2019, and the applicant under an approved new drug or biologic application is also subject to an annual program fee, currently exceeding $300,000 per product for Fiscal Year 2019. Beginning in Fiscal Year 2018, this annual program fee replaces the annual product and establishment fees. These fees are typically increased annually.  A waiver or reduction of the application, establishment and/or program fees may be obtained under certain limited circumstances.  For instance, one basis for a waiver of the application user fee is if the applicant employs fewer than 500 employees, including employees of affiliates, the applicant does not have an approved marketing application for a product that has been introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce, and the applicant, including its affiliates, is submitting its first marketing application. In addition, an application for a drug that has obtained orphan designation is not subject to an application fee unless the application includes an indication for a non-rare disease or condition.
 
The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA or BLA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency's threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA or BLA for filing.  In this event, the NDA or BLA must be re-submitted with the additional information.  The re-submitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing.  Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of NDAs and BLAs. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, the FDA has a goal of responding to 90% of standard review original BLAs within ten months after the 60-day filing review period, but this timeframe is only a goal and, thus, the review time may be longer or extended. Priority review can be applied to drugs and biologics that the FDA determines are for a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. FDA has the review goal of completing review of 90% of original BLA priority review applications within six months of the 60-day filing review period.  The review process for both standard and priority review may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider certain late-submitted information, or information intended to clarify information already provided in the submission.
 
The FDA may also refer applications for novel drug or biologic products, or drug or biologic products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to an advisory committee—typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts—for review, evaluation, and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations.  Before approving a drug or biologic for which no active ingredient (including any ester or salt of active ingredients) has previously been approved by the FDA, the FDA must either refer that drug or biologic to an external advisory committee or provide in an action letter, a summary of the reasons why the FDA did not refer the product candidate to an advisory committee.
 
The FDA reviews an NDA or BLA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe, pure, and potent for its intended use and whether the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packaged or held, as well as the manufacturing processes and controls, meet standards designed to ensure the product's continued identity, strength, safety, quality, purity, and potency Before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. Additionally, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug or biologic is manufactured. FDA will not approve the product unless compliance with cGMP is satisfactory and the NDA or BLA contains data that provide evidence that the drug or biologic is safe and effective in the indication studied.  
 

22

After the FDA evaluates the NDA or BLA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application is not ready for approval. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional clinical data and/or other significant, expensive, and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, preclinical studies and/or manufacturing. The FDA has committed to reviewing resubmissions of the NDA or BLA addressing such deficiencies in two or six months depending on the type of information included. Even if such data are submitted, however, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA or BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval.
 
An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug or biologic with specific prescribing information for specific indications. If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages, or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, for example to specific patient populations or age groups.  Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, including boxed warnings. As a condition of NDA or BLA approval or following approval, the FDA may require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, to help ensure that the benefits of the drug or biologic outweigh the potential risks. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use, or ETASU. ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patient registries. The requirement for REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. Moreover, product approval may also be conditioned on substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the product's safety or efficacy. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing.
 
Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA or BLA or NDA or BLA supplement before the change can be implemented. An NDA or BLA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing NDA or BLA supplements as it does in reviewing NDAs or BLAs, including user fee requirements for certain submissions. As with new NDAs, the review process is often significantly extended by the FDA requests for additional information or clarification.
 
U.S. Patent Term Restoration 
 
Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of the FDA approval of vonapanitase and any future product candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term, often referred to as patent term extension, of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product's approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA or BLA plus the time between the submission date of an NDA or BLA and the approval of that application. The period of the patent term restoration may also be reduced to account for time that an applicant did not act with due diligence. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug or biologic is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves or denies the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we intend to apply for extension of patent term for one of our patents covering vonapanitase to add patent life beyond its current expected expiration date.
 
Post-approval requirements 
 
Once an NDA or BLA is approved, a product will be subject to certain post-approval requirements. For instance, the FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs and biologics, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet. Drugs and biologics may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising, and potential civil and criminal penalties.
 
In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products, including samples, is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, which regulates the distribution of drugs, biologics and drug and biologic samples at the federal level. Both the PDMA and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution.
 
Adverse event reports, deviation reports, and other annual reports are required following FDA approval of an NDA or BLA. The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, REMS, and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product, or the FDA may place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. In addition, quality control, drug and biologic manufacture, packaging, and labeling procedures must continue to conform to cGMPs after approval. Drug and biologic manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies. Registration with the FDA subjects entities to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA, during which the agency inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMPs. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the areas of production and quality-control to maintain compliance with cGMPs. Regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals or request product recalls if a company fails to comply with regulatory standards, if it encounters problems following initial marketing, or if previously unrecognized problems are subsequently discovered.

Moreover, the Drug Quality and Security Act, or DSCSA, imposes obligations on manufacturers of pharmaceutical products related to product tracking and tracing. Among the requirements of the DSCSA, manufacturers are required to provide certain information regarding the product to individuals and entities to which product ownership is transferred, will be required to label products with a product identifier and are required to keep certain records regarding the product for a period of six years. The transfer of information to subsequent product owners by manufacturers will eventually be required to be done electronically.  Manufacturers are also required to verify that purchasers of the manufacturers' products are appropriately licensed.  Further, under the DSCSA, manufacturers must establish procedures for the investigation, quarantine, disposition, and FDA and trading partner notification requirements. These procedures relate to suspicious, counterfeit, diverted, stolen and intentionally adulterated products that would result in serious adverse health consequences or death to humans, as well as products that are the subject of fraudulent transactions or which are otherwise unfit for distribution such that they would be reasonably likely to result in serious health consequences or death.
 
Orphan Drug designation 
 
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant Orphan Drug designation to drugs or biologics intended to treat a rare disease or condition—generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals annually in the United States for a preventive drug.  Additionally, sponsors must present a plausible hypothesis for clinical superiority to obtain Orphan Drug designation if there is a product already approved by the FDA that is intended for the same indication and that is considered by the FDA to be the same drug or biologic as the already approved drug or biologic. This hypothesis must be demonstrated to obtain orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan Drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA or BLA. After the FDA grants Orphan Drug designation, the generic identity of the drug or biologic and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan Drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical study costs, tax advantages, and user-fee waivers. The first NDA or BLA applicant to receive FDA approval for a particular drug or biologic to treat a particular disease with FDA Orphan Drug designation is entitled to a seven-year exclusive marketing period in the United States for that product, for that indication. During the seven-year exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug or biologic for the same disease, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity, that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantity of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug or biologic for the same disease or condition, or the same drug or biologic for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of Orphan Drug designation are tax credits for certain research, waiver of the NDA or BLA application user fee, and exclusion from price limitations imposed by the 340B drug discount program on sales of covered outpatient drugs to certain categories of hospitals added to the program by the Affordable Care Act.
 
Expedited development and review programs
 
The FDA maintains several programs intended to facilitate and expedite development and review of new drugs and biologics to address unmet medical needs in the treatment of serious or life- threatening diseases or conditions. These programs include Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation, Priority Review designation and Accelerated Approval, and the purpose of these programs is to provide important new drugs to patients earlier than under standard FDA review procedures.
 
Under the Fast Track program, the sponsor of a new drug or biologic candidate may request that the FDA designate the candidate for a specific indication as a fast track drug or biologic concurrent with, or after, the filing of the IND for the candidate. The FDA determines if the drug or biologic candidate qualifies for Fast Track designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsor's request. Under the Fast Track program, sponsors have more opportunities to interact with FDA, and fast track product candidates may be eligible for Priority Review, if they meet the Priority Review criteria.  If FDA determines, after preliminary evaluation of clinical data submitted by a sponsor, that a fast track product may be effective, FDA may also permit the sponsor to submit a marketing application on a rolling basis before the full application is complete. This rolling review is available if the applicant provides, and the FDA approves, a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the applicant pays applicable user fees. However, the FDA's time period goal for reviewing an application does not begin until the last section of the NDA or BLA is submitted. Additionally, the Fast Track designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process.
 
In addition, a new drug or biologic may be eligible for Breakthrough Therapy designation if it is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. Breakthrough Therapy designation provides all the features of Fast Track designation in addition to intensive guidance on an efficient drug development program and FDA organizational commitment to expedited development, including involvement of senior managers and experienced review staff in a cross-disciplinary review, where appropriate. The FDA must determine if the biological product qualifies for breakthrough therapy designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsor’s request.

Any product submitted to the FDA for marketing, including a product with Fast Track or Breakthrough Therapy designation, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as Priority Review and Accelerated Approval. Any application for a product that treats a serious or life-threatening condition is eligible for Priority Review if the product would provide safe and effective therapy where no available therapy exists or a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease compared to marketed products, among other things. The FDA aims to review applications for new products designated for Priority Review within six months, compared to ten months under standard review. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new drug or biological product designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate such review. Additionally, a drug or biological product that treats a serious or life-threatening illness and that generally provides meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive Accelerated Approval, which means the FDA may approve the product based upon a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. In clinical trials, a surrogate endpoint is a measurement of laboratory or clinical signs of a disease or condition that substitutes for a direct measurement of how a patient feels, functions, or survives. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. A drug or biologic candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase 4 or post-approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing studies, will allow the FDA to withdraw the drug or biologic from the market on an expedited basis. All promotional materials for drug or biologic candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by the FDA.
 
Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation, Priority Review designation and Accelerated Approval do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or review process. We have received Breakthrough Therapy and Fast Track designations for vonapanitase.
 
Pediatric information 
 
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, NDAs or BLAs or supplements to NDAs or BLAs for a new active ingredient, indication, dosage form, dosage regimen or route of administration must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug or biologic for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the drug or biologic is safe and effective. The FDA may grant full or partial waivers, or deferrals, for submission of data. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any drug or biologic for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted except a product with a new active ingredient that is molecularly targeted cancer product intended for the treatment of an adult cancer and directed at a molecular target determined by FDA to be substantially relevant to the growth or progression of a pediatric cancer that is subject to an NDA or BLA submitted on or after August 18, 2020.
 
Pediatric exclusivity is another type of exclusivity in the United States. For biological products, pediatric exclusivity, if granted, provides an additional six months of exclusivity to be attached to any existing non-patent exclusivity. This six month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric trial that fairly responds to an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a trial.
 
Additional controls for biologics 
 
To help reduce the increased risk of the introduction of adventitious agents, the PHSA emphasizes the importance of manufacturing controls for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The PHSA also provides authority to the FDA to immediately suspend licenses in situations where there exists a danger to public health, to prepare or procure products in the event of shortages and critical public health needs, and to authorize the creation and enforcement of regulations to prevent the introduction or spread of communicable diseases in the United States and between states.
 
After a BLA is approved, the product may also be subject to official lot release as a condition of approval. As part of the manufacturing process, the manufacturer is required to perform certain tests on each lot of the product before it is released for distribution. If the product is subject to official release by the FDA, the manufacturer submits samples of each lot of product to the FDA together with a release protocol showing the results of all of the manufacturer's tests performed on the lot. The FDA may also perform certain confirmatory tests on lots of some products before releasing the lots for distribution by the manufacturer.
 
In addition, the FDA conducts laboratory research related to the regulatory standards on the safety, purity, potency, and effectiveness of biological products. As with drugs, after approval of biologics, manufacturers must address any safety issues that arise, are subject to recalls or a halt in manufacturing, and are subject to periodic inspection after approval.

Biosimilars 
 
The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA, creates an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products shown to be highly similar to or interchangeable with an FDA-licensed reference biological product. Biosimilarity sufficient to reference a prior FDA-approved product requires a high similarity to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components, and no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency. Biosimilarity must be shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and at least one clinical trial, absent a waiver by the Secretary of Health and Human Services.  There must be no difference between the reference product and a biosimilar in conditions of use, route of administration, dosage form, and strength.  A biosimilar product may be deemed interchangeable with a prior approved product if it meets the higher hurdle of demonstrating that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product and, for products administered multiple times, the biologic and the reference biologic may be switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. The first biosimilar was approved by the FDA in 2015,and no interchangeable products have been approved by the FDA under the BPCIA. Complexities associated with the larger, and often more complex, structures of biological products, as well as the process by which such products are manufactured, pose significant hurdles to implementation which are still being evaluated by the FDA.
 
A reference biologic is granted 12 years of exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the reference product, and no application for a biosimilar can be submitted for four years from the date of licensure of the reference product.  However, certain changes and supplements to an approved BLA, and subsequent applications filed by the same sponsor, manufacturer, licensor, predecessor in interest, or other related entity do not qualify for the twelve year exclusivity period.  The PHSA also includes provisions to protect reference products that have patent protection. The biosimilar product sponsor and reference product sponsor may exchange certain patent and product information for the purpose of determining whether there should be a legal patent challenge. Based on the outcome of negotiations surrounding the exchanged information, the reference product sponsor may bring a patent infringement suit and injunction proceedings against the biosimilar product sponsor.  The first biologic product submitted under the abbreviated approval pathway that is determined to be interchangeable with the reference product has exclusivity against a finding of interchangeability for other biologics for the same condition of use for the lesser of (i) one year after first commercial marketing of the first interchangeable biosimilar, (ii) eighteen months after the first interchangeable biosimilar is approved if there is no patent challenge, (iii) eighteen months after resolution of a lawsuit over the patents of the reference biologic in favor of the first interchangeable biosimilar applicant, or (iv) 42 months after the first interchangeable biosimilar's application has been approved if a patent lawsuit is ongoing within the 42-month period.
 
Disclosure of clinical trial information 
 
Sponsors of clinical trials of FDA-regulated products, including drugs and biologics, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, trial sites and investigators, and other aspects of the clinical trial is then made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to discuss the results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed in certain circumstances for up to two years after the date of completion of the trial. Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of development programs.
 
European Union—EMA process 
 
In the European Union, medicinal products are authorized following a similar demanding process as that required in the United States and applications are based on the ICH Common Technical Document, an agreed upon format to assemble all quality, safety and efficacy data for preparation of an application of a new drug. Prior to submitting a European Marketing Authorization Application, or MAA, it is necessary to gain approval of a detailed Pediatric Investigation Plan, or PIP, with the European Medicines Agency's Pediatric Committee, or PDCO. After gaining PIP approval, medicines can be authorized in the European Union by using either the centralized authorization procedure or national authorization procedures.
 
Centralized procedure 
 
Under the centralized procedure, after the EMA issues an opinion, the European Commission issues a single marketing authorization valid across the European Union, as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. The centralized procedure is compulsory for human medicines that are:  derived from biotechnology processes, such as genetic engineering; contain a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative disorders or autoimmune diseases and other immune dysfunctions; and officially designated orphan medicines. For medicines that do not fall within these categories, an applicant has the option of submitting an application for a centralized marketing authorization to the EMA, as long as the medicine concerned is a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation, or if its authorization would be in the interest of public health.
 

26

National authorization procedures 
 
There are also two other possible routes to authorize medicinal products in several countries, which are available for products that fall outside the scope of the centralized procedure:
 

• | Decentralized procedure. Using the decentralized procedure, an applicant may apply for simultaneous authorization in more than one European Union country of a medicinal product that has not yet been authorized in any European Union country and that does not fall within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Mutual recognition procedure. In the mutual recognition procedure, a medicine is first authorized in one European Union Member State, in accordance with the national procedures of that country. Thereafter, further marketing authorizations can be sought from other European Union countries in a procedure whereby the countries concerned agree to recognize the validity of the original, national marketing authorization. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
While we believe that our development program, our Phase 3 trial design, and overall nonclinical and clinical data package could support future regulatory approval of vonapanitase in the European Union, we have not submitted such information to the European Union for their review.
 
Good manufacturing practices 
 
Like the FDA, the EMA, the competent authorities of the European Union Member States and other regulatory agencies regulate and inspect equipment, facilities and processes used in the manufacturing of pharmaceutical and biologic products prior to approving a product. If, after receiving clearance from regulatory agencies, a company makes a material change in manufacturing equipment, location, or process, additional regulatory review and approval may be required. Once we or our partners commercialize products, we will be required to comply with cGMP, and product-specific regulations enforced by, the European Commission, the EMA and the competent authorities of European Union Member States following product approval. Also like the FDA, the EMA, the competent authorities of the European Union Member States and other regulatory agencies also conduct regular, periodic visits to re-inspect equipment, facilities, and processes following the initial approval of a product. If, as a result of these inspections, it is determined that our or our partners' equipment, facilities, or processes do not comply with applicable regulations and conditions of product approval, regulatory agencies may seek civil, criminal or administrative sanctions and/or remedies against us, including the suspension of our manufacturing operations or the withdrawal of our product from the market.
 
Data and market exclusivity 
 
Similar to the United States, there is a process for authorization of generic versions of innovator drug products in the European Union. Abridged applications for the authorization of generic versions of drugs authorized by EMA can be submitted to the EMA through a centralized procedure referencing the innovator's data and demonstrating bioequivalence to the reference product, among other things.
 
New medicinal products in the European Union can receive eight years of data exclusivity coupled with two years of market exclusivity, and a potential one year extension, if the marketing authorizations holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications that demonstrates “significant clinical benefit” in comparison with existing therapies; this system is usually referred to as “8+2+1”. We expect to be eligible for at least 10 years of market exclusivity following any approval of vonapanitase.
 
Abridged applications cannot rely on an innovator's data until after expiry of the eight year data exclusivity term; applications for a generic product can be filed but the product cannot be marketed until the end of the market exclusivity term.
 
Other international markets—drug approval process 
 
In some international markets (e.g., China or Japan), although data generated in United States or European Union trials may be submitted in support of a marketing authorization application, additional clinical trials conducted in the host territory, or studying people of the ethnicity of the host territory, may be required prior to the filing or approval of marketing applications within the country.
 
Pricing and reimbursement 
 
In the United States and internationally, sales of products that we market in the future, and our ability to generate revenues on such sales, are dependent, in significant part, on the availability and level of reimbursement from third-party payors such as state and federal governments, managed care providers and private insurance plans. Substantial uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved healthcare products by third-party payors. In the United States no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug and biologic products exists. Accordingly, decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided for any of our products will be made on a payor by payor basis. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our product candidates to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained.
 

27

Private insurers, such as health maintenance organizations and managed care providers, have implemented cost-cutting and reimbursement initiatives and likely will continue to do so in the future. These include establishing formularies that govern the drugs and biologics that will be offered and also the out-of-pocket obligations of member patients for such products. Several third-party payors are requiring that drug and biologic companies provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices, are using preferred drug lists (which include biologics) to leverage greater discounts in competitive classes, are disregarding therapeutic differentiators within classes, and are challenging the prices charged for drugs and biologics.  It is possible that some third party payors may not consider our technology to be a significant benefit in a clinical and cost effectiveness comparison with other technologies or techniques intended to address the same conditions as our product candidates and reimbursement may not be available to our customers, or may not be sufficient to allow our products to be marketed on a competitive basis. Cost-control initiatives could cause us to discount or rebate a portion of the price we might establish for products, which could result in lower than anticipated product revenues. If the realized prices for our products, if any, decrease or if governmental and other third party payors do not provide adequate coverage or reimbursement, our prospects for revenue and profitability will suffer.
 
In addition, particularly in the United States and increasingly in other countries, we may be required to provide mandatory discounts and pay fixed rebates to state and federal governments and agencies in connection with purchases of our products that are used or reimbursed by such entities. Rebates also must be paid to the governments of U.S. territories on drugs that are reimbursed by Medicaid in the territories. It is possible that future legislation in the United States and other jurisdictions could be enacted which could potentially impact the reimbursement rates for the products we are developing and may develop in the future and also could further impact the levels of discounts and rebates paid to federal and state government entities. Any legislation that impacts these areas could impact, in a significant way, our ability to generate revenues from sales of products that, if successfully developed, we bring to market. The Medicaid program also imposes penalties on manufacturers of drugs marketed under an NDA or abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, and biological products marketed under a BLA in the form of mandatory additional rebates if commercial prices increase at a rate greater than the Consumer Price Index-Urban. In addition, biological products approved under BLAs and drugs approved under NDAs are generally subject to greater discounts and reporting obligations under federal programs, such as the Federal Supply Schedule, or FSS, than generic drugs approved under ANDA, although biosimilars are generally treated the same as the reference biologic. These rebates and/or discounts, which can be substantial and may equal the selling price in some cases, may impact our ability to raise commercial prices. Government authorities and third party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medications, which could affect our ability to sell our product candidates profitably. It is also not uncommon for market conditions to warrant multiple discounts to different customers on the same unit, such as purchase discounts to institutional care providers and rebates to the health plans that pay them, which reduces the net realization on the original sale.
 
There is no legislation at the European Union level governing the pricing and reimbursement of medicinal products in the European Union other than in relation to the transparency and timing of national decision making and the availability of appeal. As a result, the competent authorities of each of the 28 European Union Member States have adopted individual strategies regulating the pricing and reimbursement of medicinal products in their territory. These strategies often vary widely in nature, scope and application. However, a major element that they have in common is an increased move towards reduction in the reimbursement price of medicinal products, a reduction in the number and type of products selected for reimbursement and an increased preference for generic products over innovative products. These efforts have mostly been executed through these countries' existing price control methodologies. It is increasingly common in many European Union Member States for Marketing Authorization Holders to be required to demonstrate through health technology assessment the pharmaco-economic superiority of their products as compared to products already subject to pricing and reimbursement in specific countries. In order for drugs to be evaluated positively under such criteria, pharmaceutical companies may need to re-examine, and consider altering, a number of traditional functions relating to the selection, study, and management of drugs, whether currently marketed, under development, or being evaluated as candidates for research and/or development.
 
Sales and marketing, and other healthcare related activities
 
Sales, promotion and other activities following product approval are subject to regulation by numerous regulatory authorities in addition to the FDA, including, in the United States, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, other divisions of the Department of Health and Human Services, the U.S. Department of Justice, and similar foreign, state, and local government authorities.
 
As described above, the FDA regulates all advertising and promotion activities for products under its jurisdiction both prior to and after approval. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy that are approved by the FDA in labeling. Physicians may prescribe legally available drugs and biologics for uses that are not described in the product's labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. These off-label uses are common across medical specialties, and often reflect a physician's belief that the off-label use is the best treatment for the patients. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments, but FDA regulations do impose stringent restrictions on manufacturers' communications regarding off-label uses. Failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements may subject a company to adverse publicity, enforcement action by the FDA, corrective advertising, consent decrees and the full range of civil and criminal penalties available to the FDA.

In the United States sales, marketing and scientific/educational programs must also comply with various federal and state laws pertaining to healthcare “fraud and abuse,” including anti-kickback laws and false claims laws. Anti-kickback laws make it illegal for a prescription manufacturer to solicit, offer, receive, or pay any remuneration in exchange for, or to induce, the referral of business, including the purchase or prescription of a particular drug or biologic. The term ‘‘remuneration’’ has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, formulary managers, and beneficiaries on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are narrowly drawn. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases, or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not meet the requirements of a statutory or regulatory exception or safe harbor. Several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the statute has been violated. Due to the breadth of the statutory provisions and the absence of guidance in the form of regulations and very few court decisions addressing industry practices, it is possible that our practices might be challenged under anti-kickback or similar laws. Moreover, healthcare reform legislation has strengthened these laws. For example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or ACA, among other things, amends the intent requirement of the federal anti-kickback and criminal healthcare fraud statutes to clarify that a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it. In addition, ACA clarifies that the government may assert that a claim that includes items or services resulting from a violation of the federal anti-kickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act.
 
The civil False Claims Act prohibits anyone from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented for payment, to third-party payors (including Medicare and Medicaid) claims for reimbursed drugs (including biologics) or services that are false or fraudulent, claims for items or services not provided as claimed, or claims for medically unnecessary items or services. A claim includes ‘‘any request or demand’’ for money or property presented to the United States government, and may be predicated on false certification of compliance with a statute or regulation that is a condition of payment. The False Claims Act also applies to false submissions that cause the government to be paid less than the amount to which it is entitled, such as a rebate. Intent to deceive is not required to establish liability under the civil False Claims Act. Several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies’ marketing of products for unapproved, and thus non-covered, uses, and for underpaying rebates by concealing their best price. In addition, federal health care programs require drug and biologic manufacturers to report pricing information, which is used to quantify discounts and establish reimbursement rates.   Civil False Claims Act actions may be brought by the government or may be brought by private individuals on behalf of the government, called “qui tam” actions. The False Claims Act provides for trebling of actual damages and a penalty for each false claim the manufacturer submitted or caused to be submitted, which, when aggregated, can yield substantial liability,
 
In addition to the Anti-Kickback Statute and the civil False Claims Act, there are a number of other laws that we may be subject to due to the nature of our business.  The criminal False Claims Act prohibits the making or presenting of a claim to the government knowing such claim to be false, fictitious, or fraudulent and, unlike the civil False Claims Act, requires proof of intent to submit a false claim. The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, prohibits, among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a health care benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a health care offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. As discussed above, ACA amended the intent standard for HIPAA’s healthcare fraud provision such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
 
The civil monetary penalties statute further imposes penalties against any person or entity who, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent.
 
Section 1927 of the Social Security Act requires that manufacturers of drugs and biological products covered by Medicaid report pricing information to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, on a monthly and quarterly basis, including the best price available to any customer of the manufacturer, with certain exceptions for government programs, and pay prescription rebates to state Medicaid programs based on a statutory formula and derived from reported pricing information.  In addition, many states authorize their Medicaid programs to establish Preferred Drug Lists (which include biologics) to leverage supplemental Medicaid rebates.  Reporting false pricing information may cause underpayment of rebates or overpayment of pharmacies that are reimbursed by Medicaid on the basis of reported prices and has been the basis of numerous civil, as well as criminal False Claims Act cases against manufacturers.
 
The Veterans Health Care Act, or VHCA, requires manufacturers of covered drugs and biologics participating in the Medicaid program to report certain non-federal pricing information from which a mandatory purchase discount is derived and to enter into FSS contracts with the Department of Veterans Affairs through which their covered drugs and biologics must be sold to certain federal agencies at the statutory price.  This necessitates compliance with applicable federal procurement laws and regulations and subjects us to contractual remedies as well as administrative, civil, and criminal sanctions.  In addition, the VHCA requires manufacturers participating in Medicaid to agree to provide different mandatory discounts to certain Public Health Service grantees and other safety net hospitals and clinics.

The federal and state governments further regulate the payments made to physicians and other health care providers. The ACA created new federal requirements for reporting, by applicable manufacturers of covered drugs and biologics, payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals, and report annually certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and other healthcare providers and their immediate family members. The reported data are posted in searchable form on a public website on an annual basis. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties. Effective January 1, 2022, we will also be required to report on transfers of value to physician assistants, nurse practitioners or clinical nurse specialists, certified registered nurse anesthetists, and certified nurse-midwives.
 
We may also be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and its implementing regulations, imposes specified requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Penalties for violating HIPAA include civil penalties, criminal penalties, and imprisonment. Among other things, HITECH, through its implementing regulations, makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to ‘‘business associates,’’ defined as a person or organization, other than a member of a covered entity’s workforce, that creates, receives, maintains or transmits protected health information on behalf of a covered entity for a function or activity regulated by HIPAA. HITECH also strengthened the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same requirements, thus complicating compliance efforts.
 
There further may be state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by federal laws, thus complicating compliance efforts. There are also an increasing number of state laws with requirements for manufacturers and/or marketers of pharmaceutical products. Some states require the reporting of expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of drug products and the reporting of gifts and payments to individual healthcare practitioners in these states. Other states prohibit various marketing-related activities, such as the provision of certain kinds of gifts or meals. Still other states require the reporting of certain pricing information, including information pertaining to and justification of price increases, or prohibit prescription drug price gouging. In addition, states such as California, Connecticut, Nevada, and Massachusetts require pharmaceutical companies to implement compliance programs and/or marketing codes. Many of these laws contain ambiguities as to what is required to comply with the laws.
 
Our activities relating to our products may be subject to scrutiny under these laws. Violations of fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by criminal and civil sanctions, including fines and civil monetary penalties, the possibility of exclusion from federal healthcare programs (including Medicare and Medicaid) and corporate integrity agreements, which impose, among other things, rigorous operational and monitoring requirements on companies. Similar sanctions and penalties also can be imposed upon executive officers and employees, including criminal sanctions against executive officers under the so-called “responsible corporate officer” doctrine, even in situations where the executive officer did not intend to violate the law and was unaware of any wrongdoing.
 
Given the significant penalties and fines that can be imposed on companies and individuals if convicted, allegations of such violations often result in settlements even if the company or individual being investigated admits no wrongdoing. Settlements often include significant civil sanctions, including fines and civil monetary penalties, and corporate integrity agreements. If the government were to allege or convict us or our executive officers of violating these laws, our business could be harmed. In addition, private individuals have the ability to bring similar actions. Our activities could be subject to challenge for the reasons discussed above and due to the broad scope of these laws and the increasing attention being given to them by law enforcement authorities. Further, there are an increasing number of state laws that require manufacturers to make reports to states on pricing and marketing information. Many of these laws contain ambiguities as to what is required to comply with the laws. Given the lack of clarity in laws and their implementation, our reporting actions could be subject to the penalty provisions of the pertinent state authorities.
 
Depending on the circumstances, failure to comply with these laws can also result in penalties, including criminal, civil and/or administrative criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, debarment from government contracts and future orders under existing contracts, refusal to allow us to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our business.
 
Similar rigid restrictions are imposed on the promotion and marketing of medicinal products in the European Union and other countries. Laws (including those governing promotion, marketing, anti-kickback and personal data provisions), industry regulations and professional codes of conduct often are strictly enforced. Even in those countries where we are not directly responsible for the promotion and marketing of our products, inappropriate activity by our international distribution partners can have adverse implications for us.

Other laws and regulatory processes 
 
We are subject to a variety of financial disclosure and securities trading regulations as a public company in the United States, including laws relating to the oversight activities of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC and, following the listing of our capital stock on the NASDAQ Global Market, the regulations of the NASDAQ Global Market. In addition, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, the SEC and other bodies that have jurisdiction over the form and content of our accounts, our financial statements and other public disclosure are constantly discussing and interpreting proposals and existing pronouncements designed to ensure that companies best display relevant and transparent information relating to their respective businesses.
 
Our international operations are subject to compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or the FCPA, which prohibits corporations and individuals from paying, offering to pay, or authorizing the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party, or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business or to otherwise influence a person working in an official capacity. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring the company to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations. We also may be implicated under the FCPA for activities by our partners, collaborators, CROs, vendors or other agents. Activities that violate the FCPA, even if they occur wholly outside the United States, can result in criminal and civil fines, imprisonment, disgorgement, oversight, and debarment from government contracts.
 
Our present and future business has been and will continue to be subject to various other laws and regulations.
