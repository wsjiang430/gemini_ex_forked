Vision, Mission and Strategy
Our Vision
To be the global leader in total cash management, route-based logistics and payment services. 

Our Strategy
Our strategy is to:

• | Accelerate profitable growth ("APG")


• | Close the gap with operational excellence ("CTG")


• | Introduce differentiated services ("IDS")

We will accelerate profitable growth by:

• | growing high-value services


• | growing account share with existing customers


• | increasing our focus on smaller financial institutions


• | penetrating the large, unvended retail market


• | exploring core and adjacent acquisition opportunities

We have opportunities to grow revenue in higher-margin lines of business such as money processing outsourcing, CompuSafe® services and recyclers, and Brink’s global services. Our plan calls for growing revenue with both large and small financial institutions, and increasing penetration of the large and underserved retail market. We also have the financial flexibility to pursue accretive acquisitions in both core and adjacent markets.
Close the gap with operational excellence by: 

• | exceeding customer expectations


• | leading our industry in safety and security


• | increasing operational productivity to achieve operational excellence

We are on track in our efforts to improve internal productivity, optimize cost and achieve industry-leading margins. 
Introduce differentiated services through:

• | leveraging uniform, best-in-class global technology base for logistics and operating systems


• | offering end-to-end cash supply chain managed services


• | launching a customer portal and app to support value-added, fee-based services

The third component of our strategy is to introduce differentiated services to our customers by strengthening and leveraging our IT capabilities. Our IT strategy and systems will also drive improved service levels and operational efficiencies. 
The actions taken to execute the components of our strategy include internal breakthrough initiatives such as more efficient vehicles, one-person crews and more effective IT processes leading to lower operating costs. We have also completed eight acquisitions in our core markets.

Services
We design customized services to meet the cash and valuables supply chain needs of our customers.  We enter into contracts with our customers to establish pricing and other terms. Cash-in-transit and ATM contracts usually cover an initial term of at least one year and in many cases one to three years, and generally remain in effect thereafter until canceled by either party.  Contracts for cash management services are typically longer.  Following are descriptions of our service offerings: 
Core Services (49% of total revenues in 2018) 
Cash-in-transit ("CIT") and ATM services are core services we provide to customers throughout the world. We charge customers per service performed or based on the value of goods transported.  Revenues are affected by the level of economic activity in various markets as well as the volume of business for specific customers.  Core services generated approximately $1.7 billion of revenues in 2018 ($1.6 billion in 2017 and $1.5 billion in 2016).
Cash-in-transit services – Serving customers since 1859, our success in CIT is driven by a combination of rigorous security practices, high-quality customer service, risk management and logistics expertise.  Cash-in-transit services generally include the secure transportation of:

• | cash between businesses and financial institutions, such as banks and credit unions


• | cash, securities and other valuables between commercial banks, central banks and investment banking and brokerage firms


• | new currency, coins, bullion and precious metals for central banks and other customers

ATM services – We manage 128,400 ATMs worldwide.  We provide customers who own and operate ATMs a variety of service options.  Basic ATM management services include cash replenishment and first and second line maintenance.  We also provide comprehensive services for ATM management including cash replenishment, replenishment forecasting, cash optimization, ATM remote monitoring, service call dispatching, transaction processing, installation services, and first and second line maintenance.
High-Value Services (45% of total revenues in 2018)
Our Core Services, combined with our brand and global infrastructure, provide a broad platform from which we offer additional high-value services, which generated approximately $1.6 billion of revenues in 2018 ($1.5 billion in 2017 and $1.3 billion in 2016).
Global services - Brink’s global services ("BGS") is the leading global provider of secure transport of highly-valued commodities including diamonds, jewelry, precious metals, securities, currency, high-tech devices, electronics and pharmaceuticals.  Our specialized diamond and jewelry operations have offices in the world’s major diamond and jewelry centers. Serving customers in more than 100 countries, BGS provides secure transportation services including pick-up, packaging, customs clearance, secure vault storage and inventory management. BGS uses a combination of armored vehicles and secure air and sea transportation.  
Cash management services - We offer a variety of cash management services, depending on customers’ unique needs. These include:

• | money processing (e.g., counting, sorting, wrapping, checking condition of bills, etc.) and other cash management services


• | services related to deploying and servicing “intelligent” safes and safe control devices, including our patented CompuSafe® service 


• | check imaging services

Other cash management services include cashier balancing, counterfeit detection, account consolidation and electronic reporting.  Retail and bank customers use Brink’s to count and reconcile coins and currency, prepare bank deposit information and replenish coins and currency in specific denominations.
Brink's offers a fully integrated approach to managing customers' supply chain of cash.  These services include logistical support from point-of-sale through transport, vaulting, bank deposit and related credit reporting.  We also offer a variety of technology applications including online cash tracking, cash inventory management, check imaging for real-time deposit processing, and a variety of other web-based tools that enable banks and other customers to reduce costs while improving service to their customers. We believe the quality and scope of our money processing and information systems differentiate our cash management services from competitive offerings.
Brink’s CompuSafe® service –We manage 34,500 installed Compusafes devices worldwide. Brink’s CompuSafe® service provides an integrated, closed-loop system for minimizing theft and managing cash.  We market CompuSafe® services to a variety of cash-intensive customers including convenience stores, gas stations, restaurants, retail chains and entertainment venues.  In a majority of instances, once the specialized safe is installed, the customer’s employees deposit currency into the safe’s cassettes, which can only be officially removed by Brink’s personnel or in some instances, securely by customer employees.  Upon removal, the cassettes are securely transported to a vault for processing where contents are verified and transferred for deposit.  Our CompuSafe® service features currency-recognition and counterfeit-detection technology, multi-language touch screens and in some instances, an electronic interface between the point-of-sale, back-office systems and external banks.  Our electronic reporting interface with external banks enables customers to receive same-day credit on their cash balances, even if the cash remains on the customer’s premises. 
Vaulting services.  Vaulting services combine cash-in-transit services, cash management services, vaulting and electronic reporting technologies to help banks expand into new markets while minimizing investment in vaults and branch

facilities.  In addition to providing secure storage, we process deposits, provide check imaging and reconciliation services, perform currency inventory management, process ATM replenishment orders and electronically transmit banking transactions.
Payment services – We provide convenient payment services, including bill payment processing, mobile phone top-up, and Brink’s Money™ prepaid cards. 
Bill payment processing services include bill payment acceptance and processing services on behalf of utility companies and other billers. Consumers can pay bills, top-up prepaid mobile phones and manage accounts at retail agent locations that we operate on behalf of utility companies, banks and a small number of leased payment locations. This service is offered at over 24,300 locations in Brazil, Colombia, Panama and Mexico.
We offer Brink’s Money™ general purpose reloadable prepaid cards and payroll cards to consumers and employers in the U.S. Our general purpose reloadable cards are sold to consumers through our direct-to-consumer marketing efforts while our payroll cards are sold to employers who use them to pay employees electronically. Brink’s Money™ cards can be used at stores, restaurants, online retailers, and at ATMs worldwide. This product is targeted to the millions of unbanked and under-banked Americans looking for alternative financial products.  
Other Security Services (6% of total revenues in 2018)
Guarding – We protect airports, offices, warehouses, stores, and public venues with or without electronic surveillance, access control, fire prevention and trained patrolling personnel. Other security services generated approximately $0.2 billion of revenues in 2018 ($0.2 billion in 2017 and 2016).
We offer security and guarding services in Luxembourg, Greece and Brazil.  A portion of this business involves long-term contracts related primarily to security services at airports and embassies.  Generally, guarding contracts are for a one-year period, and the majority of contracts are extended.
Commercial security systems – We provide commercial security system services in designated markets in Europe.  Our security system design and installation services include alarms, motion detectors, closed-circuit televisions, digital video recorders, and access control systems, including card and biometric readers, electronic locks, and turnstiles.  We may also provide monitoring services after systems have been installed.
Industry and Competition
Brink’s competes with large multinational, regional and smaller companies throughout the world.  Our largest multinational competitors are G4S plc (U.K.); Loomis AB (Sweden); Prosegur, Compania de Seguridad, S.A. (Spain); and Garda World Security Corporation (Canada).
We believe the primary factors in attracting and retaining customers are security expertise, service quality, and price.  Our competitive advantages include:

• | brand name recognition


• | reputation for a high level of service and security


• | risk management and logistics expertise


• | global network and customer base


• | proven operational excellence, and


• | high-quality insurance coverage and financial strength

Although we face competitive pricing pressure in many markets, we resist competing on price alone.  We believe our high levels of service, security expertise and value-added solutions differentiate us from competitors.
Insurance Coverage
The availability of high-quality and reliable insurance coverage is an important factor in our ability to attract and retain customers and manage the risks inherent in our business.  We purchase insurance coverage for losses in excess of what we consider to be prudent levels of self-insurance.  Our insurance policies cover losses from most causes, with the exception of war, nuclear risk and certain other exclusions typical in such policies.
Insurance for security is provided by different groups of underwriters at negotiated rates and terms.  Premiums fluctuate depending on market conditions.  The security loss experience of Brink’s and, to a limited extent, other armored carriers affects our premium rates.

Service Mark and Patents
BRINKS is a registered service mark in the U.S. and certain foreign countries.  The BRINKS mark, name and related marks are of material significance to our business.  We own patents for safes and related services, iDeposit and Daily Credit processes, including our integrated CompuSafe® service, which expire between 2022 and 2033.  These patents provide us with important advantages. However, we are not dependent on the existence of these patents.
We have licensed the Brink’s name to a limited number of companies, including a company that provides residential smart home and home security services and a distributor of security products (padlocks, door hardware, etc.) to customers through major retail chains. 
Government Regulation
Our U.S. operations are subject to regulation by the U.S. Department of Transportation with respect to safety of operations, equipment and financial responsibility.  Intrastate operations in the U.S. are subject to state regulation.  Operations outside of the United States are regulated to varying degrees by the countries in which we operate.
Employee Relations
At December 31, 2018, our company had approximately 62,400 full-time and contract employees, including approximately 11,700 employees in the United States (of whom approximately 3,000 were classified as part-time employees) and approximately 50,700 employees outside the United States.  At December 31, 2018, Brink’s was a party to nine collective bargaining agreements in Canada with various local unions covering approximately 1,400 employees.  The agreements have various expiration dates from 2019 to 2022.  Outside of Canada, approximately 49% of employees are represented by trade union organizations.  We believe our employee relations are satisfactory.
Business Divestitures
Below is a summary of the significant businesses we exited in the last three years.  These divestitures did not meet the criteria for classification as discontinued operations. Operating results for these businesses are included in continuing operations for all periods presented, as applicable. We continue to operate our global services business in each of these countries.

• | In September 2016, we shut down the remaining operations in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. During 2016, we incurred approximately $16 million in losses as we exited these operations. These losses included $5 million in severance costs and $2 million in property impairment charges. During 2017, additional losses incurred related to the Ireland operations were not significant.

Reorganization and Restructuring
In the fourth quarter of 2016, management implemented restructuring actions across our global business operations and our corporate functions (“2016 Reorganization and Restructuring”). As a result of these actions, we recognized $18.1 million in related 2016 costs and an additional $17.3 million in 2017 under this restructuring related to severance, asset-related adjustments, a benefit program termination and lease terminations. We recognized an additional $13.0 million of costs in 2018 under this restructuring for severance costs and asset-related adjustments. The actions under the 2016 Reorganization and Restructuring were substantially completed in 2018, with cumulative pretax charges of approximately $48 million. Severance actions reduced our global workforce by approximately 800 positions. 
Management initiated a global restructuring of our business in the third quarter of 2015 (“2015 Reorganization and Restructuring”). We recognized $6.5 million of costs in 2016 related to this restructuring for severance costs, contract terminations and lease terminations. The 2015 Reorganization and Restructuring reduced the global workforce by approximately 1,100 positions and resulted in approximately $20 million in 2016 cost savings. The actions under this program were substantially completed by the end of 2016, with cumulative pretax charges of approximately $18 million.
Executive Leadership and Board of Directors Restructuring
In January 2016, Brink’s entered into an agreement (the "Starboard Agreement") with Starboard Value LP and its affiliates ("Starboard"). As a result, our former Chief Executive Officer ("CEO"), Thomas C. Schievelbein, stepped down in May 2016, and two of the Company’s directors (including the Company’s independent lead director at that time) retired from the Board. Pursuant to the Starboard Agreement, among other things, the Board appointed three new independent directors and delegated to the Board’s Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee the responsibility to oversee the Board's process to search for a new CEO. In June 2016, the Board appointed Douglas A. Pertz as the Company’s president and CEO and as a member of the Board. In July 2016, Ronald J. Domanico replaced Joseph W. Dziedzic as Chief Financial Officer. In 2016, we recognized $4.3 million in costs related to the Executive Leadership and Board of Directors restructuring, primarily severance costs. 
Other Restructurings 
Management periodically implements restructuring actions in targeted sections of our business. As a result of these actions, we recognized costs of $4.6 million in 2017 and $7.6 million in 2018, primarily severance costs. For the current restructuring actions, we expect to incur additional costs between $5 million and $7 million in future periods. These estimates will be updated as management targets additional sections of our business.
