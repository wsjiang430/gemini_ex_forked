Pending Acquisition of Finisar Corporation
 
II-VI and Finisar have entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of November 8, 2018 (the “Merger Agreement”). Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, Mutation Merger Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of II-VI, will be merged with and into Finisar, and Finisar will continue as the surviving corporation in the merger and a wholly owned subsidiary of II-VI (the “Merger”).
 
If the Merger is consummated, Finisar stockholders will be entitled to receive, at their election, consideration per share of common stock of Finisar (the “Finisar Common Stock”) consisting of (i) $26.00 in cash, without interest (the “Cash Consideration”), (ii) 0.5546 shares of II-VI common stock (the shares, the “II-VI Common Stock,” and the consideration, the “Stock Consideration”), or (iii) a combination of $15.60 in cash, without interest, and 0.2218 shares of II-VI Common Stock (the “Mixed Consideration,” and, together with the Cash Consideration and the Stock Consideration, the “Merger Consideration”). The Cash Consideration and the Stock Consideration are subject to proration adjustment pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement such that the aggregate Merger Consideration will consist of approximately 60% cash and approximately 40% II-VI Common Stock assuming a per share price of II-VI common stock equal to the price when the Merger Agreement was signed on November 8, 2018, which was $46.88 per share.
 
At the effective time of the Merger (the “Effective Time”), each option granted pursuant to Finisar’s 2005 Stock Incentive Plan, as such plan has been further amended and restated (each, a “Finisar Stock Option”), or portion thereof, that is outstanding and unexercised as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (whether vested or unvested) will be cancelled, terminated and converted into the right to receive an amount of Mixed Consideration that would be payable to a holder of such number of shares of Finisar Common Stock equal to the quotient of (i) the product of (a) the excess, if any, of $26.00 over the exercise price per share of such Finisar Stock Option multiplied by (b) the number of shares of Finisar Common Stock subject to such Finisar Stock Option, divided by (ii) $26.00.

At the Effective Time, each restricted stock unit granted pursuant to Finisar’s 2005 Stock Incentive Plan, as such plan has been further amended and restated (each, a “Finisar Restricted Stock Unit”), or portion thereof , that is outstanding and subject to a performance-based vesting condition that relates solely to the value of Finisar Common Stock will, to the extent such Finisar Restricted Stock Unit vests in accordance with its terms in connection with the Merger (the “Participating RSUs”), be cancelled and extinguished and converted into the right to receive the Cash Consideration, the Stock Consideration or the Mixed Consideration at the election of the holder of such Participating RSUs, subject to proration adjustment. 
 
At the Effective Time, each Finisar Restricted Stock Unit (or portion thereof) that is outstanding and unvested, does not vest in accordance with its terms in connection with the Merger and is either (x) subject to time-based vesting requirements only or (y) subject to a performance-based vesting condition other than the value of Finisar Common Stock will be assumed by II-VI (each, an “Assumed RSU”). Each Assumed RSU will be subject to substantially the same terms and conditions as applied to the related Finisar Restricted Stock Unit immediately prior to the Effective Time, including the vesting schedule (and the applicable performance-vesting conditions in the case of a grant contemplated by clause (y) of the preceding sentence) and any provisions for accelerated vesting applicable thereto, except that the number of shares of II-VI Common Stock subject to each Assumed RSU will be equal to the product of (i) the number of shares of Finisar Common Stock underlying such unvested Finisar Restricted Stock Unit award as of immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (ii) the sum of (a) 0.2218 plus (b) the quotient obtained by dividing (1) $15.60 by (2) the volume weighted average price per share of II-VI Common Stock (rounded to the nearest cent) on the Nasdaq Global Select Market for the ten consecutive trading days ending on (and including) the third trading day immediately prior to the Effective Time (with the resulting number rounded down to the nearest whole share).
 
II-VI filed with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-4 relating to the Merger, and that registration statement became effective in accordance with the provisions of Section 8(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, on February 7, 2019. Shareholders of II-VI and stockholders of Finisar voted to approve proposals related to the Merger at special meetings held on March 26, 2019 by the respective companies. 
 
The waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, with respect to the Merger has expired without a request for additional information.  Other regulatory approvals applicable to the Merger have been obtained in Germany, Mexico and Romania.  
 
The completion of the Merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain additional customary closing conditions, including review and approval of the Merger by the State Administration for Market Regulation in China. The Company is planning to refile with the State Administration for Market Regulation in China, extending the approval period. Subject to the satisfaction or waiver of each of the closing conditions, II-VI and Finisar expect that the Merger will be completed in the second half of calendar 2019.  However, it is possible that factors outside the control of both companies could result in the Merger being completed at a different time or not at all. 
 
On November 8, 2018, in connection with its entry into the Merger Agreement, II-VI entered into a commitment letter (together with a related fee letter) with Bank of America, N.A., which was subsequently amended and restated on December 7, 2018 and on December 14, 2018 (together with one or more related fee letters, the “Commitment Letter”). Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Commitment Letter, the lender parties thereto severally committed to provide 100% of up to $2.425 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior secured credit facilities of II-VI.
 On March 4, 2019, II-VI entered into a Credit Agreement, dated as of March 4, 2019 (as amended, the “New Credit Agreement”), by and among the Company, Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent, Swing Line Lender and an L/C Issuer, and the other lenders party thereto. II-VI also entered into Amendment No. 1 to Credit Agreement, dated as of May 24, 2019, by and among the Company, Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent, and the other lenders party thereto, which includes the final results of the syndication of the Term A Facility (as defined below).  Pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions therein, the New Credit Agreement provides for senior secured financing of $1.705 billion in the aggregate, consisting of (i) a five-year senior secured first-lien term A loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $1.255 billion (the “Term A Facility”) and (ii) a five-year senior secured first-lien revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $450.0 million (the “Revolving Credit Facility” and together with the Term A Facility, the “New Senior Credit Facilities”). The New Credit Agreement also provides for a letter of credit sub-facility not to exceed $25.0 million and a swing loan sub-facility initially not to exceed $20.0 million, subject to adjustment in accordance with the terms of the New Credit Agreement. II-VI anticipates using the proceeds from the Term A Facility, together with a separately committed term B loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $720.0 million (the “Term B Facility”) and cash and short-term investments of II-VI and Finisar, to pay the cash portion of the merger consideration payable in connection with the Merger and related fees and expenses. II-VI currently does not intend to draw on the Revolving Credit Facility in order to fund the cash portion of the merger consideration payable in connection with the Merger.
 6


The funding obligations of the lenders under the New Senior Credit Facilities are subject to certain currently unsatisfied conditions, including the consummation of the Merger. Accordingly, no borrowings are currently outstanding under the New Senior Credit Facilities, and II-VI currently is not able to borrow under the New Senior Credit Facilities. Further, II-VI expects that the New Credit Agreement will be amended prior to the consummation of the Merger to reflect syndication of the Term B Facility and to finalize certain other terms in the New Credit Agreement. Upon the consummation of the Merger, the New Senior Credit Facilities, governed by the New Credit Agreement as it may be amended as of such time, will be used (i) to refinance in full the Amended Credit Facility (as defined in Note 9 to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K) and (ii) on or after the date of the consummation of the Merger, to repay amounts owed in connection with Finisar’s outstanding convertible notes, currently in an aggregate principal amount outstanding of $575.0 million, including with the proceeds of a portion of the Term A Facility which will be available to II-VI for a certain period after the initial funding under the New Senior Credit Facilities.
 Unless and until the Merger is consummated and the other currently unsatisfied conditions to the funding obligations of the lenders under the New Senior Credit Facilities are satisfied or waived, the Amended Credit Facility remains in effect in accordance with its terms.

Manufacturing Processes
 Our success in developing and manufacturing many of our products depends on our ability to manufacture and to tailor the optical and physical properties of technically challenging materials and components. The ability to produce, process, and refine these complex materials and to control their quality and in-process yields is an expertise of the Company that is critical to the performance of our customers’ subsystems and systems. In the markets we serve, there are a limited number of high-quality suppliers of many of the components we manufacture, and there are very few industry-standard products. 
 Our network of worldwide manufacturing sites allows us to manufacture our products in regions that provide cost-effective and risk management advantages. We employ numerous advanced manufacturing technologies and systems at our manufacturing facilities. These include metal–organic chemical vapor deposition and molecular beam epitaxy reactors, automated computer numeric control optical fabrication, high-throughput thin-film coaters, nanoprecision metrology, and custom-engineered automated furnace controls for crystal growth processes. Manufacturing products for use across the electromagnetic spectrum requires the capability to repeatedly produce products with high yields to atomic tolerances. II-VI continuously updates its comprehensive quality management systems that feature manufacturing quality best practices. II-VI is committed to delivering products within specification, on time, and with high quality, with a goal of fully satisfying customers and continually improving.

Sources of Supply
 Among the major feed stock and raw materials we use are zinc, selenium, ZnSe, ZnS, hydrogen selenide, hydrogen sulfide, arsine, phosphine, hydrogen, silon, tellurium, yttrium oxide, aluminum oxide, iridium, platinum, bismuth, silicon, thorium fluoride, antimony, carbon, graphite, GaAs, InP, copper, germanium, molybdenum, quartz, optical glass, and diamond. 
 The continued high quality of and access to these materials is critical to the stability and predictability of our manufacturing yields. We test materials at the onset and throughout the production process. Additional research and capital investment may be needed to better define future material specifications. We have not experienced significant production delays due to shortages of materials. However, we do occasionally experience problems associated with vendor-supplied materials not meeting contract specifications for quality or purity. As discussed in greater detail in Item 1A – Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, significant failure of our suppliers to deliver sufficient quantities of necessary high-quality materials to our specifications on a timely basis could have a materially adverse effect on our results of our operations.

Our Markets 
 Our market-focused businesses are organized by technology and products. Our businesses are composed of the following primary markets: communications, materials processing, aerospace and defense, semiconductor capital equipment, life sciences, consumer electronics, and automotive. 
 Communications Market
II-VI’s optical communications products and technologies enable the next generation of high-speed optical transmission systems, networks, and datacenter solutions necessary to meet the accelerating global bandwidth demand. At the core of both terrestrial and undersea optical networks, our market-leading 980 nm pump lasers boost the power of the optical signal in the fiber optic cable at intervals along the way to enable a larger number of high-speed signals to be transmitted over longer distances. Our latest generation of 980 nm pump lasers along with miniature tunable filters and hybrid passives is part of our ultracompact family of components critical to a new generation of small-size, long-reach DWDM transmission modules operating at 100, 200, and 400 Gb/s.
 Customers continue to rely on us for our industry-leading optical amplification and embedded monitoring solutions for their next-generation ROADM systems to compensate for inherent signal loss and to monitor signal integrity. Our proprietary OTDR modules allow systems to automatically detect and pinpoint issues along the transmission path in real time. The accelerating adoption of applications such as cloud computing is driving the rapid growth of datacenter buildouts. Our high-speed 25 Gb/s VCSELs enable intra-datacenter transceivers to transmit and receive signals. Our miniature WDM thin-film filter assemblies are used to increase the bandwidth within 100 GbE transceivers by combining wavelengths at the transmitter end and separating them out at the receiver end.
 In mobile wireless applications, II-VI supplies base SiC substrates to customers who manufacture RF power amplifier devices that are embedded in remote radio heads in 4G wireless base stations to boost the power of the RF signal before it reaches the antenna. These devices are also widely expected to be embedded in next-generation active antennas for 5G wireless, where multiple devices per antenna will be required to enable higher bandwidth. SiC has a high number of intrinsic physical and electronic advantages, such as high thermal conductivity, that enables it to operate at high power levels and still dissipate the excess heat generated. 
 Materials Processing Market
 Our industrial laser optics and solutions for the materials processing market remain in strong demand. There continues to be a steady global demand to support existing installations and new deployments of CO2 and fiber laser systems. Our vertically integrated and market-leading ZnSe optics and components, due to their inherent low loss at around 10-micron wavelength, have enabled high-power CO2 laser systems for many decades and remain critical to the steady stream of new deployments as well as to continued operation, serving as replacement optics for the installed base of CO2 lasers. II-VI continues to introduce products that address new and growing applications for low-power CO2 lasers, such as cutting textiles, leather, wood, and other organic materials, for which the CO2 laser’s 10-micron wavelength is ideally suited. CO2 lasers are also at the core of EUV lithography systems, which are now emerging on the market to enable a new generation of smaller and more powerful personal integrated circuits for internet of things computing devices.
 Over the past several years, fiber laser-based systems operating at 1-micron wavelength in pulsed or continuous mode have taken a central role in nearly all materials processing segments, especially for precision machining such as marking and micro-drilling. From the laser chips that generate the input optical power to the beam delivery systems that direct the output optical power to the target, II-VI supplies a broad set of laser optics and fused fiber products that enable many functions within these systems. The same set of II-VI products is also at the core of existing and emerging direct-diode laser systems. II-VI is also driving innovation with a direct-diode laser engine small enough to be mounted on a robotic arm so that the end user can apply square beams directly to the workpiece at wavelengths optimized for aluminum processing.
 II-VI’s broad portfolio of coated optics and crystal materials serve all of these growing laser markets.
 Aerospace and Defense Market
II-VI aerospace and defense optical products and technologies enable targeting, night vision, and navigation as well as intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance systems. Moreover, our recently acquired optical beam combining and directing technologies, along with our fiber laser components, are enabling High Energy Laser (HEL) systems and applications.
 Multiple fighter jets are equipped with our large-area sapphire windows that surround advanced electro-optical targeting and imaging systems. Infrared domes are used on missiles with infrared guidance systems ranging from small human-portable designs to larger designs mounted on helicopters, fixed-wing aircraft, and ground vehicles. High-precision domes are an integral component of a missile’s targeting system, providing efficient tactical capability while serving as a multi-functional protective cover for its internal components. 
 12


Rotary and fixed-wing aircraft also use missile warning systems to protect against the threat of shoulder-fired human-portable missiles. Our competencies in materials growth for UV crystals and our optical assembly capabilities provide significant support to these common missile warning systems. A key attribute of several of these systems is the ability to filter electromagnetic interference using microfine conductive mesh patterns. This technology is also applied to non-optical applications for absorbing and transmitting energy from the surfaces of aircraft and missiles.
 Many aerospace and defense systems employ laser designation and range-finding capabilities supported by our semiconductor laser bars and solid state laser host crystals and laser optics, all manufactured in-house, and benefit from our competency in short-wave infrared and visible optics. Our thermoelectric coolers are used to increase thermal imaging sensitivity or to maintain a constant window temperature in various visible and infrared applications for night vision and sighting applications. 
 We provide a range of battlefield-ready technologies for soldier equipment and specifically designed variants for law enforcement. Our precision patterned reticles can be embedded in rifle scopes. Our reaction-bonded boron carbide materials are shaped into torso plates and employed as in-aircraft cabin and protective body armor. Our thermoelectric coolers are used to regulate the soldier’s body heat. They are also used to convert heat produced by battlefield fuel burners into electrical power, for example, to extend battery life on the battlefield.
 We maintain engineering and manufacturing facilities in the United States with strictly controlled access that are dedicated to our U.S. government supported contracts.
 Semiconductor Capital Equipment Market
Semiconductor capital equipment requires advanced materials to meet the need for tighter tolerances, enhanced thermal stability, faster wafer transfer speeds, and reduced stage settling times. Our metal-matrix composites and reaction-bonded ceramics enable these applications, thanks to their optimum combination of light weight, strength, hardness, and coefficient of thermal expansion. Our reaction-bonded SiC materials are used to manufacture wafer chucks, lightweight scanning stages, and high-temperature corrosion-resistant wafer support systems. Our cooled SiC mirrors and precision patterned reticles are used in the illumination systems of lithography tools.
 In the emerging market of EUV lithography systems, CO2 lasers are used to generate extreme-ultraviolet light. These CO2 lasers and beam delivery systems leverage our broad portfolio of CO2 laser optics, CdTe modulators, and high-power damage-resistant polycrystalline CVD diamond windows to route the powerful laser beam to a tin droplet from which EUV light will emanate. Due to its very high mechanical and thermal performance characteristics, our reaction-bonded SiC is used in structural support systems that are integral to EUV lithography optics to meet critical requirements for optical system stability.
Life Sciences Market
 The majority of our business in the life sciences end market is in analytical tools. Many analytical tools found in modern biotech laboratories are based on some form of interaction with light. This applies to flow cytometry, cell sorting, confocal microscopy, DNA genome sequencing, Raman spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, and particle sizing, to name a few. Our multicolored laser engines along with our broad portfolio of application-specific optics, filters, and gratings are embedded in these analytical tools. We also supply objective lenses, precision patterned reticles, and assemblies for microscopes.
 Genome sequencing involves temperature-cycling DNA in flow cells with a high degree of temperature uniformity and precision. We believe that our thermal engines are the state of the art in chiller technology, and they achieve what we believe to be industry-leading temperature control and uniformity across large areas. Our green lasers are used to excite the fluorescence of DNA to reveal its structure. Our flow cells are micromachined with a high degree of precision to ensure the smooth flow of sample fluids undergoing analysis.

Consumer Electronics Market
II-VI manufactures low-cost VCSELs, VCSEL arrays, and filters for the consumer electronics market. Our VCSEL products leverage our world-class 6-inch GaAs platform, combining our epitaxial wafer growth and wafer fabrication capabilities.
 Our VCSELs, unlike many on the market, have already been designed into consumer products such as the computer mouse as well as for menu navigation in smart phones and vehicle steering wheels. Our VCSELs are also widely deployed in datacenters and in the emerging market for HDMI optical cables. This expertise in VCSEL technology is being leveraged for the emerging 3D sensing market. With our acquisitions of 6-inch epitaxy and wafer capabilities, we have invested significantly to round out our capacity expansion.
 Automotive Market
Power-conversion electronics for high-efficiency electric vehicles need a combination of high power density, high efficiency, and high-temperature operation that is only afforded by advanced materials systems based on SiC substrates. Our SiC substrates are available in large diameters and have what we believe to be best-in-class quality and low defect levels.
 Our thermoelectric modules are used to cool batteries to extend their operating life. They are also more efficient than resistive heaters when used in heated car seats and extend an electric vehicle’s range of travel in cold environments.
 To operate safely, self-driving cars will rely on control systems that are informed by a comprehensive number of sensors. One such sensor is based on LiDAR, which employs semiconductor lasers to properly identify and measure the distance to obstacles ahead. Our GaAs-based semiconductor laser platform, which already enables a broad portfolio of products in communications and materials processing, is now being scaled further for consumer electronics and will be leveraged to deliver a highly reliable and cost-effective laser product for this emerging market.
 Marketing and Sales 
 We market our products through a direct sales force and through representatives and distributors around the world. Our market strategy is focused on understanding our customers’ requirements and building market awareness and acceptance of our products. New products are continually being developed and introduced to our new and established customers in all markets. 
 The Company has centralized its worldwide marketing and sales functions across the Company’s business units. Sales offices have been strategically established to best serve and distribute products to our worldwide customer base. There are significant cooperation, coordination, and synergies among our business units, which capitalize on the most efficient and appropriate marketing channels to address diverse applications within our markets.
