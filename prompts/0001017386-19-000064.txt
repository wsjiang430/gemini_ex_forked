Item 1. Business
Company Overview
 
Established in 1998, Newgioco Group is an international commercial-stage, vertically integrated company engaged in various aspects of the leisure gaming industry. We own and operate a state-of-the-art, innovative betting platform software (“Platform”) and are a licensed leisure lottery and gaming operator offering online and offline leisure gaming services, including a variety of lottery and casino gaming products, as well as sports betting products through a distribution network of retail betting locations situated throughout Italy and internationally through various agents in Africa and South America.
 
The Platform, colloquially known as “Elys”, is owned by our subsidiary Odissea Betriebsinformatik Beratung GmbH (“Odissea”) and was developed and built on the latest Microsoft.Net Core framework, supporting both online customer gaming accounts as well as land-based bet processing capability with multi-channel functionality accepting all forms of payment methods (i.e., cash, e-wallet, bank card and wire transfer, etc.) backed by a real-time customer relationship management (“CRM”) and business intelligence (“BI”) program for streamlined cross-platform marketing as well as a synchronized financial accounting processes. Data is communicated directly to on-the-ground sales and marketing agents that manage and maintain both our online and land-based retail distribution. The Platform allows our independent business-to-business (“B2B”) and white-label end users to (i) rapidly and effectively model their gaming businesses and client gaming accounts, (ii) monitor and analyze performance on an ongoing basis, (iii) share dashboards, and (iv) generate management reports all within a fully integrated solution. In addition, our clients can use the built-in artificial intelligence and adaptive business intelligence modules to evaluate actual performance and leverage insights from analytics to make informed, timely decisions to drive future business. The unique ’shop-client’ architecture of the Platform to our knowledge, is the first of its kind in the leisure betting industry. Elys was built around the specific needs of leisure betting opertors through our existing Multigioco distribution throughout Italy.
 
We currently provide retail land-based (onsite) and web-based (online) gaming services through our subsidiaries, Multigioco Srl (“Multigioco”), acquired on August 15, 2014, Rifa Srl (“Rifa”), acquired on January 1, 2015, and Ulisse GmbH (“Ulisse”), acquired on July 1, 2015. These operations are carried out under both land-based and online retail gaming licenses regulated by the Agenzia delle Dogane e dei Monopoli (“ADM”) in Italy, (formerly known as the Amministrazione Autonoma. dei Monopoli di Stato or AAMS), and our Austrian Bookmaker license, that permit us to distribute leisure betting products such as sports betting, lotto tickets, virtual sports betting, online poker and casino gaming products through both physical, land-based retail locations as well as online through our licensed principal website www.newgioco.it or commercial webskins linked to our principal website and through mobile devices. The information contained in, and that can be accessed through, our website is not incorporated into and is not part of this annual report.
 
In Italy, our gaming products and services are offered through the following three distribution methods: (1) agencies (the principal business situated at the location is gaming); (2) corners (the principal business situated at the location is primarily other than gaming); and (3) websites that customers can access through a personal computer (“PC”), tablet or mobile device, or alternatively visit a web-café that is under contract to promote our websites. We use a combination of all three distribution methods and currently service approximately 90,000 online user accounts through the three distribution methods: 1,000 web cafés (or “web-shops”), 7 corners and 172 agency locations.


The following describes the three distribution methods used by us in Italy in greater detail:
 
(1) Negozio Sportivo (“agency”) (translated as Sporting Store): An agency is an arcade location that is a gaming specific venue meeting strict regulatory standards and must have at least 70% of its square-footage dedicated specifically to gaming space. In addition, each Agency must have a cash cage for the primary purpose of gaming and gaming related transactions serving an indefinite number of anonymous walk-in customers.
 
(2) Punto Sportivo (“corner”) (translated as Sporting Point): A corner is distinguished from an agency insofar as the principal business situated at the location is an activity that is primarily different from gaming (such as a coffee shop or bakery) with a terminal connected to the ADM network. The primary purpose of the facility is not gaming, but rather, there is only a small ‘corner’ for extra cash flow in exchange for a fee and/or commission. Specifically, a maximum of 30% of floor space of a corner location can be dedicated to gaming where gaming transactions are collected and processed by a counter clerk.

(3) Punti Virtuali di Recarica (“PVR”; “web-shops”; “web cafe” or “websites”) (translated as Virtual Reload Points): A web shop is a physical location where computers are connected to the web and directed to our website where customers may also make cash deposits that are credited electronically to their online gaming accounts (i.e., virtual account reloading). Customers can play games and wager through their online account while at the web-shop or just re-load their gaming account and play remotely through a PC, tablet or mobile device.
 
Our revenue streams, through our subsidiaries Multigioco, Rifa and Ulisse, consist of wagering and gaming transaction income from online betting and land-based betting shops located throughout Italy, and our revenue stream through our subsidiary, Odissea, consists of the service revenue generated from the provision of our Platform services to third party operators on a B2B basis. We generated revenue of $34.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to revenue of $22.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.
 
Recent Developments 
 
On January 30, 2019, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding ordinary shares of Virtual Generation Limited, a company organized under the laws of Republic of Malta (“VG”) that owns and has developed a virtual gaming software platform (“VGS”), together with all the ordinary shares of Naos Holding Limited, a company organized under the laws of Republic of Malta (“Naos”) that owns 3,999 of the 4,000 issued and outstanding ordinary shares of VG. The sellers included Mr. Luca Pasquini, our Vice President of Technology and a member of our board of directors, and Mr. Gabriele Peroni, our Vice President of Business Development, each of whom owned 800 ordinary shares of Naos (20% of the issued and outstanding shares of Naos).
 
VG is a Gaming Laboratories International (“GLI”) certified virtual sports and gaming software developer with a portfolio of products including: greyhound and horse racing; league play football (i.e., soccer), keno; and American Roulette. In addition, VG’s platform allows for customization for country-specific sports generation including applications in Latin American and African markets as well as unique U.S. tribal games tailored for the U.S. tribal gaming market.
 
VG’s operations, which have been running on our Platform, have grown in the highly competitive virtual sports market from approximately 67,000 tickets in 2014 to over 20 million bet tickets traded in 2018. VG now operates in 12 countries including: Italy, Peru, Nigeria, Paraguay, Albania, Honduras, Colombia, Mexico, Dominican Republic, Uganda, Nicaragua, and Turkey.
 

Pursuant to the purchase agreement that we entered into with the prior owners of the shares of VG and Naos (the “Sellers”), on the closing date, we paid the Sellers Four Million Euro (€4,000,000) (approximately U.S. $4,580,000) in consideration for all the ordinary shares of VG and Naos, which was paid as follows:
 


(i) | a cash payment of One Hundred and Eight Thousand Euro (€108,000) (approximately U.S. $124,000);
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(ii) | the issuance of shares of our common stock valued at Eighty-Nine Thousand Euro (€89,000) (approximately U.S. $102,000); and
-----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(iii) | the delivery of a non-interest bearing promissory note providing for the payment of (a) an aggregate of €2,392,000 (approximately U.S. $2,737,000) in cash in 23 equal and consecutive monthly installments of €104,000 (approximately U.S. $119,000) with the first such payment due and payable on the date that is one (1) month after the closing date; and (b) an aggregate of €1,411,000 (approximately U.S. $1,615,000) in shares of our common stock in seventeen (17) equal and consecutive monthly installments of €83,000 (approximately U.S. $95,000) as determined by the average of the closing prices of such shares on the last ten (10) trading days immediately preceding the determination date of each monthly issuance, commencing on March 1, 2019.
------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In addition, pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement, we agreed to pay the Sellers an earn-out payment to be paid in shares of our common stock within one month from the end of the business year 2019 equal to an aggregate amount of €500,000 (approximately U.S. $570,000), if the amounts of bets made by the users through the VGS platform related to our 2019 fiscal year are at least 5% higher than the amounts of bets made by the users through the VGS platform related to our 2018 fiscal year.

Market Opportunity 
 
According to H2 Gambling Capital, a provider of data and market intelligence regarding the interactive and land-based gambling industry in Europe and the United States, the global online gambling industry’s (including online poker, casino, sports betting, bingo, lotteries and skill-based and other games) gross gaming revenue (“GGR”) has grown from approximately $8.2 billion in 2003 to $53.1 billion in 2018. GGR is defined as wagers, poker rake plus bonuses, promotions, overlays and loyalty rewards, less prizes or winnings. It is estimated that the combined global online gambling GGR could grow to approximately $83 billion by 2025 for a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 7.8%. The overall global gambling market (including online, land-based and tribal casinos) is expected to exceed $600 billion by 2025 while the online gambling segment is expected to increase from approximately 8% of overall GGR in 2010 to about 20% by 2025; while the mobile channel is expected to increase from about 12% of online GGR in 2010 to over 55% by 2025.
 
Until recently, the Interstate Wire Act of 1961, combined with the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act of 1992 (“PASPA”), prohibited sports betting in the U.S. in all but four grandfathered states (Montana, Oregon, Nevada, Delaware). Despite its illegal status, sports betting has been a thriving underground business, with the American Gaming Association (AGA) estimating that $150 billion was wagered on an annual basis illegally on U.S. sports events. By way of example, the 2019 Super Bowl LIII alone drew $6 billion in illegal wagers, with only about $300 million placed legally through Nevada and other legal state bookmakers.
 
In mid-May 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned PASPA in a 6-3 decision that found the law unconstitutional, resulting in it being up to individual states to decide whether to allow its residents to bet on sports. Many states are expected to move quickly to establish sports betting as a means to increase their respective capital resources. While several states have recently passed legislation to allow online gambling, we believe that the U.S. sports betting market will take 5 – 10 years to fully develop. We believe that due to the recent U.S. Supreme Court decision, the United States represents an addressable market opportunity for us with our Elys betting Platform in addition to developing new opportunities in Canada, South America, Africa as well as several European countries.
 
Our Strengths 
 
We have established ourselves as one of the leaders in the Italian leisure betting market. Below are our strengths that we believe will enable us to capture a meaningful share of the global leisure betting market:

1. | Highly Differentiated Technology Platform. Built from the ground-up, the Platform is designed to be a highly flexible and robust sportsbook engine able to cope with the huge demands of today’s betting operators and players. The Platform is designed as an industry specific ‘shop-client’ architecture and can offer any type of sport (or non-sport) event and any type of betting market (i.e., soccer, football, basketball, hockey, baseball, tennis, etc.) in both pre-match and in-game modes across both fixed-odds and pari-mutuel betting styles and through all channels (i.e., online, mobile or land-based). Our proprietary Platform, which we intend to continuously update with gaming technology developments, should address the independent operator’s ability to effectively and inexpensively compete against larger and established franchise operators.
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Market Momentum. We are a pioneer with our unique ‘shop-client’ designed Platform and gaining momentum in the Italian leisure betting market with our fully integrated shop-client based Platform architecture with integrated gaming account, artificial intelligence and business intelligence modules. We currently have approximately 90,000 online user accounts through the three distribution methods: 1,000 web cafés (or “web-shops”), 7 corners, and 172 agency locations.
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | Scalable Platform at Minimal Cost. Our Platform is highly scalable. Expansion of the Platform under our existing infrastructure requires little to no overhead and will create in-house efficiencies for our corporate operations and for our agents and operator clients. Many of the inherent functions and features of our Italian Platform certification have received prior approval and adhere to multi-jurisdictional standards which should enable us to receive certification in new markets and expand into new markets in a timely manner.
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4. | Growing Industry. Online gambling is growing in popularity and consumer confidence and is steadily becoming one of the fastest growing sectors of the e-commerce industry. Gamblers worldwide are broadly preferring Internet channels for their betting activities due to the ease of access offered and safety provided. Extensive usage of digital processes and growing bettor demand is driving the market for online betting platforms. Recent liberalization and state-by-state legislation in the United States has resulted in new opportunities in the United States sports betting market. We anticipate that the United States market will begin to have a strong and steady uptake in active wagers. We further anticipate the first select states (i.e., Nevada, Delaware, New Jersey, Mississippi, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and New Mexico) to provide the regulatory framework and foundation to build upon for other states and locations. In December 2018, New Jersey generated approximately $21 million in revenue from approximately $319 million in sports bet wagers, with Mississippi generating approximately $6.2 million in revenue from approximately $42 million in sports bet wagers. According to a recent study by Eilers & Krejcik Gaming (“EKG”), 32 states will likely have legalized sports gambling within five years and as many as 14 could be ready for legislation within two years. Based on 32 states, EKG estimates that the overall U.S. sports betting market could generate approximately $6 billion in revenue, where a legalized U.S. sports gambling industry could generate an annual handle (turnover) of $100 billion.

5. | Highly Experienced Senior Management Team. We are led by a dedicated and highly experienced senior management team with significant industry experience and proven ability to develop novel solutions. Each of the members of our senior management has more than 20 years of relevant experience and many members of our board of directors have industry experience.
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Strategy 
 
Our goal is to expand our market presence by entering new foreign markets while at the same time further penetrating the Italian and additional European markets. We expect new markets to be a large source of our future growth, in particular, the United States market is one where we intend to offer the use of our Platform to existing commercial and tribal casinos, retail betting operators and franchise enterprises. Principal growth drivers include, but are not limited to:
Development of Foreign Markets
 

· | The U.S. Sports Betting Market. With the recent repeal of the 1992 PASPA law by the U.S. Supreme Court, the U.S. sports betting and online gaming market presents a huge opportunity to deploy our Platform as a Service (PaaS) product to several potential independent and tribal casino and gaming operators throughout the United States. We expect GLI-33 certification (the Gaming Laboratories International technical standard for event wagering systems) of our Platform to be processed in a timely manner as many of the inherent functions and features of our Italian platform certification have received prior approval and adhere to multi-jurisdictional standards. Upon completing the GLI certification and if successful in partnering with a key tribal casino operator, we expect to be well-positioned to commence processing sports bets in the U.S. during 2019. Once our Platform is online and processing live wagers on sports such as American football and basketball (both professional and college level), we believe we will have established a solid foundation to build out our U.S. market strategy.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Mergers and Acquisition in the Global Gaming Industry. In an effort to scale and grow the business, we will evaluate potential acquisitions that can be easily integrated into our business. Our recent acquisition of VG is expected to allow us to expand our product offerings in additional countries. The global gaming industry is still very much fragmented. There has been a significant number of noteworthy consolidations such as: (1) Stars Group/SkyBet/CrownBet/William Hill Australia; (2) Paddy Power/Betfair; (3) Ladbrokes/Coral, GVC/BWIN; and (4) in lottery concentration (IGT/GTECH; as well as others such as Pollard/Innova; NYX Gaming Group/Scientific Games) which we believe provides us with an opportunity to capitalize on the acquisition of smaller operators forced to compete against newly formed larger consolidated entities.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Further Penetration In the Italian Market
 

· | Acquisitions of Smaller Operators. Government legislated consolidation of the regulated Italian lottery and gaming market have driven smaller regional operators in Italy to our licensed brand “New Gioco”TM in both the online and land-based sales channels. The Italian regulated gaming market is the largest in the European Union (“EU”) and is extremely fragmented. It is estimated that about 60% of betting handle (turnover) in Italy is controlled by 5 operators, with the remaining 40% of online handle (turnover) divided between approximately 150 - 200 licensed operators. Recent new regulations in Italy have made it more difficult for smaller regional operators throughout Italy to operate and we believe that our innovative and cost-effective Platform will be a welcome alternative for such smaller regional operators throughout Italy that will not be able to maintain the new standards set out by the Italian regulator on their own.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Organic Growth. The strong and growing Italian online gaming market continues to drive substantial growth in our core operations. The number of monthly average active online gambling players increased by over 25% year over year to 959 thousand out of 2.2 million online gambling players in Italy in 2017. In 2017, the Italian online gaming market grew by approximately 34% on a year over year basis to €1.38 billion (approximately U.S. $1.58 billion). A key characteristic of the Italian market is that the online channel represents only about 7% of the market compared to the UK’s gaming market where 41% comes from online channels. We believe there is ample room for growth in the Italian market.

Products and Services and Distribution Methods
 
Betting Platform
 
We believe that our Platform, engineered and launched by our software development team at Odissea, is a highly efficient, cutting edge betting Platform technology that supports the processing of online client gaming account protocols as well as land-based betting protocols with seamless multi-channel functionality accepting all forms of payment methods (i.e., cash, e-wallet, bank card and wire transfer, etc.) and integrated with a real-time CRM and BI program for streamlined cross-platform marketing as well as a synchronized financial accounting process.
 
Online payment channels for both deposit and withdrawals are as set forth below:
 

· | Player indirect meaning that the customer makes a deposit indirectly to their gaming account through a licensed agent (such as a cash deposit to their gaming account at a web-shop counter (e-credit to player account)).
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Player direct meaning that the customer makes a deposit directly to their own gaming account through one or more of the following methods:
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | All credit card brands;
--+------------------------


o | Debit card (Interac/Bancomat);
--+-------------------------------

--+-----------


o | Postal Money Order;
--+--------------------


o | e-wallet or e-credit transfer.

· | Player direct meaning that the customer pays for the wager in cash, accepted debit or credit cards.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We currently employ a customizable client-focused and cost-effective “hands-on” method, rather than a “general approach” to our Platform design with the goal of empowering our player-facing agents and employees to enhance the players’ experience by allowing personalized dashboard design and customer care for all customer call-in’s to our service agents. We believe that this strategy has been highly effective in the Italian retail betting market and has been instrumental in increasing our revenues, net earnings and player retention.

Other Services and Facilities
 
In addition to complementing gaming offerings originally provided by our acquired operators with our Newgioco branding, we intend to add new products and services with the assistance of gaming specialists, software providers and market research professionals, such as we have done with our acquisition of VG. We believe that we can generate additional revenues by establishing additional marketing centers and kiosks.
Our Target Markets
 
The following table sets forth certain information regarding our target markets and is consistent with on our own internal ad hoc survey we conducted between January 1, 2014 and August 15, 2014.

Age Group | Demographic | Nexus 
----------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
18 – 24 | · Pre-gaming future client · New-gaming audience · Desires experiential, e-gaming, imaginative fantasy games | · A majority of this age group owns a cellular or smart mobile phone with data packages and internet access · Technologically savvy consumer spending more on experiences compared to material goods 
25 – 44 | · Mature-gaming audience · Desires games of chance, casino, traditional gambling tables, and sports betting | · Majority of online gamers are 30 years old and currently heads of households · Male and female balanced across the group 
45 – 79 | · Grounded gamer · Desires social interaction, easy play, bingo slots, nickel games | · Largest growing segment of the population and largest market size · Significantly underserved · Needs are more social interaction rather than self-fulfilling · High disposable income 

 
We currently service approximately 90,000 online user accounts and estimate that our user base will increase to over 100,000 in two years based on projections of both organic growth and acquisitions of existing operators. Our clients range in age from ages 18 through 79 and are a mix of 70% male and 30% female. In addition, we separate our revenue source by (a) sports betting, (b) casino and card game betting and (c) poker. Our in-house analysis indicates that sports betting and casino games are more popular than poker and other card games among our customer base. In addition, sports betting is our most profitable revenue stream yielding the highest percentage of our gross gaming revenue at 51% of revenues, which is representative of industry metrics when measured by completed sports seasons on a year over year basis.
 
Our internal analysis further indicates different gaming patterns among our male and female online users. Male players prefer sports-bets, while approximately 10% of them also explore casino and poker. Conversely, female players prefer casino and bingo while approximately 1% try our other games such as poker, sports-betting or lotteries.
 

· | Sports-Bet: We currently have an average of 5,500 players per month (approximately 22% of our total gaming accounts) that place at least three bets per week, for a total of twelve bets per month per player. The total number of monthly bets on our Platform averages between 160,000 and 180,000 tickets. The average of the amount played per ticket is approximately $8 such that each player that places twelve bets spends approximately $96 per month.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Casino: We have an average of 900 players monthly who participate in our casino games (approximately 2.5% of all gaming accounts and 14.6% of the sports-bet players), with approximately 26% of players playing on our mobile platform. Each casino player generates approximately $3,172 per month of coin-in handle (or turnover) which represents gross gaming revenue (“GGR”) of approximately $99 per player per month. We also use the GGR metric of $99 to measure our casino performance in “spending” of a casino player.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Poker: We have an average of 1,080 players participating in poker games through our website (approximately 3% of all gaming accounts and 19.6% of the sports-bet players) per month. Each poker player generates approximately $3,063 per month of coin-in handle which represents GGR of approximately $109 per player per month. We also use the GGR metric of approximately $109 to measure our casino performance in “spending” of a poker player.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Most of our users are located throughout Italy with the highest concentrations in larger centers such as Rome and Naples.
 
We expect that users from any operators that we acquire will continue to utilize our services and anticipate that any operators we acquire will have existing revenues from users who frequent their establishments and venues or use their websites. In addition to acquiring customers through the acquisition of operators, we intend to obtain additional licenses and pursue contracts and relationships with institutions, both from private and publicly listed companies that we believe will attract and secure new users.
 
Mobile App
 
Based upon customer demand for improved performance, speed, and ease-of-use for sports betting on mobile devices, we engaged a dedicated team of engineers to this distribution channel and have already launched and intend to launch several additional innovative, market-leading features through this channel on an ongoing basis.
 
In October 2017, we launched a new mobile betting application on our Platform. The new mobile app is dedicated to improving the user experience with respect to sports betting, with casino and poker brands rolled out in November 2017 and our artificial intelligence (AI) learning bot in February 2018.
 
Our Websites
 
Our main licensed gaming website, www.newgioco.it, currently processes sports bets and mobile betting transactions through our Platform, while online casino and poker operates under a third-party service provider agreement with Microgame SpA, and Lotto products through Lottomatica SpA. Odissea provides and operates all aspects of our online gaming website including servers, routers, software development (for the Newgioco branded website operations), sportsbook trading, telephone betting, licensing, website hosting, payment solutions, security, and gaming related customer support needs.
 
Our main and white-label websites are tailored for the Italian gaming market. We maintain a web-based platform directly under the branded website www.newgioco.it which serves both players directly and web-shops (i.e., internet café’s). Information contained on our website does not form a part of this report on form 10-K and is intended for informational purposes only. There are some variations in website style because we offer different services through distinctive marketing campaigns:



· | Our direct sales campaigns are conducted through our main page: www.newgioco.it.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | www.newgioco.it is mainly devoted to marketing for shops which includes marketing with respect to campaigns, branding, and proposals/marketing for prospective operators to become a “Newgioco shop” and is the landing page for all white-label websites. A landing page refers to a webpage that is generally owned by a promoter (which can also be referred to as a betting shop) which redirects their marketing (social network, friends or other forms of marketing) to this main webpage. Apart from a few advertisements, the landing page links patrons to sign-up or register directly on the newgioco.it main page except that a promotional code is tied to the link, such that the web promoter can funnel his marketing through a subnet. In the case of Italy, the entire subnet (a subnet is a logical grouping of connected network devices. Nodes on a subnet tend to be located in close physical proximity to each other such as on a LAN) must be connected to the ADM network.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
While the www.newgioco.it website offers wagering in many categories of sports events, we intend to capture a larger share of the Italian sports betting market by focusing on the Serie A, B, and C soccer as well as virtual sports betting, online poker, online casino and slots, skill games, and Italian horse racing through agent-based sales campaigns. Agent based sales campaigns are offered through white-label pages or webskins that direct gaming transactions through our main website www.newgioco.it. We currently operate nine such webskins as follows:
 

· www. originalbet.it | · www.timetobet.it 
------------------------------+-----------------------------
· www.lovingbet.it | · www.imperialbet.it 
· www.clubgames.it | · www.gamesmart.it 
· www.quibet.it | · www.mixbet.it 
· www.782sport.it | 


· | webskins or white-label pages are dedicated to the end-user, or players, and focus on regional campaigns and gaming offerings directed at local players, such as welcome bonuses, poker rake rebate for poker players, etc. A white-label page is a complete gaming website (similar to the main website of the licenser (in our case Multigioco)) but with the interface and logo of the promoter. The promoter earns fees based on a percentage of the handle (turnover) generated through their website.

In relation to the third-party websites, the promoter (“partner”, “shop”, “agent” or “promoter”) is responsible for marketing strategies, administration and costs. The promoter may utilize special promotions, draws and incentives to drive players to their website to increase gaming handle (turnover) or visits. Generally, these regional promoters operate in areas that are remote or distant from our central operations based in Rome. Therefore, some promotions may be tied to local events in the jurisdictions surrounding the “home base” of the promoter rather than originating from our main operations. The relationship with local shops and players from the promoter region remains with the promoter since there may be regional nuances that attract their clientele to our gaming offerings. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the gaming business is owned by the underlying licensor (i.e., Multigioco) and is included in our overall financial results as gaming handle (turnover).


The promoter does not have direct access to our client gaming accounts and is therefore not legally responsible or liable for maintaining gaming account balances but rather, the licensor is legally responsible for compliance and client gaming account control such as anti-money laundering, know-your-client and minimum age restrictions, and is also required to ensure that all payouts due to players are credited to each players’ gaming account and are available to players within seven business days of the completion of the play.
 
The foregoing websites are only published in Italian. We may include additional languages if we determine that such services are commercially viable and if we agree to pay the related development fees. We currently do not have any plans to expand our websites to include additional languages.
 
The ADM requires that all websites be owned only by the license holder (Multigioco). We own our branded url (uniform resource locator) www.newgioco.it in accordance with our ADM licensing requirements and either directly operate our websites (main page - newgioco.it) and all white-label websites or alternatively contract the websites to third party agents or promoters operating webskin urls under the licensed main page.
 
Although we have a diverse portfolio of product and service offerings through our websites, we intend to focus on creating in-house cost savings and synergies by undertaking strategic acquisitions of competing webskin operators and to operate them under our Newgioco branding.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We do not own any patents or have any patent applications pending in Italy or any other jurisdiction. As a result of our acquisitions of Multigioco, Rifa and the gaming assets of Newgioco Srl, we obtained the rights to the domestic distribution brand known throughout Italy as New Gioco, and in July 2015, we obtained a trademark on the brand and logo for New Gioco.
 
As a result of the acquisition of Odissea, we obtained the technical rights, intellectual property and technical know-how behind our Elys betting Platform.
 
In addition to the foregoing, we have proprietary rights to a number of trademarks, service marks and trade names used in this prospectus which are important to our business including “Aleabet”, “OriginalBet”, “LovingBet” and “Elys.”
 
Research and Development
 
We are continually updating the Platform and the products that we offer. During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 we incurred approximately $0.8 million and no expenses, respectively, for research and development. We expect that expenses we incur for development and improving our betting software to be continuous recurring research and development expenses.
Overview of the Leisure Betting Industry Including Italian Sports Betting and Leisure Gaming Market
 
Leisure betting describes consumer entertainment products which customers purchase on a daily or regular basis. With a population of approximately 60.6 million, of which 75.9% are between the ages of 15 and 64, Italy is one of the leading betting markets in the world and has recently surpassed the UK to become the largest betting market in Europe. [Source: Agenzia della Dogane e dei Monopoli] With 640,000 active monthly players, the Italian market accounts for approximately 23% of the global gaming market worth over $400 billion [Source: American Gaming Association].
 
12




According to Agenzia della Dogane e dei Monopoli, in recent years, the Italian leisure betting market has grown significantly, reaching an estimated $102 billion in 2013, an increase of 12.3% compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”) between 2007 and 2013, driven by new products with higher pay-out, the expansion of the distribution network and the development of the online channel. The Italian state works with operators to promote a responsible approach to gaming through national advertising campaigns as well as social, cultural and sports initiatives by curtailing excessive gambling advertisements.
 
Gambling has been culturally rooted since Roman times, and as such, Italian gaming laws are governed by a well-defined set of regulations which are considered to be some of the most advanced and robust regulations in the world. The Italian regulator, ADM, has created an environment that fosters competition and guards against illegal gaming as well as by implementing a consolidated licensing mechanism, creating favorable conditions for operators such as Newgioco.
 
Overview of the Mobile Betting Market in Italy
 
Agenzia della Dogane e dei Monopoli estimates that approximately 64.9% of mobile users between the ages of 15 and 64 use smart phones with approximately 53.1 million using mobile broadband. Mobile applications in the online leisure betting space are forecasted to become the leading technology channel for customer transactions in the near future.
Overview of the Global Leisure Gaming Market
 
The easing of government regulations on sports betting is expected to be a primary growth driver for the global online gambling market. In May 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the national ban on sports betting (PASPA) was unconstitutional, paving the way for states to enact laws authorizing sports gambling.
 
In addition to the repeal of PASPA, as of December 2018, three states, Delaware, Nevada and New Jersey, as well as the U.S. Virgin Islands, allowed online gaming, while other states have indicated their support for enacting laws authorizing land-based and/or online sports betting (Mississippi, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and New Mexico).
 
According to “Global Gaming Outlook”, the PricewaterhouseCoopers 2015 global report on global casino and online gaming industries, governments facing social constraints are now entertaining the potential source of tax revenue from online gaming. We believe that the tax revenue in addition to increase in employment opportunities derived from online gambling will motivate governments around the globe to legalize online gambling. The American Gaming Association expects the industry to grow at a CAGR of more than 6% by 2025.
 
The global online gambling market is gaining popularity in Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) because online sports betting sites generate substantial revenues for governments and foster a safe environment for players to place wagers. Their significant contribution to national revenues is encouraging several countries to legalize online gambling.
 
The global online gambling market is characterized by the presence of several vendors competing to gain market dominance. Some small vendors are operating only in specific product verticals such as casino and lottery, while, other vendors are operating in multiple areas including poker and retail sports betting. The growth opportunity for these vendors is increasing due to the rise in the number of online gambling providers and improved access to the internet around the world, as well as the increase in the number of players.
 
Certain key vendors in the global online gambling market are:
 

· | Bet 365 (Hillside Group);
--+--------------------------


· | Stars Group (formerly Poker Stars);
--+------------------------------------


· | IGT/GTECH Lottomatica SpA;
--+---------------------------


· | 888 Holdings;
--+--------------


· | William Hill;
--+--------------


· | bet-at-home.com;
--+-----------------


· | GVC Holdings;
--+--------------


· | Ladbrokes Coral Group (now merged with GVC Holdings);
--+------------------------------------------------------


· | Paddy Power Betfair; and
--+-------------------------


· | Kindred (Unibet Group).
--+------------------------

Other notable product vendors in the market also include Betsson, Gamenet/Intralot/Goldbet, Camelot Group, Genting UK, NetEnt, Playtech (acquired Snaitech), and Rank Group. See “—Competition” below for additional information on major operators in Italy.
 
The sports betting segment is expected to grow with the increased popularity of global soccer sporting events such as the recently completed 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia and ongoing global growth of cricket and rugby tournaments. In addition, online betting is popular in many sports events that take place around the globe including basketball, horse and greyhound racing, ice hockey, baseball, golf, tennis and football. Sports betting is becoming more popular due to the expansion of wagering on these sports on the online channel.
 
Industry Growth Trends
 
The unregulated global betting sector is understood to be many times larger than the regulated sector, although no verifiable or precise financial reporting is available. It is believed that 70-85% of the unregulated bets collected, excluding horse racing, are placed on American football [Source: H2 Gaming].
 
According to Statista, the European online market was projected to increase to US$24.75 billion. The largest share of online gambling revenues in Europe came from sports betting with 37%, followed by online poker with 24% and online casinos with 22%.
 
Competition
 
Competition in the online gaming industry is moderate with operators competing for customers in various geographic markets. These include online operations of ‘land based’ casino operators, poker rooms, sports/race books, bingo, skills games, lottery, betting exchanges as well as internet or web only based operators. The global reach of the internet together with the abundant supply of games and operators means that users can easily switch gaming platforms and operators, thereby increasing competition. Government and other regulations make it more difficult for operators to expand their footprint in certain markets leading to the consolidation of operators in such markets, while the easing of regulations in some markets has permitted more operators to enter the marketplace.
 
We compete with several private and publicly listed companies that provide land-based and/or online gaming, many of which have greater sources of financing, greater name recognition and have been engaged in the industry longer than we have. In addition, current land-based casino competitors, many of which have longer operating histories, greater brand recognition and greater financial and other resources than us, may provide Internet gaming services in the future.
 
Our subsidiaries face direct competition in Italy from established online gaming sites including, but not limited to:
 

GTECH (IGT/Lottomatica): focused on providing software and services
in the Internet, lottery and sports betting market;
Snaitech: (recently acquired by Playtech) an Italian corporation that
deals with the management of betting odds and horse racing contests;
Sisal: one of the longest running Italian gaming companies offering
Internet betting, lotteries, scratch to win, poker and casino, slots and arcade games;
GVC Holdings/BWIN: one of the largest online gaming companies in the
world focused primarily on sports betting, as well as online casino and poker;
Ladbrokes/Gala Coral Group/Eurobet: a UK based betting and gambling
company which was acquired by GVC Holdings in March 2018;
Bet365 (Hillside Media): a UK based online gambling company offering
sports betting, poker, casino, games, and bingo, as well as video streams on sporting events;
PaddyPower/Betfair: is a London Stock Exchange company and a constituent
of the FTSE 100 Index. The company is a bookmaking business created by the merger of Paddy Power and Betfair, and operates under
various brands including Betfair, Paddy Power, Sportsbet, TVG and FanDuel;
888 Holdings: a multinational online gambling company which operates
several international gambling websites including 888casino (one of the oldest online casino websites); 888poker and 888bingo;
William Hill: a UK based bookmaker founded in 1934 is listed on the
London Stock Exchange and a constituent of the FTSE 250 Index operates an online sportsbook and offers online casino games, ‘skill
games’, online bingo and online poker. The company operates approximately 2,300 betting shops and employs over 16,000 people
worldwide; and
The Stars Group (PokerStars): a Canadian online gaming company formerly
known as Amaya Gaming Group produces and offers online gaming products and services including poker, casino and sportsbook through
its online gaming division, Stars Interactive under the brands PokerStars, PokerStars Casino, BetStars and Full Tilt Poker.

Government Regulations
 
We are subject to various government regulations in the jurisdictions in which we currently operate or intend to operate in as set forth below. Current and future laws and regulations may impede the growth of regulated online and offline gaming and wagering. Any noncompliance with the various laws and regulations that our operations are subject to may harm our business and results of operations.
Italy
 
In Italy, the operation of land-based and online gaming activities requires a license awarded by the ADM. The ADM is responsible for, among other things:
 

· | regulating games and enforcing relevant regulatory provisions;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


· | issuing licenses, and supervising compliance by licensees;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


· | monitoring the distribution of gaming services; and
--+----------------------------------------------------


· | collecting gaming taxes.
--+-------------------------

 
There are currently two main categories of licenses (land-based and online) in circulation, issued or awarded by the ADM in three series:
 

· | Series 1 first issued by legal decree in 1992, renewed in 2009 under the Abruzzo decree and are colloquially branded as “Monti” licenses, that expired in 2016 and are expected to be called for renewal tender between 2020 and 2022;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Finance Act series which were awarded by tender in 2006 and are known as “Bersani” Licenses that expired in 2016 and are expected to be called for renewal tender between 2020 and 2022; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | New series Gioco a Distanza (Games at a Distance) (“GAD”) issued by application process under the Comunitaria decree in 2010 expire in 2021 and are expected to be renewed through a license tender auction.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The Monti and Bersani licenses provide distribution authorization to operate both Negozio Sportivo and Punto Sportivo land-based agencies and corners as well as GAD online (web-based) distribution. Land-based Monti licenses and Bersani licenses are subject to and expected to be consolidated under a new decree at renewal auction which is expected to be called for renewal tender between 2020 and 2022, to match up with the limited number of Comunitaria Series GAD licenses expiring in 2021.
 
We currently hold, through our subsidiaries four gaming licenses upon which our business is dependent: (i) a Bersani license, (ii) a Monti license, (iii) a GAD license and (iv) an Austrian bookmaker license. Our Italian Bersani, Monti and GAD licenses are issued by the ADM, while our Austrian bookmaker license is issued by the Austrian Gambling Authority (BMF). Each Italian license is typically valid for a term of nine (9) years while the Austrian license has a lifetime duration and, in both cases, can be terminated if we fail to comply with required regulations in each country. The renewal process for the Bersani license and Monti license, is a call to tender auction process held at the same time for all licensees approximately once every nine years with the highest bidders being awarded not only licenses but rights to operate a certain number of land-based locations. In addition, the maximum number of land-based license rights that any one operator may bid on at auction is 20% of the total market being auctioned.
 
15




The Bersani and Monti land-based licenses allow us to offer specific gaming products through physical retail locations. The rights granted under the Bersani and Monti licenses are not fixed to any specific physical location and can be moved at the discretion of the licensee to any physical address so long as the physical address has a municipal license to sell gaming products and the physical locations meets the ADM requirements, most of which are zoning requirements that require that the location is situated at a minimum distance from schools, churches and ATM’s and banks. Multigioco currently holds one land-based Bersani license which provides the right to operate seven (7) corners that was issued to it in 2006, expired in 2016 and is up for renewal at such time as the ADM determines to hold an auction, which is expected to be held between 2020 and 2022. Rifa holds one land-based Monti license that was issued to it in 2010 which provides it with rights to operate two (2) agencies, expired in 2016 and is up for renewal at such time as the ADM determines to hold an auction, which is expected to be held between 2020 and 2022. Although both Monti and Bersani land-based licenses expired in 2016, until the ADM holds the auction for renewal of the licenses, we have been granted a Letter of Authority which permits us to continue our operations until the next government organized license renewal is held. For a description of the risks associated with the licenses and their renewal see the Risk Factors entitled “If we should lose our online or land-based licenses or if the licenses are not renewed for any reason, including our failure to successfully bid for location rights at the renewal auction, our business would be materially adversely impacted” and “In order to expand our land-based operations in Italy, we will be required to acquire additional location rights under our licenses or acquire operators that have location rights under their licenses and our inability to acquire such additional rights or operators or restrictions from using any license associated with such acquired operators, will result in an adverse effect on our revenues and profits.” Our failure to successfully acquire the requisite number of location rights we desire at the renewal auction in Italy, will most likely result in us either acquiring rights in the secondary market from someone selling rights they acquired at auction at prices which are typically higher than the auction prices of the ADM or opening additional webshops, which will be less expensive but also have lower profit margins than the land-based operations.
 
Multigioco was awarded a Comunitaria Series GAD license by the ADM in 2011. The licenses provide Multigioco the right to:
 

1. | offer gaming products that ADM authorizes for deployment in Italy through online channels which include websites and apps displayed on a PC, tablet or mobile phone;
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | enter into licensing, joint venture and acquisition agreements with shops and private enterprises as concessionaires that provide various local services such as convenience stores, bars, cafes, and restaurants in Italy;
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | establish web cafe`s as permitted by the regulations enforced by the ADM regional office within Italy; and
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4. | take such steps such as know your client (“KYC”) and anti-money laundering controls (“AML”) that are deemed necessary to develop the business of regulated gaming in Italy.
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
An online account allows a player to fund an account through a variety of electronic payment channels such as credit cards, ATM/debit cards and bank wires. The GAD license provides us with the opportunity to open an unlimited number of web-shops and to close any of the web-shops that we open in our sole discretion. Our GAD license expires on June 15, 2021 and can renewed by a licensee provided that they have not violated any regulations. We believe that we will be able to renew this license through a tender notice process, no assurances can be given that the renewal will be timely, if at all.
 
Ulisse holds one Austrian bookmaker license that it was issued in June 2018 which has no termination date but may be terminated or cancelled by the regulator if Ulisse fails to comply with any regulations.
 
In addition, our software Platform has been certified for use in Italy in accordance with the ADM requirements by Quinel M. Limited, a global technology auditor that conducted an audit of the Platform in June 2017. The purpose of the certification is to prove the effectiveness and accuracy of communications between the supplier interface and the user/operator interface. Any updates to the software or changes to key functions that we implement, require recertification, for which there can be no assurance that our software will qualify.
 
United States
 
There is no federal United States legislation that explicitly addresses the legality of online gambling. However, there are several acts that impact online gambling.
 
The Federal Wire Act of 1961 makes the placing of sports bets over the telephone illegal, given its age, The Federal Wire Act of 1961 does not explicitly refer to online gambling, leaving the applicability of the Act on online gambling open to interpretation.
 
16



The Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006 (“UIGEA”) prohibits any person engaged in the business of betting or wagering from knowingly accepting payments related to unlawful bets or wagers transmitted over the Internet. While the UIGEA does not define online gambling as being illegal, the UIGEA instructs the U.S. Treasury Department and Federal Reserve to impose obligations upon financial institutions and other payment processors to establish procedures designed to block online gaming-related financial transactions. It also expressly requires Internet bets and wagers to comply with the law of the jurisdiction where the wagers are initiated and received (i.e., within state borders). As a result of the UIGEA we may not accept bets received by use of wire communications facilities, including telephones and computers, unless such bets originated in jurisdictions where such betting or wagering is legal.


In May 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (the “PASPA”) is unconstitutional as it violates the Tenth Amendment prohibition against forcing states to implement federal laws. Enacted in 1992, PASPA generally prohibited states from authorizing, licensing or sponsoring betting on competitive games in which amateur or professional athletes participate. PASPA did not make sports betting a federal crime; but rather, it allowed the attorney general for the Department of Justice, as well as professional and amateur sports organizations, to bring civil actions to enjoin violations of the act. The U.S. Supreme Court decision opens the door for all states to legalize and regulate sports gambling within their borders. States such as New Jersey, Delaware, West Virginia and Mississippi have passed laws that were ready to be enacted once the federal ban on sports betting was lifted. Other states have since legalized sports betting (Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and New Mexico). Furthermore, additional states including California, Connecticut, Louisiana, South Carolina, Oklahoma, Kansas, Missouri, Iowa, Indiana, Illinois, Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio, Maryland, South Dakota and North Dakota are considering active bills.
 
United Kingdom and European Union
 
The United Kingdom and certain European Union countries such as Germany, France, Spain and Greece have enacted online gaming laws and regulations. To the extent that we operate in any of these jurisdictions, our operations will need to be in compliance with the laws and regulations of such jurisdiction.
Additional Government Regulations
 
We are subject to general business regulations and laws which cover among others, taxation, virtual currencies, identity theft, account management guidelines, privacy, disclosure rules, security and marketing.
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2018, two persons are directly employed, and three persons are engaged as independent contractors by us, while our subsidiaries Multigioco employed 19 full-time and five part-time employees, and approximately 27 independent contractors which includes risk management specialists and sales agents, Odissea employed 14 full-time employees and Ulisse employed 10 full-time employees. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and we consider our relations with our employees to be very good.
