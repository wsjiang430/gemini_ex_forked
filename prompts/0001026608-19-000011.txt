Westcott is one of the leading scissor and ruler brands in North America.
 
Many of the Westcott branded cutting products contain patented titanium bonding and proprietary non-stick coatings, making the blades more than three times harder than stainless steel as well as reducing friction and corrosion. In 2018, Westcott continued to build on its safety knife launch with the introduction of the Saber Safety Cutters as well as several new ceramic safety knives, allowing its customers to remain safer on the job.
