Certain industry and market share information in this Annual Report has been presented on a worldwide basis which includes all countries. In this Annual Report, management estimates of market share information are generally based on retail unit sales data in North America, on registrations of equipment in most of Europe, Brazil, and various other markets, and on retail and shipment unit data collected by a central information bureau appointed by equipment manufacturers associations, including the Association of Equipment Manufacturers in North America, the Committee for European Construction Equipment in Europe, the Associação Nacional dos Fabricantes de Veículos Automotores in Brazil, the Japan Construction Equipment Manufacturers Association, and the Korea Construction Equipment Manufacturers Association, as well as on other shipment data collected by independent service bureaus. Not all agricultural or construction equipment is registered, and registration data may thus underestimate, perhaps substantially, actual retail industry unit sales demand, particularly for local manufacturers in China, Southeast Asia, Eastern Europe, Russia, Turkey, Brazil, and any country where local shipments are not reported.
Iveco Group N.V. Demerger
Until December 31, 2021, CNH Industrial N.V. owned and controlled the Commercial and Specialty Vehicles business, the Powertrain business, and the related Financial Services business (together the “Iveco Group Business” or the “On-Highway Business”), as well as the Agriculture business, the Construction business, and the related Financial Services business (collectively, the “Off-Highway Business”). Effective January 1, 2022, the Iveco Group Business was separated from CNH Industrial N.V. by way of a demerger under Dutch law (the "Demerger") to Iveco Group N.V. (the "Iveco Group"), and the Iveco Group became a public listed company independent from CNH Industrial with its common shares trading on the Euronext Milan, a regulated market organized and managed by Borsa Italiana S.p.A. In connection with the Demerger, shares of Iveco Group N.V. were distributed to shareholders in CNH Industrial N.V. on a pro rata basis. The On-Highway Business' financial results for the periods prior to the Demerger have been reflected in our Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations, retrospectively, as discontinued operations. Additionally, the related assets and liabilities associated with the On-Highway Business are classified as discontinued operations within Assets Held for Distribution and Liabilities Held for Distribution in the prior year of the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. Pursuant to the terms of the deeds of demerger entered into between CNH Industrial N.V. and Iveco Group N.V. on January 1, 2022, assets related to the

Industry Overview
Agriculture
The operators of dairy, livestock and row crop producing farms, as well as independent contractors that provide services to such farms, purchase most agricultural equipment. Row crop farmers typically purchase tractors at the mid-to-upper end of the horsepower ("hp") range, combines and harvesting equipment and crop production equipment. Dairy and livestock farmers typically utilize tractors in the mid-to-lower hp range and crop preparation and crop packaging implements. The key factors influencing sales of agricultural equipment are the level of net farm income and, to a lesser extent, general economic conditions, interest rates and the availability of financing and related subsidy programs, farmland prices and farm debt levels. Net farm income is primarily impacted by the volume of acreage planted, commodity and/or livestock prices and stock levels, crop yields, farm operating expenses (including fuel and fertilizer costs), fluctuations in currency exchange rates, government subsidies, tax incentives and trade policies. The availability, quality, and cost of used equipment for sale affects the level of new equipment sales. Weather conditions are a major determinant of crop yields and crop prices and therefore affect equipment-buying decisions. Global organization initiatives, such as those of the World Trade Organization, also can affect the market acceptance of genetically modified organisms such as seed, feed and animals and climate change and sustainability initiatives. 
Demand for agricultural equipment also varies seasonally by region and product, primarily due to differing climates and farming calendars. Peak retail deliveries for tractors and planting, seeding, and application equipment typically occurs in March through June 
in the Northern hemisphere and in September through December in the Southern hemisphere. Dealers order equipment year-round but harvesting equipment orders in the Northern hemisphere generally increase in the late fall and winter so that the dealers can receive inventory prior to the peak retail selling season, which generally extends from March through June. In the Southern hemisphere, dealers generally order between August and October so they can receive inventory prior to the peak retail-selling season, which extends from November through February. Agriculture's production levels are based upon estimated retail demand, which takes into account, among other things, the timing of dealer shipments, dealer and Company inventory levels, the need to retool manufacturing facilities to produce new or different models, and the efficient use of labor and facilities. However, because production and wholesale shipments adjust throughout the year to take into account the factors described above, sales of agricultural equipment in any given period may not reflect the timing of dealer orders and retail demand for that period. This situation has been emphasized during the recent pandemic and current post-pandemic environment where global supply chains have been disrupted for a series of reasons linked with production not able to match demand and transportation becoming congested with increases in lead times and expenses.
Customer preferences regarding farming practices, and thus product types and features, vary by region. In North America, Australia, Brazil, Argentina and other areas where soil conditions, climate, economic factors and population density allow for intensive mechanized agriculture, farmers generally demand high capacity, sophisticated machines equipped with the most advanced technology. In Europe, where farms are generally smaller in size than those in North America and Australia, there is greater demand for somewhat smaller, yet equally sophisticated, machines. In the developing regions of the world where labor is more abundant and infrastructure, soil conditions and/or climate are not conducive to intensive agriculture, customers generally prefer simpler and easy to use machines with relatively lower acquisition and operating costs. In many developing countries, tractors are the primary type of agricultural equipment used, and much of the agricultural work in such countries that cannot be performed by tractors is carried out by hand. A growing number of part-time farmers, hobby farmers and customers engaged in landscaping, municipality and park maintenance, golf course and roadside mowing in Western Europe and North America prefer relatively simple, low-cost agricultural equipment. Our position as a geographically diversified manufacturer of agricultural equipment and our broad geographic network of dealers allows us to provide customers in each significant market with equipment that meets their specific requirements.
One trend in North American and Western European agricultural industries include a reduction in number but growth in size of farms, supporting increased demand for higher capacity agricultural equipment. In addition, we believe that the use of technology and other precision farming solutions (including the development of autonomously operated equipment) to enhance productivity, profitability and environmental impact are becoming more important in the buyers’ purchasing decision. In South America, India and in other emerging markets, the number of farms is growing, and mechanization is replacing manual labor. In other markets, long-term demographic trends, increasing urbanization, and low level of farm mechanization represent the key drivers of demand for agricultural equipment. 
Government farm programs, including the amount and timing of government payments, are a key income driver for farmers raising certain commodity crops in the United States (the "U.S.") and the European Union. The existence of comprehensive subsidies in these agricultural/farm markets reduces the effects of cyclicality in the agricultural equipment business. The existence and extent of subsidies depends largely on the U.S. Farm Bill and programs administered by the United States Department of Agriculture, the Common Agricultural Policy of the European Union and World Trade Organization negotiations. Additionally, the Brazilian government subsidizes the purchase of agricultural equipment through low-rate financing programs administered by the Banco Nacional de Desenvolvimento Economico e Social (“BNDES”). These programs have had over the years a significant influence on sales.
Global demand for renewable fuels increased considerably in recent years driven by consumer preference, government renewable fuel mandates, renewable fuel tax and production incentives. Biofuels, which include fuels such as ethanol and biodiesel, have become one of the most prevalent types of renewable fuels. The primary type of biofuel supported by government mandates and incentives varies by region. North America and Brazil are promoting ethanol first and then biodiesel, while Europe is primarily focused on biodiesel and biomethane. 
The demand for biofuels has created an associated demand for agriculturally based feedstocks, which are used to produce biofuels. Currently, most of the ethanol in the U.S. and Europe is extracted from corn, while in Brazil it is extracted from sugar cane. Biodiesel is typically extracted from soybeans and rapeseed oil in the U.S. and Brazil, and from rapeseed and other oil seeds as well as food waste by-products in Europe. The use of corn and soybeans for biofuel has been one of the main factors affecting the supply and demand relationships, as well as the price for these crops. The economic feasibility of biofuels is significantly impacted by the price of oil. As the price of oil falls, biofuels become a less attractive alternative energy source. This relationship will, however, be impacted by government policy and mandates as governments around the world consider ways to combat global warming and avoid potential energy resource issues in the future. 
Sustainability has been a focus of CNH Industrial since 2013. During the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference, COP27 event in Egypt, there was a continued emphasis on carbon reduction with significant attention on the establishment of a Loss and Damage Fund, which aims to provide financial assistance to nations most vulnerable and impacted by the effects of climate change. With the use of a bio-digester, animal waste and food waste can be processed to produce bio-methane. New Holland developed a Methane Powered Tractor that runs on methane produced on the farm from animal and food waste. Moreover, in 2021 CNH Industrial has invested with a minority equity share participation into the U.K. based technology start-up, Bennamann, which has developed an 
on-site kit for small-medium size livestock farms to capture and repurpose fugitive methane from their waste and generate bio-methane which could potentially allow a successful implementation of the circular economy.
This approach also improves the sustainability of farmland management practices through minimizing artificial inputs such as manufactured fertilizer, lowering operational costs and reducing pollutants. This concept is intended to contribute to a dairy farm's decarbonization.
The developments in precision agriculture technology are designed to allow farmers to increase yield with reduced input costs in the areas of labor, fertilizer, chemicals and water. Further, with shorter planting and harvesting cycles experienced in recent years, we believe that precision agriculture technology will help drive replacement demand for new farm equipment as this technology is designed to improve farm efficiency.
Construction
The construction equipment market consists of two principal segments: heavy construction equipment (excluding the mining and the specialized forestry equipment markets in which we do not participate), with equipment generally weighing more than 12 metric tons, and light construction equipment, with equipment generally weighing less than 12 metric tons.
In developed markets, customers tend to prefer more sophisticated machines equipped with the latest technology and features to improve operator productivity. In developing markets, customers tend to prefer equipment that is relatively less costly and has greater perceived durability. In North America and Europe, where the hourly cost of machine operators is higher relative to fuel costs and machine depreciation, customers typically emphasize productivity, performance and reliability. In other markets, where the relative cost for machine operators is lower, customers often continue to use equipment after its relative performance and efficiency have begun to diminish. 
Customer demand for power and operating capacity does not vary significantly from market to market. However, in many countries, restrictions on equipment weight or dimensions, as well as road regulations or job site constraints can limit demand for larger machines.
Although the demand for new construction equipment tends to decrease during periods of economic stagnation or recession, the aftersales market is historically less volatile than the new equipment market and, therefore, helps limit the impact of declines in new equipment sales on the operating results of full-line manufacturers, such as Construction. 
Heavy Construction
Heavy construction equipment typically includes general construction equipment such as large wheel loaders and excavators, and road building and site preparation equipment such as graders, compactors and dozers. Purchasers of heavy construction equipment include construction companies, municipalities, local governments, rental fleet owners, quarrying and mining companies, waste management companies and forestry-related concerns. 
Sales of heavy construction equipment depend on the expected volume of major infrastructure construction and repair projects such as highway, tunnel, dam and harbor projects, which depend on government spending and economic growth. Demand for aggregate mining and quarrying equipment is more closely linked to the general economy and commodity prices, while growing demand for environmental equipment is becoming less sensitive to the economic cycle. In North America, a portion of heavy equipment demand has historically been linked to the development of new housing subdivisions, where the entire infrastructure needs to be created, thus linking demand for both heavy and light construction equipment. The heavy equipment industry generally follows macroeconomic cyclicality, linked to growth in gross domestic product.
Light Construction
Light construction equipment is also known as compact and service equipment, and it includes skid-steer loaders, compact track loaders, tractor loaders, rough terrain forklifts, backhoe loaders, small wheel loaders and excavators. Purchasers of light construction equipment include contractors, residential builders, utilities, road construction companies, rental fleet owners, landscapers, logistics companies, and farmers. The principal factor influencing sales of light construction equipment is the level of residential and commercial construction, remodeling and renovation, which is influenced by interest rates and the availability of financing. Other major factors include the construction of light infrastructure, such as utilities, cabling and piping and maintenance expenditures. The principal use of light construction equipment is to replace relatively high-cost, slower manual work. Product demand in the United States and Europe has generally tended to mirror housing starts, with lags of six to twelve months. In areas where labor is abundant, and the cost of labor is inexpensive relative to other inputs, such as in India, Africa and South America, the light construction equipment market is generally smaller. These regions represent potential areas of growth for light construction equipment in the medium to long-term as labor costs rise relative to the cost of equipment or the supply of labor contracts leading to increased mechanization.
Equipment rental is a significant element of the construction equipment market. Compared to the U.K. and Japan, where there is an established market for long-term equipment rentals as a result of favorable tax treatment, the rental market in North America and 
Western Europe (except for the U.K.) consists mainly of short-term rentals of light construction equipment to individuals or small contractors for which the purchase of equipment is not cost effective or that need specialized equipment for specific jobs. In North America, the main rental product has traditionally been the backhoe loader and, in Western Europe, it has been the mini-excavator. As the market has evolved, a greater variety of light and heavy equipment products have become available to rent. In addition, rental companies have allowed contractors to rent machines for longer periods instead of purchasing the equipment, enabling contractors to complete specific job requirements with greater flexibility and cost control. Large, national rental companies can significantly impact the construction equipment market, with purchase volumes being driven by their decisions to increase or decrease the size of their rental fleets based on rental utilization rates. 
Seasonal demand for construction equipment fluctuates somewhat less than for agricultural equipment. Nevertheless, in North America and Western Europe, housing construction generally slows during the winter months. North American and European industry retail demand for construction equipment is generally strongest in the second and fourth quarters.
Agricultural and landscaping customers also contribute to a significant portion of the North America light equipment market. In this segment the main applications are related to material handling.
In markets outside of North America, Western Europe and Japan, equipment demand may also be partially satisfied by importing used equipment. Used heavy construction equipment from North America may fulfill demand in the South American market and equipment from Western Europe may be sold to Central and Eastern European, North African and Middle Eastern markets. Used heavy and light equipment from Japan is mostly sold to other Southeast Asian markets, while used excavators from Japan are sold to almost every other market in the world. This flow of used equipment is highly influenced by exchange rates, the weight and dimensions of the equipment and the different local regulations in terms of safety and/or engine emissions.
The construction equipment industry has seen an increase in the use of hydraulic excavators and wheel loaders in earth-moving and material handling applications. In addition, the light equipment sector has grown as more manual labor is being replaced on construction sites by machines with a variety of attachments for specialized applications, such as skid steer loaders, compact track loaders and mini-crawler excavators. 
Competition
The Agriculture and Construction equipment industries are highly competitive. We believe that we have many competitive strengths that will enable us to improve our position in markets where we are already well established while we direct additional resources to markets and products with high growth potential.
We compete with: (i) large global full-line equipment manufacturers with a presence in every market and a broad range of products that cover most customer needs, (ii) manufacturers who are product specialists focused on particular industry segments on either a global or regional basis, (iii) regional full-line manufacturers, some of which are expanding worldwide to build a global presence, and (iv) local, low-cost manufacturers in individual markets, particularly in emerging markets such as Eastern Europe, India and China. 
Our competitive strengths include well-recognized brands, a full range of competitive products and features, including software, a strong presence, distribution and customer service network. There are multiple factors that influence a buyer’s choice of industrial equipment. These factors include the strength and quality of the distribution network, brand loyalty, product features, quality and performance, availability of a full product range, pricing, technological innovations, product availability, financing terms, parts and warranty programs, resale value and customer service and satisfaction. The ability to meet or exceed applicable engine emissions standards as they take effect is also a key competitive factor, particularly in those markets where such standards are the subject of frequent legislative or regulatory scrutiny and change, such as Europe and North America. Emission regulations are becoming a significant competitive factor at global level with new legislation in India and China. We continually seek to improve in each of these areas but focus primarily on providing high-quality and high-value products and on supporting those products through our dealer networks. Customers’ perceptions of product value in terms of productivity, reliability, digital content, resale value and dealer support are formed over many years. Buyers tend to favor brands based on experience with the product and the dealer. 
The efficiency of our manufacturing, logistics and scheduling systems are dependent on forecasts of industry volumes and our anticipated share of industry sales, which is predicated on our ability to compete successfully with others in the marketplace. We compete based on product performance, customer service, quality, innovation and price. The environment is by nature competitive from a pricing standpoint, but we have been able to counter inflationary cost increases with positive price realization. There is no guarantee that we can maintain positive price realization in the future. The ability of our supply chain and manufacturing system to timely deliver finished goods is also critical to meeting customer expectations. Failure to do so might imply losses of market share and competitiveness.
Our main competitors in the agricultural equipment market are Deere & Company, AGCO Corporation, Claas Group, Kubota Tractor Corporation, Argo Tractors S.p.A., and the Same Deutz Fahr Group. 
Our principal competitors in the construction equipment market are Caterpillar Inc., Komatsu Ltd., J C Bamford Excavators Ltd., Hitachi Construction Machinery Co, Ltd., Volvo Group, Liebherr Group, Doosan Group, Kubota Tractor Corporation, and Deere & Company. 
Products and Markets 
Agriculture
To capitalize on customer loyalty to its dealers and its brands, Agriculture’s product lines are sold primarily under the Case IH and New Holland Agriculture brands as well as the STEYR and Kongskilde brands in Europe and the Miller and Flexi-Coil brands, primarily in North America and Australia. Raven primarily operates in North America, Australia, South America and Europe. Certain agricultural equipment products are also sold under Överum (a sub-brand of Kongskilde), K-Line and JF brands. We believe that these brands enjoy high levels of brand identification and loyalty among both customers and dealers. 
Although newer generation tractors have a high percentage of common mechanical components, each brand and product remains differentiated by features, color, interior and exterior styling, warranty terms, technology offering, and model designation. Flagship products such as row crop tractors and large combine harvesters may have significantly greater differentiation. 
Distinctive features that are specific to a particular brand such as the Supersteer® tractor axle or Twin Rotor combine threshing technology for New Holland, the Case IH tracked four-wheel drive tractor, Quadtrac®, and the front axle mounted hitch for STEYR tractors are examples of certain distinctive features that remain an important part of each brand’s unique identity.
Agriculture’s product lines include tractors, combine harvesters, hay and forage equipment, seeding and planting equipment, and self-propelled sprayers. Our agricultural equipment is sold with a limited warranty that typically runs from one to three years.
Case IH and New Holland Agriculture brands enable their customers to visualize and share in-depth real-time machine and farm operation data within the respective AFS-PLM Farm solution and offer data sharing to a vast number of third party providers at full control of the customer. Agriculture launched AGXTENDTM, focused exclusively on aftermarket precision farming technology solutions. AGXTENDTM is designed to provide our dealers and customers access to innovative and more sustainable productivity enhancing precision farming technologies.
CNH Industrial acquired AgDNA an industry leading Farm Management Information System (FMIS) that automatically collects and analyzes data from equipment manufactured by CNH Industrial and third-party manufacturers. The cloud-based platform analyzes equipment, agronomic and environmental data to deliver actionable insights directly to customers' smartphones and tablets to help them maximize the agronomic performance of their CNH Industrial and other equipment to increase farm profitability.
Raven Industries, Inc., ("Raven") formerly a long-term strategic supplier, was acquired in order to expand our portfolio of precision agriculture technology offerings and to accelerate the development of advanced machine automation and autonomous agriculture technology. 
With Raven as part of the Agriculture product portfolio, we now design, manufacture, sell, and service innovative precision agriculture products, autonomous solutions, and information management tools, which are collectively referred to as precision agriculture equipment. Our Precision Agriculture suite of solutions encompass connected platforms, automation solutions and autonomous capabilities. Our technology stack includes satellite guided positioning, telemetric connectivity, automation software, ruggedized sensors and cross validation/machine learning aided by edge and cloud computing. Our connected platforms link farmers to their equipment, dealers, input providers, partners and other advisors enabling real time monitoring of their operations and logistics management capabilities. Our Raven brand offers retrofit solutions to upgrade farmer's existing equipment, resulting in increased productivity and reduced cost across the full fleet of equipment.
Construction
Construction’s product lines are sold primarily under the CASE Construction Equipment and New Holland Construction brands. CASE provides a wide range of products on a global scale, including crawler excavators and mini-excavators. The New Holland Construction brand family also markets a full product line of construction equipment in South America and focuses on light equipment distributed by the Agriculture network in the other regions. In 2021, we completed the acquisition of Sampierana S.p.A., which provides Construction direct control over technology and manufacturing of Mini and Midi Excavators. 
Construction's products often share common components to achieve economies of scale in manufacturing, purchasing, and development. Construction differentiates these products based on the relative product value, technology, design concept, productivity, product serviceability, color, and styling to preserve the unique identity of each brand. 
Heavy construction equipment product lines include general construction equipment such as large excavators and wheel loaders, and road building and site preparation equipment such as compactors, graders and dozers. Light construction equipment is also known as compact and service equipment, and its product lines include backhoe loaders, skid steer and tracked loaders, mini- and midi- 
excavators, and compact wheel loaders. The brands each offer parts and support services for all of their product lines. Our construction equipment is generally sold with a limited warranty that typically runs from one to two years.
We continue to evaluate our Construction business with a view toward increasing efficiencies and profitability as well as evaluating its strategic alliances to improve its position in key markets. 
Sales and Distribution 
Agriculture and Construction
Agriculture sells and distributes products through dealers that sell either Case IH products, New Holland products or both brands. Case IH has 898 dealers worldwide with more than 2,500 point of sale locations and New Holland has more than 1,800 dealers worldwide and more than 3,700 point of sale locations. Construction sells and distributes products through approximately 420 full-line dealers and distributors with over 1,580 points of sale. Agriculture’s and Construction’s dealers are almost all independently owned and operated. Some Agriculture dealers also sell construction equipment. In the United States, Canada, Mexico, most of Western Europe, Brazil, Argentina, India, China, Thailand, Australia, and South Africa products are generally distributed directly through the independent dealer network. In the rest of the world, products are either sold to independent distributors who then resell to dealers, or to importers who have their own branches to sell product to retail customers. 
Consistent with our brand promotion program, we generally seek to have dealers sell a full range of our products. Typically, a dealer is appointed to sell one brand in a specific territory, but depending on market potential, history, capabilities and commitment of the dealer operator, a multi-brand approach is also pursued in some territories. In each region, we seek to optimize our distribution strategy to maximize customer satisfaction and sales while reducing structural costs. This results in two far-reaching networks representing two strong brands with unique identities and strengths to compete against all non-CNH Industrial brands in any given territory.
In larger markets, a trade-in of used equipment typically accompanies the sale of new equipment to end-users. We often provide marketing assistance to our dealers to support the sale of used, trade-in equipment through subsidized financing incentives, inventory carrying cost defrayment, or other methods.
Exclusive, dedicated dealers generally provide a higher level of market penetration. Some dealers may sell complementary products manufactured by other suppliers to complete their product offerings or to satisfy local demand for a particular specialty application or segment.
A strong dealer network with wide geographic coverage is a critical element in the success of Agriculture and Construction. We work to enhance our dealer network through the expansion of our product lines and customer services, including enhanced financial services offerings, and an increased focus on dealer support. To assist dealers in building rewarding relationships with their customers, focused customer satisfaction programs have been introduced and they are expected to incorporate customer input into the relevant product development and service delivery processes.
As the equipment rental business becomes a more significant factor in both the agricultural and construction equipment markets, Agriculture and Construction are facilitating sales of equipment to the local, regional and national rental companies through their dealers as well as by encouraging dealers to develop their own rental activities. A strong dealer service network is required to maintain the rental equipment, and to help ensure that the equipment remains at peak performance levels both during its life as rental equipment and afterward when resold into the used equipment market. Agriculture and Construction have launched several programs to support their dealer service and rental operations, including training, improved dealer standards, financing, and advertising. As the rental market is a capital-intensive sector and sensitive to cyclical variations, we expand such activities gradually, with special attention to managing the resale of rental units into the used equipment market by our dealers, who can utilize this opportunity to improve their customer base and generate additional parts and service business. 
We believe that it is generally more cost-effective to distribute our agricultural and construction equipment products through independent dealers, although as of December 31, 2022, we operated two Agriculture and Construction dealerships in North America and six company-owned Agriculture and Construction dealerships in Europe. We also operate with a network of owned dealers for Case IH and the Construction segment in South Africa. We promote a selective dealer development program, in territories with growth potential but underdeveloped representation by our agricultural and construction equipment brands, the program typically involves a transfer of ownership to a qualified operator through a buy-out or private investment after a few years. 
Precision Agriculture technology is offered factory fit with our new equipment as well as offered as parts and service for retrofit solutions through our dealer network. The Raven brand is leveraging and expanding their sales through the CNH Industrial dealer network in all the regions but is also distributing through independent dealers and directly to other OEM as factory fit solutions or their parts and service offering.
Pricing and Promotion 
The retail price of any piece of equipment is determined by the individual dealer or distributor and generally depends on market conditions, features, options and, potentially, regulatory requirements. Retail transaction prices may differ from the manufacturer-suggested list prices, as a result of different factors (markets' demand, customers' specific requirements, local market conditions, general economic conditions, access to financing, etc.). We sell most of our products and parts to our dealers and distributors at wholesale prices that reflect a discount from the manufacturer-suggested list prices. In the ordinary course of business, we engage in promotional campaigns that may include price incentives or preferential financing terms when a product is sold by a dealer to a final customer.
We regularly advertise our products to the community of farmers, builders, and agricultural and construction contractors, as well as to distributors and dealers in each of our major markets. To reach our target audience, we use a combination of general media, specialized design and trade magazines, the Internet and direct mail. We also regularly participate in major international and national trade shows and engage in co-operative advertising programs with distributors and dealers. The promotion strategy for each brand varies according to the target customers for that brand.
Parts and Services 
The quality and timely availability of parts and services are important competitive factors for each of our businesses, as they are significant elements in overall customer satisfaction and important considerations in a customer’s original equipment purchase decision. We supply parts, many of which are proprietary, to support items in the current product line as well as for products we have sold in the past. We also offer personalized aftersales customer assistance programs that provide a wide range of modular and flexible maintenance and repair contracts, as well as warranty extension services, to meet a variety of customers’ needs and to support the equipment’s value over time. Many of our products can have economically productive lives of up to 20 years when properly maintained, and each unit has the potential to produce a long-term parts and services revenue stream for us and our dealers. The technology has allowed us to connect machines with our cloud-based Control Rooms and our dealer service shops get results of analytics blended with the professional knowledge of our products experts. We are increasing the number of connected units supported proactively by Dealer Control Room that leverage service alarms, operators’ insights, predictive repairs and maintenance that enrich a suite of machine and farm data’s. 
As of December 31, 2022 we operated and administered 34 parts depots worldwide which support both Agriculture and Construction, either directly, through a joint venture, or through arrangements with warehouse service providers. This network includes 10 parts depots in North America, 7 in Europe, 3 in South America, and 14 in other regions. The network includes 33 parts depots that support Agriculture and 30 that support Construction. These depots supply parts to dealers and distributors, which are responsible for sales to retail customers. Our parts depots and parts delivery systems provide customers with access to substantially all the parts required to support our products. 
Research and Development, Patents and Licenses, etc. 
Our research, development and engineering personnel design, engineer, manufacture and test new products, components, and systems. 
In a continuously and rapidly changing competitive environment, our research and development activities are a vital component in our strategic development. Our research and development activities are designed to accelerate time-to-market while taking advantage of specialization and experience in different markets.
We own a significant number of patents, trade secrets, licenses and trademarks related to our products and services, and that number is expected to grow as our R&D activities continue. We file patent applications in Europe, the U.S. and in other jurisdictions around the world to protect technology and improvements considered important to the business. Certain trademarks contribute to our identity and the recognition of our products and services and are an integral part of our business, and their loss could have a material adverse effect on us.
Agriculture—We are marketing the New Holland, Case IH, STEYR, Raven and Miller brands and logos as the primary brand names for our agriculture products. 
Construction—For construction equipment under New Holland, we are marketing the New Holland Construction brand name and trademark. For construction equipment under CASE, we are promoting the CASE Construction brand name and trademark. 
Joint Ventures
As part of a strategy to enter and expand in new markets, we are also involved in several commercial and/or manufacturing joint ventures. At December 31, 2022, they included the following:
◦in Japan, we own 50.0% of New Holland HFT Japan Inc. (“HFT”), which distributes our products in Japan. HFT imports and sells the full range of New Holland agricultural equipment;
◦in Pakistan, we own 43.2% of Al Ghazi Tractors Ltd., which manufactures and distributes New Holland tractors;
◦in Turkey, we own 37.5% of TürkTraktör ve Ziraat Makineleri A.S., which manufactures and distributes various models of both New Holland and Case IH tractors; 
◦in Mexico, we own 50.0% of CNH de Mexico S.A. de C.V., which manufactures New Holland agricultural equipment and distributes our agricultural equipment through one or more of its wholly-owned subsidiaries.
Suppliers 
We purchase materials, parts, components and services from third party suppliers. Our focus on quality improvement, cost reduction, product innovation and production flexibility requires us to rely upon suppliers with a focus on quality, reliability and the ability to provide cost reductions. We view our relationships with suppliers as critical to our operational effectiveness, and in recent years, we have established closer ties with a significantly reduced number of suppliers, selecting those that enjoy a leading position in the relevant markets. 
Certain components and parts used in our products are available from a single supplier and cannot be sourced quickly otherwise. The sudden or unexpected interruption in the availability of certain of our suppliers’ raw materials, parts, and components could result in delays in, or increases in the costs of production. 
CNH Industrial is committed to growing together with our suppliers to maintain a strong and resilient supply chain; therefore, the company is embarking on a multi-year supply chain transformation under our new strategic sourcing program. The strategic sourcing program is designed to leverage CNH Industrial's long-term relationships with its suppliers to reduce costs and improve overall performance of the supply chain. 
Financial Services
Financial Services offers a range of financial products and services to dealers and customers in the various regions in which it operates. Retail financing products primarily include retail notes, finance leases and operating leases to end use customers and revolving charge account financing to purchase parts, service, rentals, implements and attachments from CNH Industrial brand dealers. Wholesale financing consists primarily of dealer floorplan financing as well as the management and purchase of trade receivables from CNH Industrial companies. Dealer floorplan financing gives dealers the ability to maintain a representative inventory of products. In addition, Financial Services provides financing to dealers for used equipment and machines taken in trade, equipment utilized in dealer-owned rental yards, parts inventory, working capital and other financing needs. As a captive finance business, Financial Services is reliant on and supports the operations of Agriculture, Construction, their dealers, and customers.
Financial Services supports the growth of Industrial Activities by developing and structuring financial products with the objective of supporting equipment and parts sales as well as customer loyalty. Financial Services’ strategy is to grow a core financing business to support the sale of our equipment and parts while at the same time maintaining its portfolio credit quality, service levels, operational effectiveness and customer satisfaction. Financial Services also offers products to finance third party equipment and machines sold through our dealer network or within our core businesses. Financed third party equipment include used equipment taken in trade by our dealers or equipment used in conjunction with or attached to our products.
In North America, retail customer and dealer financing activities, which support the sales of Agriculture and Construction, are managed through our wholly-owned financial services companies. 
In Europe, the Middle East and Africa, CNH Industrial Capital Europe S.a.S., which is 24.95% owned by CNH Industrial N.V. and accounted for under the equity method, provides retail financing to customers of Agriculture and Construction. Additionally, there are vendor programs with banking partners that provide customer financing to our industrial segments in certain countries.
In Europe, IC Financial Services S.A., a French specialized credit institution, wholly-owned by Iveco Group, manages CNH Industrial dealer financing through a dedicated securitization. CNH Industrial Capital Solutions S.p.A. retains the securitization program's junior notes, and therefore retains substantially all the risks and the benefits of the underlying wholesale receivables.
For South America, retail customer and dealer financing activities are managed through our wholly-owned financial services company, which support the sales of Agriculture and Construction. For retail customer financing in Brazil, Banco CNH Industrial Capital S.A. serves as a lender for funding provided by BNDES, a federally-owned financial institution linked to the Brazilian 
Ministry of Development, Industry and Foreign Trade. In Argentina, vendor programs with banking partners are also utilized. CNH Industrial Financial Services serves as a lender for Iveco Group and services the sales of Iveco Group.
In Asia Pacific, CNH Industrial Financial Services supports the sales of Agriculture and Construction by providing retail customer and dealer financing activities in Australia, New Zealand and India, managed through wholly-owned financial services companies. In China, Agriculture dealer financing activities are provided by and managed through a wholly-owned financial services company. CNH Industrial Financial Services serves as a lender for Iveco Group and services the sale of Iveco Group in Australia and New Zealand. 
Customer Financing
Financial Services has certain retail underwriting and portfolio management policies and procedures that are specific to Agriculture or Construction. This distinction allows Financial Services to reduce risk by deploying industry-specific expertise in each of these businesses. We provide retail financial products primarily through our dealers, who are trained in the use of the various financial products. Dedicated credit analysis teams perform retail credit underwriting. The terms for financing equipment retail sales typically provide for retention of a security interest in the equipment financed.
Financial Services’ guidelines for minimum down payments for equipment generally range from 5% to 30% of the actual sales price, depending on equipment types, repayment terms, and customer credit quality. Finance charges are sometimes waived for specified periods or reduced on certain equipment sold or leased in advance of the season of use or in connection with other sales promotions. For periods during which finance charges are waived or reduced on the retail notes or leases, Financial Services generally receives compensation from the applicable Industrial Activities segment based on Financial Services’ estimated costs and a targeted return on equity. The cost is recognized as a reduction in net sales for the applicable Industrial Activities segment.
Dealer Financing
Financial Services provides dealer floorplan financing, and to a lesser extent, the financing of dealer operations. Under the standard terms of the wholesale receivable agreements, these receivables typically have a fixed period of “interest-free” financing to dealers. During the “interest-free” period, the applicable Industrial Activities segment compensates Financial Services based on Financial Services’ estimated costs and a targeted return on equity. The cost is recognized as a reduction in net sales for the applicable Industrial Activities segment. After the expiration of any “interest-free” period, interest is charged to dealers on outstanding balances until Financial Services receives payment in full.
A wholesale underwriting group reviews dealer financial information and payment performance to establish credit lines for each dealer. In setting these credit lines, Financial Services seeks to meet the reasonable requirements of each dealer while managing its exposure to any one dealer. All risk is underwritten and supported by Financial Services. The credit lines are secured by the equipment financed. Dealer credit agreements generally include a requirement to repay individual receivables at the time of the retail sale of the related unit. Financial Services leverages employees, third‑party contractors, and digital technologies like “geo-fencing” to conduct periodic stock audits at individual dealerships to confirm that the financed equipment is maintained in inventory. These audits are unannounced, and their frequency varies by dealer and depends on the dealer’s financial strength, payment history, and prior performance. 
Factoring 
Financial Services also provides intragroup factoring of trade and other receivables. This activity involves the purchase, without recourse, of receivables of CNH Industrial companies, originating from the Industrial Activities segments, and due from third or related parties. 
Sources of Funding
The long-term profitability of Financial Services’ activities largely depends on the cyclical nature of the industries in which we operate, interest rate volatility, and the ability to access funding on competitive terms. Financial Services funds its operations and lending activity through a combination of term receivable securitizations, committed secured and unsecured facilities, uncommitted lines of credit, unsecured bonds, unsecured commercial paper, affiliated financing, and retained earnings. Financial Services’ current funding strategy is to maintain sufficient liquidity and flexible access to a wide variety of financial instruments and funding options.
Financial Services has periodically accessed the asset-backed securities (“ABS”) markets in the United States, Canada, and Australia, as part of its retail note and wholesale financing programs when those markets offer funding opportunities on competitive terms. Financial Services has also accessed the unsecured bond market in the United States, Canada, Brazil, Argentina and Australia and commercial paper markets in the United States to diversify its funding sources. Financial Services’ ability to access these markets will depend, in part, upon general economic conditions and Financial Services’ financial condition and portfolio performance. These factors can be negatively affected by cyclical swings in the industries in which we operate.
Competition
The financial services industry is highly competitive. Financial Services competes primarily with banks, equipment finance and leasing companies and other financial institutions. Typically, this competition is based upon the financial products and services offered, customer service, financial terms, and interest rates charged. Financial Services’ ability to compete successfully depends upon, among other things, the availability and competitiveness of funding resources, the development of competitive financial products and services, and licensing or other governmental regulations.
Human Capital
All CNH Industrial employees contribute to company performance at different levels and are key to the achievement of business targets and results. The conviction that people are the company’s greatest asset is the baseline principle of the Human Capital Management Guidelines which aim to increase organizational effectiveness. The Company has identified 5 key cultural behaviors which have been cascaded to the entire organization through specific trainings during 2022: Customer First, One Team, Grow Together, Make it Simple, Be the Best. Specific tools have been developed to implement the cultural behaviors which include focus recognitions, story telling and focus feedback. We strongly believe that sharing a common culture will help to retain and attract talent and ultimately allow the Company to be more competitive.
Employees
The ability to attract, retain, and further develop qualified employees is crucial to the success of CNH Industrial’s businesses and its ability to create value over the long-term. CNH Industrial’s business is, by its nature, labor intensive and this is reflected in the high number of Group hourly employees. As of December 31, 2022, CNH Industrial had 40,070 employees including 11,769 employees in the U.S. and Canada. CNH Industrial also retains consultants, independent contractors, and temporary and part-time workers. Approximately 1,000 hourly production employees in the United States were covered by a collective bargaining agreement with the United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America with an expiration date of May 2, 2026. Additionally, approximately 750 U.S. production employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with International Association of Machinists with an expiration date of April 28, 2024. In Canada, a small number of employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with the United Steelworkers Local Union No. 5917 that expires on April 15, 2023. In Europe, most employees are covered by collective labor agreements (“CLAs”) stipulated either by a CNH Industrial subsidiary or by the employer association for the specific industry to which the CNH Industrial subsidiary belongs. Outside North America and Europe, the Company enters into employment contracts and agreements in those countries in which such relationships are mandatory or customary. 
Diversity and Inclusion
Our Company is committed to creating a diverse and inclusive environment where all employees feel empowered, engaged, and valued. To progress towards our company’s diversity and inclusion ("D&I") goals, we are carrying out dedicated initiatives around the globe, such as D&I training employee resource groups (ERGs), online forum panel series "Let's Talk"; and partnerships with the Society of Women ENgineers and others. 
Code of Conduct
CNH Industrial’s Code of Conduct is one of the pillars of the CNH Industrial corporate governance system, which regulates the decision-making processes and the approach used by the Company and its employees in interacting with all stakeholders. The Code of Conduct summarizes the values the Company recognizes, adheres to, and fosters, in the belief that integrity and fairness are important drivers of long-term value creation and social and economic development. 
Employee Health and Safety
CNH Industrial’s approach to occupational health and safety is based on effective preventive and protective measures, implemented both collectively and individually, aimed at minimizing the risk of injury in the workplace. The Company endeavors to ensure optimal working conditions, applying principles of industrial hygiene and ergonomics to processes at organizational and operational level. Its safety management system directly involves employees in identifying and reporting work related hazards and potentially unsafe situations. This approach is intended to promote common, ethical occupational health and safety principles, and enables the achievement of improvement targets using various tools, including training and awareness campaigns. Key areas of focus are pursuit of a zero-accident and zero-injury rate, extension of ISO 45001 certification, and implementation of initiatives to increase employee health and safety awareness via multiple tools (e.g., training courses, corporate Intranet, video tutorials). 
Employee Compensation and Benefits
The Company is committed to providing a base pay that, in compliance with local regulations, is competitive with the local market, affordable from a business perspective, and in line with the Company’s achieve and earn philosophy. CNH Industrial has defined a compensation approach that comprises a number of different components. This comprehensive package rewards employees for their contribution to the Company’s results and allows them to share in the business success they help to create. Base salary, benefits, and short and long-term incentives are determined by market-driven benchmarks. Variable compensation is influenced by individual employee contribution, which is evaluated through a performance evaluation program that is deployed throughout the entire organization. The same metrics and methodology are applied in the annual performance assessment of all eligible employees worldwide. Additionally, the Company employs a formal process to monitor the application of its core equity and fairness principles to compensation levels, annual salary reviews, and promotions. 
Employee Welfare and Well-being
Employee welfare and well-being initiatives are an important part of the Company’s employee engagement. CNH Industrial offers well-being initiatives in addition to traditional benefits (such as health care), going beyond its legal obligations in the countries where it operates. The aim is to help employees balance their personal commitments through time and money saving initiatives and flexible working arrangements, while cultivating motivation, pride, and a sense of belonging at work through family activities, engagement with the community, and involvement in Company life.
Training and Development
CNH Industrial believes that employee training is key to skill management and development. Training allows sharing operational and business know-how, as well as the Company’s strategy and values.
The Company manages training through a 4-step process: training needs identification, content development, program delivery, and reporting. Ownership of each lies with different corporate functions, depending on which areas of content or expertise need to be improved.
The Training Management Model is business-oriented and therefore closely involves business functions on content areas such as:
•business and job-specific skills
•new business methodologies
•shared tools, languages, soft skills, legal aspects and compliance, ethics, etc.
CNH Industrial manages the overall training process through an Internet-based global learning management system. The Company builds upon segment-specific training programs, believing that the most effective solutions are specifically tailored to individual needs. 
Employees are given the opportunity to indicate development and training needs as part of a Performance Management Process, and to propose actions to support their personal development during the year.
Training effectiveness and efficiency are monitored and measured based on the participants’ satisfaction with the initiatives delivered and improvements in their knowledge/skills; in some cases, depending on the learning path, structured followups are provided.
Environmental and Other Regulatory Matters
We engineer, manufacture and sell our products and offer our services around the world, subject to requirements applicable to our products that relate to equipment emissions, product safety and fuel efficiency as well as those applicable to our manufacturing facilities that relate to stack emissions, treatment of waste, water and hazardous materials, prohibitions on soil contamination and worker health and safety. These extensive regional, national and local laws and regulations often impact the development of our products, including, but not limited to, required compliance with air emissions standards applicable to engines. We have made, and expect that we may additionally make, significant capital and research and development expenditures to comply with these standards now and in the future.
We are conducting environmental investigatory or remedial activities at certain properties that are currently or were formerly, owned and/or operated by us, or which are being decommissioned. We believe that the outcome of these activities will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position or results of operations while they will restore environmental conditions. 
Our operations and the activities of our employees, contractors and agents around the world are also subject to the laws and regulations of numerous countries, including the United States. These laws and regulations include data privacy requirements, labor relations laws, tax laws, antitrust regulations, prohibitions on payments to governmental officials and others, federal and state 
environmental regulations, import and trade restrictions and export requirements. Any violations of such law or regulation could also result in prohibitions on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
Our operations globally are also subject to risks of violations of laws prohibiting improper payments and bribery, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act as well as a range of national anti-corruption and antitrust or competition laws that apply to conduct in a particular jurisdiction. We have implemented a program to promote compliance with these laws and to reduce the likelihood of potential violations. Our compliance program, however, may not in every instance protect us from acts committed by our employees, agents, contractors, or collaborators that may violate the applicable laws or regulations of the jurisdictions in which we operate. Such improper actions could subject us to civil or criminal investigations and monetary, injunctive and other penalties as well as damage claims.
