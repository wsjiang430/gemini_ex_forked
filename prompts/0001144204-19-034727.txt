--------+---------

General
 
Universal Security Instruments, Inc. (“we” or “the Company”) designs and markets a variety of popularly-priced safety products consisting primarily of smoke alarms, carbon monoxide alarms and related products. Most of our products require minimal installation and are designed for easy installation by the consumer without professional assistance, and are sold through retail stores. We also market products to the electrical distribution trade through our wholly-owned subsidiary, USI Electric, Inc. (“USI Electric”). The electrical distribution trade includes electrical and lighting distributors as well as manufactured housing companies. Products sold by USI Electric usually require professional installation.
 
In 1989 we formed Eyston Company Limited, a limited liability company under the laws of Hong Kong, as a joint venture with a Hong Kong-based partner, to manufacture various products in the Peoples Republic of China (the “Hong Kong Joint Venture”). We currently own a 50% interest in the Hong Kong Joint Venture and are a significant customer of the Hong Kong Joint Venture (82.9% and 74.0% of its sales during fiscal 2019 and 2018 respectively), with the balance of its sales made to unrelated customers worldwide. We import all of our products from foreign suppliers. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, approximately 87.2% of our purchases were imported from the Hong Kong Joint Venture.
 
Our sales for the year ended March 31, 2019 were $17,588,040 compared to $14,873,189 for the year ended March 31, 2018. We reported a net loss of $1,347,986 in fiscal 2019 compared to a net loss of $2,262,310 in fiscal 2018, a decrease in the net loss of $914,324 (40.4%). The net loss is primarily due to increases in interest expense, product liability insurance expense, and the Company’s interest in the loss from investment in the Hong Kong joint venture.
 
The Company was incorporated in Maryland in 1969. Our principal executive office is located at 11407 Cronhill Drive, Suite A, Owings Mills, Maryland 21117, and our telephone number is 410-363-3000. Information about us may be obtained from our website www.universalsecurity.com. Copies of our Annual Report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and current reports on Form 8-K, are available free of charge on our website as soon as they are filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) through a link to the SEC’s EDGAR reporting system. Simply select the “Investor Relations” menu item, and then click on the “SEC Filings” link. The SEC’s EDGAR reporting system can also be accessed directly at www.sec.gov.
 
Safety Products
 
We market a line of residential smoke and carbon monoxide alarms under the trade names “UNIVERSAL” and “USI Electric” both of which are manufactured by the Hong Kong Joint Venture.
 
Our line of safety alarms consists of units powered by replaceable batteries, ten year sealed batteries, or are 120 volt with battery backup. Our replaceable battery products contain different types of batteries with different battery lives, and some include alarm silencers. The smoke alarms marketed to the electrical distribution trade also include hearing impaired and heat alarms with a variety of features. We also market door chimes, ventilation products, ground fault circuit interrupters (GFCI’s), and other electrical devices.
 
Over the past several fiscal years we have added significantly to our intellectual property portfolio. Since 2010 the United States Patent and Trademark Office has awarded eight patents to the Company, many being applied to our “Smart Alarm Technology” developed to significantly reduce nuisance alarms. This “Smart Alarm Technology” is being incorporated into our new sealed battery alarms. In addition, certain of our detector designs have also been awarded patents. We consider these patented enhancements to form a core part of the Company’s “next generation” safety product line. The Company has also been awarded foreign patents for its technology. The Company has actively pursued development of an array of unique packaging and source identifiers with the intent of promoting consumer association with our Company’s “next generation” product line. These efforts have resulted in eight new Trademark registrations being granted by the United States Patent and Trademark Office.
 
We also submitted each of our new products for independent testing agency approval, and have introduced products into the marketplace as approvals were received. This process began during the fourth quarter of our 2010 fiscal year and continued through the development and testing of our sealed battery alarms. Currently, we have received independent testing agency approvals on all of our sealed battery products.

Our wholly-owned subsidiary, USI Electric, Inc., focuses its sales and marketing efforts to maximize safety product sales, especially smoke alarms and carbon monoxide alarms manufactured by our Hong Kong Joint Venture, to the electrical distribution trade.
 
Import Matters
 
We import all of our products. As an importer, we are subject to numerous tariffs which vary depending on types of products and country of origin, changes in economic and political conditions in the country of manufacture, potential trade restrictions, and currency fluctuations. Substantially all of our safety products, including products we purchase from our Hong Kong Joint Venture, are imported from the People’s Republic of China. These products are currently subject to tariffs ranging from ten to twenty-five percent.
 
We have attempted to protect ourselves from fluctuations in currency exchange rates to the extent possible by negotiating commitments in U.S. dollars. Our inventory purchases are also subject to delays in delivery due to problems with shipping and docking facilities, as well as other problems associated with purchasing products abroad.
 
Sales and Marketing; Customers
 
We sell our products to various customers, and our total sales market can be divided generally into two categories; sales by the Company to retailers, including wholesale distributors, chain, discount, television retailers and home center stores, catalog and mail order companies and other distributors (“retailers”), and sales by our USI Electric subsidiary to the electrical distribution trade (primarily electrical and lighting distributors and manufactured housing companies) and foreign customers. Products marketed by the Company have historically been retailed to “do-it-yourself” consumers by these retailers. Products marketed by our USI Electric subsidiary to the electrical distribution trade typically require professional installation. We do not currently market a significant portion of our products directly to end users.
 
A significant portion of our sales are made by approximately 40 independent sales organizations, compensated by commission, which represents approximately 100 sales representatives, some of which have warehouses where USI Electric products are maintained for sale. In addition, the Company has established a national distribution system with eight regional stocking warehouses throughout the United States which generally enables customers to receive their orders the next day without paying for overnight freight charges. Our agreements with these sales organizations are generally cancelable by either party upon 30 days’ notice. We do not believe that the loss of any one of these organizations would have a material adverse effect upon our business. Sales are also made directly by the officers and full-time employees of the Company and our USI Electric subsidiary, seven of whom have other responsibilities for the Company. Sales outside the United States are made by our officers and through exporters, and amounted to less than five percent of total net sales in fiscal years 2019 and 2018.
 
We also market our products through our website and through our own sales catalogs and brochures, which are mailed directly to trade customers. Our customers, in turn, may advertise our products in their own catalogs and brochures and in their ads in newspapers and other media. We also exhibit and sell our products at various trade shows, including the annual National Hardware Show.
 
Our backlog of orders as of March 31, 2019 was approximately $748,000. Our backlog as of March 31, 2018 was approximately $1,326,000. This decrease in backlog is primarily due to the timing of orders of our safety products.
 
Hong Kong Joint Venture
 
We have a 50% interest in Eyston Company Limited, the Hong Kong Joint Venture, which has manufacturing facilities in the People’s Republic of China, for the manufacturing of certain of our electronic and electrical products.
 
We believe that the Hong Kong Joint Venture arrangement will ensure a continuing source of supply for a majority of our safety products at competitive prices. During fiscal years 2019 and 2018, 87.2% and 97.8%, respectively, of our total inventory purchases were made from the Hong Kong Joint Venture. The products produced by the Hong Kong Joint Venture include smoke alarms and carbon monoxide alarms. Negative changes in economic and political conditions in China or any other adversity to the Hong Kong Joint Venture will unfavorably affect the value of our investment in the Hong Kong Joint Venture and would have a material adverse effect on the Company’s ability to purchase products for distribution.

Our purchases from the Hong Kong Joint Venture represented approximately 82.9% of the Hong Kong Joint Venture’s total sales during fiscal 2019 and 74.0% of total sales during fiscal 2018, with the balance of the Hong Kong Joint Venture’s sales being primarily made in Europe and Australia, to unrelated customers. The Hong Kong Joint Venture’s sales to unrelated customers were $2,039,878 in fiscal 2019 and $3,504,494 in fiscal 2018. Please see Note C of the consolidated financial statements, and management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, for a comparison of annual sales and earnings of the Hong Kong Joint Venture.
 
Other Suppliers
 
Certain private label products not manufactured for us by the Hong Kong Joint Venture are manufactured by other foreign suppliers. We believe that our relationships with our suppliers are good. We believe that the loss of our ability to purchase products from the Hong Kong Joint Venture would have a material adverse effect on the Company. The loss of any of our other suppliers would have a short-term adverse effect on our operations, but replacement sources for these other suppliers could be developed.
Competition
 
In fiscal years 2019 and 2018, sales of safety products accounted for substantially all of our total sales. In the sale of smoke alarms and carbon monoxide alarms, we compete in all of our markets with First Alert and Walter Kidde Portable Equipment, Inc. These companies have greater financial resources and financial strength than we have. However, we believe that our safety products compete favorably in the market primarily on the basis of styling, features and pricing.
 
The safety industry in general involves changing technology. The success of our products may depend on our ability to improve and update our products in a timely manner and to adapt to new technological advances.
 
Employees
 
As of March 31, 2019, we had thirteen employees, nine of whom are engaged in administration and sales, and the balance of whom are engaged in product development. Our employees are not unionized, and we believe that our relations with our employees are satisfactory.
