Item 1. | Business
--------+---------

 
Unless otherwise indicated, the terms “the Company,” “we,” “our,” and “us” are used in this 2022 Form 10‑K to refer to Northwest Pipe Company or one of our consolidated subsidiaries or to all of them taken as a whole. We were incorporated in the State of Oregon in 1966.
 
Overview
 
Northwest Pipe Company is a leading manufacturer of water-related infrastructure products. In addition to being the largest manufacturer of engineered steel water pipeline systems in North America, we manufacture stormwater and wastewater technology products; high-quality precast and reinforced concrete products; pump lift stations; steel casing pipe, bar-wrapped concrete cylinder pipe, and one of the largest offerings of pipeline system joints, fittings, and specialized components. Strategically positioned to meet growing water and wastewater infrastructure needs, we provide solution-based products for a wide range of markets under the ParkUSA, Geneva Pipe and Precast, Permalok®, and Northwest Pipe Company lines. Our diverse team is committed to quality and innovation while demonstrating our core values of accountability, commitment, and teamwork. We are headquartered in Vancouver, Washington, and have 13 manufacturing facilities across North America.
 
Our water infrastructure products are sold generally to installation contractors, who include our products in their bids to federal, state, and municipal agencies, privately-owned water companies, or developers for specific projects. We believe our sales are substantially driven by spending on urban growth and new water infrastructure with a recent trend towards spending on water infrastructure replacement, repair, and upgrade. Within the total range of products, our steel pipe tends to fit the larger-diameter, higher-pressure pipeline applications, while our precast concrete products mainly serve stormwater and sanitary sewer systems.
 
With steady population growth and regional community expansion, as well as continued drought conditions, existing water sources have become stressed, and we see continued opportunities for growth in North American infrastructure.
 
Recent Strategic Actions
 
On October 5, 2021, we completed the acquisition of 100% of Park Environmental Equipment, LLC (ParkUSA) for a purchase price of $90.2 million in cash, which is included in the Precast Infrastructure and Engineered Systems (“Precast”) segment for all periods following the acquisition date. ParkUSA is a precast concrete and steel fabrication-based company that develops and manufactures water, wastewater, and environmental solutions. Operations continue with ParkUSA’s previous management and workforce at its three Texas manufacturing facilities located in Houston, Dallas, and San Antonio. This strategic acquisition provides a foothold into the water infrastructure technology market. As we employ similar operating capabilities at our existing facilities, we intend to explore strategic opportunities to expand ParkUSA’s value-added products within the organization.
 
On January 31, 2020, we completed the acquisition of 100% of Geneva Pipe and Precast Company (“Geneva”) (fka Geneva Pipe Company, Inc.) for a purchase price of $49.4 million in cash, which is included in the Precast segment for all periods following the acquisition date. Geneva is a concrete pipe and precast concrete products manufacturer based in Utah. This acquisition expanded our water infrastructure product capabilities by adding additional reinforced concrete pipe capacity and a full line of precast concrete products including storm drains and manholes, catch basins, vaults, and curb inlets as well as innovative lined products that extend the life of concrete pipe and manholes for sewer applications. Operations continue with Geneva’s previous management and workforce at its three Utah manufacturing facilities.
 
Impact of the COVID‑19 Pandemic on Our Business
 
In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID‑19 a pandemic. The impacts of the COVID‑19 pandemic, and the resurgence of new COVID‑19 virus variants, on global and domestic economic conditions, including the impacts of labor and raw material shortages, the long-term potential to reduce or delay funding of municipal projects, and the continued disruptions to and volatility in the financial markets remain uncertain. While the COVID‑19 pandemic has caused various direct and indirect financial impacts associated with project bidding, execution, and product deliveries over the past couple of years, we remain unable to predict the ultimate impact that the COVID‑19 pandemic may have on our business, future results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. We continue to monitor the impact of the COVID‑19 pandemic on all aspects of our business.

Precast has manufacturing facilities located in Dallas, Houston, and San Antonio, Texas; and Orem, Salt Lake City, and St. George, Utah.
Our Industries
 
Much of the United States water infrastructure is antiquated and many authorities, including the United States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), believe the United States water infrastructure is in critical need of update, repair, or replacement. A combination of new population centers, rising demand on developed water sources, substantial underinvestment in water infrastructure over the past several decades, drought conditions, climate change, and increasingly stringent regulatory policies are driving demand for water infrastructure projects in the United States. These trends are intensifying the need for new water infrastructure as well as the need to upgrade, repair, and replace existing water infrastructure. While we believe this offers the potential for increased demand for our water infrastructure products and other products related to water transmission, budgetary pressures could impact governmental and public water agency projects in the near-term.
 
Federal initiatives to improve the conditions of the aging water infrastructure include the Water Infrastructure and Resiliency Finance Center at the EPA and the Water and Environmental Programs at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal (Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act), signed into law in November 2021, will invest $55 billion to expand access to clean drinking water for households, businesses, schools, and child care centers all across the country. According to its 2021 Annual Report, the EPA’s Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act program, a federal credit program for eligible water and wastewater infrastructure projects, closed 31 loans totaling over $5 billion in 2021.
 
In addition to the Federal initiatives, individual states are also taking action. In November 2013, the State of Texas earmarked $27 billion of future bond funding for state water projects over the next 50 years through their State Water Implementation Fund for Texas (SWIFT). This program provides low-interest and deferred loans to state agencies making approved investments in water infrastructure projects. In November 2014, the State of California approved the Water Quality, Supply and Infrastructure Improvement Act which authorizes $7.5 billion in general obligation bonds to fund state water supply infrastructure projects, such as public water system improvements, surface and groundwater storage, drinking water protection, water recycling and advanced water treatment technology, water supply management and conveyance, wastewater treatment, drought relief, emergency water supplies, and ecosystem and watershed protection and restoration. Our strategically located manufacturing facilities are well-positioned to take advantage of the anticipated growth in demand.
 
Engineered Steel Pressure Pipe. In its Sixth Drinking Water Infrastructure Needs Survey and Assessment released in March 2018, the EPA estimated the nation will need to spend $473 billion on public water system infrastructure capital improvements from 2015 to 2034 to continue to provide safe drinking water to the public. The American Society of Civil Engineers (“ASCE”) has given poor ratings to many aspects of the United States water infrastructure in their 2021 Infrastructure Report Card for Drinking Water. The Failure to Act: Economic Impacts of Status Quo Investment Across Infrastructure Systems report published by ASCE and EBP in 2021, estimates there will be $2.6 trillion in cumulative infrastructure needs for water and wastewater infrastructure by 2029, and $5.8 trillion in cumulative infrastructure needs by 2039. The American Water Works Association concluded in their 2012 report, Buried No Longer: Confronting America’s Water Infrastructure Challenge, that from 2011 to 2035 more than $1 trillion will be needed to repair and expand drinking water infrastructure.
 
According to the United States Census Bureau, the population of the United States will increase by approximately 52 million people between 2023 and 2050. The resulting increase in demand will require substantial new infrastructure, as the existing United States water infrastructure is not equipped to provide water to millions of new residents. The development of new sources of water at greater distances from population centers will drive the demand for new water transmission lines. Climate change may be a cause for the drought conditions in some regions of the country and are increasing the demand for new infrastructure. The Construction Outlook 2023 from Dodge Construction Network forecasts public works construction in 2023 will grow 18%, supported by several recent federal legislative initiatives that have provided ample funding for infrastructure projects over the coming year.

As water systems degrade over time and cause failures, many current water supply sources are in danger of being exhausted. Much of the drinking water infrastructure in major cities was built in the mid-20th century with a lifespan of 75 to 100 years. In its 2021 Infrastructure Report Card for Drinking Water, the ASCE estimates there are 250,000 to 300,000 water main breaks per year in the United States, wasting over 2.1 trillion gallons of treated drinking water. The ASCE also reports that with utilities averaging a pipe replacement rate of 1.0% to 4.8% per year, the replacement rate now matches the lifecycle of the pipes. These aging water and wastewater systems will drive demand for future investment.
 
The Drinking Water State Revolving Loan Fund (“DWSRF”), a federal-state partnership and financial assistance program to help water systems and states achieve the health protection objectives of the Safe Drinking Water Act, provided $3.8 billion in assistance in 2021 and $48.5 billion in assistance since 1997, according to the 2021 DWSRF Annual Report.
 
Finally, the increased public awareness of problems with the quality of drinking water and efficient water usage has resulted in more stringent application of federal and state environmental regulations. The need to comply with these regulations in an environment of heightened public awareness is expected to contribute to demand in the water infrastructure industry.
 
Our large-diameter, engineered welded steel pipeline systems are utilized in water, energy, structural, and plant piping applications. Our core market is the large-diameter, high-pressure portion of a water transmission pipeline that is typically at the “upper end” of a pipeline system. This is the portion of the overall water pipeline that generally transports water from the source to a treatment plant or from a treatment plant into the distribution system, rather than the small lines that deliver water directly into households. We believe the total addressable market for the engineered welded steel pipeline system products sold will be approximately $2.0 billion over the next three years.
 
Precast Infrastructure and Engineered Systems. In its 2021 Infrastructure Report Card for Wastewater, the ASCE estimates the drinking water and wastewater pipes in the ground, with a typical lifespan expected of 50 to 100 years, are on average 45 years old. In 2020, Bluefield Research estimated that utilities throughout the country will spend more than $3 billion on wastewater pipe repairs and replacements, addressing 4,692 miles of wastewater pipeline, and this cost is projected to grow by an average of 5% annually.
In its 2021 Infrastructure Report Card for Stormwater, the ASCE states that given the recent increase in rainfall trends and urbanization in certain geographic regions, the actual capacity of a stormwater system is often less than the design standard. In addition, from 2010 to 2018 the length of impaired rivers and streams increased 39%, a key indicator of declining stormwater infrastructure condition.
 
Our high-quality precast and reinforced concrete products and bar-wrapped concrete cylinder pipe are typically used in non-pressure, gravity fed sewer and stormwater applications. Demand for these products is generally influenced by general economic conditions such as housing starts, population growth, and interest rates. New residential and commercial construction and state Department of Transportation funding impact our market. The November 2022 Bluefield Research Insight Report – U.S. & Canada Municipal Water Outlook: Utility CAPEX & OPEX Forecasts, 2022-2030 (“Bluefield Report”) states that since the peak of new U.S. home construction in March 2022, interest rate hikes have dissuaded potential new homebuyers from entering the market. According to the United States Census Bureau, the privately-owned housing starts in December 2022 were at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.4 million, compared to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.8 million in December 2021. However, our Precast manufacturing facilities are located in Texas, one of three states with the largest infrastructure asset base, and Utah; both of these states are in the top five of the fastest growing markets (based on compound annual growth rate forecasted through 2030), according to the Bluefield Report.
 
Backlog
 
Engineered Steel Pressure Pipe. We measure backlog as a key metric to evaluate the commercial health of our water infrastructure steel pipe business. Backlog represents the balance of remaining performance obligations under signed contracts for SPP products for which revenue is recognized over time. Binding agreements received by us may be subject to cancelation or postponement; however, cancelation would obligate the customer to pay the contract consideration proportional to the costs we have incurred through the cancelation date. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, backlog was $274 million and $183 million, respectively. Backlog as of any particular date may not be indicative of actual operating results for any fiscal period. There can be no assurance that any amount of backlog ultimately will be realized. Separate from our backlog, we have been notified that we are the successful bidder on additional projects, but binding agreements have not been executed (“confirmed orders”). As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, backlog including confirmed orders was $372 million and $290 million, respectively. Projects for which a binding agreement has not been executed could be canceled.

Products
 
Engineered Steel Pressure Pipe. Water infrastructure steel pipe is used for high-pressure applications, typically requiring pipe to withstand pressures in excess of 150 pounds per square inch. Most of our water transmission products, mainly welded steel pipe and bar-wrapped cylinder pipe, are made to project specifications for fully engineered, large-diameter, high-pressure water infrastructure systems. Other uses include power generation circulating water systems, penstocks, pipe piling, and water and wastewater treatment plants. Spiral welded pipe is manufactured in diameters ranging from 24 inches to 156 inches with wall thickness of 0.135 inches to 1.00 inch. Our rolled and welded capabilities allow for manufacturing diameters greater than 156 inches or wall thicknesses exceeding 1.00 inch. Lining and coating capabilities include cement mortar, polyurethane, epoxy, polyethylene tape, and coal-tar enamel according to our customers’ project specifications. Fabrication of fittings are performed at our own facilities providing installation contractors and project owners with a complete engineered system. Product is delivered to the jobsite using commercial trucks or marine transport as needed.
 
We manufacture Permalok® steel casing pipe, which is a proprietary pipe joining system that employs a press-fit interlocking connection system. The Permalok® product is generally installed in trenchless construction projects.
 
Precast Infrastructure and Engineered Systems. We manufacture a variety of high-quality precast concrete products for water and adjacent infrastructure applications. Our precast products include reinforced concrete pipe (“RCP”), manholes, box culverts, vaults, catch basins, oil water separators, pump lift stations, lined RCP and manholes, and other precast infrastructure products.
 
The Geneva facilities manufacture RCP in sizes ranging from twelve inches to 96 inches in diameter and in a variety of strength classes at ASTM International and American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (“AASHTO”) specifications which are primarily used for water transmission, sanitary sewer systems, storm drainage, and utilities fabrication. Geneva’s manholes, box culverts, vaults, and other structural products come in a variety of dimensions. Geneva’s lined products include high-density polyethylene (“HDPE”) or fiber reinforced plastic internal liners within manholes and RCP with additional corrosion protection in sanitary sewer and wastewater environments.
 
Under the ParkUSA brand, we manufacture pre-assembled stormwater, wastewater, and water management systems housed predominantly in precast concrete or steel housings, including water meter assemblies, break tank systems, pump lift stations, and backflow prevention systems. ParkUSA also manufactures a variety of stormwater products including catch basins, canal valves, and interceptors capable of removing sediments, trash, and oil from stormwater runoff. ParkUSA’s wastewater products protect the environment and limit pollutants from entering sewer systems including interceptors designed to neutralize and macerate foreign materials such as fats, oils, and greases in wastewater for hospitals, service stations, restaurants, and other commercial applications. ParkUSA units are pre-assembled in a quality-controlled environment and are delivered ready to install to the job site, providing significant savings from onsite assembly.
 
Manufacturing and Product Development
 
Engineered Steel Pressure Pipe. Water infrastructure steel pipe manufacturing begins with the preparation of engineered drawings of each unique piece of pipe in a project. These drawings are prepared on our proprietary computer-aided design system and are used as blueprints to manufacture pipe. After the drawings are completed and approved, the manufacturing of engineered steel water pipe begins by feeding a steel coil continuously at a specified angle into a spiral weld mill which cold-forms the band into a tubular configuration with a spiral seam. Automated arc welders, positioned on both the inside and the outside of the tube, are used to weld the seam. The welded pipe is then cut at the specified length. After completion of the forming and welding phases, the finished cylinder is tested and inspected in accordance with project specifications, which may include 100% radiographic analysis of the weld seam. The cylinders are then coated and lined as specified. Possible coatings include polyurethane paint, polyethylene tape, epoxy, cement mortar, coal-tar enamel, and Pritec®. The inside of the pipe cylinders can be lined with cement mortar, polyurethane, or epoxy. Following coating and lining, certain pieces may be custom fabricated as required for the project. This process is performed at our on-site fabrication facilities. Completed pipes are evaluated for structural integrity with a hydrotester prior to shipment.
 
In April 2022, we introduced the Permalok® Auger Bore Joint, which utilizes a precision-machined interference fit that eliminates the need for time-sensitive field applied butt-welds on trenchless and open-cut applications. This patented pre-installed joint connection is flush with the interior and exterior surfaces of the pipe, allowing for quick, easy, and permanent joining in the field. Its unique stepped profile simplifies installation for our customers.
 
In November 2022, we announced the development of the Permalok® Radial Bending Joint. This patent-pending technology is a groundbreaking advancement in trenchless microtunneling construction allowing steel pipe to be installed in a curved radius. As with other Permalok joints, the press-fit machined joint reduces field time by eliminating butt-weld joints and results in a shortened install duration and reduced field costs.

Precast Infrastructure and Engineered Systems. Precast concrete products are manufactured using either a dry cast or wet cast concrete mix, depending on the size of the piece and the number of identical pieces to be manufactured. In the dry cast method, a concrete mix with low water content, known as zero-slump concrete, is poured into a mold and then densely compacted around the steel reinforcement using a variety of manufacturing methods. The concrete structure is immediately removed from the mold and allowed to cure in a high humidity environment to ensure proper hydration of the concrete. This method allows multiple pieces to be produced from the same mold each day and is most suitable for high volume, repetitive manufacturing. We also manufacture reinforced concrete pipe by producing a steel mesh cage, enclosing it in a form or mold, and then pouring concrete around it to produce the pipe. In the wet cast method, a concrete mix with relatively high water content is poured into a mold and allowed to cure in the mold, which can take from four to 16 hours.
 
We work hand-in-hand with our customers to develop custom water infrastructure products that help protect the environment. Many of our precast wastewater, stormwater, water management, and process systems include integrated Original Equipment Manufacturer components that we build out at our facilities into the finished solution. We build and test each unit to industry standards in our quality-controlled certified facilities. The units arrive at the jobsite ready to install, which reduces jobsite construction time and the need for specialized trades on site.
 
Technology. Advances in technology help us produce high-quality products at competitive prices. We have invested in modern welding and inspection equipment to improve both productivity and product quality. We own interlocking pipe joining system technologies (Permalok®) that provide an alternate joint solution used for connecting steel pipes. In addition, we are licensed to manufacture a conventional reinforced concrete pipe with a HDPE liner to protect concrete pipe from corrosion, and a lined manhole system, which integrates a precast concrete monolithic base with a plastic liner that is chemically resistant to raw sewage gases. ParkUSA also holds several patents for commercially viable products.
 
To stay current with technological developments in the United States and abroad, we participate in trade shows, industry associations, research projects, and vendor trials of new products. Our staff includes some of the most tenured and experienced pipe manufacturing professionals in the nation.
 
Intellectual Property. We own various patents, registered trademarks and trade names and applications for, or licenses in respect of the same, that relate to our various products, including a number of innovative technologies relating to water infrastructure as well as precast infrastructure and engineered systems produced by ParkUSA. We also license intellectual property for use in certain of our products from unaffiliated third parties. We believe that our patents, trademarks, and trade names are adequately protected and that any expiration or other loss of one or more of our patents or other intellectual property rights would not have a material adverse effect upon our business, financial condition, or results of operations.
Quality Assurance. We have quality management systems in place that assure we are consistently providing products that meet or exceed customer and applicable regulatory requirements. All of our steel pipe manufacturing facilities’ quality management systems in the United States and Mexico are registered under a multi-site registration by the International Organization for Standardization (“ISO”). In addition to the ISO qualification, we are certified for specific steel pipe products or operations by the American Petroleum Institute. All of our steel pipe water transmission manufacturing facilities are certified by NSF for cement lining. We are certified for specific precast and reinforced concrete products or operations by the National Precast Concrete Association and the National Ready Mixed Concrete Association. We also follow and make products to the following standards and specifications: American Institute of Steel Construction, American Society of Mechanical Engineers, American Welding Society, Caltrans, American Water Works Association, ASTM International, AASHTO, and the ASCE. All of our steel pipe nondestructive evaluation technicians are qualified and certified to the guidelines of the American Society for Nondestructive Testing, Inc.
 
Our quality assurance/quality control department is responsible for monitoring and measuring the characteristics of our products. Inspection capabilities include, but are not limited to, visual, dimensional, liquid penetrant, magnetic particle, hydrostatic, ultrasonic, conventional, computed and real-time x-ray/radioscopic, base material tensile, yield and elongation, sand sieve analysis, coal-tar penetration, concrete compression, lining and coating dry film thickness, adhesion, concrete absorption, guided bend, charpy impact, hardness, metallurgical examinations, chemical analysis, spectrographic analysis, and finished product final inspection. Our products are not released for customer shipment until there is verification that all requirements have been met.

Marketing
 
Engineered Steel Pressure Pipe. Our seven steel pipe manufacturing facilities in Oregon, California, West Virginia, Texas, Missouri, and Mexico allow us to efficiently serve customers throughout North America. The primary customers for our water infrastructure steel pipe products are installation contractors for projects funded by public water agencies. Our marketing strategy emphasizes early identification of potential water projects, promotion of specifications consistent with our capabilities and products, and close contact with the project designers and owners throughout the design phase. Our in-house sales force is comprised of sales representatives, engineers, and support personnel who work closely with public water agencies, contractors, and engineering firms, often years in advance of a project bid date. These relationships allow us to identify and evaluate planned projects at early stages, and pursue these projects by offering technical support and resources. After an agency completes a design, they publicize the upcoming bid for a water transmission project. We then obtain detailed plans and develop our estimate for the pipe portion of the project. We typically bid to installation contractors who include our bid in their proposals to public water agencies. A public water agency generally awards the entire project to the contractor with the lowest responsive bid.
Precast Infrastructure and Engineered Systems. Our six precast and water systems manufacturing facilities in Texas and Utah allow us to efficiently serve customers throughout Texas, the Intermountain West region, and surrounding states. The primary customers for our precast infrastructure and reinforced concrete products are installation contractors for various commercial, government, residential, and industrial projects. Our marketing strategy emphasizes our product quality and variety of offerings, competitive pricing, customer service, delivery, and technical expertise. We market many of our engineered systems with preinstalled components as having the advantage of reduced field install time, the elimination of multiple vendors, and higher quality control. Our sales force is comprised of in-house and third-party sales representatives, engineers, and support personnel who work closely with the customers to find the right product or solution for their specific need.
Competition
 
Engineered Steel Pressure Pipe. Most water infrastructure steel pipe projects are competitively bid and price competition is vigorous. Price competition may reduce the gross margin on sales, which may adversely affect overall profitability. Other competitive factors include timely delivery, customized specifications, and high freight costs which may limit the ability of manufacturers located in other market areas to compete with us. With water infrastructure steel pipe manufacturing facilities in Oregon, California, West Virginia, Texas, Missouri, and Mexico, we believe we can more effectively compete throughout North America. Our primary competitors in the western United States and southwestern Canada are Imperial Pipe and West Coast Pipe. East of the Rocky Mountains, our primary competitors are Thompson Pipe Group, American SpiralWeld Pipe, and Mid America Pipe Fabricating & Supply, LLC.
 
Our competitors could build new facilities or expand capacity within our market areas. In 2019, a competitor broke ground on a new spiral welded steel pipe facility in Texas that became operational in the first half of 2021. New or expanded facilities or new competitors could have a material adverse effect on our market share, product pricing, sales, gross margins, and overall profitability in our business.
 
Precast Infrastructure and Engineered Systems. Our six precast and reinforced concrete product manufacturing facilities in Texas and Utah have several local competitors which are primarily other precast concrete manufacturers in the respective states where we operate. Our primary competitors are Oldcastle Infrastructure in Texas and Utah and The QUIKRETE Companies in Texas.
Raw Materials and Supplies
 
We have at least two suppliers for most of our raw materials. We believe our relationships with our suppliers are positive and do not expect that we will experience shortages of raw materials or components essential to our production processes or that we will be forced to seek alternative sources of supply. Any shortages of raw materials may result in production delays and costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
Engineered Steel Pressure Pipe. The main raw component in our steel pipe manufacturing process is steel. We have historically purchased hot rolled steel coil and steel plate from both domestic and foreign steel mills. Our suppliers include Big River Steel, Steel Dynamics, Inc., United States Steel Corporation, ArcelorMittal, SSAB, POSCO INTERNATIONAL, EVRAZ North America, California Steel Industries, Cleveland-Cliffs Inc., and Nucor Corporation. Steel is normally purchased after the steel pressure pipe orders are confirmed with an executed contract. Purchased steel represents a substantial portion of our cost of sales. The steel industry is highly cyclical in nature and steel prices fluctuate significantly, influenced by numerous factors beyond our control, including general economic conditions, availability of raw materials, energy costs, import duties, other trade restrictions, and currency exchange rates.
 
    7 

  

Precast Infrastructure and Engineered Systems. The main raw components in our precast and reinforced concrete products are cement, steel, and aggregate, which are widely available commodities. When possible, we source these raw materials from suppliers near our facilities. During 2022, we experienced supply chain challenges for cement resulting from historically high demand as well as equipment outages, which led to suppliers allocating cement to customers in both Texas and Utah. We also rely on certain suppliers of valves, pumps, piping, and certain custom fabricated items, and experienced supply chain challenges for some of these materials during periods of the year.
Seasonality
 
Our operations can be affected by seasonal variations and our results tend to be stronger in the second and third quarters of each year due to typically milder weather in the regions in which we operate. We are more likely to be impacted by severe weather events, such as hurricanes and excessive flash flooding, snow, ice, or frigid temperatures, which may cause temporary, short-term anomalies in our operational performance in certain localized geographic regions. However, these impacts usually have not been material to our operations as a whole. See Part I — Item 1A. “Risk Factors” of this 2022 Form 10‑K for further discussion.
Government Regulations
 
We are subject to various environmental, health, and employee safety laws and regulations. We believe we are in material compliance with these laws and regulations and do not currently believe that future compliance with such laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position. Nevertheless, we cannot guarantee that, in the future, we will not incur additional costs for compliance or that such costs will not be material.
 
In particular, we are subject to federal, state, local, and foreign environmental regulations, violations of which could lead to fines, penalties, other civil sanctions, or criminal sanctions. These environmental laws and regulations govern emissions to air; discharges to water; and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment, and disposal of waste materials. We operate under numerous governmental permits and licenses relating to air emissions, stormwater runoff, and other environmental matters. We are subject to environmental laws requiring the investigation and cleanup of environmental contamination at properties we presently own or operate and at third-party disposal or treatment facilities to which these sites send or arrange to send hazardous waste. For example, we have been identified as a potentially responsible party at the Portland Harbor Superfund Site discussed in Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II — Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this 2022 Form 10‑K. Estimating liabilities for environmental investigations and cleanup is complex and dependent upon a number of factors beyond our control which may change dramatically. We have no reserves for environmental investigation or cleanup, and we believe this is appropriate based on current information; however, we cannot provide assurance that our future environmental investigation and cleanup costs and liabilities will not result in a material expense.
 
Human Capital Resources
 
At Northwest Pipe Company, we believe that a commitment to developing our Human Capital Resources is necessary to maintain our position as a leader in our marketplace. Key issues of culture, health and safety, and diversity and inclusion are key priorities in our discussions of our environmental, social, and governance (ESG) impact.
Employees. As of December 31, 2022, we had 1,312 employees, the overwhelming majority of which were full-time. Approximately 66% of our workforce is employed on an hourly basis, while 34% is salaried. Approximately 5% of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement with a single labor union. We consider our relations with our employees and the labor union to be good. The weighted-average tenure of our employees is 8 years of service.
 
Maintaining a sufficient number of skilled employees in order to support the operations at our corporate office and various manufacturing sites continues to be a key focus at Northwest Pipe Company. To that end, we offer a wide array of company-paid benefits to our employees both in the United States and Mexico. Benefits may vary between countries due to customary local practices and statutory requirements, or due to an employee’s full or part time status, work location, position, or tenure; however, we believe that as a whole our compensation packages are competitive relative to others in our industry. We are committed to ensuring equal pay for equal work regardless of an employee’s age, gender identity, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, or physical or mental ability.
 
Culture. Our key values are captured in the acronym ACT, which stands for Accountability, Commitment, and Teamwork, which we seek to demonstrate in our daily actions. Our executive leadership team guides our strategic direction to provide innovative water, environmental, and other infrastructure solutions for a wide range of commercial, residential, and municipal applications which are manufactured safely (see Health and Safety below) and efficiently. As a trusted partner to engineering firms, contractors, and water municipalities, we strive for operational, manufacturing, and client service excellence. Our success stems from our employees delivering product to our customers that consistently meets or exceeds their expectations.
 
    8 

  

We believe that our employees are our best resources. In order to recognize and reward the continued commitment and teamwork of our employees, when positions that may offer opportunities for advancement become open at Northwest Pipe Company, we first try to fill those positions from within.
 
We are committed to promoting and supporting fundamental human rights at our facilities, and have adopted a Human Rights Policy. In that policy, we prohibit the use of child labor and all forms of forced labor, including prison labor, indentured labor, bonded labor, military labor, modern forms of slavery, and any form of human trafficking.
 
Health and Safety. Our goal is to send each employee home safe at the end of the day. As such, safety is at the central core of our culture, and is infused at every level of our organization. More than just policy and procedure, our safety program gives equal focus to the human side of safety, integrating coaching and mentoring efforts with compliance-driven approaches. By instilling a deep commitment to safety that reaches from our Chief Executive Officer to our general laborers, we have achieved industry-leading safety performance. Over the last four years, our average total recordable incident rate was 2.35 and our average days away rate was 0.51, calculated in accordance with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration’s record keeping requirements. Each of our facilities utilize various interactions to achieve this performance, from a toolbox meeting to cover the day’s work and any particular safety concern, to monthly Safety Plan Meetings, ‘No Days Away’ Safety Awards, and our employee-favorite, Safety Day. Each year, a facility may close for one full day to cover safety training and updates. Outside vendors demonstrate the latest safety procedures and equipment in a hands-on, fun atmosphere.
 
As a manufacturer, we work hard to eliminate hazards associated with high-risk work and have measures in place that include programs for fall protection, heavy equipment operation, and lockout/tagout. We also focus on personal safety issues, such as complacency and fatigue. We offer our employees medical, dental, and vision insurance coverage to support their physical and mental well-being. We seek to keep our employees healthy during the COVID‑19 pandemic by taking proactive and precautionary steps to ensure the safety of our employees including frequent cleaning and disinfection of workspaces, providing personal protective equipment, instituting social distancing measure, staggering employee schedules, offering remote working environments for certain employees, encouraging vaccination, and guiding employees on preemptive measures as outlined by the Center for Disease Control (CDC).
 
Diversity and Inclusion. Diversity and inclusion are integral to our employee experience, and we are proud of our diverse workforce. Companies that are diverse in age, gender identity, race, sexual orientation, physical or mental ability, ethnicity, and perspective are shown to be more resilient. We believe that diversity and inclusion are important in building the most effective, high-performing teams as part of our ACT culture. As of December 31, 2022, 51% of our employees in the United States self-identified as belonging to one or more of the following racial/ethnic groups: American Indian or Alaskan Native, African American/Black, Asian, Hispanic or Latino, and Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander. As of December 31, 2022, 12% of our employees self-identified as female.
 
Our goal is to build a skilled and strong workforce that is not only diverse in race and ethnicity, but also diverse in age, gender identity, sexual orientation, physical or mental ability, and perspective. Our Affirmative Action Program (“AAP”) strives to hire, recruit, train, and promote employees in job classifications without regard to race, age, religion, color, sex, national origin, physical or mental disability, marital or veteran status, sexual orientation, gender identity, or any other classification protected by law. To support these efforts, the AAP for our facilities in the United States is reviewed annually by a third-party consultant, establishing annual hiring goals for women, minorities, veterans, and individuals with disabilities.
 
Ethics and Compliance. We take pride in the high standards of conduct that identifies us as a company. We have controls in place relating to compliance with our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (“Code”), including a requirement for employees to review and understand the requirements of our Code, as well as an established whistleblower hotline and related procedures. Our Code, along with other key governance policies, is published on our website.
 
We conduct training on our Code upon hire, and in regular intervals during the employee’s life cycle with us. The most recent ethics training for all salaried employees was launched in the fourth quarter of 2022. We also conduct anti-trust training annually. The most recent anti-trust training for certain senior management and sales employees was the first quarter of 2023. In addition, we recently conducted our “Respect in the Workplace” training which focused on inclusion, communication, and attentiveness to workplace behaviors and their impact on others.

Cybersecurity
 
Cybersecurity is a top priority, and our program is driven by our commitment to maintaining a strong security architecture, active governance, and robust controls. Our program is led by our Director of Information Technology, who works closely with our senior management team to advance our cybersecurity strategy. The Audit Committee of our Board of Directors receives quarterly updates regarding information about cyber risk mitigation strategies, proposed plans of action to strengthen our architecture against evolving risks, as well as the identification of known cybersecurity breaches, in the event applicable. We do not believe our systems were breached in 2022.
 
We maintain an incident response plan in the event of a cybersecurity incident, for the purpose of contacting authorities and informing key stakeholders. The principles of our program align with the National Institute of Standards and Technology’s five phase Cybersecurity Framework to identify, protect, detect, respond, and recover. Further, we use industry leading security tools, continuously monitor our networking architecture, conduct simulated attacks, and require employee training.
