ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
GENERAL

Bion Environmental Technologies, Inc.'s ("Bion," "Company," "We," "Us," or "Our") patented and proprietary technology provides comprehensive environmental solutions to a significant source of pollution in U.S. agriculture: large-scale livestock production facilities (also known as Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations or CAFOs"). Application of our technology and technology platform can simultaneously remediate environmental problems and improve operational/resource efficiencies by recovering value high-value co-products from the CAFOs waste stream that has traditionally been wasted or underutilized, including renewable energy, nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) and clean water. 

The $200 billion U.S. livestock industry is under intense scrutiny for its environmental and public health impacts at the same time it is struggling with declining revenues and margins. We believe that Bions technology platform, coupled with common-sense policy changes to our clean water strategy that are already underway, provides a pathway to true economic and environmental sustainability with win-win benefits to the industry, the environment, and the consumer. Bions business model can open up the opportunity for joint ventures (in various contractual forms) (JVs) between the Company and large livestock/food/fertilizer industry participants, based upon the cash flow generated by our 3G Tech (defined and discussed below) supporting the costs of technology implementation (including related debt), which will result in long term value including the sustainable consumer branding opportunity created by our technology (discussed below). Long term, Bion anticipates that the branding opportunity may expand to represent the single largest contributor to the economic opportunity provided by Bion.

During July 2018, the Company received a Notice of Allowance for the first patent filed on our third-generation technology (3G Tech) and has continued its work to expand its patent coverage for our 3G Tech since that date. The 3G Tech platform has been designed to maximize the value of coproducts produced during the waste treatment/ recovery processes, including pipeline-quality renewable natural gas and organic commercial fertilizer products. All processes will be verifiable by third-parties (including regulatory authorities, certifying boards and consumers) to comply with environmental regulations and trading programs, as well as meet the requirements for renewable energy credits and the expected organic certification of the fertilizer co-products. Bion anticipates moving forward with the development process of its first commercial installations of its 3G technology during 2019 and 2020 calendar years.

In parallel, Bion has worked (which work continues) to advance public policy initiatives that will create a market in Pennsylvania (and subsequently other states) utilizing taxpayer funding for the purchase of verified pollution reductions from agriculture  credits  by the state (or others) through a competitively-bid procurement program. The credits can then be used as a qualified offset by an individual state to meet its federal clean water mandates at significantly lower cost to the taxpayer. Competitive procurement of verified credits is now supported by US EPA, the Chesapeake Bay Commission, national livestock interests, and other key stakeholders. Legislation in Pennsylvania to establish the first state competitive procurement program passed the Pennsylvania Senate by a bi-partisan majority in June 2019 and we anticipate it will be voted on in the Pennsylvania House in the fall. Bion believes the bill has bi-partisan support and will be passed by the Pennsylvania legislature and signed into law by the Governor in the 2019 fall session.

The livestock industry is under tremendous pressure to adopt sustainable practices - from regulatory agencies, a wide range of advocacy groups, institutional investors and the industrys own consumers. Environmental cleanup is inevitable - policies are already changing. Bions 3G technology was developed for implementation on large scale livestock production facilities, where scale drives lower treatment costs and efficient production of co-products. We believe that scale, coupled with Bions verifiable treatment technology platform, will create a transformational opportunity to integrate clean production practices at (or close to) the point of productionthe source from which most of the industrys environmental impacts are initiated. Bion intends to assist the forward-looking segment of the livestock industry in actually bringing animal protein production in line with twenty-first century consumer sustainability and environmental demands and priorities.

The Problem/Opportunity

In the U.S. (according to the USDAs 2012 agricultural census) there are over 9M dairy cows, 90M beef cattle, 60M swine and 2 billion poultry  an indication of both the scope of the problem addressed by Bion, as well as the size of the opportunity. Environmental impacts from livestock production include surface and groundwater pollution, greenhouse gas emissions and other air pollution, excess water use and pathogens related to foodborne illnesses and antibiotic resistance. The greatest impacts come from the manure waste. Estimates of total annual U.S. livestock manure waste vary widely, but start around a billion tons, between 100 and 130 times greater than human waste. However, where human waste is generally treated, livestock waste  raw manure  is spread on our nations croplands for its fertilizer value. Runoff from livestock waste has been identified as one of the largest sources of excess nutrients in most major watersheds. Excess nutrients fuel algae blooms nationwide that are increasingly toxic; dead zones in the Great Lakes, Chesapeake Bay, and Gulf of Mexico; and nitrate-contaminated drinking water in a growing number of states including Pennsylvania, California, Wisconsin, Washington and other states. US EPA considers excess nutrients one of Americas most widespread, costly and challenging environmental problems. Nutrient runoff is expected to worsen with rising temperatures and increasing rain storm intensity.

More than half of the nitrogen nutrient impacts from livestock come from ammonia emissions from the waste. Nitrogen in the form of ammonia is extremely reactive and mobile. When airborne ammonia/ nitrogen eventually comes back to the ground through atmospheric deposition - it rains everywhere. Much of this nitrogen enters surface and groundwater. In the context of groundwater aquifers, it can contaminate drinking water sources. It is now well-established that most of the voluntary conservation practices (often referred to as BMPs or Best Management Practices) that have traditionally been implemented to attempt to mitigate nutrient runoff are considerably less effective than previously was believed to be the case (especially with regard to addressing mobile ammonia emissions because such BMPs are primarily focused on surface water runoff).

Further, groundwater transports this nitrogen downstream creating an additional problem as most of the conservation practices relied on to reduce agricultural runoff to our lakes and estuaries are bypassed by this flow. Nitrate-contaminated groundwater is of growing concern in agricultural regions nationwide. Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, California and Washington, among other states, all of which states now have areas where groundwater nitrate levels exceed EPA standards for safe drinking water. Additionally, in arid climates, such as California, airborne ammonia emissions from livestock manure contribute to air pollution through PM2.5, small inhalable particulate matter that is a regulated air pollutant with significant public health risks. Whether airborne or dissolved in water, ammonia can only be cost-effectively controlled and treated at the source, before it has a chance to escape and take diluted form. 

Nutrients from livestock waste runoff fuel downstream toxic algae blooms and dead zones in the Chesapeake Bay, Gulf of Mexico and the Great Lakes. Excess nutrient runoff also impacts local water resources, producing algae blooms in lakes and rivers and contaminating underground aquifers that supply drinking water. The impacts of livestock production on public health and the environment are coming under increasing scrutiny from environmental groups and health organizations, regulatory agencies and the courts, the media, consumers and activist institutional investors. 

When implemented in appropriate situations, Bion's technology prevents the uncontrolled release to the environment of most of the nutrients from the CAFO waste stream, while recovering a substantial portion for value-added commercial utilization. Our technology platform largely eliminates ammonia emissions, as well as greenhouse gases, odors and other harmful air emissions. Additionally, the platform destroys virtually all pathogens in the waste stream that have been linked to foodborne illnesses and growing antibiotic resistance. Similar to point-source treatment, such as an industrial or municipal wastewater treatment plant, the performance of Bions technology platform can be precisely measured and quantified (in contrast to the modeled - and so far, disappointing - results from BMPs). Verification of data from our facilities by independent third parties can provide the basis for environmental credits, as well as sustainable branding claims.

Bions proven second generation technology (2G Tech) platform was developed to provide comprehensive onsite livestock waste treatment for wet (beef/dairy/swine) waste streams and has been proven at commercial scale at Kreider Dairy Farm (Kreider 1) in Pennsylvania (PA). In 2012, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PADEP) issued the Kreider 1 system a full water quality management permit and verified the nitrogen and phosphorus reductions achieved by our 2G Tech. These verified nutrient credits can be used as qualified offsets to PAs federally-mandated Chesapeake Bay nutrient reduction requirements. In 2014 the 2G Tech was reviewed and qualified for federal loan guarantees under USDAs Technical Assessment program. The Company anticipates that our 3G Tech will be similarly qualified and will produce results that exceed the results provided by our 2G Tech.

Bion is working with several stakeholders, including national representatives of the livestock industry and members of the PA Legislature, to establish a competitive bidding program in PA that will allow the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania to purchase low-cost nutrient reduction credits from private-sector providers such as Bion. Bion believes that other states which face similar livestock waste-related nutrient pollution issues will adopt a similar strategy in the future. When competitively-bid markets for nutrient reductions become fully-established, Bion anticipates a robust opportunity to use its 3G Tech-based platforms to retrofit both existing CAFOs and equip new large-scale livestock facilities (Projects) to generate revenue from sales of verified nutrient reduction credits. If such nutrient markets are established and Bion is successful in certifying its fertilizer co-products from Projects for Organic use with resulting higher-value markets (Bion intends to file an application with the Organic Materials Research Institute (OMRI) during the next 120 days), we believe that revenue from nutrient reductions and organic co-products, together with renewable energy credit revenues and the potential value of environmental sustainable branding, will combine to create numerous profitable economically and environmentally sustainable opportunities for our Projects and related JVs.

Policy Change is Coming

The current clean water strategy being utilized in the U.S. is clearly failing, because it doesnt adequately address waste from agriculture. About half of U.S. crops are now fertilized with raw, untreated manure and approximately 75% of the nutrients in that manure are not utilized by the plants and escape to contaminate the environment through various pathways. While livestock waste is one of the largest contributors to nutrient problems in our watersheds, livestock waste treatment can also be the source of the low-cost solution for such problems if the waste is treated at (or close to) the source of production. Manure control technologies at large scale facilities, where concentration and scale enable cost-effective cleanup, can potentially offer the lowest cost nutrient solutions available in most watersheds. More than 70 percent of U.S. livestock production takes place on large-scale facilities. There is no longer any real question regarding whether such facilities need to be cleaned up. The actual question for public policy concerns developing sources of new revenues to offset the implementation costs for the cleanup. 

Despite trends toward concentration over the last several decades, the U.S. animal-protein industry remains a fragmented, low-margin commodity business. Cleaning it up will have to be orderly and contain a path to sustainability that does not cause U.S. food costs to spike or bankrupt the industry. Global export is a significant part of the U.S. livestock production industry and an abrupt increase in federal regulation absent offsetting revenues would likely create costs that could not be absorbed by the industry in a manner that would allow it to remain competitive in international markets. Selective state regulation would have a similar chilling effect within the U.S., since regulated producers in one state would be unable to compete with unregulated producers in adjoining states. Subsidies and/or new revenue sources are required.

Bion believes that reallocating some part of the approximately $110 billion in U.S. taxpayer-funded clean water spending to lower-cost alternative solutions in agriculture (including competitively-bid nutrient reduction procurement) is inevitable. It will provide the taxpayer with accelerated and substantially lower-cost verified air and water quality solutions compared to current strategy. In addition, if Bions technology is implemented in appropriate situations, it will provide the livestock industry with the recurring revenues that are needed to offset the costs of technology adoption without major disruption to the industry. To date, a wide range of entrenched interests have opposed and fought policy change that might reallocate spending to more cost-effective alternatives; but this common-sense approach is being accepted by a widening group of stakeholders.

A bipartisan 2013 Pennsylvania legislative study projected that creating a competitive bidding program to procure nitrogen reductions to meet federal Chesapeake Bay mandates, regardless of source, could reduce the states tax- and ratepayer-funded compliance costs by up to 80 percent (approximately $1.5B annually). The legislative study was updated in 2018 to reflect new policies. The updated report projects savings of up to 90 percent. As discussed in the original study, much of the savings were due to low-cost high-impact manure control projects (Bions technology figured prominently in the report). Senate Bill 575, which is supported by legislative leadership, US EPA, national livestock interests and other key stakeholders, will establish a competitive procurement program that will unlock some of these opportunities in PA. In June 2019, the Pennsylvania Senate voted 33 to 17 in favor of Senate Bill 575. The bill is now pending in the House. Bion is optimistic that the bill will be adopted by the House and signed by the Governor in the current session this fall.

In a 2017 Letter of Expectation to PAs Department of Environmental Protection, US EPA demonstrated its support of a procurement strategy to engage the private sector - as long as the credits are verified. It is noteworthy that US EPA and national livestock industry representatives agree on this strategy. Such a procurement strategy is also consistent with USDA and EPA support of Private Partnerships and OMBs guidance that supports acquiring verified results vs. financing projects with uncertain outcomes and taxpayer risks. We believe that strategies being developed in Pennsylvania and the Chesapeake Bay are likely to serve as a model for the 40 other states now seeking solutions to similar water quality problems. Today, most states face a similar issue---unfunded federal clean water mandates. Pennsylvanias proposed competitive bidding program provides an opportunity to significantly reduce the cost to PA (and a model for other states to utilize in the future) in meeting such mandates. 

Technology and Technology Platform
We have invested years of work and substantial capital on the development of our technology and technology platform since 1989.
 
Bions patented second generation technology (2G Tech) was proven at commercial scale and it was reviewed and qualified for federal loan guarantees under USDAs Technical Assessment program. Bions 2G Tech Kreider dairy project (Kreider 1 or KF1) received the first verified /measurable nutrient reduction credits from a non-point source livestock facility in the U.S. and its nutrient reductions were verified by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP). A key attribute of Bions 2G Tech (now supplanted by our 3G Tech) is that nutrient and other pollution reductions can be measured, providing a level of verification on par with a municipal wastewater treatment plant -- which creates the opportunity for their nutrient reductions to be used as qualified offsets to EPA-mandated requirements. While it was an engineering success, Kreider 1 has failed financially to date because the 2G Tech platform was almost wholly dependent for revenue from anticipated demand for credits based on nitrogen reductions (Credits) in Pennsylvanias trading program that failed to materialize. 

The 3G Tech was developed by Bion to avoid the dependence of our 2G Tech systems on the sale of Credits. The 3G Tech platform has been designed to maximize the revenues from the co-products that are produced from very large-scale production facilities while simultaneously remediating the CAFOs waste stream. The first patent on the 3G Tech was filed in September 2015 for an ammonia recovery process that produces ammonium bicarbonate (a commercial fertilizer) without external chemical additives, thereby providing the basis for organic certification. A Notice of Allowance from the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) was received during August 2018 related to this patent application. Since July 2017 Bion has filed for extensions of this patent application to provide broadened protections and to cover improvements to the process developed in the interim. The 3G Tech platform incorporates Bions patented and proprietary technology while utilizing existing commercial evaporation and distillation process equipment (with decades of reliability and service history) that is customized for Bions specific applications.
 
The 3G Tech platform supports a business model with four distinct revenue streams: 1) pipeline quality renewable natural gas and related carbon credits, 2) premium fertilizer products, 3) nutrient credits, and 4) premium pricing from a USDA-certified Environmentally Sustainable branding. Carbon and nutrient credit revenues will be generated by third-party verification of the waste treatment processes that produce renewable energy and fertilizer products - with relatively limited incremental cost to Bion. The same verified data will provide the backbone for the USDA-certified sustainable brand, again with limited incremental cost.

Renewable energy and related carbon credits: 
 Bions 3G Tech platform utilizes customized anaerobic digestion (AD) to recover methane from the waste stream. At sufficient scale, methane produced from AD can be cost-effectively conditioned, compressed and injected into a pipeline. The US Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) program and state programs in California and elsewhere provide ongoing renewable energy credits for the production and use of renewable transportation fuels.
 Fertilizer products: 

The 3G Tech platform will produce multiple fertilizer products: i) concentrated ammonia bicarbonate liquid, ii) ammonium bicarbonate in solid crystal form and iii) a soil amendment product that will contain the remaining nitrogen, phosphorus and other micronutrients captured from the livestock waste stream. Bion believes each product will qualify for organic certification and intends to file initial applications to OMRI within 120 days.

Ammonium bicarbonate manufactured using chemical processes has a long history of use as a fertilizer. Bions ammonium bicarbonate crystal product will contain 12 to 14 percent nitrogen in a crystalline form that will be easily transported, water soluble and provide readily-available nitrogen. It will contain virtually none of the other salt, iron and mineral constituents of the livestock waste stream and will be in an industry-standard form that can be precision-applied to crops using existing equipment. Due to its high concentration of ammonia nitrogen in readily-available and water-soluble form, Bion believes that the product will have broad applications in the production of row crops; horticulture, greenhouse and hydroponic production; and potentially retail lawn and garden products.

Successful organic certification for this product will provide access to substantially higher value markets compared to synthetic nitrogen products. Based on preliminary market surveys to date, we believe that existing competing products in both liquid and granular form are being sold presently at price points significantly greater than Bions projected cost and pricing. 

Nutrient credits:

Bion anticipates that passage of SB575 in Pennsylvania this fall will establish a competitively-bid market for nutrient reduction Credits in Pennsylvania, which will be functioning during 2020 and thereafter Bions Kreider Farms poultry project (Kreider 2) is projected to generate between 1.5-3M lbs of Chesapeake Bay (CB or Bay) verified nitrogen reduction credits (the range depends on the specific calculation methodology agreed to between the EPA and the Pennsylvania DEP). Bion anticipates the market value for these credits will be in the range of $8 to $12 per pound annually. The focus of the latest regulatory watershed improvement plan (WIP) has shifted the reduction mandates to individual counties. Lancaster County, PA is being asked to reduce 21% of the mandate (approximately 11M lbs of nitrogen) to the Bay. As a result, we believe that it is likely that the Kreider 2 project in Lancaster County will expand to include a regional processing opportunity in addition to the Kreider 2 base project. SB 799s initial funding will allow Bion and others to demonstrate the technological effectiveness and cost savings of manure control technologies, which should open the door for increased funding and expanded opportunities in PA and elsewhere.

Sustainable Branding:
 
Consumers have demonstrated a willingness to pay a premium for their safe and sustainable food choices. Bion has received conditional approval from USDA Process Verified Program (PVP) related to its Kreider 1 project (utilizing 2G Tech). It is our intention to amend and resubmit its application for the 3G Tech Platform during the current fiscal year and seek an approval for certification based on third-party-verified reductions in nutrient impacts, greenhouse gases and pathogens in the waste stream based on our 3G Tech. The USDAs PVP is the gold standard of food certifications. PVP certification will back the claims for a meaningful and recognizable sustainable brand that the Company believes will enable Bion customers/joint venturers to command premium pricing for their livestock products.
 
Food safety and sustainability are issues of growing importance in the U.S. and worldwide. Bions branding initiative reflects trends already underway in the livestock industry. Driven by growing consumer demand, large food retailers such as Walmart and Costco, and restaurant chains including Chipotle and McDonalds, are increasingly demanding greater responsibility and improved sustainability in food production practices from their suppliers. The Global Roundtable for Sustainable Beef (Roundtable) was created to advance a sustainable global beef value chain that is environmentally sound, socially responsible and economically viable. The Roundtable represents members from across the supply chain, including U.S., Canadian and Australian cattlemens associations, Cargill, JBS, Elanco, McDonalds and A&W.
 More recently, large institutional investors have begun to pressure the livestock industry. Ceres and several other large activist institutional investors have already expressed concerns about carbon footprint, water quality, antibiotic usage and animal welfare in letters to management of their investment holdings in the food production industry. The Collier Farm Animal Investment Risk & Return (FAIRR) Initiative was recently launched to highlight the environmental, social, and governance (ESG) risks associated with large-scale livestock production.

The food industry cannot successfully address sustainability for meat and dairy products without dealing with the production side of the supply chain, where most of the environmental and public health impacts occur. In addition to mitigating direct environmental impacts, Bions technologies have been developed to allow greater control over inputs, improved traceability and accountability, and the cleanest, most efficient production practices possible. We believe it will be possible to communicate these verified improvements to the consumer at the point-of-sale with a bar-coded brand certified by the USDA PVP. 
 Over the last few years, most large meat and dairy product retailers have announced sustainability initiatives, although the definition of sustainability is unclear. Bion believes that as these initiatives move forward, true sustainability on the production side will look a lot like what Bion can provide today with its 3G Tech. We believe our 3G Tech platform can deliver verifiable metrics that demonstrate meaningful improvements in sustainability for livestock production including: a) reduced carbon and nutrient footprint; b) lower negative impacts to water, soil and air; c) increased pathogen destruction and other environmental and public health impacts that are unmatched in the industry today.

Over the last three years, Bion has worked on development of its third generation technology (3G Tech) which is designed to: a) generate significantly greater value from the nutrients and renewable energy recovered from the waste stream, b) treat dry (poultry) waste streams as well as wet waste streams (dairy/beef cattle/swine), and c) while maintaining or improving environmental performance. The 3G Tech platform will produce a) a stable nitrogen fertilizer product that Bion believes will qualify for certification for use in organic food production, b) a soil amendment product that Bion believes will also qualify for organic production, as well as c) renewable natural gas that can be conditioned to pipeline quality.
 
For the past decade, Bion has been directed toward creating applications of our patented and proprietary waste management technologies and technology platform to pursue JVs in three main business opportunities:
 
1)
 Installation of Bion systems to retrofit and environmentally remediate existing large CAFOs (Retrofits and Retrofit Projects) in selected markets where:
 a) government policy supports such efforts (such as the Chesapeake Bay watershed, Great Lakes Basin states, and/or other states and watersheds facing EPA total maximum daily load (TMDL) issues), and/or 
 b) where CAFOs need our technology to obtain permits to expand or develop without negative environmental consequences.
 2) 
 Development of new state-of-the-art large scale waste treatment facilities (now utilizing our 3G Tech) which may be developed in conjunction with new CAFOs in strategic locations that were previously impracticable due to environmental impacts or to treat the waste streams from one or more existing large livestock facilities (Projects). Some of these Projects may be either a) Integrated Projects as described below, b) central processing facilities which receive the waste from multiple livestock facilities, c) Retrofit Projects or d) hybrids with elements of each of these types. Each version will be able to realize revenue from multiple revenue streams potentially generated by our 3G Tech. 
 3) 
 Licensing and/or joint venturing of Bions technology and applications (primarily) outside North America.
 
In both categories 1) and 2) above, the Company intends to directly participate (whether by joint venture agreement or other contractual arrangements) in the revenues of the Retrofits and Projects. 

The opportunities described at categories 1) and 2) above each require substantial political and regulatory (federal, state and local) efforts on the part of the Company and a substantial part of Bions efforts are focused on such political and regulatory matters. Bion is currently intends to pursue the international opportunities primarily through the use of consultants with existing relationships in target countries.


7


At this time, our primary focus is on categories 1) and 2) above using our 3G Tech to develop new (or expanded) large-scale Projects with strategic partners (including the Kreider 2 Project) on a joint venture (or other participating contractual form) basis. Bions business model opens up the opportunity for JVs in various forms based upon the revenue generated by our 3G Tech platform from nutrient reductions, fertilizer co-products and renewable natural gas (which revenue streams will be secured through long term take-off agreements for each of these co-products) providing initial support for financing of required capital expenditures (whether equity or debt). We anticipate that these revenue streams will be supplemented by revenue realized from long-term premium pricing resulting from the sustainable branding opportunity. We believe that the branding opportunity may provide the single largest contribution to the economic opportunity over time.

Kreider Farms  Initial 3G Tech Project

Bion is completing an envelope of policy change and technology pilots that will allow it to move forward with the first commercial scale 3G Tech project at Kreider Farms. Having recently received a Notice of Allowance of the initial 3G Tech patent, Bion is focused on multiple key tasks (including the following items) during the remainder of 2019 that will complete the envelope and allow Bion to launch active development of the Kreider 2 poultry project in early 2020:

1.
 Support for adoption of PA SB 575: This will create a competitively-bid market for nutrient reductions/Credits that we believe will provide support for project financing for Kreider 2 prior to development of markets for the coproducts from Kreider 2 are established. 
 2.
 Installation of a small-scale 3G Tech ammonia recovery system to produce ammonium bicarbonate to be used for grower trials to develop coproduct markets and for OMRI review.
 3.
 Completion of OMRI filings for all of Bions fertilizer products.
 The 3G Tech Kreider 2 project is planned for two (or more) locations. It is intended to treat the waste from Kreider Farms 1,600 dairy cows and approximately six million egg layer chickens (with capacity for an additional three million layers). The Project will be designed for a capacity of 450 tons per day of waste and will remove nitrogen and phosphorus from the waste stream that will be converted into high-value coproducts instead of polluting local and downstream waters. The Project is planned to be built in three phases and may be expanded to include a central processing facility with modules that will accept transported waste from the region on a fee basis.

Bion has a long-standing relationship with Kreider Farms including a 2016 joint venture agreement related to this facility. Kreider has already made a significant investment in upgrading its poultry facilities to maximize the treatment and recovery efficiencies that can be achieved with Bions technology. We are optimistic that once PA SB575 has been passed, a market will be put in place for long-term commercial sale of the nutrient reduction credits produced at Kreider 2. Once adopted, PA will need to create the rules under which the bidding can be performed prior to any awards If the competitive procurement is implemented, we intend to arrange project financing for the initial portions of the Kreider 2 Project during the first half of 2020.

Integrated Projects: 

We believe that Bions technology also creates the opportunity to enter joint ventures with livestock and other agriculture industry entities (JVs) to develop Integrated Projects that profitably integrate large-scale CAFO's production with their feed producers, downstream food processing facilities, and in certain applications, biofuel/ethanol production. The Bion 3G technology platform will provide treatment of, as well as renewable energy and co-product recovery/production from, both the CAFO and food processing waste streams, on-site utilization of some or all of the renewable energy generated, and potentially, biofuel/ethanol production, in an environmentally and economically sustainable manner that reduces the aggregate capital expense and operating costs for the entire integrated complex while increasing production efficiencies and generating supplemental revenue streams. 


8


In one such application, modeled in the context of our 2G Tech-based Integrated Projects, beef, dairy or swine production can be integrated with food processing and ethanol production, so that overall efficiencies would be increased by onsite use of energy and certain by-products, thereby maximizing their value. In addition to mitigating polluting releases to water and emissions to air, Bions platform will recover cellulosic biomass from portions of the CAFO waste stream from which renewable energy can be produced to be utilized by integrated ethanol plants, CAFO end-product processors (including cheese, ice cream and /or bottling plants in the case of dairy CAFOs and/or slaughter and/or further processing facilities in the context of beef CAFOs) and/or other users as a replacement for fossil fuel energy (and/or sold to unrelated purchasers). Also, an integrated ethanol plant's main by-product, called distillers grain, can be added to the feed of the animals in wet form, thereby potentially lowering the: i) capital expenditures, ii) operating, marketing and shipping costs, and iii) energy/fossil fuel usage of the ethanol production process. Thus, integrated ethanol plants can potentially act as a feed mill for the CAFO, thereby reducing the CAFO's feeding costs and both lowering costs and generating revenue to the ethanol plant(s), and also provide a market for the renewable energy from the cellulosic biomass that Bion's System (defined below) modules produce from the CAFO waste stream. 

Utilization of our 3G Tech will vary the integration process in several ways, including the production and utilization of renewable natural gas and greater recovery of nutrients, with a corresponding increase in value for fertilizer/soil amendment products---which products the Company believes can qualify for organic certification with higher value realization as described above. 

As such, Bion Integrated Projects can be denominated "closed loop". We anticipate that the participants in our Integrated Projects will have substantially lower carbon footprints (per unit of production) compared to non-integrated producers of the same products. We anticipate that different projects will be integrated to different degrees and in different manners. Bion, as developer of, and a participant in, its Integrated Projects, anticipates that it will share in the cost savings and revenue generated from these (and other) benefits of integrated activities, including the potential for premium pricing due to sustainable branding.

We anticipate that most Projects (including Integrated Projects) undertaken by the Company in which we retain ownership interests will be pursued through and owned by single project subsidiaries. Bion PA 1 LLC (PA1), through which the Kreider 1 System was developed at the Kreider dairy, and Bion PA 2 LLC (PA2), through which we are pursuing development of the Kreider JV and the Kreider 2 poultry waste Project, are the first two of what are likely to be many such entities. 

Bions current long-term goal is to enter in to JVs to develop, or have in a development pipeline, 5 to 10 large Projects over the next 24 to 48 months. 
 
Going Concern: 

The Company's consolidated financial statements for the years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 included herein have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company has not recorded significant revenue from operations for either of the years ended June 30, 2019 or June 30, 2018. The Company has incurred net losses of approximately of $2,659,000 and $3,018,000 during the years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The Company had a working capital deficit and stockholders' deficit, respectively, of approximately $10,876,000 and $14,724,000 as of June 30, 2019.The report of the independent registered public accounting firm on the Company's consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended June 30, 2019 and June 30, 2018 includes a "going concern" explanatory paragraph, which means that there are factors that raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.
PRINCIPAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

Bion has invested over $100 million in its business since 1989, much of which has been expended development of its technologies and technology platform, policy change initiatives and other activities. Our 2G Tech (now supplanted by our 3G Tech) has been proven at commercial scale and has been reviewed and qualified for federal loan guarantees under USDAs Technical Assessment program. The 2G Tech platform (as will our 3G Tech going forward) provided verified nutrient credits from wet livestock waste (dairy, beef, and swine) that can be used to offset US EPA-mandated TMDL requirements. The Company intends to implement its first 3G Tech systems during 2020.

Each Bion system (whether prior 2G Tech or current 3G Tech) is comprised of several process units combined in a process train, much like a municipal wastewater treatment plant. The platform utilizes a combination of mechanical, biological, and thermal processes and can be configured in a variety of ways, based on the needs and economics of the location, to provide the level of environmental treatment required, while separating and aggregating the various components of the waste stream for processing and recovery. A key attribute of the Bion platform is that the performance of the systems can be measured, quantified and verified through a proprietary data collection system, providing a level of oversight and verification similar to waste water treatment facilities. In addition to providing third-party verification of reductions for regulatory/credit purposes, the same data can also be used to support the claims of a USDA-certified sustainable branding.

Bions waste treatment solutions are scalable, proven in commercial operations (2G Tech) and the verified results have been accepted by EPA (for use as a qualified offset), USDA and other regulatory agencies. Bions core processes are protected by seven U.S. patents and six international patents, with additional applications pending in the US, EU, New Zealand, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina and Australia. We do not know of any other cost-effective technology that provides Bion systems level of treatment of livestock waste: dairy, beef, poultry and swine. Note that while revenues from Bions 2G platform were 90 percent dependent on developing markets for nutrient reductions, our 3G Tech systems will generate revenues from multiple co-product streams to supplement revenues from nutrient reductions.

Bions 3G Tech platform has been developed over the past four years to maximize co-product recovery values from large scale facilities (or multiple modular facilities) while maintaining/improving the level of environmental remediation produced by our 2G systems. The 3G systems will recover nitrogen from the CAFO waste stream for production of nitrogen-rich fertilizer products that Bion believes will qualify for certification for use in growing organic crops. Further, the 3G Tech platform will recover methane that can be conditioned to pipeline quality and will qualify for various credits and subsidies as clean, renewable natural gas. These two revenue streams will supplement revenues from nutrient reduction credits and USDA-certified (PVP) sustainable branding. 

Building upon our 2G Tech and Bion's over 20 years of experience providing waste treatment services to the livestock industry, commencing with our first generation technology applications, the Company is pursuing the Retrofit opportunity related to environmental remediation of existing CAFOs. Our technology has evolved and been upgraded over the decades to meet changing standards and requirements. Bion's 3G Tech platforms creates potentially profitable business opportunities to provide waste treatment services and systems and/or renewable energy production capability to existing large livestock operations (of which there are many), and potentially to smaller facilities through aggregation of waste streams. Candidates for these solutions include individual CAFO facilities that face impending regulatory action, CAFOs that wish to expand or relocate, and operations located in regions that suffer severe and immediate environmental issues, such as the Chesapeake Bay watershed, Great Lakes region and/or the San Joaquin Valley, where financial incentives (such as nutrient reduction credit trading programs) are (or may become) available that encourage voluntary reductions of nutrient releases and/or atmospheric emissions from agricultural sources. 

The Kreider 1 dairy system in Pennsylvania in the Chesapeake Bay watershed represents the Company's first Retrofit in this market segment. This Retrofit installation was designed and intended primarily to reduce nitrogen and phosphorus releases and ammonia emissions from the dairy waste streams to generate tradable nutrient reduction credits as part of a nutrient credit trading program through the PA Department of Environmental Protection (PADEP). While this project has not been (and most likely will not be) a commercial success on a stand-alone basis (due to PAs failure to implement a viable long-term credit trading market), it has demonstrated that Bions manure treatment technology can generate low-cost verified credits, providing the basis of a 2013 PA Legislative Budget and Finance Committee report (updated in 2018) that supports the use of manure technologies to provide low-cost alternatives to meet Bay mandates.

It is likely that the Kreider 2 poultry waste treatment Project, which is in its early development and pre-permitting phase, will be our first large scale Project. The Kreider 2 Project will utilize our 3G Tech to treat the waste stream from Kreider Farms large poultry operations (possibly together with waste from other nearby poultry operations and/or other waste streams) (and the dairy waste stream previously treated in the Kreider 1 system) to generate renewable energy, marketable nutrient reduction credits and co-products (including nitrogen in organic and/or non-organic forms). It is targeted to treat the waste stream from approximately 9 million birds, in modules, when fully developed. Estimated capital costs (capex) are currently in the $60 million range (with the caveat that no site has yet been chosen, technology development is not complete and the final design work has not yet begun) and has the potential to generate gross revenues of up to $50 million annually from the multiple revenue streams based on current projected yields and prices, none of which are assured. Note that tech and system design work is continuing and the Company anticipates reduce reductions of both capex and operating costs. 


10


To complete and operate these projects, substantial capital (equity and/or debt) has been and will continue to be expended. Additional funds will be needed to be expended for upgrade and continuing maintenance operations of the Kreider 1 system until sufficient revenues can be generated and the Pennvest Loan (see below) situation can be resolved, of which there is no assurance. The Kreider 1 system was developed to earn revenue primarily from the sale of nutrient reduction (and/or other) environmental credits. Upon successful construction and operation, the Company anticipates that the Kreider 2 Project will earn revenue from the sale of nutrient reduction (and/or other) environmental credits generated by its 3G Tech system, and through sales of renewable energy and co-products (fertilizer nutrients and soil amendment products in organic and/or non-organic forms and/or renewable energy and environmental credits) recovered. 

To date the market for long-term nutrient reduction credits in Pennsylvania has been very slow to develop and the Companys activities have been negatively affected by such lack of development. However, Bion is confident that once these markets are established, the credits it produces will be competitive in the credit trading markets, based on its cost to remove nitrogen from the livestock waste stream, compared to the cost to remove nitrogen through various other treatment activities. 

Several independent studies have calculated the average cost to remove nitrogen through various sector practices. Reports prepared for the PA Senate (2008), Chesapeake Bay Commission (2012) and PA legislature (2013; described below), as well as the Maryland Chesapeake Bay Financing Strategy Report (2015), demonstrate that the cost to remove nitrogen (per pound on average) from agriculture is $44 to $54, municipal wastewater: $28 to $43, and storm water: $386 to $633. Pursuant to the PA legislative study, by replacing sector allocation (for all sectors) with competitive bidding, up to 80 percent savings could be achieved in PAs Chesapeake Bay compliance costs ($1.5 billion annually) by 2025. If the legislative study had focused on the cost differentials of competitive bidding compared only with storm water, the relative savings would be substantially greater. 

Since these studies were completed, most of the larger (Tier 1) municipal wastewater treatment plants in PA have been upgraded, at a cost of approximately $2.5 billion (vs initial 2004 PA DEP cost estimates of $376 million). US EPA is now focused on PAs storm water allocation (3.5 million pounds) and has this sector on backstop level actions, the highest level of EPA-oversight and the final step before sanctions. In the same 2004 PA DEP cost estimate that led to the more than a $2 billion underestimate/miscalculation in municipal wastewater plant upgrade costs, the estimate for storm water cost was $5.6 billion. In April 2017, US EPA sent a Letter of Expectation to PA DEP, expressing the agencys support for the use of nutrient credit trading and competitive bidding to engage the private-sector to lower costs. The letter specifically encouraged the use of credit trading to offset the states looming storm water obligations. 

Bion anticipates that it will be able to profitably sell nutrient credits from its Kreider facilities (and subsequent projects) if prices are in the range of $8-$12 (or higher) per lb. of nitrogen reduction under long-term contracts, of which there is no assurance. Bion further believes that with the studies and information now available to other states that are (or will shortly be) facing these same decisions, a cost-benefit analysis will make it clear from the outset that competitive bidding for nutrient reduction credits from alternative approaches can provide dramatically lower-cost solutions than traditional strategies. 

The Company anticipates that the Kreider 2 poultry waste treatment facility in PA will be its initial 3G Tech Project. Bion intends that it will select a site for the Kreider 2 Project and/or its initial Integrated Project (and possibly additional Projects) during the current fiscal year. Bion hopes to commence development of its initial Project by optioning land and beginning the permitting process during calendar year 2020, but delays are possible. It is not possible at this time to firmly predict where the initial Project will be developed or the order in which Projects will be developed. All potential Projects are in very early pre-development stages and may never progress to actual development or may be developed after other Projects not yet under active consideration.

Bion also hopes to be able to move forward on additional Projects through 2020-22 to create a pipeline of Projects. Bions current long-term goal is to acquire or develop, or have in a development pipeline, 5 to 10 large Projects over the next 24 to 48 months. It is possible that one or more Projects will be developed in joint ventures specifically targeted to meet the growing animal protein demand outside of the United States (including without limitation Asia, Europe and/or the Middle East). No Projects (including Integrated Projects) have been developed to date.

 ·
 Regulatory and enforcement policies at the Federal, State and local levels.

CAFO INDUSTRY: PROBLEM AND OPPORTUNITY 

In the U.S., we have over 9 million dairy cows, 90 million beef cattle, 60 million swine and 2 billion poultry (USDA NASS 2012)  an indication of both the scope of the problem addressed by Bion, as well as its opportunity. Estimates of total annual U.S. livestock waste vary widely, but start around a billion tons, between 100 and 130 times greater than human waste. Although the U.S. spends over $110 billion a year to clean up human waste, animal waste is disposed of today largely as it has been for centuries: spread on the ground untreated for its fertilizer value. Today, however, the agronomic balance between livestock production and crop farming has been skewed, leading to runoff of excess nutrients and other pollution that contaminates local and downstream waters.

Over the last several decades the livestock industry specialized, essentially decoupling from crop farming, and began developing increasingly larger facilities, which are often in close proximity, to improve production efficiencies. CAFOs are now responsible for the majority of U.S. animal protein production. The unintended consequence of increased scale, together with concentration in certain geographies, has been to overwhelm natures ability to absorb nutrients and mitigate other impacts from animal waste.

Nutrients from livestock waste enter the environment primarily through direct runoff (after ground application) or atmospheric deposition of nitrogen from ammonia emissions, after which they contaminate groundwater and surface waters. Livestock waste has now been acknowledged as one of the largest sources of excess nutrients that cause toxic algal blooms and dead zones in our waters, in addition to being a large source of greenhouse gases and ammonia, and pathogens that have been linked to food-borne illnesses and antibiotic resistance. A major study, completed in May 2016 by Colorado State University in collaboration with US EPA and the National Park Service, determined that ammonia emissions (from livestock and nitrogen fertilizers) have surpassed NOx emissions (from automobiles and power plants) as the largest source of problem nitrogen cycling from the atmosphere to the biosphere.

The same manure that is degrading our environment also represents lost opportunities for the industry. Spreading manure is a tremendous waste of the energy and most of the valuable nutrients it contains. Only about 25 percent of the highly-reactive and mobile nitrogen in manure is available to crops when applied as fertilizer; the rest is lost to runoff and/or volatilization to the atmosphere as ammonia or other gases. Further, in order to achieve the desired level of nitrogen via manure application, phosphorus must be over-applied, which is both wasteful and harmful to soil health and waters to which it migrates. Bions technology platform provides direct treatment of the waste stream (vs. release to the environment) that separates its various components so that they can then be processed into value-added byproducts, thereby allowing the energy, nitrogen, phosphorus and micronutrients to be utilized independent of each other.

The traditional business model for CAFO's, regardless of livestock type, has relied on a combination of: 1) a passive environmental regulatory regime (including exemptions pursuant to certain statutes), and 2) access to a relatively unlimited supply of cheap land and water to serve as the basis for "environmental" treatment of animal waste. Such land and water resources have now become significantly more expensive and, due to climate/weather variations, less reliable. Further, ongoing consolidation of the CAFO industry has produced substantially increased and more concentrated waste streams. At the same time, regulatory scrutiny of, and public concern about, food safety and the health and environmental impacts from CAFO's has intensified greatly as the occurrence of downstream and local impacts has become more commonplace.


12


The production of animal protein (meat and dairy) in the United States (and elsewhere) now faces substantial constraints due to environmental pollution problems (primarily air and water), public health concerns, resource limitations (land, water and energy), input cost volatility and increases (feed, fuel, etc.), product price volatility and, potentially, weather variability and climate change. Each of these issues negatively affect both the current profit levels and the future activities of the industry as presently structured. Spreading a billion tons of manure annually on fields and crops for fertilizer, is both a tremendous waste of resources and contributes to several widespread and costly environmental and public health impacts. Based on current estimates and practices, the annual environmental remediation costs of the nitrogen impacts from a dairy cow in Lancaster, Pennsylvania to the Chesapeake Bay range from $1,200 to $4,000 (depending on cleanup sector) while generating only $150 to $400 in net income (at current milk prices). Onsite waste treatment such as Bions can reduce that nutrient reduction cost by 60-80% (or more) while generating measurable local environmental benefits whose economic value in many cases will exceed the Bay nutrient reduction costs. Bion believes that its technologies (and its technology platform) can not only remediate/mitigate many of these problems, but can also be a catalyst for the substantial relocation, rationalization and modernization that is currently needed by the livestock industry in the U.S.

Agricultural runoff (including atmospheric deposition of nitrogen from livestock-related ammonia emissions) is the largest water pollution problem in the United States. Agricultural release of nitrogen and phosphorus into rural watersheds negatively impacts water quality and increases remediation costs, not only for local waterways and aquifers, but also for downstream water bodies and urban areas. Over-application of animal waste to cropland has resulted in manure nutrients polluting surface and ground water systems, adversely impacting fresh and salt water quality throughout the country, including the Chesapeake Bay, the Great Lakes and the Gulf of Mexico. 

Clean-up initiatives for the Chesapeake Bay, the Great Lakes and elsewhere are requiring the expenditure of substantial sums of money to reduce excess nutrient pollution and resultant algal blooms. In each such case, agriculture in general--and CAFO's in particular--have been identified among the main contributors of pollution. CAFO's are also recognized as a significant source of harmful air emissions and odors. Dairy CAFO's have been identified as the largest contributor to airborne ammonia and other polluting gases in the San Joaquin Valley in California and elsewhere. They are also among the largest contributors to nutrient pollution of the Chesapeake Bay. 

A substantial volume of the nitrogen released to the atmosphere from CAFOs and their waste streams originates as ammonia and other nitrogen gas emissions, which is subsequently re-deposited to the ground, adding to the nitrogen loading to surface and ground water systems. Ammonia emissions also contribute to the formation of PM2.5, small inhalable particulate matter that is a well-recognized health risk. Further, untreated manure from CAFOs utilized as fertilizer has been linked to pathogens that cause food-borne illnesses, as well as the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, such as MRSA. 

Bion believes that its patented and proven technologies offer the only comprehensive solution to the environmental impacts of these concentrated livestock waste streams. 

We believe Bion's technologies can enable animal protein production to take place in a manner which is both economically and environmentally sustainable, because our technology removes nutrients from the waste streams generated by animal operations at the source while it is still concentrated. The platform thereby dramatically reduces releases to water and gaseous atmospheric emissions in a cost-effective manner. The potential resulting herd concentration increase (due to lower pollution) will reduce marginal costs of production for the CAFOs. Previously unavailable locations close to markets, feed and other needed inputs may become available due to the reduced pollution created by our technology. Also, it results in a core Bion technology platform that can enable substantial integration of environmental treatment, renewable energy and by-product production, and/or animal protein processing operations, and/or biofuel/ethanol production, thereby creating the basis for the Company's Integrated Projects business opportunity.

Bions 3G Tech platform will provide comprehensive onsite waste treatment and substantially greater value co-product recovery capabilities at very large-scale production facilities (Projects). The 3G Tech platform will recover renewable energy and nitrogen (that can be processed into a high-value natural and/or organic nitrogen fertilizer product), while simultaneously offering cost-effective solutions to several pressing environmental and public health issues.


13


Bions 3G Tech Project business model, which is applicable to large scale installations (such as the Kreider poultry operations in PA) or, potentially, central waste processing facilities that serve multiple geographically-close CAFO facilities, is based on revenue from the sale of 1) financial products generated in the course of Bions 3G Tech waste treatment including: a) nutrient reduction credits, b) renewable energy-related credits and c) other environmental credits; 2) co-products, including a) ammonium bicarbonate fertilizer (liquid and solid crystal), b) other fertilizer/soil amendment products, and 3) renewable natural gas (RNG); and 4) revenues from premium pricing due to sustainable branding. Based on pilot study results over the last 24 months related to the 3G Tech platform (and assuming such pilot results are achievable at commercial scale), Bions management currently estimates that in a commercial-scale Bion 3G Tech Project (such as the proposed Kreider 2 poultry waste treatment facilities or a large scale beef project of equivalent size) that there will be three large and roughly equivalent-sized revenue streams (based on currently projected pricing and yields (of products and/or verified credits), which may vary in the future, each category would contribute between 25%-45% of the gross revenues) and a fourth revenue stream thereafter:

1.
 sales of verified nutrient reductions (when competitive bidding markets mature);
 2.
 sales of nutrient/soil amendment co-products (which will require building distribution with industry partners, regulatory certifications (including organic certification), field trials and market acceptance); 
 3.
 sales of RNG (and related credits); and, thereafter, 
 4.
 revenue from licensing sustainable branding based on implementation of Bions technology. 

Assuming that Bion can accomplish the tasks above, we believe that in some fully built-out Projects, any two of the above revenue categories may be sufficient to support debt service and operating costs , based upon current estimated CAPEX and OPEX costs, and achieve profitability when three revenue streams, plus licensing fees from branding, can be realized by a particular Project. Additional revenue streams will potentially be available in Integrated Projects.

There are many risks associated with these projections, but Bions management is cautiously optimistic that the challenges will be met as the initial Projects are developed. 

The Company is involved in ongoing technology development work with regard to:

1)
 Ammonium Nitrogen Recovery (plus residual soil amendment production)
 As part of our 3G Tech work, Bion filed patent applications in September 2015 and July 2017, for our processes that recover a natural nitrogen fertilizer product without the use of chemical additives or processes. A Notice of Allowance from the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) was received during August 2018 related to this patent application. Organic co-products consist of concentrated ammonia liquid, ammonium bicarbonate crystal solids and residual solids from the evaporation/distillation process utilized to process the discharge from a customized front-end anaerobic digester. Bion is preparing a filing with the Organic Materials Review Institute (OMRI) (and potentially other certification bodies) for certification of these coproducts for use in growing of organic food. The solid fertilizer product is intended to contain 12 to 15 percent nitrogen in a solid crystalline form that is water soluble and provides readily-available nitrogen. It will contain none of the phosphorus, salt, iron and other mineral constituents found in many organic fertilizers and also in the livestock waste stream (which may be separately recovered). Instead, the nitrogen recovered from Bions process will be in an industry-standard yet pure form that can be precision-applied to crops using existing practices and is intended to be suited to greenhouse, hydroponic and indoor vertical farming applications. Successful OMRI (and/or other) approval, if achieved, for the products use in organic crop production will provide Bion with access to a higher value market for the product than the synthetic nitrogen markets. The ability to generate concentrated ammonium bicarbonate in large scale and at low cost will potentially open significant opportunities in existing and future unique markets such as corn-fed organic beef, vertical farming and potentially organic cannabis. Both the ammonium bicarbonate and the residual solids will require OMRI (or other institutional) review and approval for their use as certified fertilizer products in organic farming operations. 

2)
 Renewable Energy/Credits 
 Bions 3G Tech platform incorporates anaerobic digestion (AD) (following pre-treatment) to recover methane from the volatile solids in the CAFO waste stream. At sufficient scale, methane can be cost-effectively conditioned and injected into existing pipelines, resulting in a renewable compressed natural gas. Federal programs to support renewable energy production include a 30 percent Biogas Investment Tax Credit (ITC) for qualifying biogas technologies and the Renewable Fuel Standard program that provides ongoing renewable energy credits for the production and use of renewable transportation fuels. Livestock waste is one of the largest contributors of methane and nitrous oxide emissions, two of the most potent greenhouse gases. Under Californias carbon cap-and-trade program, eligible credits are currently being purchased from dairy farms located anywhere in the U.S. that utilize AD. Bion will file an application to include poultry layer manure, such as will be processed at Bions Kreider 2 poultry waste treatment facility, as an eligible feedstock.
 
14


3)
 Sustainable Branding 
 During December 2015, Bion submitted its branding application to the USDA Agricultural Marketing Services Process Verified Program (PVP) to certify a number of verifiable environmental and public health benefits associated with the application of Bions technology to livestock production facilities utilizing our 2G Tech. The initial application included reductions in both nitrogen and carbon footprint, as well as pathogens. Licensing Bions brand, if approval is received, will allow producers that utilize Bions technology to differentiate themselves to consumers who are becoming increasingly more sustainability- and safety-conscious in their food choices. Bions application has received initial stage approvals by USDA, pending site-specific audits. We intend to amend our applications to include the utilization of our 3G Tech.

4)
 Nutrient Reductions 
 Public expenditures on clean water from federal, state and local ratepayers are rising rapidly while overall water quality continues to decline. Harmful algal blooms that block sunlight and lead to dead zones are occur regularly in the Chesapeake Bay, Great Lakes, Gulf of Mexico and many other U.S. waters. Toxic algal blooms, like the 2014 Lake Erie bloom that shut down Toledo, Ohios water supply for several days, occur with increasing frequency. High nitrate levels in water wells located near livestock production are also increasing. Livestock waste has been acknowledged as one of the largest sources of excess nutrients. A task force of EPA and state officials described excess nutrients as having the potential to become one of the costliest, most difficult environmental problems we face in the 21st century. In 2010 US EPA established the Chesapeake Bay regulations that require substantial reductions in nutrients and sediment from the six Bay states and Washington, DC. This is the first watershed-wide, multi-state regulation of U.S. water quality. Compliance cost estimates vary widely, from $30 to $50 billion. Bions technology will capture most of the nutrients from a livestock production facility, providing large-scale nutrient reductions at a fraction of the cost of traditional agricultural or downstream treatment. 

Bions long-term objective is to focus the use of its 3G technology, branding and organic co-product revenues to develop large-scale livestock production Projects that consolidate, either by direct ownership or joint venture, the revenues from livestock production and Bions platform-related revenue sources. Note that appropriate housing for beef cattle (replacing open feedlots) will represent a significant percentage of the cost in the case of Projects involving beef production and will be required to collect the waste in an efficient manner in order to generate renewable energy and nutrient credits. However, the Company believes the such housing will significantly increase livestock production net income (due to efficiencies in rate of weight gain, improved mortality rates and other documented factors) and that premium pricing of even 5-7% at the wholesale level resulting from a USDA-certified environmentally sustainable brand will have a dramatic positive impact on the overall economics of production. Further, we project that the potential revenue streams associated with organic coproducts and sustainable branding will provide key long-term value opportunities that will drive such Projects.
 The current Administrations US EPA and USDA strongly support a market-driven strategy that will engage the private sector to provide innovative solutions to reduce costs. Proposed cuts to federal funding are likely to accelerate movement by the EPA and/or multiple states toward competitive bidding and other lower cost approaches to environmental cleanup. Nutrient reduction credit trading and/or procurement programs are already being evaluated and proposed in many states. They would allow verified reductions from unregulated sources, such as agriculture, to be used to offset federal requirements, in lieu of dramatically higher-cost infrastructure projects, such as municipal wastewater and storm water treatment. Nutrient reductions from Bions manure treatment technologies can be verified and achieved at substantially less cost than traditional infrastructure solutions, as well as todays voluntary agricultural conservation practices. Additionally, treating livestock waste at its source also provides many benefits to the local environment and community that cannot be achieved with downstream treatment.

HISTORY AND DEVELOPMENT OF OUR BUSINESS

Substantially all of our business and operations to date has been conducted through wholly-owned subsidiaries, Bion Technologies, Inc. (a Colorado corporation organized September 20, 1989), Bion Integrated Projects Group, Inc. ("Projects Group") (formerly Bion Dairy Corporation through August 2008 and originally Bion Municipal, Inc., a Colorado corporation organized July 23, 1999) and Bion Services Group, Inc. ("Services Group") (formerly Bion International, Inc., a Colorado corporation organized July 23, 1999) and BionSoil, Inc. (a currently inactive Colorado corporation organized June 3, 1996). Bion is also the parent of Bion PA 1 LLC (a Colorado entity organized August 14, 2008) (PA1) and Bion PA 2 LLC (a Colorado entity organized June 24, 2010) (PA2). In January 2002, Bion entered into a series of transactions whereby the Company became a 57.7% (now 58.9%) owner of Centerpoint Corporation (a Delaware corporation organized August 9, 1995) ("Centerpoint").

Although we have been conducting business since 1989, we determined that we needed to redefine how we could best utilize our technology during 2003. From 2003 through early 2008, we primarily worked on technology improvements and applications and in furtherance of our business model of Integrated Project development. During 2008 we re-commenced pursuing active commercial transactions involving installation of our 2G Tech for CAFO waste treatment and related environmental remediation and initiation of pre-development modeling and pre-development work to prepare for our initial Integrated Projects.

Our original systems were wastewater treatment systems for dairy farms and food processing plants. The basic design was modified in late 1994 to create Nutrient Management Systems ("NMS") that produced organic soil products as a byproduct of remediation of the waste stream when installed on large dairy or swine farms. Through June 30, 2002, we sold and subsequently installed, in the aggregate, approximately 30 of these first iteration of Bions systems in 7 states, of which we believe a few may still in operation in 3 states. We discontinued marketing of our first-generation NMS systems during fiscal year 2002 and turned control and ownership of the first-generation systems over to the farms on which they were installed over the following two years. We were unable to produce a business model based on the first-generation systems that would generate sufficient revenues to create a profitable business. While continuing to market and operate the first-generation systems, during the second half of calendar year 2000, we began to focus our activities on developing the next generation of the Bion technology. We no longer operate or own any of the first-generation NMS systems.

As a result of our research and development efforts, the core of our current technology was re-developed during fiscal years 2001-2004. We designed and tested Systems that used state-of-the-art, computerized, real-time monitoring and system control with the potential to be remotely accessed for both reporting requirements and control functions. These Systems were smaller and faster than our first-generation NMS systems. The initial versions of our second generation of Bion Systems were designed to harvest solids used to produce organic fertilizer and soil amendments or additives (the "BionSoil(R) products") in a few weeks as compared to six to twelve months with our first-generation systems.

During 2003-4 we designed, installed and began testing a commercial scale, second generation Bion System as a temporary modification or retrofit to a waste lagoon on a 1,250-milking cow dairy farm in Texas, known as the DeVries Dairy. In December 2004, Bion published an independently peer-reviewed report, a copy of which may be found on our website, www.biontech.com, with data from the DeVries project demonstrating a reduction in nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) of approximately 75% and air emissions of approximately 95%. More specifically, those published results indicated that the Bion System produced a 74% reduction of nitrogen and a 79% reduction of phosphorus. The air results show that the Bion System limited emissions from the waste stream as follows: (in pounds per 1,400-pound dairy cow per year):

·
 Ammonia 0.20
 ·
 Hydrogen Sulfide 0.56
 ·
 Volatile Organic Compounds 0.08
 ·
 Nitrogen Oxides 0.17

These emissions represented a reduction from published baselines of 95%-99%.

Through 2007 the demonstration project at the DeVries Dairy in Texas also provided Bion with the opportunity to explore mechanisms to best separate the processed manure into streams of coarse and fine solids, with the coarse cellulosic solids/biomass supporting generation of renewable energy and the fine solids potentially becoming the basis of organic fertilizer products and/or a high-protein animal feed ingredients. On-going research was also carried out on various aspects of nutrient releases and atmospheric emissions. 


16


Bion discontinued operation of the DeVries demonstration research system during 2008. 

During the 2005-2008 period, Bion focused on completing development of its 2G Tech platform and business model. As such, we did not pursue near term sales and revenue opportunities, such as retrofitting existing CAFO's with interim versions of our waste management solutions, because such efforts would have diverted scarce management and financial resources and negatively impacted our ability to complete development of an integrated technology platform in support of large-scale sustainable Projects.

From 2009 through the present period, Bion has actively pursued business opportunities in three broad areas 1) Bion systems to retrofit of existing CAFOs (some of which may generate verified nutrient credits and revenues from the production of renewable energy and byproducts) (Retrofits), and 2) development of new state-of-the-art large scale waste treatment facilities, potentially in conjunction with new CAFOs developed in strategic locations that were not previously possible due to environmental constraints in strategic locations (Projects) (some of these may be closed loop Integrated Projects that were not previously possible due to environmental constraints as described below), and 3) licensing and/or joint venturing of Bions technology (primarily) outside North America. Bion is pursuing these opportunities within the United States and internationally. Launch of our 3G Tech (for use in all these areas) is anticipated during 2017/2018. 

We believe significant Retrofit opportunities exist that will enable us to generate future revenue streams from Bion's 2G and 3G Tech. The initial Retrofit opportunities we are pursuing have related to the existing clean-up program for the Chesapeake Bay ('Chesapeake Bay Program' or 'CB Program'). The Company has at times deployed some of its limited resources toward an initiative in the Great Lakes/North Central states that has not yet yielded any contracts. The Company anticipates that further opportunities for our remediation/retrofit business will develop in other areas with CAFOs, including the watersheds of the Great Lakes (from New York to Minnesota), the extended Mississippi River/Gulf of Mexico watershed (including its tributaries from Pennsylvania in the east to Montana/Wyoming/Colorado in the west), and other areas with excess nutrient pollution from agriculture in general and CAFOs in particular.

Over the past 36 months the Company has undertaken research and development efforts to develop the 3G Tech (and related applications) with emphasis on increasing efficiency and increasing recovery of high value by-products (organic and inorganic), which efforts continue during the current fiscal year.

The urgency and priority of the need to clean up nutrient (primarily nitrogen and phosphorus) pollution to the Chesapeake Bay was clearly demonstrated with promulgation of President Obama's 2009 Executive Order concerning clean-up of the Chesapeake Bay and the EPAs publication and issuance during December 2010 of the Chesapeake Bay Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) standard (http://www.epa.gov/reg3wapd/tmdl/ChesapeakeBay/tmdlexec.html) for nutrient pollution in Chesapeake Bay tributaries. In May 2010, the EPA published their overall strategy for remediating the Chesapeake Bay, and they have committed to reducing nitrogen and phosphorus flows to the Bay sufficiently to enable 60% of the Bay watershed segments to meet water quality standards by 2025. At that time, 89 of the 92 Bay and tidal watershed segments were not in compliance with water quality standards (97% were out of compliance). The EPA and associated state agencies also committed to short-term 3-year compliance milestones to enhance accountability and corrective actions, along with a host of definable and measurable goals, enhanced partnerships, and major environmental initiatives. Based on these actions, greater compliance has been required commencing with the 2016 water year. EPA documents defined the overall mission as requiring an approximately 65-million-pound annual reduction from existing nitrogen (N) loading to the Chesapeake Bay by 2025, of which 35 million pounds was allocated to Pennsylvania. Importantly, the 3-year compliance milestones were established as a part of the compliance program to add both short- and long-term accountability to state actions associated with reduced nutrient and sediment flows to the Chesapeake Bay. According to the EPAs Interim Evaluation of Pennsylvanias Milestone Progress published in June 2015, PA was 14.6 million pounds behind its 2014-2015 milestone commitments for nitrogen, a remarkably large deficit given the previously stated 2-million-pound deficit from the 2012-2013 water year. EPA has placed PAs agriculture and urban/suburban sectors under a Backstop Actions Level, the highest level of EPA oversight. EPA has also stated that if load reductions remain off track, EPA may consider seeking additional (and expensive) pollutant reductions from the wastewater sector.

In an effort to get back on track and hold off federal intervention, PA unveiled a purported comprehensive strategy to "reboot" the state's efforts to improve water quality in January 2016. The reboot strategy relied upon a mix of enhanced farm compliance and enforcement activities along with the promotion of additional best management practices (BMP). This proposed strategy has been met with skepticism about its efficacy/practicality and resistance within the agricultural community. While many of these reboot efforts are continuing today, the PADEP Secretary resigned in May 2016 and PA appears to have slowed implementation efforts recently while seeking alternative approaches to reduce PAs nitrogen pollution to the Chesapeake Bay. The budget spending package that was passed by the PA legislature in July 2018 contained no new funding for clean water related to either the Chesapeake Bay compliance mandates or state water quality.

As a result of PAs default of its Bay mandates, and the host of upcoming both short and long-term specific commitments and compliance deadlines, Bion believes that its long-term opportunity related to the Chesapeake Bay clean-up has potentially been significantly expanded and accelerated.

During 2008, Bion executed an agreement to install a Bion System at the Kreider Farms (KF) in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania to reduce nitrogen (including ammonia emissions which are re-deposited as nitrogen from the atmosphere) and phosphorus in the farm's effluent. Bion undertook this project due, in large part, to Pennsylvania's nutrient credit trading program, which was established to provide cost-effective reductions of the excess flow of nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) into the Chesapeake Bay watershed. Bion worked extensively with the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection ('PADEP') over several years to establish nutrient credit calculation/ verification methodologies that were appropriate to Bion's 2G Tech and recognizes its 'multi-media' (both water and atmospheric) approach to nutrient reductions. Pennsylvania's nutrient credit trading program allows for voluntary credit trading between a 'non-point source' (such as a dairy or other agricultural sources) and a 'point source' polluter, such as a municipal waste water treatment plant or a housing development. For example, pursuant to this program, since Bion can reduce the nutrients from an existing dairy much more cost-effectively than a municipal wastewater treatment plant can reduce nutrients to meet its baseline, a municipal facility can purchase nutrient reduction credits (Credits) from Bion to offset its nutrient discharges, rather than spending significantly more money to make (and operate) the plant upgrades necessary to achieve its own reductions. However, the market for long term Credits in PA has failed to develop any significant breadth or depth and no Credits have been sold from the Kreider 1 system.

During May 2008, the PADEP approved Bion's initial protocols to determine how many tradable nutrient (nitrogen and phosphorus) credits Bion would receive for nutrient reductions achieved through installation of its comprehensive dairy waste management 2G Tech Kreider 1 project pursuant to PA's efforts under the Chesapeake Bay Program mandates. During April 2010, the PADEP issued an amended certification. The PADEP's approval includes the certification of credits, both for ammonia air emission reductions, and for significantly reducing the leaching and runoff potential of land-applied nutrients. The PADEP has certified the Kreider 1 dairy system for 107 nitrogen and 13 phosphorus credits (each credit represents an annual pound of reduction) for each of the 1,200 dairy cows (subject to testing and verification based on operational data). Bion's agreements with Kreider Farms provide for the Kreider 1 System to expand through-put to treat the waste from the Kreider dairy support herd after the PADEP has verified the operating results. It is anticipated that this expansion will take place and lead to a proportionate increase in credits generated for sale, only if a more robust market for long term nutrient reductions develops.

The economics (potential revenues, profitability and continued operation) of the Kreider 1 System are based almost entirely on the long-term sale of nutrient (nitrogen and/or phosphorus) reduction credits to meet the requirements of the Chesapeake Bay environmental clean-up. See below for further discussion.

Pursuant to the KF agreements, Kreider 1 system to treat KF's dairy waste streams to reduce nutrient releases to the environment, while generating marketable nutrient credits and renewable energy, was designed, constructed and entered full-scale operation during 2011. On January 26, 2009, the Board of the Pennsylvania Infrastructure Investment Authority (Pennvest) approved a $7.75 million loan to Bion PA 1, LLC (PA1), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, for the initial Kreider Farms project (Kreider 1). After substantial unanticipated delays, on August 12, 2010, PA1 received a permit for construction of the Kreider 1 system. Construction activities commenced during November 2010. The closing/settlement of the Pennvest Loan took place on November 3, 2010. PA1 finished the construction of the Kreider 1 System and entered a period of system operational shakedown during May 2011. The Kreider 1 System reached full, stabilized operation by the end of the 2012 fiscal year. During 2011, the PADEP re-certified the nutrient credits for this project. The PADEP issued final permits for the Kreider 1 System (including the credit verification plan) on August 1, 2012, on which date the Company deemed that the Kreider System was placed in service. As a result, PA1 commenced generating nutrient reduction credits for potential sale, while continuing to utilize the Kreider 1 system to test technology improvements and add-ons. However, to date, liquidity in the Pennsylvania nutrient credit market has been slow to develop significant breadth and depth, which limited liquidity/depth has negatively impacted Bions business plans and has resulted in challenges to monetizing the nutrient reductions created by PA1s existing Kreider 1 project and Bions other proposed projects. These difficulties have prevented PA1 from generating any material revenues from the Kreider 1 project to date and raise significant questions as to when, if ever, PA1 will be able to generate such revenues from the Kreider 1 system. PA1 has had sporadic discussions/negotiations with Pennvest related to forbearance and/or re-structuring its obligations pursuant to the Pennvest Loan for more than five years. In the context of such discussions/negotiations, PA1 elected not to make interest payments to Pennvest on the Pennvest Loan since January 2013. Additionally, PA1 has not made any principal payments, which were to begin in fiscal 2013, and, therefore, the Company has classified the Pennvest Loan as a current liability as of June 30, 2019. Due to the failure of the PA nutrient reduction credit market to develop, the Company determined that the carrying amount of the property and equipment related to the Kreider 1 project exceeded its estimated future undiscounted cash flows based on certain assumptions regarding timing, level and probability of revenues from sales of nutrient reduction credits and, therefore, PA1 and the Company recorded impairments related to the value of the Kreider 1 assets of $1,750,000 and $2,000,000 at June 30, 2015 and June 30, 2014, respectively. During the 2016 fiscal year, effective June 30, 2016, PA1 and the Company recorded an impairment of $1,684,562 to the value of the Kreider 1 assets which reduced the value on the Companys books to zero. This impairment reflects managements judgment that the salvage value of the Kreider 1 assets roughly equaled PA1s contractual obligations related to the Kreider 1 system, including expenses related to decommissioning of the Kreider 1 system, costs associated with needed capital upgrade expenses, and re-certification/ permitting amendments.

On September 25, 2014, Pennvest exercised its right to declare the Pennvest Loan in default and accelerated the Pennvest Loan and demanded that PA1 pay $8,137,117 (principal, interest plus late charges) on or before October 24, 2014. PA1 did not make the payment and does not have the resources to make the payments demanded by Pennvest. PA1 has commenced discussions and negotiations with Pennvest concerning this matter but Pennvest has rejected PA1s proposal made during the fall of 2014. No formal proposals are presently under consideration and only sporadic communication has taken place regarding the matters involved over the last 5 years. It is not possible at this date to predict the outcome of such this matter, but the Company believes that a loan modification agreement (coupled with an agreement regarding an update and re-start of full operations of the Kreider 1 System) may be reached in the future if/when a more robust market for nutrient reductions develops in Pennsylvania, of which there is no assurance. PA1 and Bion will continue to evaluate various options with regard to Kreider 1 over the next 180 days.

During August 2012, the Company provided Pennvest (and the PADEP) with data demonstrating that the Kreider 1 system met the technology guaranty standards which were incorporated in the Pennvest financing documents and, as a result, the Pennvest Loan is now solely an obligation of PA1. 

As a result of the extended period of Kreider 1 full-scale, commercial operations, Bion is confident that future Bion 2G Tech systems can be constructed with even higher operational efficiencies at lower capital expense and with lower operational costs. Operating results of the Kreider 1 system have documented the efficacy of Bions nutrient reduction technology and vetted potential add-ons for future installations.

Additionally, the Kreider agreements provide for Bion to develop a waste treatment/renewable energy production facility to treat the waste from Kreider's approximately 6+ million chickens (planned to expand to approximately 9 million)(and potentially other poultry operations and/or other waste streams)('Kreider Renewable Energy Facility' or  Kreider 2 Project). On May 5, 2016, the Company executed a stand-alone joint venture agreement with Kreider Farms covering all matters related to development and operation of the Kreider 2 system to treat the waste streams from Kreiders poultry facilities in Bion PA2 LLC (PA2). The Company continues its development work related to the details of the Kreider 2 Project. During May 2011 the PADEP certified Kreider 2 Project for 559,457 nutrient credits under the old EPAs Chesapeake Bay model. The Company anticipates that the Kreider 2 Project will be re-certified for between 1.5-2 million nutrient reduction credits (for treatment of the waste stream from Kreiders poultry) pursuant to the Companys pending reapplication (or subsequent amended application) during 2017 pursuant to the amended EPA Chesapeake Bay model and agreements between the EPA and PA. Note that this Project may be expanded in the future to treat wastes from other local and regional CAFOs (poultry and/or dairy) and/or Kreider poultry expansion (some of which may not qualify for nutrient reduction credits). The review process to clarify certain issues related to credit calculation and verification commenced during 2014 but has been largely placed on hold while certain matters are resolved between the EPA and PA and pending development of a robust market for nutrient reductions in PA. The Company anticipates it will submit an amended application once these matters are clear. Design and engineering work for this facility, which will probably be the first to utilize Bions 3G Tech, have not commenced, and the Company does not yet have financing in place for the Kreider 2 Project. This opportunity is being pursued through PA2. If there are positive developments related to the market for nutrient reductions in PA, of which there is no assurance, the Company intends to pursue development, design and construction of the Kreider 2 Project with a goal of achieving operational status during the 2020 calendar year, and hopes to enter into agreements related to sales of the nutrient reduction credits for future delivery (under long term contracts) during 2018 subject to verification by the PADEP based on operating data from the Kreider 2 Project. The economics (potential revenues and profitability) of the Kreider 2 Project, despite its use of Bions 3G Tech for increased recovery of marketable by-products, are based in material part on the long term sale of nutrient (nitrogen and/or phosphorus) reduction credits to meet the requirements of the Chesapeake Bay environmental clean-up. However, liquidity in the PA nutrient credit market has been slow to develop significant breadth and depth, which lack of liquidity has negatively impacted Bions business plans and has resulted in challenges to monetizing the nutrient reduction credits generated by PA1s existing Kreider 1 project and will most likely delay PA2s Kreider 2 Project and other proposed projects in PA. 

Note that Bion believes that the Kreider 1 System, the Kreider 2 Project and/or subsequent Bion Projects will eventually generate revenue from: a) sales of nutrient reductions (credits or in other form), b) renewable energy (and related credits), c) sales of fertilizer products, d) sustainable branding and/or e) potentially, in time, credits for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. We believe that while the potential market is very large, it is not possible to predict the exact timing and/or magnitude of these potential markets at this time.

Several independent studies have calculated the average cost to remove nitrogen through various sector practices. Reports prepared for the PA Senate (2008), Chesapeake Bay Commission (2012) and PA legislature (2013; described below and updated during 2018), as well as the Maryland Chesapeake Bay Financing Strategy Report (2015), demonstrate that the cost to remove nitrogen (per pound on average) from agriculture is $44 to $54, municipal wastewater: $28 to $43, and storm water: $386 to $633. Pursuant to the PA legislative study, by replacing sector allocation (for all sectors) with competitive bidding, up to 80 percent savings could be achieved in PAs Chesapeake Bay compliance costs ($1.5 billion annually) by 2025. If the legislative study had focused on the cost differentials of competitive bidding compared only with storm water, the savings would be substantially greater. 

Since these studies were completed, most of the larger (Tier 1) municipal wastewater treatment plants in PA have been upgraded, at a cost of approximately $2.5 billion (vs initial 2004 PA DEP cost estimates of $376 million). US EPA is now focused on PAs storm water allocation (3.5 million pounds) and has this sector on backstop level actions, the highest level of EPA-oversight and the final step before sanctions. In the same 2004 PA DEP cost estimate that led to the more than a $2 billion underestimate/miscalculation in municipal wastewater plant upgrade costs, the estimate for storm water cost was $5.6 billion. In April 2017, US EPA sent a Letter of Expectation to PA DEP, expressing the agencys support for the use of nutrient credit trading and competitive bidding to engage the private-sector to lower costs. The letter specifically encouraged the use of credit trading to offset the states looming storm water obligations. 

Bion anticipates that it will be able to profitably sell nutrient credits from its Kreider facilities (and subsequent projects) if prices are in the range of $10-$12 (or higher) per lb. of nitrogen reduction, of which there is no assurance. Bion further believes that with the studies and information now available to other states that are (or will shortly be) facing these same decisions, a cost-benefit analysis will make it clear from the outset that credits from alternatives can provide dramatically lower-cost solutions than traditional strategies.

On January 22, 2013, the Pennsylvania Legislative Budget and Finance Committee (LBFC) published a study (Report) detailing the economic and environmental benefits that would result from the implementation of a competitively bid, request for proposal (RFP) program for nitrogen reductions to fulfill Pennsylvanias obligations under the US EPA-mandated Chesapeake Bay Total Maximum Daily Load (CB TMDL). We agree with and support the basic conclusions and recommendations of the Report. Links to both the full Report and a summary are available on the policy page of Bions website at www.biontech.com/policy. The Report demonstrates that implementation of such a RFP program would result in dramatically lower cost compliance with Pennsylvanias requirements under the CB TMDL and would also provide a host of additional environmental and economic benefits to Pennsylvanias interior freshwater resources and communities. 

The Report (which references Bion in numerous places) concluded that: 

(1) 
 Adoption of the competitively-bid RFP program would reduce Pennsylvanias Chesapeake Bay nutrient reduction compliance costs by up to 80% through the purchase of verified nitrogen reductions from all public and private sector sources, including technology providers such as Bion. The Report estimates that adoption of a competitive RFP program for nitrogen reductions would result in reducing Pennsylvanias compliance expenditures from a projected cost of $628M to $110M in 2015 and from $1.7B to $250M in 2025. The Report further concludes that absent the implementation of cost-cutting measures, Pennsylvanias compliance with the storm water and agricultural reduction mandates in the CB TMDL standard is at risk of default as there is insufficient funding available to comply under todays existing cost structure. The CB TMDL was established by the US EPA to protect and restore the Bay after decades of decline in water quality and aquatic life due to excess nitrogen from the surrounding watershed. 

(2) 
 The use of verified nitrogen reductions from agricultural (and primarily livestock) sources to achieve CB TMDL compliance will generate substantial economic and environmental benefits, well beyond the cost savings of the CB TMDL compliance itself. These ancillary benefits are in the form of increased agricultural investments and significant improvements to the States local fresh water resources. 

(3) 
 Adoption would significantly reduce nitrogen and phosphorous impacts to local freshwater resources such as streams, lakes and groundwater, thereby reducing long term freshwater quality compliance costs. These local reductions would be a by-product of achieving Chesapeake Bay reductions since it requires (on average) the upstream reduction of two to five pounds of nitrogen and as much as twenty pounds of phosphorous to achieve a one pound reduction of these nutrients to the Chesapeake Bay. The long term economic value and environmental benefits to interior freshwater sources could well be greater than the downstream estuary cost savings and benefits. 

The Report was updated in 2018 to reflect new policies. It now projects savings of up to 95 percent  $340 million in costs versus $6.5 billion. As discussed in the original study, much of the savings were due to low-cost high-impact manure control projects.

The Reports conclusions support adoption of a competitive bidding platform for nitrogen reductions as a cost-effective solution to the high costs facing state and local tax and rate payers. The Report also demonstrates that this strategy would provide tangible environmental, economic, quality of life and health benefits to those upstream rural communities which have shouldered much of the economic cost of downstream nutrient reductions, with little or no benefit to their local communities.

In 2013, a report was issued by PennState University (https://www.usda.gov/oce/environmental_markets/files/EconomicTradingCBay.pdf) which the PADEP Secretary in 2016 described as the most reliable estimate of the amount of financial resources required to fully implement non-point source best management practices (BMPs) called for in Pennsylvanias Watershed Implementation Plan (WIP). This report provided two estimates. The first estimate showed a need for $3.6 billion in capital costs to fully implement all non-point source BMPs in the WIP, in incremental levels between 2011 and 2025. The second estimate annualized costs through 2025 and included operation and maintenance (O&M) costs, resulting in a figure of $378.3 million per year. Overall, this 2013 PSU study projected the state would need $378 million per year for 15 years, including O&M totaling $5.6 billion to place in service a sufficient number of designated BMPs to achieve reductions of 24 million pounds of nitrogen annually. The 2013 PSU study was completed prior to guidance issued by US EPA Region 3 in 2014 which was adopted by the PADEP as a requirement for a one-for-three uncertainty factor be applied to BMPs in PA, since their actual performance is now known to be substantially less than previously modelled. Accounting for the uncertainty factor, PAs BMP cost estimate per the PSU study would need to be increased to $16.8 billion (three times the $5.6 billion conclusion of the PSU study).

A significant portion of Bions current activities concern efforts with private and public stakeholders (at local and state level) in PA, (and other Chesapeake Bay, Midwest and Great Lakes states) and at the federal level (EPA and other executive departments and Congress) to establish appropriate public policies which will create regulations and funding mechanisms that foster installation of the low cost, technology-based environmental solutions that Bion (and others) can provide through clean-up of agricultural waste streams. The Coalition for an Affordable Bay Solution (Coalition) was formed to support the creation of a competitively-bid nitrogen trading program in Pennsylvania that will enable Pennsylvania to capture the economic benefits outlined in the Report. The Coalition supports legislation to establish a competitively-bid RFP program for nitrogen reductions, where bids will also be scored to reflect the value of the benefits to PAs interior waterways and communities. Founding members of the Coalition represent both Chesapeake Bay and national industry participants, and include Bion, JBS, SA, Kreider Farms, and Fair Oaks Farms. The Company believes that: i) the April 2015 release of a report from the Pennsylvania Auditor General titled Special Report on the Importance of Meeting Pennsylvanias Chesapeake Bay Nutrient Reduction Targets which highlighted the economic consequences of EPA-imposed sanctions if the state fails to meet the 2017 TMDL targets, as well as the need to support using low-cost solutions and technologies as alternatives to higher-cost public infrastructure projects, where possible, and ii) Senate Bill 799 (successor to prior SB 924 and SB 724) which, if adopted, will establish a program that will allow the Pennsylvanias tax- and rate-payers to meet their EPA-mandated Chesapeake Bay pollution reductions at significantly lower cost by purchasing verified reductions (by competitive bidding) from all sources, including those that Bion can produce through livestock waste treatment, represent visible evidence of progress being made on these matters in Pennsylvania. Such legislation, if passed and signed into law, will potentially enable Bion (and others) to compete for public funding on an equal basis with subsidized agricultural best management practices and public works and storm water authorities. Note, however, that there has been vocal opposition to SB 799 (and its predecessors) from threatened stakeholders committed to the existing status quo approaches--- a significant portion of which was focused on attacking (in often inaccurate and/or vilifying ways) Bion in/through social media and internet articles, blogs, press releases, twitter posts and re-tweets, rather than engaging the substantive issues. If legislation similar to SB 799 is passed and implemented (in something close to its current form), Bion expects that the policies and strategies being developed in PA will not only benefit the Companys existing and proposed PA projects, but will also subsequently provide the basis for a larger Chesapeake Bay watershed strategy and, thereafter, a national clean water strategy. 

The Company believes that Pennsylvania is ground zero in the long-standing clean water battle between agriculture and the further regulation of agriculture relative to nutrient impacts. The ability of Bion and other technology providers to achieve verified reductions from agricultural non-point sources can resolve the current stalemate and enable implementation of constructive solutions that benefit all stakeholders, providing a mechanism that ensures that taxpayer funds will be used to achieve the most beneficial result at the lowest cost, regardless of source. All sources, point and non-point, rural and urban, will be able to compete for tax payer-funded nitrogen reductions in a fair and transparent process; and since payment from the tax and rate payers would now be performance-based, these providers will be held financially accountable. 

We believe that the overwhelming environmental, economic, quality of life and public health benefits to all stakeholders in the watershed, both within and outside of Pennsylvania, make the case for adoption of the strategies outlined in the Report less an issue of if, but of when and how. The adoption of a competitive procurement program will have significant positive impact on technology providers that can deliver verified nitrogen reductions such as Bion, by allocating existing tax- and rate-payer clean water funding to low cost solutions based upon a voluntary and transparent procurement process. The Company believes that implementation of a competitively-bid nutrient reduction program to achieve the goals for the Chesapeake Bay watershed can also provide a working policy model and platform for other states to adopt that will enhance their efforts to comply with both current and future requirements for local and federal estuarine watersheds, including the Mississippi River/Gulf of Mexico, the Great Lakes Basin and other nutrient-impaired watersheds.

Bion estimates that the overall market opportunity for Bion in the Chesapeake Bay watershed is large and of long duration. Most (if not all) of the publicly proposed new (or upgraded) municipal waste water and storm water treatment facilities in the Chesapeake Bay watershed in PA, Maryland, Virginia and Washington, DC have projected costs (capital and operating) far in excess of the costs involved in reducing nutrients using Bions technology to treat CAFO wastes at the source. While regulatory and enforcement policy is still evolving and, therefore, the impact of those future policies upon Bion's operations cannot be precisely predicted and/or fully quantified, Bion believes that the tremendous difference between its cost to remove nutrients from a concentrated livestock manure waste stream and the cost required for reduction of nutrients from diluted conventional waste water and storm water treatment technologies, makes it reasonable to believe that Bion's potential profitability from projects in the Chesapeake Bay watershed should be significant. Based on the aggregate size of livestock operations in the Chesapeake Bay watershed, Bion believes that the potential market for reductions in nitrogen loadings to the Chesapeake Bay watershed from livestock can be reasonably anticipated to increase tenfold (or more) to total in excess of 65 million (or more) pounds annually (including airborne ammonia) over the next decade, with verified nutrient reductions potentially generated equaling 50% to 60% of that aggregate required nitrogen reduction. Bion hopes that some significant portion of the nutrient reductions related to this clean-up mandate will be made by Bion Systems (which portion cannot be reasonably estimated at this time).

We believe that the credits from the Kreider 1 dairy project (verified by the PADEP) represent the first nutrient credits from multi-media (air and water) reductions from an unregulated, non-point source (livestock) technology-based project to be verified (including ammonia reductions). These credits will be equivalent to municipal wastewater treatment plant reductions, once regulatory issues are resolved. Further, we believe this will provide, over time, a basis for credit trading basin-wide throughout the Chesapeake Bay watershed (beyond just Pennsylvania where the credits are being generated to the other states and Washington, DC). An established basin-wide trading program will potentially broaden the market for credits from smaller local watersheds to the entire Chesapeake Bay Watershed. Both USEPA and Maryland DNR have expressed support for basin-wide trading for the Bay.

Bion has undertaken, and will continue to pursue, work to establish appropriate public policies to facilitate environmental clean-up of CAFOs in the Chesapeake Bay states and at the federal level and in other locales. 

Bion also believes that it is reasonable to assume that a version of the Chesapeake Bay Program strategies developed by the US EPA and various state regulatory agencies to address the issue of excess nitrogen loadings to the Chesapeake Bay watershed clean-up, will be subsequently applied to deal with the much larger nutrient pollution problems of the Mississippi River Basin that are a primary cause of the 'Dead Zone' in the Gulf of Mexico and similar problems in the Great Lakes and elsewhere. The US EPA has stated the intention that the strategies being developed for the Chesapeake Bay will be utilized in the Mississippi River Basin and other watersheds in the U.S. Note, however, that such an EPA initiative is certain to generate significant political opposition. The Mississippi River Basin alone has been estimated to require more than 1 billion pounds of annual nitrogen reduction to remediate the dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico. Applying the same metrics as above (Bions ability to profitably provide nitrogen reductions at a cost of $8-12 per pound per year compared to municipal wastewater and storm water removal costs of $35 or higher per pound per year), using Bion-type solutions would represent a potential benefit in excess of $25 billion annually to tax- and rate-payers of the 31 Mississippi River Basin states and the federal government. We believe that Bion will potentially have large business opportunities for utilization of its technology as efforts to clean up such polluted areas develop, but at present such opportunities are not quantifiable nor can a definitive timeline be predicted.

COMPETITION

There are a significant number of competitors in the waste treatment industry who are working on animal related pollution issues. Probably the most efficient way to assess competition in this industry is to review the Newtrient Technology Catalog, a service provided by Newtrient which is an organization created by the dairy industry to help farmers, technology providers, manure-based product developers and other stakeholders assess manure related challenges and opportunities. Many of the technologies reviewed by and organized by Newtrient in their catalog, such as Bion, address manure streams in addition to dairy. The potential competition has increased with the growing governmental and public concern focused on pollution due to CAFO wastes. Waste treatment lagoons which depend on anaerobic microorganisms ("anaerobic lagoons") are the most common traditional treatment process for animal waste on large farms within the swine and dairy industries. Additionally, many beef feedlots, poultry facilities and dairy farms simply scrape and accumulate manure for later field application. Both lagoon and scrape/pile manure storage approaches are coming under increasing regulatory pressure due to associated odor, nutrient management and water quality issues and are facing possible phase-out in some states. Although we believe that Bions comprehensive solution is the most economically and technologically viable solution for the current problems, other alternative (though partial) solutions do exist, including, for example, synthetic lagoon covers (which are placed on the top of the water in the lagoon to trap the gases), methane digesters (a tank which uses anaerobic microorganisms to break down the waste to produce methane), multistage anaerobic lagoons and solids separators (processes which separate large solids from fine solids), as well as various thermal waste-to-energy technologies. Additionally, many efforts are underway to develop and test new technologies.

Our ability to compete is dependent upon favorable regulatory conditions, our ability to obtain required approvals and permits from regulatory and other authorities and upon our ability to introduce and market our Systems in the appropriate industry and geographic segments.

There is also extensive competition in the organic soil amendment/fertilizer and feed ingredient markets. There are many companies that are already selling products to satisfy demand in the sectors of these markets we are trying to enter. Many of these companies have established marketing and sales organizations and customer commitments, are supporting their products with advertising, sometimes on a national basis, and have developed brand name recognition and customer loyalty in many cases. Because Bion systems offer a comprehensive solution that is designed to produce up to four separate and distinct revenue streams, the Company believes that it has the ability to be more competitive in any one of the sectors from which it derives revenue.

DEPENDENCE ON ONE OR A FEW MAJOR CUSTOMERS

In our Projects (including Integrated Projects) business segment, we will most likely be dependent upon one or a few major customers/partners/joint venturers since a relatively limited number of Projects (including Integrated Projects) will be developed by the Company. We anticipate initially developing, owning interests in, and operating only one or a few Projects commencing during 2018-19, and, thereafter, developing a limited number of Projects at a time. Thus, at least for the near future, our revenues will be dependent on a relatively small number of major Projects, participants and/or customers.

In our CAFO Retrofit/remediation business segment, we currently have only one operating System and contracts with only a single party. However, there are thousands of CAFOs in the United States and we anticipate that in the future we will have agreements with many CAFO customers.

In addition to such factors as innovation, technological expertise and experienced personnel, we believe that a strong patent position is increasingly important to compete effectively in the businesses on which we are focused. It is likely that we will file applications for additional patents in the future. There is, however, no assurance that any such patents will be granted.

Because the direct costs of the patent filings has historically been and continues to constitute a small portion of the Companys total expenses, we have elected to expense such costs rather than capitalize and record the cost of patent filings as an asset. 

It may become necessary or desirable in the future for us to obtain patent and technology licenses from other companies relating to technologies that may be employed in future products or processes. To date, we have not received notices of claimed infringement of patents based on our existing processes or products, but due to the nature of the industry, we may receive such claims in the future.

We generally require all of our employees and consultants, including our management, to sign a non-disclosure and invention assignment agreements upon employment with us.
 
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

Current research and development work is focused toward completion of the development and ongoing improvement of our 3G Tech (the initial version of which is ready for implementation in an appropriate Project) with emphasis on increased recovery of valuable by-products (including nutrients in organic and/or non-organic forms, production of renewable energy from by-products together with related renewable energy and/or environmental credits). Bion believes its 3G Tech will produce significantly greater value from the CAFO waste stream through the recovery of a concentrated natural nitrogen fertilizer and pipeline-quality natural gas. 

During the years ended June 30, 2019 and June 30, 2018, respectively, we expended approximately $435,000 and $344,000 (excluding non-cash stock-based compensation) on research and development activities related to our technology platform applications in support of large-scale, economically and environmentally sustainable Projects and Retrofits. During the 2018 fiscal year, Bions research and development has been primarily focused on development work to complete and further refine development of our 3G Tech which will have the capacity to process dry, poultry CAFO waste streams (in addition to wet dairy/beef/swine CAFO waste streams) and increase our ability to recover marketable by-products from the waste stream remediation including renewable natural gas and nitrogen products (organic and non-organic). Some work has also involved modifying and adding unit processes to our 2G Tech platform with the objective of reducing capital costs and operating costs, while generating commercial equivalent by-products (and therefore, potential revenue streams) and significantly increasing environmental efficiency. As a result of these efforts (including their continuation during the current period), Bion made new patent filing(s) during the 2019 and 2018 fiscal years. The Company anticipates completion of its pilot system and pre-commercial testing for its 3G Tech by end of the current fiscal year. Our technology focus is to separate and aggregate the various assets in the waste stream and then to re-assemble them to maximize their economic value and our current research and development efforts have been focused on developments that will enhance potential sales revenues from renewable energy (both from solids combustion and methane generation thru the use of anaerobic/microaerobic digestion modules), fertilizer and soil amendment products (organic and inorganic), water reuse, environmental and reduction credits (including but not limited to nutrient, carbon, sediment, water and pathogen reduction) while reducing capital costs and operating costs. Bion continues to focus on normalizing its technology platform for use on multiple species. This effort has required significant work and resource allocation on research regarding balancing the activities of each unit process so that its output enables the subsequent unit processes to maximize efficiency and discharge to the subsequent unit in order to process a feedstock cost effectively. The by-products of this series of unit processes (which include certain Bion proprietary elements) are then reassembled into products to maximize their economic value. To date, research and development results have supported our objectives. In prior periods, Bion's main efforts were directed at further refinement of our 2G Tech and its applications. In addition, substantial research and development activity was focused on design and refinement of all aspects of the technology and integration engineering related to the energy balances, renewable energy production and on-site utilization, related to Integrated Project issues and our business model. Research activities were also focused on factors related to renewable energy production from CAFO waste including coarse solid recovery, drying and use for renewable energy production, as well as fine solids recovery, drying and utilization as fertilizer and/or animal feed, water re-use and other matters.

Environmental Protection/Regulation and Public Policy

In regards to Retrofits and development of Projects, we will be subject to extensive environmental (and other) regulations related to CAFO's, biofuel production and end product (e.g fertilizer) producers. To the extent that we are a provider of systems and services to others that result in the reduction of pollution, we are not under direct enforcement or regulatory pressure. However, we are involved in the business of CAFO waste treatment and are impacted by environmental regulations in at least five different ways:

·
 Our marketing and sales success depends, to a substantial degree, on the pollution clean-up requirements of various governmental agencies, from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) at the federal level to state and local agencies;
 ·
 Our System design and performance criteria must be responsive to the changes in federal, state and local environmental agencies' effluent and emission standards and other requirements;
 ·
 Our System installations and operations require governmental permits and/or other approvals in many jurisdictions; 
 ·
 To the extent we own or operate Projects (including Integrated Projects with CAFO facilities and ethanol plants), those facilities will be subject to environmental regulations; and
 ·
 Appropriate public policies need to be developed and implemented to facilitate environmental clean-up at CAFOs and the sale of nutrient reductions from such activities in order for the Company to monetize the nutrient reductions generated by its facilities.

Additionally, our activities are affected by many public policies and regulations (federal, state and local) related to other industries such as municipal waste and storm water treatment, watershed-wide mandates, and others. For example, the existing differences in the regulatory requirements for agriculture versus municipal wastewater clean-up currently in place have negatively impaired the development of viable markets for nutrient reduction credits. 

EMPLOYEES

As of September 1, 2019, we had 6 employees and primary consultants, all of whom are performing services for the Company on a full-time basis. The Company utilizes other consultants and professionals on an as needed basis. Our future success depends in significant part on the continued service of our key personnel and the ability to hire additional qualified personnel. The competition for highly qualified personnel is intense, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain our key managerial and technical employees or that we will be able to attract and retain additional highly qualified technical and managerial personnel in the future. None of our employees is represented by a labor union, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good. None of our employees is covered by "key person" life insurance.
