Overview
 We have created a comprehensive cloud-based software platform designed to transform and modernize accounting and finance operations for organizations of all types and sizes.  Our secure, scalable platform supports critical accounting processes such as the financial close, account reconciliations, intercompany accounting, and controls assurance.  By introducing software to automate these processes and to enable them to function continuously, we empower our customers to improve the integrity of their financial reporting, increase efficiency in their accounting and finance processes and enhance real-time visibility into their results and operations.
 Critical accounting and finance processes underlie the integrity of an organization’s financial reports.  The lack of effective accounting and finance tools can result in inefficient and cumbersome processes and, in some cases, accounting errors, restatements and write-offs, as well as material weaknesses and significant deficiencies.  Traditional enterprise resource planning, or ERP, systems do not generally provide effective solutions for processes handled outside of an organization’s general ledger, such as balance sheet account reconciliation, intercompany transaction accounting and the broader financial close process.  Many organizations also use multiple ERPs and other financial systems without a platform to efficiently integrate them.  As a result, to manage these tasks, organizations rely on spreadsheets and other error-prone and labor-intensive processes that are unsuited for the increasing regulatory complexity and transaction volumes encountered by many modern businesses.  We believe that we are creating a new category of powerful cloud-based software that is capable of automating and streamlining accounting and finance operations, in a manner that complements and supports traditional ERP systems.  We believe our customers benefit from cost savings through improvements in process management and staff productivity, in addition to managing a faster financial close.

Our mission is to transform how accounting and finance departments operate.  Our approach modernizes what historically has been done through batch processing and manual controls typically applied only during the month, quarter or year-end financial close, and delivers dynamic workflows embedded within a real-time, highly automated framework, a process we refer to as “continuous accounting.”  It also enables up-to-date analytics, provides industry-benchmarked metrics and is designed to help customers run more efficiently while achieving greater accuracy, control and transparency.  We believe the need for our software has been driven by growing business and information technology complexities, transaction volumes and expanding regulatory requirements.  Our software integrates with, and obtains data from, more than 30 different ERP systems, including NetSuite, Oracle, SAP, and Workday, as well as many other financial systems and applications such as bank accounts, sub-ledgers and in-house databases.
 We are a holding company and conduct our operations through our wholly-owned subsidiary, BlackLine Systems, Inc. (“BlackLine Systems”). BlackLine Systems funded its business with investments from our founder and cash flows from operations until September 3, 2013.  On September 3, 2013, we acquired BlackLine Systems, and Silver Lake Sumeru and Iconiq acquired a controlling interest in us, which we refer to as the “2013 Acquisition.” The 2013 Acquisition was accounted for as a business combination under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) and resulted in a change in accounting basis as of the date of the 2013 Acquisition.
 Our platform consists of nine core cloud-based products, including Transaction Matching, Account Reconciliations, Consolidation Integrity Manager, Daily Reconciliations, Journal Entry, Variance Analysis, Task Management, Compliance, and Insights. Customers typically purchase these products in packages that we refer to as solutions, but they have the option to purchase these products individually. Current solutions include Balance Sheet Integrity, Close Process Management, Accounting Process Automation, Finance Transformation, Intercompany Hub and Smart Close.
 The BlackLine Solution
 We provide a powerful cloud-based software platform designed to automate and streamline accounting and finance operations. The key elements of our solutions include:
 Comprehensive Platform
 We offer an integrated suite of applications that delivers a broad range of capabilities that would otherwise require the purchase and use of multiple products to support critical accounting processes such as the financial close, account reconciliations, intercompany accounting, and controls assurance.
 The technology underpinning our platform includes a comprehensive base of accounting-specific business logic and rules engines, which enable our customers to implement continuous accounting.
 Enterprise Integration
 Our platform provides simple, secure and automated tools and integrations to transfer data to and from a range of enterprise-wide processes and systems, including ERPs, financial systems and in-house databases, and other custom applications and data. Our platform integrates with over 30 ERP systems, including NetSuite, Oracle, SAP, and Workday. In addition, for companies with multiple systems and complex needs, we can connect with any number of general ledger systems simultaneously, resolving many of the issues associated with consolidating data across systems.
Independence
 Our platform is not dependent on any single operating system and works with most major ERP systems our customers may use. Our cross-system functionality allows us to reach a broader group of customers. We are also able to focus on and innovate for the needs of our customers irrespective of updates or changes in their existing systems. We believe this independence provides us with a competitive advantage in the industry over traditional methods.
Ease of Use
 Our platform is designed by accountants, for accountants, to be intuitive and easy to use. We strive to enable any user to rapidly implement our platform to manage their accounting and finance activities, from the simplest to the most sophisticated tasks. Our user-friendly interface provides clear visualization of accounting and finance data, enables user collaboration and streamlines business processes.

Innovation
 Our ability to develop innovative products has been a key driver of our success and organic growth. Through a history and culture of thought leadership, we have created a new category of powerful software that automates and streamlines antiquated, manual accounting processes to better meet our clients’ diverse and rapidly changing needs, and we continue to focus on providing advanced solutions to time and labor intensive accounting practices. Examples of recent innovations include the launches of our Intercompany Hub solution, which is designed to manage all intercompany transactions through one centralized, cloud-based system, and the launch of our Insights solution, which provides real-time performance measures and a benchmarking dashboard.
Security
 Our platform and services incorporate industry best practices and meet internationally recognized standards with respect to information security management. We have implemented and maintain our certified Information Security Management System in accordance with the ISO/IEC 27001 standard requirements. We meet a breadth of requirements for our security control environment, including information security policies, organization of information security, human resource security, access control, cryptography, physical and environmental security, operations security, communications security, information security incident management, and information security aspects of business continuity management. In our continued commitment to customer trust, transparency, and security in service, we provide customers independently validated testing and evaluation of our control environment through issued reports and certifications.
Key Benefits
 Our platform is designed to provide the following benefits to our customers:
 Flexibility and scalability
 Our unified cloud platform is designed for modern business environments and has broad applicability across large and small organizations in almost any industry. The platform supports complex corporate structures, provides integration across all core financial systems, manages multiple currencies and languages, and scales to support high transaction volumes.
 Embedded controls and workflow
 Our platform was designed for the complex global regulatory environment. Our platform embeds key controls within standardized, repeatable and well-documented workflows, which are designed to result in substantially reduced risk of non-compliance or negative audit findings, greater tolerance for regulatory complexity and increased confidence in financial reports.
 Real-time visibility
 We provide users with real-time visibility into the status, progress and quality of their accounting processes. With configurable dashboards, user-defined reporting and the ability to drill down to individual reconciliations, journals and tasks, users can track open items, identify bottlenecks within a process or intervene to prevent mistakes.
 Automation and efficiency
 Our platform can ingest data from a variety of sources, including ERP systems and other data repositories, and apply powerful, rules-driven automation to reconciliations, journals and transactions. This streamlines accounting processes, minimizes manual data entry and improves individual productivity to help ensure that accounting processes are completed on time. As a result, this automation allows users to focus on value-added activities instead of process management.
 Continuous processing
 Our platform helps organizations embed quality control, compliance and financial integrity into their day-to-day processes rather than rely on the traditional process of validating financial information at the end of each period. Activities such as account reconciliation and variance analysis can be performed in real-time, thus reducing the risk of errors and creating a more agile accounting environment.

Customers
 Our customers include multinational corporations, large domestic enterprises and mid-market companies across a broad array of industries. These businesses include publicly-listed entities and privately-owned enterprises, as well as non-profit entities. At December 31, 2018, we had over 222,600 individual users across more than 2,600 customers exclusive of on-premise software. We define a customer as an entity with an active subscription agreement as of the measurement date. In situations where an organization has multiple subsidiaries or divisions, each entity that is invoiced as a separate entity is treated as a separate customer. However, where an existing customer requests its invoice be divided for the sole purpose of restructuring its internal billing arrangement without any incremental increase in revenue, such customer continues to be treated as a single customer.
Products and Services
 Our platform consists of nine core cloud-based products, including Transaction Matching, Account Reconciliations, Consolidation Integrity Manager, Daily Reconciliations, Journal Entry, Variance Analysis, Task Management, Compliance, and Insights. Customers typically purchase these products in packages that we refer to as solutions, but they have the option to purchase these products individually. Current solutions include Balance Sheet Integrity, Close Process Management, Accounting Process Automation, Finance Transformation, Intercompany Hub, and Smart Close.
Reconciliation Management
 The process of verifying and validating transactions, balances and consolidated financial results is referred to as account reconciliation. Our Reconciliation Management solution provides a framework for the reconciliation process, allowing users to build integrity checks and automation into the entire end-to-end work flow. The solution includes:

• | Account Reconciliations provides a centralized workspace from which users can collaborate to complete account reconciliations. Features include standardized templates, workflows for review and approval, linkage to policies and procedures, and integrated storage of supporting documentation. The product automates otherwise manual activities in the reconciliation process, significantly reducing time and effort and increasing productivity. It also enhances internal controls by facilitating the appropriate segregation of duties, simplifying reconciliation audits and adding transparency and visibility to the reconciliation process.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Transaction Matching analyzes and reconciles high volumes of individual transactions from different sources of data based upon user-configured logic. Our rules engine automatically identifies exceptions, errors, missing data, and variances within massive data sets. The matching engine processes millions of records per minute, can be used with any type of data and allows customers to reconcile transactions in real-time.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Consolidation Integrity Manager manages the automated system-to-system tie-out process that occurs during the consolidation phase of the financial close. Companies with multiple ERPs utilize a consolidation system to produce their consolidated financial results. Because these systems contain and produce information that changes continually and requires constant adjustments, a final tie-out that is typically handled manually in a spreadsheet is necessary prior to publishing results. This product automates the tie-out process, aggregating balances from dozens or hundreds of different systems and allowing users to identify exceptions and create adjustments quickly.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Daily Reconciliations narrows the scope of a reconciliation to a single day’s transactions or balance detail. Users can then perform their analysis in minutes per day, rather than attempting to review an entire month’s worth of activity in a limited time during the period-end close. Some industries, such as banking, require that organizations track the creation and certification of daily reconciliations. Daily reconciliations are a prime example of continuous accounting in action.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Financial Close Management
 The collection of processes by which organizations reconcile, consolidate and report on their financial information at the end of each period is referred to as the financial close. Our Financial Close Management solution allows customers to manage the key steps within the close, applying automation where possible, and ensure that tasks are properly completed and reviewed. This solution includes the components of the Reconciliation Management solution, as well as the following products:

• | Task Management enables users to create and manage processes and task lists. The product provides automatic and recurring task scheduling, includes configurable workflow and provides a management console for accounting and finance projects. Though most commonly used with the financial close, users can create task lists and projects for hundreds of different use cases ranging from external audits to environmental impact surveys.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Journal Entry allows users to manually or automatically generate, review and post manual journal entries. Journals can be automatically allocated across multiple business units and calculated based on complex, client-defined logic. More importantly, the addition of validation and approval checkpoints helps ensure the integrity of information passed to other financial applications. Customers can use the Journal Entry product to pass information to hundreds of different ERPs and subsystems in a configurable, easily consumable format.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Variance Analysis provides “always-on” monitoring and automatically identifies anomalous fluctuations in balance sheet and income statement account balances. Once an account in flux is identified, users are automatically alerted so they can research and determine the source of the fluctuation.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Intercompany Hub
 Intercompany transactions occur when entities within a corporate parent organization transact with each other. These transactions are some of the most complex and frequent sources of uncertainty for the accounting function. Our Intercompany Hub solution manages the entire intercompany transaction lifecycle within our platform and we believe it is the only widely available end-to-end intercompany solution. This solution includes the following features:
• | Intercompany Workflow replaces informal, ad-hoc intercompany requests and approvals with a simple, structured workflow approval process. The application stores permissions by entity and transaction type, ensuring that both the initiator and the approver of the intercompany transaction are authorized to conduct business.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Intercompany Processing records an organization’s intercompany transactions once they reach an appropriate completion level and posts them to the appropriate systems from a single source. The product automatically incorporates local taxes, exchange rates, invoicing requirements, and customer-specific transfer pricing so that the resulting journal entries will net, which reduces the possibility of intercompany differences and eliminates the need to perform a manual reconciliation.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Netting and Settlement automatically generate a real-time, aggregated settlement matrix, which shows the balance of transactions across an entire organization. Users can filter the information by transaction type, currency or business relationship, easing the process of netting transactions and helping them make informed, strategic decisions.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Compliance
  
• | Compliance is an integrated solution that facilitates compliance-related initiatives, consolidates project management, and provides visibility over control self-assessments and testing.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Insights
 Our platform provides us with detailed information about the accounting and finance function for most of our cloud-based customers. Insights, which was made generally available in November 2015, aggregates and analyzes that information and can help clients assess productivity, risk and timeliness. We also provide a series of key performance indicators and allow clients to compare metrics across their own operating entities, set goals and gauge their performance over time. Insights provides benchmarking, scores for a variety of industries, company sizes, and geographies. These benchmarks are drawn from actual client usage of the application, rather than survey data, which provides valuable context for users.
Services
 Customer service is essential to our success. We offer the following services for our customers:
  
• | Implementation. With a focus on configuration over customization, our implementation approach favors rapid and efficient deployments led by accounting experts, rather than technical resources. A typical project will focus on mapping our application to a customer’s current or ideal process, coaching them on best practices, and helping organizations become self-sufficient, instead of dependent on additional professional services. For clients that elect to work with a business process outsourcer or other company for implementation services, our implementation team provides ongoing support in order to ensure that the implementation or finance transformation projects are completed successfully. We generally provide this service for a fixed fee.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Support. We provide live customer support 24/7/365 from our offices in Los Angeles, Sydney and London. All customers have access to support resources by phone, email or through our portal, free of charge.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Customer Success. Our customer success managers, many of whom are former users, provide customers with best practices and help create a roadmap for expanded usage of our platform. We believe that this service, which is made available to all customers, is central to our retention and upsell efforts.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Training. We offer a variety of live and web-based training options, but most customers elect to consume their training through our e-learning environment, BlackLine U. Courses cover platform functionality, as well as the underlying concepts that make reconciliation, the financial close and other accounting and finance activities necessary.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sales and Marketing
 We sell our solutions through our direct sales force. Our direct sales force leverages our relationships with technology vendors such as SAP and NetSuite, professional services firms such as Deloitte, Ernst & Young, and KPMG and business process outsourcers such as Cognizant, Genpact and IBM, to influence and drive customer growth. In particular, we offer our customers an integrated SAP-endorsed business solution in connection with our relationship with SAP. We also utilize a reseller channel that includes software vendors throughout the world and offer training in our solutions so that our reach is further extended.
 Our marketing efforts are focused on creating sales leads, establishing and extending our brand proposition, generating product awareness, and cultivating our community of users. We generate sales leads primarily through word-of-mouth, search engine marketing, outbound lead generation, and our network of business process outsourcers, business services organizations and resellers. We leverage online and offline marketing channels on a global basis and organize customer roundtables and user conferences and release white papers, case studies, blogs, and digital programs and seminars. We have further extended our brand awareness through sponsorships with leading industry organizations such as the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, or AICPA, the Institute of Management Accountants, or IMA, the Financial Executives International, or FEI, the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, or ICAEW, and the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants, or ACCA.
 Competition
 The market for accounting and financial software and services is competitive, rapidly evolving and requires deep understanding of the industry standards, accounting rules and global financial regulations.
 We compete with vendors of financial automation software such as Trintech, and we also compete with components of Oracle’s Hyperion software.
 We believe the principal competitive factors in our market include the following:
  
• | level of customer satisfaction;
--+--------------------------------


• | ease of deployment and use of applications;
--+--------------------------------------------


• | ability to integrate with multiple legacy enterprise infrastructures and third-party applications;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | domain expertise on accounting best practices;
--+-----------------------------------------------


• | ability to innovate and respond to customer needs rapidly;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


• | capability for configurability, integration and scalability of applications;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | cloud-based delivery model;
--+----------------------------


• | advanced security and reliability features;
--+--------------------------------------------


• | brand recognition and historical operating performance; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------


• | price and total cost of ownership.
--+-----------------------------------

 We believe we are positioned favorably against our competitors based on these factors. However, certain of our competitors may have greater name recognition, longer operating histories, more established customer and marketing relationships, larger marketing budgets, and significantly greater resources.
 Intellectual Property and Proprietary Rights
 Our intellectual property and proprietary rights are important to our business. We currently have one pending patent application. We primarily rely on copyright, trade secret and trademark laws, trade secret protection, and confidentiality or 
 8


license agreements with our employees, customers, partners, and others to protect our intellectual property rights. Though we rely in part upon these legal and contractual protections, we believe that factors such as the skills and ingenuity of our employees and the functionality and frequent enhancements to our solutions are larger contributors to our success in the marketplace.
 Despite our efforts to preserve and protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights, unauthorized third parties may attempt to copy, reverse engineer or otherwise obtain portions of our software. Competitors may attempt to develop similar products that could compete in the same market as our products. Unauthorized disclosure of our confidential information by our employees or third parties could occur. Laws of other jurisdictions may not protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights from unauthorized use or disclosure in the same manner as the United States. The risk of unauthorized use of our proprietary and intellectual property rights may increase as our company continues to expand outside of the United States.
 Third-party infringement claims are also possible in our industry, especially as software functionality and features expand, evolve and overlap with other industry segments.
 Employees and Culture
 We believe our employees and culture are fundamental to our success. Therese Tucker, our founder and Chief Executive Officer, has led our company since its inception in 2001 and has built and maintained a culture committed to empowering our employees and communities around us. Our motto “Think. Create. Serve.” expresses our core values as a company dedicated to innovation and creativity, collaboration and action, and service to each other and our customers.
 At December 31, 2018, we employed 850 people globally. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.
