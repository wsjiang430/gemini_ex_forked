ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Overview

374Water offers a technology that transforms wet wastes such as sewage sludge, biosolids, food waste, hazardous and non-hazardous waste, and forever chemicals (e.g., PFAS) into recoverable resources by focusing on waste as a valuable resource for water, energy, and minerals. We consider ourselves pioneers in a new era of waste management that supports a circular economy and enables organizations to achieve their environment, social, and governance (ESG) goals. Our vision is a world without waste and our mission is to help create and preserve a clean and healthy environment that sustains life.
Our Technology

We have developed AirSCWO™, a proprietary treatment system based on “supercritical water oxidation.” AirSCWO™ leverages the unique properties of water in its supercritical phase (above 374oC and above a barometric pressure of 221 atm). The supercritical phase produces unique properties of water which combine with air convert organic matter to energy and minerals that are safe byproducts that can be recovered and put to economically productive use. We call our systems AirSCWO™, as it utilizes a combination of ambient air and the supercritical water oxidation process. Because our AirSCWO™ convert any organic material, we believe the AirSCWO™ systems are essentially waste stream agnostic with the capability of treating a variety of complex, hazardous and non-hazardous wet waste streams, thus creating opportunities for multiple applications in diverse market verticals on an international scale. The technology is addressing environmental challenges that the Company believes, until now, have been considered insurmountable due to science/engineering and/or cost barriers. For example, we can treat PFAS (“per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances”).

Products and Services

We believe AirSCWO™ systems have the ability to address environmental issues across multiple market verticals. Our revenue model includes both capital equipment sales and long- term service agreements. Our sales and market strategy is a combination of direct customer and channel partner sales routes, depending on the specific market and territory. Additionally, the AirSCWO™ systems may be sold directly to other solution providers who may integrate our equipment with other equipment as part of an integrated system and solution.

We sell AirSCWO™ as a modular and containerized system. The units are compact and prefabricated so that they may be cost effectively shipped, installed, and operated within the footprint of an existing plant. We are currently offering a six (6) wet tonne per day throughput capacity system and anticipate commercializing a thirty (30) wet tonne per day throughput capacity system in 2024. A two hundred (200) wet tonne per day throughput capacity system is to be designed in 2025.

We also intend to sell, as part of a broader solution package, ancillary equipment that is required to pre-treat the inlet waste stream and post-treat a product stream, depending on the application. In some cases, to meet the AirSCWO™ inlet requirements (e.g., water percentage, total dissolved solids), a pre-treatment is added to our system to ensure our system performance or a post-treatment packaged system to enhance the system outputs value (e.g., carbon dioxide utilization or sequestration, minerals recovery and upgrade, and water purification). Such solutions may be developed by the Company or by its strategic partners to provide a complete solution and integrated treatment train. In addition, the Company intends to offer sales agreements for supply of parts, maintenance and repairs, as well as long term SAs.

Human Capital and Culture

We currently employ twenty-three full-time employees and seven consultants on a full or part-time basis. Our current projections are to increase the workforce to forty full-time employees in 2023 and fifty full-time employees in 2024. 

We recognize and value our people as our most important asset in achieving our strategic goals and growing a great company. We are working towards a human resources strategy that will help drive the right culture, leadership, talent management, performance, reward and recognition, personal development, and ways of working vital to ensure the Company achieves its strategic goals whilst our people benefit from an exceptional experience.

Our focus areas in creating a working environment that draws out the best in our employees and allows them to fulfill their potential and support the Company to attain its goals are as follows:


1) | Attract, identify, develop and retain high-performing talent across all areas. 
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2) | Develop and support the growth of leadership. 
3) | Enable the development of a high-performance culture in which staff performance can be supported, rewarded, enhanced and managed effectively. 
4) | Foster a values-based culture focused on diversity, inclusivity, well-being and positive staff engagement. 
5) | Develop a total reward approach which is valued by staff and facilitates organizational objectives. 
6) | Provide excellent core HR, professional development and health and safety services across all business areas to enable the effective operation of the organization.


Our recruitment strategy is based on identifying top talent, predominantly via existing networks and referrals, and offering competitive remuneration packages that combine salary, benefits and equity. As we move forward our recruitment strategy will expand to wider platforms allowing outreach to a wider audience. In the immediate future, we will use an outsourced human resources firm, and as we grow, within 2023, embed a human resources function into the Company. We intend to apply a wide range of retention initiatives that include rewarding high-performance and opening opportunities for progression and career development. Identification of high-performing talent will be linked to succession planning and development of the future-workforce will be embedded in employee professional development schemes.

We are setting clear standards with respect to generating an open and transparent working environment in which everyone has a voice. This will invoke effective personal development discussions and provide the opportunity to conduct performance reviews supported by transparent data and open conversation.

We are dedicated to embedding Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DE&I) as an important part of developing our culture through delivery of innovative initiatives and internal workshops, ensuring that DE&I policies touch on all aspects of the Company from recruitment practices to company behavior/operating frameworks. These policies will also be reviewed periodically as required and updated accordingly. 

Moving forward we intend to deliver a total reward strategy which appropriately supports achievement of organizational aims and priorities, and will help position us as an employer of choice which employees value and understand. This will undergo periodical review to ensure we are able to attract and retain top talent in a financially sustainable way.

All of our human resource initiatives will be supported by key performance indicators to monitor their effectiveness and gain insight into gaps that can be addressed quickly and ensure our overall human resource strategy is adapted as required and maintained to a high degree.

Markets and Industries

We’re seeking to create a more robust and sustainable approach to waste stream management for our customers. The drivers that are facilitating adoption of our technology include but are not limited to: population growth and urbanization, increasing quantity/complexity of waste streams, climate change, carbon economics, resource scarcity, corporate sustainability targets, commodity prices, energy security and tightening regulations. The AirSCWO™ technology is designed to address those key market drivers and provides a complete, compact, energy efficient, and decentralized solution able to treat a broad range of waste.

The AirSCWO™ technology can treat diverse waste streams across different industries and market segments. We believe our technology provides a unique value proposition that will support its adoption across various markets, including, but not limited to:


· | Generating value from waste by recovering clean energy in the form of heat, water, and minerals; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Providing a highly energy efficient, compact and sustainable waste treatment option that we believe can deliver unprecedented elimination of many environmentally persistent pollutants, e.g., PFAS, 1,4 Dioxane, microplastics, pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), and other contaminants of emerging concern (CECs);
· | Treating waste at the source thereby eliminating haulage and transportation needs and reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions; and 
· | Offsetting methane emissions by offering a solution to waste that does not form methane as a byproduct. 


One of our key markets is sludge treatment, which includes both municipal and industrial wastes. Sludge is the semi-solid by-product obtained from the treatment of residential and commercial (i.e., municipal) or industrial wastewater. Municipal sludge is typically treated in large biological treatment processes that allow for the wastewater to reside for extended periods in an air or oxygen rich environment (aerobic digestion or anaerobic digestion) that promotes biological breakdown of organic solids. This process generates a final residue known as biosolids, as it mainly consists of biological bacteria. Sludge and biosolids management are a key part of any wastewater treatment process. Those high strength streams are prime for the AirSCWO™ technology since they contain significant calorific content that can be treated effectively and self-propel the oxidation process.

The global demand for municipal and industrial sludge treatment is expected to generate revenue of above $9.0 billion by the end of 2026, growing at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of around 5.7% between 2020 and 2026 (Research and Markets Report, August 2020). Growing populations and economic advancement have resulted in increased volumes of sludge, which drives the market for municipal and industrial sludge treatment.

The municipal sludge market is expected to drive the near-term growth of the Company’s revenue because of increasing disposal costs, and future regulation on organic CECs (e.g PFAS, Microplastics, Pharmaceuticals). We are also targeting additional high value markets that we expect will contribute to the Company’s revenue and thereby help fuel our growth plans. Table 1 below shows near-term target markets, their subsegments, and the relevant applications associated with those markets.

Strategy

The execution of our growth strategy includes a blend of opportunities:

Growth Initiatives

We have sold our first commercial unit to a public agency responsible for 2.6 million people in Southern California. The AirSCWO 6 system, expected to be installed in the 2nd quarter of 2023, is capable of processing six (6) wet tonne per day (WMT/d) of wastewater in a 40-foot standard shipping container. We expect to receive several additional purchase orders for our systems. Additionally, we are finalizing the design of larger capacity systems to process thirty (30) WMT/d (AirSCWO 30) and later on two hundred (200) WMT/d (AirSCWO 200), respectively. We anticipate initial sales of our thirty (30) tonne system within the next twelve months.

We intend for the Company’s growth over the next two years to be predominantly driven by sales of AirSCWO™ systems in the identified key markets, which we hope will lead to customer base expansion, and ultimately, with the municipal market expected to generate a significant portion of the Company’s revenue. Our initial geographical focus will be North America and EMEA (to include Europe, the Middle East and Africa). Our business model includes direct sales to end-users and indirect sales via channel partners. In some markets, we believe revenue will be generated from a mix of capital equipment sales and a Service Agreement (SA), which is a paid service for waste treatment pursuant to long-term contracts. The latter will be offered through a separate financing division that we are targeting to establish in 2023 and will initially be deployed via direct end-user engagement. The financing systems to be sold via SAs will lower barriers to entry in our key markets and facilitate more rapid expansion of our client base. Examples of models to be used can include, but are not limited to: Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) and Build-Own-Operate-Transfer (BOOT), depending on clients’ preferences and limitations. We envisage that in some cases, public private partnerships (PPPs) will be established, particularly when selling to public utilities and addressing projects in developing geographies.

In addition, during the next two to three years, we are planning to conduct further product development and expand our product portfolio, which we believe will facilitate entry into new market subsegments where particularly complex waste streams require treatment. This is most relevant to some industrial manufacturing, defense, and waste management applications. Our intention is to maintain a research and development budget sufficient to attain this goal.

Third Party Growth Initiatives

As an early-stage growth company with what we believe to be a highly differentiated technology platform, we expect to leverage strategic partnerships with larger companies that offer environmental services or execute on targeting various end markets. We are currently engaging with potential strategic partners in a variety of markets.
Intellectual Property

We have designed an intellectual property strategy to ensure we maintain a competitive edge. As of December 31, 2022, we have three pending U.S. non-provisional applications and three pending Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) applications that cover crucial process operational aspects and improvements in system efficiencies and performance, including a next generation AirSCWO™ system for high strength waste stream treatment.
Collaborations with Strategic Partners

We have an exclusive manufacturing agreement in place with Merrell Bros., Inc., which is based in Kokomo, Indiana, and is a nationwide biosolids management company helping municipalities, industries and agricultural operations successfully manage and recycle biosolids. We have also entered into an agreement with Merrell Bros., Inc. where they also serve as a channel partner to facilitate our market penetration and expansion plans in the US by opening up their existing client base. We believe the Company has the facilities and capability to rapidly ramp-up manufacturing volumes and also support system modifications and deployment as required per market and clients. We expect Merrell Bros., Inc. to be a valuable resource as an additional sales channel for our AirSCWO™ systems which will continue to spur overall growth of the Company.

We have a Sponsored Partnership Agreement with Duke University that provides access to Duke’s world-class research capabilities, building on our own R&D expertise and strengthening our core development activities when needed.

We also are working with Environmental Services Company, LTD. (ESC), which is based in Israel, to act as our channel partner for treating industrial waste streams in Israel. ESC has an established reputation for its unique knowledge, regulatory and physical infrastructure, and a variety of halogenated organic wastes required for the R&D effort. ESC is expected to provide the Company with access to new markets in the Middle-East that are more closely focused toward hazardous material treatment.

Marketing

Our marketing approach is multi-pronged with three areas of focus: development of information, education of end users, and thought leadership. We believe this approach is appropriate because business purchase decisions are based on bottom-line revenue impact and, increasingly, the environmental impact of its decisions. Return on investment (ROI) is a primary focus for corporate decision makers. The AirSCWO™ technology offers a waste treatment for the modern era and a versatile treatment tool that could address future regulation and improve resiliency.

We conduct marketing campaigns aimed at any individual(s) with control or influence on purchasing decisions. This can encompass a wide variety of titles and functions, from entry- level end-users all the way up to the C-suite.

Government Regulations

Our operations and AirSCWO™ units may be subject to various United States federal, state and local and, in the case of our Israel operations, Israeli laws and regulations and requirements governing the protection of the environment, public health and safety, and other matters. For example, the construction and operation of our AirSCWO™ units may require obtaining air permits from various states or, alternatively, obtaining a formal determination from a state that a permit is not required. We may also be required to obtain state and local treatment works approval to install our AirSCWO™ units if a unit is connected to a system which is permitted pursuant to the United States National Pollutant Discharge Elimination Systems Act (NPDES). In the event our AirSCWO™ units are used to treat metals, the resulting mineral stream may constitute heavy metals under the United States Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (the “RCRA”) and require separation and regulated disposal if such heavy metals were deemed to be hazardous waste under the RCRA. If the operators of our AirSCWO™ units are treating hazardous waste, such operators may be required to obtain special hazardous waste technician training. Additionally, we are currently evaluating whether our AirSCWO™ units may be regulated pursuant to the United States Occupational Safety and Health Act and thereby be subject to inspections thereunder. We intend that our operations and AirSCWO™ units will be in material compliance with, and in many cases surpass, minimum standards required by applicable laws and regulations.
Corporate Information

374Water Inc. (the “Company”, “374Water”, “We”, or “Our”) is a Delaware corporation which was formed in September 2005 as PowerVerde, Inc At that time, the Company was focused on developing, commercializing and marketing a series of unique electric generating power systems designed to produce electrical power with zero emissions or waste byproducts, based on a pressure-driven expander motor and related organic rankine cycle technology.

Implications of Being an Emerging Growth Company and a Smaller Reporting Company

We qualify as an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the “JOBS Act”) enacted in April 2012. An emerging growth company may take advantage of exemptions from some of the reporting requirements that are otherwise applicable to public companies. These exemptions include:

· | Being permitted to present only two years of audited financial statements and only two years of related Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in this Form 10-K;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”); 
· | Reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports, proxy statements and registration statements; and 
· | Exemptions from the requirements to hold a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. 


We may take advantage of these provisions until the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of our common equity securities pursuant to a registration statement declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). However, if certain events occur prior to the end of such five-year period, including if we become a “large accelerated filer,” our annual gross revenue exceeds $1.235 billion, or we issue more than $1.0 billion of non-convertible debt in any three-year period, we will cease to be an emerging growth company prior to the end of such five-year period.

In addition, the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. We have elected not to take advantage of the benefits of this exemption and our election is irrevocable. Therefore, we will not be able to take advantage of this exemption at any time in the future.

Finally, we are a “smaller reporting company” (and may continue to qualify as such even after we no longer qualify as an emerging growth company) and, accordingly, may provide public disclosure that differs from larger public companies. As a result, the information that we provide to our stockholders may be different than you might receive from other public reporting companies in which you hold equity interests.
