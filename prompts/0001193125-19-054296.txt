ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

 We are a leading American media and entertainment company, with a cume of 170 million people each month, with coverage of close to 90% of persons 12+ in the top 50 U.S. markets through our premier collection of highly-rated, award-winning radio stations, digital platforms and live events. We are the number one creator of live, original, local audio content and the nations unrivaled leader in news and sports radio. We are home to seven of the eight most listened to all-news stations in the U.S., as well as more than 40 professional sports teams and dozens of top college programs. As one of the countrys two largest radio broadcasters, we offer local and national advertisers integrated marketing solutions across audio, digital and event platforms to deliver the power of local connection on a national scale. We have a nationwide footprint of radio stations including positions in all of the top 16 markets and 22 of the top 25 markets. We were organized in 1968 as a Pennsylvania corporation. 
 On February 2, 2017, we and our wholly owned subsidiary (Merger Sub) entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the CBS Radio Merger Agreement) with CBS Corporation (CBS) and its wholly-owned subsidiary CBS Radio Inc. (CBS Radio). Pursuant to the CBS Radio Merger Agreement, Merger Sub merged with and into CBS Radio with CBS Radio surviving as our wholly-owned subsidiary (the Merger). The parties to the Merger believe that the Merger was tax-free to CBS and its shareholders. The Merger was effected through a stock for-stock Reverse Morris Trust transaction. 
 In connection with the Reverse Morris Trust transaction, CBS commenced an exchange offer for the separation of its radio business to allow for the combination of CBS Radio and Entercom. CBS, certain of its subsidiaries and CBS Radio completed the following distributions and stock split (together referred to as the Radio Reorganization). At the time of the signing of the CBS Radio Merger Agreement on February 2, 2017, CBS Radio had two classes of common stock, the Radio Series 1 Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share (the Radio Series 1 Common Stock), and the Radio Series 2 Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share (the Radio Series 2 Common Stock and, together with the Radio Series 1 Common Stock, the Radio Existing Common Stock). As of February 2, 2017, CBS directly owned 100% of the equity of Westinghouse CBS Holding Company, Inc., a Delaware corporation (Westinghouse), Westinghouse directly owned 100% of the equity of CBS Broadcasting Inc., a New York corporation (CBS Broadcasting), and CBS Broadcasting directly owned 100% of the Radio Existing Common Stock. Prior to the consummation of the Final Distribution (defined below), CBS Broadcasting distributed all of the outstanding equity of CBS Radio to Westinghouse, and Westinghouse distributed all of the outstanding equity of CBS Radio to CBS. These distributions are referred to as the Internal Distributions. 
 Following completion of the Internal Distributions, CBS Radio: (i) took all necessary actions to ensure that Radio Series 1 Common Stock and the Radio Series 2 Common Stock were combined into a single class of common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the Radio New Common Stock); (ii) authorized the issuance of at least 101,407,494 shares of Radio New Common Stock; and (iii) effected a stock split of the outstanding shares of Radio New Common Stock, as a result of which, as of immediately prior to the effective time of the Final Distribution, 101,407,494 shares of Radio New Common Stock were issued and outstanding, all of which were owned directly by CBS (collectively, (i) through (iii), the Stock Split). 
 Prior to the effective time of the Merger, pursuant to a Master Separation Agreement entered into between CBS and CBS Radio (the Separation Agreement and, together with the Side Letter Agreement made as of February 2, 2017 by and among Entercom, Joseph M. Field, Marie Field, and David J. Field (the Side Letter) and the CBS Radio Merger Agreement, (the Agreements): 
 

 | Certain subsidiaries of CBS consummated the Internal Distributions of all of the outstanding equity of CBS Radio that resulted in CBS Radio being a directly wholly owned subsidiary of CBS, and CBS Radio effected the Radio Reorganization, in each case on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the CBS Radio Merger Agreement and the Separation Agreement;

 | CBS consummated an offer to exchange (the Exchange Offer) all of the outstanding shares of Radio Common Stock for shares of Class B Common Stock of CBS, par value $0.001 per share (the CBS Class B Common Stock), then outstanding on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the CBS Radio Merger Agreement and the Separation Agreement; and

 | In the event that holders of CBS Class B Common Stock subscribed for less than all of the shares of Radio Common Stock in the Exchange Offer, CBS would distribute the remaining outstanding shares of Radio Common Stock on a pro rata basis to holders of CBS Class B Common Stock and Class A Common Stock of CBS, par value $0.001 per share (the CBS Class A Common Stock and, together with the CBS Class B Common Stock, the CBS Common Stock), whose shares of CBS Common Stock remain outstanding after consummation of the Exchange Offer, so that CBS

would be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes as having distributed all of the Radio Common Stock to its stockholders (the Clean-Up Spin-Off), considering for the purpose of calculating the pro rata distribution of Radio Common Stock pursuant to any Clean-Up Spin-Off, the CBS Class A Common Stock and CBS Class B Common Stock as a single class (collectively, the Final Distribution, and, together with the Internal Distributions, the Distributions), in each case on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the CBS Radio Merger Agreement and the Separation Agreement.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In the exchange offer, CBS shareholders had the opportunity to exchange their shares of CBS Class B common stock for shares of CBS Radio common stock, which were immediately converted into the right to receive an equal number of shares of Entercom Class A common stock upon completion of the Merger.    Under the terms of the exchange offer, 5.6796 shares of CBS Radio common stock were exchanged for each share of CBS Class B common stock accepted in the offer. CBS accepted 17,854,689 of the tendered shares in exchange for 101,407,494 shares of CBS Radio common stock, which upon closing of the Merger were immediately converted into an equal number of whole shares of Entercom Class A common stock. 
 On November 1, 2017, we entered into a settlement with the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ). The settlement with the DOJ together with several required station divestiture transactions with third parties, allowed us to move forward with the Merger. On November 9, 2017, we obtained approval from the Federal Communications Commission (the FCC) to consummate the Merger. The transactions contemplated by the CBS Radio Merger Agreement were approved by our shareholders on November 15, 2017. Upon the expiration of the exchange offer period on November 16, 2017, the Merger closed on November 17, 2017.

The principal components of our strategy are to: (i) continue to be Americas number one creator of live, original, local audio content by building strongly branded radio stations with highly compelling content; (ii) focus on delivering effective integrated marketing solutions for our customers that incorporate audio, digital and experiential assets and leverage our national scale and digital and live events platforms; (iii) assemble and develop the strongest market leading station clusters; (iv) drive a positive perception of radio as the nations number one reach and ROI medium; and (v) offer a great place to work, where the most talented high achievers can grow and thrive. 
Source Of Revenue 
 The primary source of revenue for our radio stations is the sale of advertising time to local, regional and national advertisers and national network advertisers who purchase commercials in varying lengths. A growing source of revenue is from station-related digital product suites, which allow for enhanced audience interaction and participation, and integrated digital advertising solutions. A stations local sales staff generates the majority of its local and regional advertising sales through direct solicitations of local advertising agencies and businesses. We retain a national representation firm to sell to advertisers outside of our local markets. 
 Our stations are typically classified by their format, such as news, sports, talk, classic rock, urban, adult contemporary, alternative and country, among others. A stations format enables it to target specific segments of listeners sharing certain demographics. Advertisers and stations use data published by audience measuring services to

  estimate how many people within particular geographical markets and demographics listen to specific stations. Our geographically and demographically diverse portfolio of radio stations allows us to deliver targeted messages to specific audiences for advertisers on a local, regional and national basis. 
 Competition 
 The radio broadcasting industry is highly competitive. Our stations compete for listeners and advertising revenue with other radio stations within their respective markets. In addition, our stations compete for audiences and advertising revenues with other media including: digital audio streaming, satellite radio, broadcast television, digital, satellite and cable television, newspapers and magazines, outdoor advertising, direct mail, yellow pages, wireless media alternatives, cellular phones and other forms of audio entertainment and advertisement. 
Federal Regulation of Radio Broadcasting 
 Overview. The radio broadcasting industry is subject to extensive and changing government regulation of, among other things, ownership limitations, program content, advertising content, technical operations and business and employment practices. The ownership, operation and sale of radio stations are subject to the jurisdiction of the FCC pursuant to the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the Communications Act). 
 The following is a brief summary of certain provisions of the Communications Act and of certain specific FCC regulations and policies. This summary is not a comprehensive listing of all of the regulations and policies affecting radio stations. For further information concerning the nature and extent of federal regulation of radio stations, you should refer to the Communications Act, FCC rules and FCC public notices and rulings. 
 FCC Licenses. The operation of a radio broadcast station requires a license from the FCC. Certain of our subsidiaries hold the FCC licenses for our stations. The total number of radio stations that can simultaneously operate in any given area or market is limited by the amount of spectrum allotted by the FCC within the AM and FM radio bands, and by station-to-station interference within those bands. While there are no national radio station ownership caps, FCC rules do limit the number of stations within the same market that a single individual or entity may own or control. 
 Ownership Rules. The FCC sets limits on the number of radio broadcast stations an entity may permissibly own within a market. Same-market FCC numeric ownership limitations are based: (i) on markets as defined and rated by Nielsen Audio; and (ii) in areas outside of Nielsen Audio markets, on markets as determined by overlap of specified signal contours. 
 The total number of stations authorized to operate in a local market may fluctuate from time to time, and the number of stations that can be owned by a single individual or entity in a given market can therefore vary over time. Once the FCC approves the ownership of a cluster of stations in a market, that owner may continue to hold those stations under grandfathering policies, despite a decrease in the number of stations in the market. 
 Ownership Attribution. In applying its ownership limitations, the FCC generally considers only attributable ownership interests. Attributable interests generally include: (i) equity and debt interests which when combined exceed 33% of a licensees or other media entitys total asset value, if the interest holder supplies more than 15% of a stations total weekly programming or has an attributable interest in any same-market media (television, radio, cable or newspaper), with a higher threshold in the case of investments in certain eligible entities acquiring broadcast stations; (ii) a 5% or greater direct or indirect voting stock interest, including certain interests held in trust, unless the holder is a qualified passive investor, in which case the threshold is a 20% or greater voting stock interest; (iii) any equity interest in a limited liability company or a partnership, including a limited partnership, unless properly insulated from management activities; and (iv) any position as an officer or director of a licensee or of its direct or indirect parent.
 Alien Ownership Rules. The Communications Act prohibits the issuance to, or holding of broadcast licenses by, foreign governments or aliens, non-U.S. citizens, whether individuals or entities, including any interest in a corporation which holds a broadcast license if more than 20% of the licensees capital stock is owned or voted by aliens. In addition, the FCC may prohibit any corporation from holding a broadcast license if the corporation is directly or indirectly controlled by any other corporation of which more than 25% of the capital stock is owned of record or voted by aliens if the FCC finds that the prohibition is in the public interest. The Communications Act gives the FCC discretion to allow greater amounts of alien ownership. The FCC considers investment proposals from international companies or individuals on a case-by-case basis. In September 2016, the FCC announced that it was streamlining foreign ownership rules and procedures to provide for a standardized filing and review process.

 The streamlined rules permit a broadcast licensee to file a petition with the FCC seeking approval for a proposed controlling investor to own up to 100% foreign ownership of the controlling parent entity and for a non-controlling foreign investor identified in the petition to increase its equity and/or voting interest in a parent entity at a future time up to 49.99%. This change will make it easier for broadcast licensees to seek foreign investors. The FCC also adopted a methodology for determining the citizenship of beneficial owners of publicly held shares that companies may use to ascertain compliance with the foreign ownership rules. 
 License Renewal. Radio station licenses issued by the FCC are ordinarily renewable for an eight-year term. A station may continue to operate beyond the expiration date of its license if a timely filed license renewal application is pending. All of our licenses have been renewed and are current. 
 The FCC is required to renew a broadcast stations license if the FCC finds that the station has served the public interest, convenience and necessity; there have been no serious violations by the licensee of the Communications Act or the FCCs rules and regulations; and there have been no other violations by the licensee of the Communications Act or the FCCs rules and regulations that, taken together, constitute a pattern of abuse. If a challenge is filed against a renewal application, and, as a result of an evidentiary hearing, the FCC determines that the licensee has failed to meet certain fundamental requirements and that no mitigating factors justify the imposition of a lesser sanction, the FCC may deny a license renewal application. In certain instances, the FCC may renew a license application for less than a full eight-year term. Historically, our FCC licenses have generally been renewed for the full term. 
 The FCC initiated an investigation in January 2007, related to a contest at one of our stations. In October 2016, the FCC designated for a hearing whether we operated this station in the public interest and whether such stations license should be renewed. In February 2017, in order to facilitate the Merger, we permanently discontinued operation of our only station subject to a petition to deny, in order to cancel the license, dismiss its renewal application and terminate the renewal hearing. 
 Transfer or Assignment of Licenses. The Communications Act prohibits the assignment of broadcast licenses or the transfer of control of a broadcast licensee without the prior approval of the FCC. In determining whether to grant such approval, the FCC considers a number of factors pertaining to the existing licensee and the proposed licensee, including: 
 

 | compliance with the various rules limiting common ownership of media properties in a given market;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the character of the proposed licensee; and
--+----------------------------------------------


 | compliance with the Communications Acts limitations on alien ownership as well as general compliance with FCC regulations and policies.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 To obtain FCC consent for the assignment or transfer of control of a broadcast license, appropriate applications must be filed with the FCC. Interested parties may file objections or petitions to deny such applications. 
 Programming and Operation. The Communications Act requires broadcasters to serve the public interest. A licensee is required to present programming that is responsive to issues in the stations community of license and to maintain records demonstrating this responsiveness. The FCC regulates, among other things, political advertising; sponsorship identification; the advertisement of contests and lotteries; the conduct of station-run contests; obscene, indecent and profane broadcasts; certain employment practices; and certain technical operation requirements, including limits on human exposure to radio-frequency radiation. The FCC considers complaints from listeners concerning a stations public-service programming, employment practices, or other operational issues when processing a renewal application filed by a station, but the FCC may consider complaints at any time and may impose fines or take other action for violations of the FCCs rules separate from its action on a renewal application. 
 FCC regulations prohibit the broadcast of obscene material at any time as well as the broadcast, between the hours of 6:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m., of material it considers indecent or profane. The FCC has historically enforced licensee compliance in this area through the assessment of monetary forfeitures. Such forfeitures may include: (i) imposition of the maximum authorized fine for egregious cases ($407,270 for a single violation, up to a maximum of $3,759,410 for a continuing violation); and (ii) imposition of fines on a per utterance basis instead of a single fine for an entire program. There may be indecency complaints which have been submitted to the FCC of which we have not yet been notified.

 Certain FCC rules regulate the conduct of on-air station contests, requiring in general that the material rules and terms of the contest be broadcast periodically or posted online and that the contest be conducted substantially as announced. 
 Enforcement Authority. The FCC has the power to impose penalties for violations of its rules under the Communications Act, including the imposition of monetary fines, the issuance of short-term licenses, the imposition of a condition on the renewal of a license, the denial of authority to acquire new stations, and the revocation of operating authority. The maximum fine for a single violation of the FCCs rules (other than the rules regarding indecency and profanity) is $50,334. 
 Proposed and Recent Changes. Congress, the FCC and other federal agencies are considering or may in the future consider and adopt new laws, regulations and policies regarding a wide variety of matters that could: (i) affect, directly or indirectly, the operation, ownership and profitability of our radio stations; (ii) result in the loss of audience share and advertising revenues for our radio stations; and (iii) affect our ability to acquire additional radio stations or to finance those acquisitions. 
 Federal Antitrust Laws. The federal agencies responsible for enforcing the federal antitrust laws, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the DOJ, may investigate certain acquisitions. For an acquisition meeting certain size thresholds, the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 requires the parties to file Notification and Report Forms with the FTC and the DOJ and to observe specified waiting-period requirements before consummating the acquisition. The Merger was subject to review by the FTC and the DOJ. On November 1, 2017, we entered into a consent decree with the DOJ that resolved the DOJs investigation into the Merger. 
 HD Radio 
 AM and FM radio stations may use the FCC selected In-Band On-Channel (IBOC) as the exclusive technology for terrestrial digital operations. IBOC, developed by iBiquity Digital Corporation, is also known as HD Radio. 
 HD Radio technology permits a station to transmit radio programming in digital format. We currently use HD Radio digital technology on most of our FM stations. The advantages of digital audio broadcasting over traditional analog broadcasting technology include improved sound quality, the availability of additional channels and the ability to offer a greater variety of auxiliary services. 
 Employees 
 As of February 5, 2019, we had 4,428 full-time employees and 3,198 part-time employees. With respect to certain of our stations in our Boston, Chicago, Detroit, Hartford, Kansas City, Los Angeles, Minneapolis, New York City, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, San Francisco and St. Louis markets, we are a party to collective bargaining agreements with the Screen Actors Guild - American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (known as SAG-AFTRA). With respect to certain of our stations in our Chicago, Los Angeles, and New York City markets, we are a party to collective bargaining agreements with the Writers Guild of America East (known as WGAE) and Writers Guild of America West (known as WGAW). With respect to certain of our stations in our Chicago, New York City, and Philadelphia markets, we are a party to collective bargaining agreements with the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (known as IBEW). We believe that our relations with our employees are good. 
Corporate Governance 
 Code Of Business Conduct And Ethics. We have a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics that applies to each of our employees, including our principal executive officers and senior members of our finance department.

 Board Committee Charters. Each of our Audit Committee, Compensation Committee and Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee has a committee charter as required by the rules of the New York Stock Exchange (the NYSE). These committee charters can be found on the Investors sub-page of our website located at www.entercom.com/investors. 
 Corporate Governance Guidelines. NYSE rules require our Board of Directors (the Board) to establish certain Corporate Governance Guidelines. These guidelines can be found on the Investors sub-page of our website located at www.entercom.com/investors.

 Environmental Compliance 
 As the owner, lessee or operator of various real properties and facilities, we are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. Historically, compliance with these laws and regulations has not had a material adverse effect on our business. 
Seasonality 
 Seasonal revenue fluctuations are common in the radio broadcasting industry and are due primarily to fluctuations in advertising expenditures. Typically, revenues are lowest in the first calendar quarter of the year.
