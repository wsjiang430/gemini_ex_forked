ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
History and Development of Business
Founded by William R. Kelly in 1946, Kelly Services® pioneered an industry that connects people with work in ways that enrich their lives. At our inception we helped usher in and embolden a workforce of women, opening doors and creating opportunities where none had existed. As work evolved we equipped people with the skills to master the technologies of the day: launching the first-of-its-kind online learning center for scientists; creating testing and training packages for new office programs; and launching skill builders to align with new light industrial protocols. With each advance we have empowered people to meet the needs of a changing marketplace, and enabled companies to access skilled talent that can move their businesses forward. 
As work has evolved so has our range of solutions, growing over the years to reflect the changing needs of our customers and the changing nature of work itself. We have progressed from a United States-based company concentrating primarily on traditional office staffing into a workforce solutions leader delivering expertise in a number of specialty services. While ranking as one of the world’s largest scientific staffing providers, we also place professional and technical employees at all levels in engineering, IT and finance. These services complement our expertise in office services, contact center, light industrial and electronic assembly staffing, as well as our leading position in the K-12 educational staffing market in the U.S. As work has evolved and workforce management has become more complex, we have also developed a talent supply chain management approach to help many of the world’s largest companies plan for and manage their workforce. Innovative solutions supporting this approach span outsourcing, consulting, recruitment, talent advisory, career transition and vendor management services.
Geographic Breadth of Services
Headquartered in Troy, Michigan, Kelly provides workforce solutions to a diversified group of customers in three regions: the Americas; Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (“EMEA”); and Asia Pacific (“APAC”). Our customer base spans a variety of industries and includes more than 90 percent of the Fortune 100™ companies.
In 2018, we assigned approximately 500,000 temporary employees to a variety of customers around the globe.
Description of Business Segments
Our operations are divided into three business segments: Americas Staffing, Global Talent Solutions (“GTS”) and International Staffing. In July 2016, we expanded our joint venture with Persol Holdings (formerly Temp Holdings) to form PersolKelly Asia Pacific (the “JV”) and moved our APAC staffing operations into the JV. We provide staffing solutions through our branch networks in our Americas and International operations. In addition to staffing solutions, we also provide a suite of innovative talent fulfillment and outcome-based solutions through our GTS segment, which delivers integrated talent management solutions to meet customer needs across the entire spectrum of talent categories. Using talent supply chain strategies, GTS helps customers design, execute, and manage workforce programs that enable them to connect with talent across all work styles (full-time, contract, temporary, etc.), gain access to a vast network of service providers, and achieve their business goals on time and on budget. 
Americas Staffing
Our Americas Staffing segment represents the Company’s branch-delivered staffing business in the U.S., Puerto Rico, Canada, Mexico and Brazil. This segment delivers temporary staffing, as well as direct-hire placement services, in a number of specialty staffing services, including: Office, providing trained employees for data entry, clerical and administrative support roles across numerous industries; Education, supplying schools nationwide with instructional and non-instructional employees; Marketing, providing support staff for seminars, sales and trade shows; Electronic Assembly, providing assemblers, quality control inspectors and technicians; Light Industrial, placing maintenance workers, material handlers and assemblers; Science, providing all levels of scientists and scientific and clinical research workforce solutions; Engineering, supplying engineering professionals across all disciplines, including aeronautical, chemical, civil/structural, electrical/instrumentation, environmental, industrial, mechanical, petroleum, pharmaceutical, quality and telecommunications; Information Technology, placing IT specialists across all disciplines; Creative Services, placing creative talent in the spectrum of creative services positions; and

It reflects the trend of customers towards the adoption of holistic talent supply chain solutions which combine contingent labor, full-time hiring and outsourced services. Services in this segment include:  Centrally delivered staffing for large accounts; Contingent Workforce Outsourcing (“CWO”), delivering contingent labor to customers using a managed service provider model; Recruitment Process Outsourcing (“RPO”), offering end-to-end talent acquisition solutions, including customized recruitment projects; Business Process Outsourcing (“BPO”), offering full staffing and operational management of non-core functions or departments; Payroll Process Outsourcing (“PPO”), providing centralized payroll processing solutions for our customers, and KellyConnect, offering contact center staffing solutions which focus on delivering talent to a customer’s call center operations.

Business Objectives
Kelly’s philosophy is rooted in our conviction that our business can and does make a difference on a daily basis—for our customers, in the lives of our employees and talent networks, in the local communities we serve and in the broader economy. We aspire to be a destination for top talent and a strategic business partner for our customers. Our solutions are designed to connect with talent across targeted specialties and a variety of flexible work styles, and to offer customers access to workforce solutions that can be customized as they seek to operate more efficient and competitive organizations. To achieve these goals, we continue to adopt forward-looking technologies and innovative business practices that can drive success in a dynamic market. 
With more than one-third of the world’s workforce now participating as independent workers, more companies are adopting strategies that recognize contingent labor, consultants and project-based work as keys to their ongoing success. We continue to refine our core competencies to help them connect with talent and realize their business objectives. Kelly offers world-class staffing on a temporary and direct placement basis, as well as a comprehensive array of outsourcing, consulting and talent advisory services. Kelly continues to target our areas of investment and expertise to solve our customers’ workforce challenges and create opportunity for talent in the changing marketplace.

Business Operations
Service Marks
We own numerous service marks that are registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, the European Union Community Trademark Office and numerous individual country trademark offices.
Seasonality
Our quarterly operating results are affected by the seasonality of our customers’ businesses. With the exception of our education business, demand for staffing services historically has been lower during the first quarter, and typically increases during the remainder of the year. 
Working Capital
Our working capital requirements are primarily generated from employee payroll and customer accounts receivable. Since receipts from customers generally lag payroll to temporary employees, working capital requirements increase substantially in periods of growth. Conversely, when economic activity slows, working capital requirements may substantially decrease. 
Customers
Kelly’s client portfolio spans companies of all sizes, ranging from local and mid-sized businesses to the Fortune 500. In 2018, an estimated 51% of total Company revenue was attributed to 100 large customers. Our largest single customer accounted for approximately five percent of total revenue in 2018.
Government Contracts
Although we conduct business under various federal, state, and local government contracts, no single one accounts for more than three percent of total Company revenue in 2018. 
Competition
The worldwide workforce solutions industry is competitive and highly fragmented. In the United States, we compete with other firms that operate nationally, and with thousands of smaller companies that compete in varying degrees at local levels. Additionally, several similar staffing companies compete globally. In 2018, our largest competitors were Adecco S.A., Randstad Holding N.V., ManpowerGroup Inc., Allegis Group and Recruit Holdings. 
Key factors that influence our success are quality of service, price and breadth of service. 
Quality of service is highly dependent on the availability of qualified, competent talent, and our ability to recruit, screen, train, retain and manage a pool of employees who match the skills required by particular customers. During an economic downturn, we must balance competitive pricing pressures with the need to retain a qualified workforce. Price competition in the staffing industry is intense, particularly for office clerical and light industrial personnel, and pricing pressure from customers and competitors continues to be significant.
Breadth of service, or ability to manage staffing suppliers, has become more critical as customers seek a single supplier to manage all their staffing needs. Kelly’s talent supply chain management approach seeks to address this requirement for our larger customers, enabling us to deliver talent wherever and whenever they need it around the world.
Environmental Concerns
Because we are involved in a service business, federal, state or local laws that regulate the discharge of materials into the environment do not materially impact us. 
Employees
We employ approximately 1,100 people at our corporate headquarters in Troy, Michigan, and approximately 6,800 staff members in our U.S. and international network of branch offices. In 2018, we recruited approximately 500,000 temporary employees on behalf of customers around the globe.
While services may be provided inside the facilities of customers, we remain the employer of record for our temporary employees. We retain responsibility for employee assignments, including workers’ compensation insurance, the employer’s 
 5

share of all applicable payroll taxes and the administration of the employee’s share of these taxes. We offer access to various health and other benefit programs to our employees.
