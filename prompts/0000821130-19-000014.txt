Throughout 2018, new postpaid handset sales to retail consumers were made primarily under equipment installment plans (EIP); business and government customers may continue to purchase equipment under alternative plans subject to a service contract.  For certain installment plans, after a specified period of time or number of payments, the customer may have the right to upgrade to a new device prior to reaching the end of the installment term, thus enabling customers to access the latest smartphones and provide a better overall customer experience. 
U.S. Cellular also offers accessories for purchase on installment plans. These plans allow new and existing postpaid customers to purchase certain accessories payable over a specified time period. These accessory installment plans are available through U.S. Cellular company-owned retail stores, telesales channels, and agent channels using direct fulfillment with U.S. Cellular’s inventory.
U.S. Cellular continues to offer device service programs that provide customers a simple process to replace a defective device. U.S. Cellular also offers its Trade-In program where U.S. Cellular buys consumers’ used equipment, Device Protection+ program, which includes overnight delivery of a replacement device for damaged, lost and stolen devices, Device Protection+ Advanced program, which includes 100GB of data backup, TechSupport+, and AppleCare services for Apple iOS customers.
U.S. Cellular offers a full array of iconic smartphones with options for both Android and iOS customers.  U.S. Cellular continues to bolster its expanding smartphone portfolio with the Samsung Galaxy S® 9/9+ and Note 9, the iPhone® XS/XS Max and XR, the LG V40 ThinQ, and the Motorola Z3 Play.  Along with the iconic devices, U.S. Cellular supports the larger ecosystem of Samsung and Apple devices, such as the Samsung Galaxy Watch, the Samsung Gear Sport and the Apple Watch Series 4.

U.S. Cellular continuously monitors the financial condition of its wireless device and accessory suppliers.  Since U.S. Cellular has a diversified portfolio of products from more than one supplier, U.S. Cellular does not expect the financial condition of any single supplier to affect its ability to offer a competitive portfolio of wireless devices and accessories for sale to customers.
Marketing, Customer Service, and Sales and Distribution Channels
Marketing and Advertising.  U.S. Cellular’s marketing plan is focused on acquiring, retaining and growing customer relationships by maintaining a high-quality wireless network, providing outstanding customer service, and offering a comprehensive portfolio of services and products built around customer needs at fair prices with a local focus.  U.S. Cellular believes that creating positive relationships with its customers enhances their wireless experience and builds customer loyalty.  U.S. Cellular currently offers several customer-centric programs and services to customers. 
To attract potential new customers and retain existing customers, and increase their usage of U.S. Cellular’s services, U.S. Cellular’s advertising is directed at increasing the public awareness of the U.S. Cellular brand, knowledge of the outstanding network that works in places where other carriers do not have coverage, and understanding of the wireless services it offers. U.S. Cellular supplements its advertising with a focused public relations program that improves overall brand sentiment and awareness, encourages engagement, supports sales of services and products, and builds preference and loyalty for the U.S. Cellular brand.  The approach combines national and local media relations in mainstream and social media channels with market-wide activities, events, and sponsorships.
U.S. Cellular focuses its charitable giving on initiatives relevant to consumers in its service areas.  These initiatives include programs that focus on STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) activities for youth in the communities U.S. Cellular serves and often involve collaboration with organizations such as the Boys and Girls Clubs of America.
Customer Service.  U.S. Cellular manages customer retention by focusing on outstanding customer service through the development of processes that are customer-friendly, extensive training of frontline sales and support associates and the implementation of retention programs.
U.S. Cellular currently operates four regional customer care centers in its operating markets with personnel who are responsible for customer service activities, and a national financial services center with personnel who perform credit and other customer payment activities.  U.S. Cellular also contracts with third parties that provide additional customer care and financial services support.
Sales and Distribution Channels.  U.S. Cellular supports a multi-faceted distribution program, including retail sales, direct sales, third-party national retailers, and independent agents, plus a website and telesales.
Company retail store locations are designed to market wireless services and products to the consumer and small business segments in a setting familiar to these types of customers. As of December 31, 2018, retail sales associates work in 259 U.S. Cellular-operated retail stores and kiosks.  Direct sales representatives sell traditional wireless services as well as Internet of Things (IoT) and M2M products and solutions to medium- and large-sized businesses and government entities.  Additionally, the U.S. Cellular website enables customers to purchase wireless devices online.
U.S. Cellular maintains an ongoing training program to improve the effectiveness of retail sales associates and direct sales representatives by focusing their efforts on obtaining customers by facilitating the sale of appropriate packages for the customer’s expected usage and value-added services that meet the individual needs of the customer.
U.S. Cellular has relationships with exclusive and non-exclusive agents (collectively “agents”), which are independent businesses that obtain customers for U.S. Cellular on a commission basis.  At December 31, 2018, U.S. Cellular had contracts with these businesses aggregating 436 locations.  U.S. Cellular provides support and training to its agents to increase customer satisfaction and to ensure a consistent customer experience.  U.S. Cellular’s agents are generally in the business of selling wireless devices, wireless service packages and other related products.  No single agent accounted for 10% or more of U.S. Cellular’s operating revenues during the past three years.
U.S. Cellular services and products also are offered through third-party national and on-line retailers.  Wal-Mart, Sam’s Club, Family Dollar and Dollar General offer U.S. Cellular services and products at select retail locations in U.S. Cellular’s service areas. U.S. Cellular continues to explore new relationships with additional third-party retailers as part of its strategy to expand distribution. 
Seasonality.  Seasonality in operating expenses may cause operating income to vary from quarter to quarter.  U.S. Cellular’s operating expenses tend to be higher in the fourth quarter due to increased marketing and promotional activities during the holiday season.
Competition
The wireless telecommunication industry is highly competitive.  U.S. Cellular competes directly with several wireless service providers in each of its markets.  In general, there are between two and four competitors in each wireless market in which U.S. Cellular provides service, excluding resellers and mobile virtual network operators (MVNO).  In its footprint, U.S. Cellular competes to varying degrees against each of the national wireless companies: Verizon Wireless, AT&T Mobility, Sprint, and T-Mobile USA, in addition to a few smaller regional carriers in specific areas of its footprint.  All of the national competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources than U.S. Cellular.  In addition, U.S. Cellular competes with other companies that use alternative communication technology and services to provide similar services and products. 
3

Since each of these wireless competitors operates on systems using spectrum licensed by the FCC and has comparable technology and facilities, competition among wireless service providers for customers is principally on the basis of types of services and products, price, size of area covered, network quality, network speed and responsiveness of customer service.  U.S. Cellular employs a customer satisfaction strategy that includes maintaining an outstanding wireless network throughout its markets.  U.S. Cellular owns and operates low-band spectrum (less than 1 GHz) that covers the majority of its footprint and enables more efficient coverage in rural areas (compared to spectrum above 1 GHz), which strengthens its network quality positioning.  To the extent existing competitors or new entrants hold or acquire such spectrum in U.S. Cellular markets, U.S. Cellular could face increased competition over time. In addition, industry deployment of fifth generation (5G) technology could introduce increased competition from industry participants on bases such as network speed and new product offerings.
The use of national advertising and promotional programs by the top four wireless service providers is a source of additional competitive and pricing pressures in all U.S. Cellular markets, even if those operators do not provide direct service in a particular market.  Over the past year, competition among top carriers has continued to be robust, with the top four carriers offering unlimited plans as well as device price reductions.  In addition, in the current wireless environment, U.S. Cellular’s ability to compete depends on its ability to continue to offer national voice and data plans. U.S. Cellular provides wireless services comparable to the national competitors, but the national wireless companies operate in a wider geographic area and are able to provide such services over a wider area on their own networks than U.S. Cellular can offer on its network.  Although U.S. Cellular offers similar coverage area as these competitors, U.S. Cellular incurs roaming charges for data sessions and calls made in portions of the coverage area which are not part of its network, thereby increasing its cost of operations.  U.S. Cellular depends on roaming agreements with other wireless carriers to provide voice and data roaming capabilities in areas not covered by U.S. Cellular’s network.  Similarly, U.S. Cellular provides roaming services on its network to other wireless carriers’ customers who travel within U.S. Cellular’s coverage areas and receives revenue from other carriers for the provision of these services.
Convergence of connectivity is taking place on many levels, including wireless devices that can act as wireless or wireline replacement devices and the incorporation of wireless “hot spot” technology in wireless devices making internet access seamless regardless of location.  Although less directly a substitute for other wireless services, wireless data services such as Wi-Fi may be adequate for those who do not need mobile wide-area roaming or full two-way voice services. If the trend toward convergence continues, U.S. Cellular is at a competitive disadvantage to larger competitors, including the national wireless carriers, traditional cable companies, MVNOs and other potential large new entrants with much greater financial and other resources in adapting to such convergence.  Cable companies have begun to compete in the wireless market.  Most notably, Comcast and Charter currently offer wireless services.
U.S. Cellular’s approach in 2019 and in future years will be to focus on the unique needs and attitudes of its customers towards wireless service.  U.S. Cellular will deliver high-quality services and products at competitive prices and intends to continue to differentiate itself by seeking to provide an overall outstanding customer experience, founded on a high-quality network.  U.S. Cellular’s ability to compete successfully in the future will depend upon its ability to anticipate and respond to changes related to new service offerings, consumer preferences, competitors’ pricing strategies and new product offerings, technology, demographic trends, economic conditions and its access to adequate spectrum resources.
Network Technology, Roaming, and System Design
Technology.  Wireless telecommunication systems transmit voice, data, graphics and video through the transmission of signals over networks of radio towers using radio spectrum licensed by the FCC.  Access to local, regional, national and worldwide telecommunications networks is provided through system interconnections.  A high-quality network, supported by continued investments in that network, will remain an important factor for U.S. Cellular to remain competitive. 
VoLTE technology allows customers to utilize a 4G LTE network for both voice and data services, and offers enhanced services such as high definition voice and simultaneous voice and data sessions. In addition, the deployment of VoLTE technology expands U.S. Cellular’s ability to offer roaming services to other wireless carriers. VoLTE technology has been launched successfully in California, Iowa, Oregon, Washington and Wisconsin, and deployments in several additional operating markets will occur in 2019. 
5G technology is expected to help address customers’ growing demand for data services as well as create opportunities for new services requiring high speed and reliability as well as low latency. U.S. Cellular is committed to continuous technology innovation and continues to prepare for deployment of 5G technology beginning in 2019, including commencing a trial utilizing 5G standards and equipment on its core LTE network in the fourth quarter of 2018. U.S. Cellular is partnering with leading companies in the wireless infrastructure and handset ecosystem to provide rich 5G experiences for customers. In addition, in the markets where U.S. Cellular commercially deploys 5G technology, which will include communities of various sizes, customers using U.S. Cellular’s 4G LTE network will experience increased network speed due to U.S. Cellular's modernization efforts. The deployment of 5G technology will require substantial investments in spectrum and U.S. Cellular’s networks to remain competitive. 
Roaming.  A secondary source of revenue for U.S. Cellular is from customers of other wireless operators who roam on its network. Inter-carrier roaming agreements are negotiated between the wireless operators to enable customers who are in a wireless service area other than the customer’s home service area to place or receive a call or text message, or to use data services, in that service area.  U.S. Cellular has entered into reciprocal roaming agreements with operators of other wireless systems covering virtually all systems with Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) technology in the United States.  In addition, U.S. Cellular has entered into reciprocal 4G LTE roaming agreements with national wireless companies and, as a result, a majority of U.S. Cellular customers currently have access to nationwide 4G LTE service. 
4

Another digital technology, Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM), has a larger installed base of customers worldwide.  U.S. Cellular customers now have the ability to roam on GSM carriers with voice, data and text messaging in Canada, Mexico and internationally.  Both CDMA and GSM technologies are being succeeded by 4G LTE, VoLTE and 5G technology. 
System Design and Construction.  U.S. Cellular designs and constructs its systems in a manner it believes will permit it to provide high-quality service to substantially all types of compatible wireless devices.  Designs are based on engineering studies which relate to specific markets, in support of the larger network.  Network reliability is given careful consideration and extensive backup redundancy is employed in many aspects of U.S. Cellular’s network design.  Route diversity, redundant equipment, ring topology and extensive use of emergency standby power also are used to enhance network reliability and minimize service disruption from any particular network element failure.
In accordance with its strategy of building and strengthening its operating market areas, U.S. Cellular has selected high-capacity, carrier-class digital wireless switching systems that are capable of serving multiple markets through a single mobile telephone switching office.  Centralized equipment, used for network and data management, is located in high-availability facilities supported by multiple levels of power and network redundancy.  U.S. Cellular’s systems are designed to incorporate Internet Protocol (IP) packet-based Ethernet technology, which allows for increased data capacity and a more efficient network.  Interconnection between the mobile telephone switching office and the cell sites utilizes Ethernet technology for nearly all 4G LTE sites, over fiber or microwave links.
As a result of increasing demand for high–speed data and the deployment of 5G technology, U.S. Cellular expects to acquire additional spectrum licenses and to make significant investments in its network to provide sufficient capacity and throughput. 
Construction of wireless systems is capital-intensive, requiring substantial investment for land and improvements, buildings, towers, mobile telephone switching offices, cell site equipment, transport equipment, engineering and installation.  U.S. Cellular primarily uses its own personnel to engineer each wireless system it owns and operates, and engages contractors to construct the facilities.
The costs (inclusive of the costs to acquire licenses) to develop the systems which U.S. Cellular operates have historically been financed primarily through proceeds from debt offerings, with cash generated by operations, and proceeds from the sales of wireless interests and other non-strategic assets.
Business Development Strategy
U.S. Cellular operates a regional wireless network. U.S. Cellular’s interests in wireless licenses include both direct interests whereby U.S. Cellular is the licensee and investment interests in entities which are licensees; together, these direct and investment interests involve operating and non-operating licenses covering 30 states and a total population of approximately 50 million at December 31, 2018.
U.S. Cellular’s business development strategy is to obtain interests in or access to wireless licenses in its current operating markets and in areas that are adjacent to or in close proximity to its other wireless licenses, thereby building larger geographic operating market areas.  U.S. Cellular believes that the acquisition of additional licenses within its current operating markets will enhance its network capacity and speed to meet its customers’ growing demand for data services.  From time to time, U.S. Cellular has divested outright or included in exchanges for other wireless interests certain consolidated and investment interests that were considered less essential to its current and expected future operations.  As part of its business development strategy, U.S. Cellular may periodically be engaged in negotiations relating to the acquisition, exchange or disposition of companies, strategic properties, investment interests or wireless spectrum.
The FCC conducts auctions through which additional spectrum is made available for the provision of wireless services.  Historically, U.S. Cellular has participated in certain FCC auctions both directly and indirectly through its limited partnership interests. At its open meeting on August 2, 2018, the FCC adopted a public notice establishing procedures for two auctions of Millimeter Wave spectrum licenses in the 28 GHz and 24 GHz bands. The 28 GHz auction (Auction 101), which commenced on November 14, 2018 and closed on January 24, 2019, offered two 425 MHz licenses in the 28 GHz band over portions of the United States that do not have incumbent licensees. The 24 GHz auction (Auction 102) will offer up to seven 100 MHz licenses in the 24 GHz band in Partial Economic Areas covering most of the United States. Upfront payments for Auction 102 were due by February 19, 2019, and bidding in Auction 102 is scheduled to begin on March 14, 2019. U.S. Cellular filed applications to participate in both auctions on September 18, 2018, and was announced as a qualified bidder for Auction 101 on October 31, 2018. The FCC has not announced qualified bidders for Auction 102. Also, at the open meeting on August 2, 2018, the FCC adopted a Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in preparation for an additional Millimeter Wave auction offering licenses in the 37, 39 and 47 GHz bands. FCC statements indicate plans to hold this auction in the second half of 2019. The spectrum auctioned in each of these Millimeter Wave auctions is expected to be used primarily to deliver 5G technology. 
Regulation
U.S. Cellular’s operations are subject to federal, state and local regulation.  Key regulatory considerations are discussed below.
U.S. Cellular provides various wireless services, including voice and data services, pursuant to licenses granted by the FCC.  The construction, operation and transfer of wireless systems in the United States are regulated to varying degrees by the FCC pursuant to the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (Communications Act).  The FCC currently does not require wireless carriers to comply with a number of statutory provisions otherwise applicable to common carriers that provide, originate or terminate interstate or international telecommunications.  However, the FCC has enacted regulations governing construction and operation of wireless systems, licensing (including renewal of licenses) and technical standards for the provision of wireless services under the Communications Act.
5

Wireless licenses segmented by geographic areas are granted by the FCC.  The completion of acquisitions, involving the transfer of control of all or a portion of a wireless system, requires prior FCC approval.  The FCC determines on a case-by-case basis whether an acquisition of wireless licenses is in the public interest.  Wireless licenses are granted generally for a ten year term or, in some cases, for a twelve or fifteen year term.  The FCC establishes the standards for conducting comparative renewal proceedings between a wireless license holder seeking renewal of its license and challengers filing competing applications.  All of U.S. Cellular’s licenses for which it applied for renewal since 1995 have been renewed.  U.S. Cellular expects to continue to meet the criteria of the FCC’s license renewal process.
As part of its data services, U.S. Cellular provides internet access.  Such internet access services may be subject to different regulatory requirements than other wireless services.
Although the Communications Act generally pre-empts state and local governments from regulating the entry of, or the rates charged by, wireless carriers, certain state and local governments regulate other terms and conditions of wireless services, including billing, termination of service arrangements, imposition of early termination fees, advertising, network outages, the use of handsets while driving, zoning, land use, privacy, data security and consumer protection.  Further, the Federal Aviation Administration also regulates the siting, lighting and construction of transmitter towers and antennae.
