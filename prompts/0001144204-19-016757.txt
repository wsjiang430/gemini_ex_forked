Item 1.   Business 
Runway Growth Credit Fund Inc. 
 Runway Growth Credit Fund Inc., formerly known as GSV Growth Credit Fund Inc., a Maryland corporation formed on August 31, 2015 (“we,” “us,” “our,” or the “Company”), is structured as an externally managed, non-diversified closed-end management investment company. We are a specialty finance company focused on providing senior secured loans to rapidly growing companies in a variety of industries. Our goal is to create significant value for our stockholders, and the entrepreneurs we support, by providing high growth-potential companies with hybrid debt and equity financing that is more flexible than traditional credit and less dilutive than equity. Our investment objective is to maximize our total return to our stockholders primarily through current income on our loan portfolio, and secondarily through capital appreciation on our warrants and other equity positions. Our offices are in Chicago, Illinois; Woodside, California; and New York, New York. 
 We have elected to be regulated as a business development company (“BDC”) under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (together with the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the “1940 Act”). We have also elected to be treated as regulated investment company (“RIC”) under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), and intend to qualify for treatment as a RIC annually. While we intend to qualify to be treated as a RIC annually, no assurance can be provided that we will be able to maintain our tax treatment as a RIC. For example, we anticipate that we may have difficulty satisfying the asset diversification requirements as we deploy initial capital and build our portfolio. If we fail to qualify for tax treatment as a RIC for any taxable year, we will be subject to corporate-level U.S. federal income tax on any net taxable income for such year. See “— Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations” and “Note 2 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to our financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for more information. 
 From the commencement of investment operations on December 16, 2016, through December 31, 2018, we funded twenty portfolio companies and invested $237.5 million in debt and equity investments, excluding U.S. Treasury Bills. As of December 31, 2018, our debt investment portfolio consisted of 23 debt investments in 17 portfolio companies with an aggregate fair value of $208.5 million while our equity portfolio consisted of 20 warrant positions and one preferred stock position in 19 portfolio companies with an aggregate fair value of $15.7 million. As of December 31, 2018, 100%, or $208.5 million, of our debt investment portfolio at fair value consisted of senior term loans. As of December 31, 2018, our net assets were $167.4 million, and all of our debt investments were secured by all or a portion of the tangible and intangible assets of the applicable portfolio company. The debt investments in our portfolio are generally not rated by any rating agency. If the individual debt investments in our portfolio were rated, they would be rated below “investment grade.” Debt investments that are unrated or rated below investment grade are sometimes referred to as “junk bonds” and have predominantly speculative characteristics with respect to the issuer’s capacity to pay interest and repay principal. 
 For the year ended December 31, 2018, our debt investment portfolio had a dollar-weighted yield of 16.9% (excluding any yield from warrants). The warrants we receive from time to time when making loans to portfolio companies are excluded from the calculation of our dollar-weighted annualized yield because such warrants do not generate any yield since we do not receive dividends or other payments in respect of our outstanding warrants. We calculate the yield on dollar-weighted average debt investments for any period measured as (1) total investment income during the period divided by (2) the average of the fair value of debt investments outstanding on (a) the last day of the calendar month immediately preceding the first day of the period and (b) the last day of each calendar month during the period. The dollar-weighted annualized yield represents the portfolio yield and will be higher than what investors will realize because it does not reflect our expenses or any sales load paid by investors. As of December 31, 2018, our debt investments had a dollar-weighted average outstanding term of four months and a dollar-weighted average remaining term of 36 months. As of December 31, 2018, substantially all of our debt investments had an original committed principal amount of between $6 million and $25 million, repayment terms of between 28 months and 48 months and pay cash interest at annual interest rates of between 11% and 13%.

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 In December 2016, we completed the initial closing of capital commitments (the “Initial Closing”) in our first private offering of shares of common stock to investors (the “Initial Private Offering”) in reliance on exemptions from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (together with the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the “Securities Act”), and other applicable securities laws. The final closing of the Initial Private Offering occurred on December 1, 2017. As of December 31, 2018, in connection with the Initial Private Offering, the Company had total capital commitments of $275,000,000 and had issued 10,664,004 shares of our common stock to stockholders for a total purchase price of $160,000,000. We expect to operate as a “private” BDC while we invest the proceeds of the Initial Private Offering and any future private offerings of our securities, after which, if market conditions are favorable, we plan to give our stockholders the opportunity to elect to participate in a Spin-Off transaction or seek other liquidity options for our stockholders, as further discussed in “— Investor Optionality; Potential Spin-Offs”. 
 We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, as amended (the “JOBS Act”). We could remain an emerging growth company until the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of an initial public offering (“IPO”), if any, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenue of $1,070,000,000 or more, (ii) December 31 of the fiscal year in which we become a “large accelerated filer” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (together with the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the “Exchange Act”), (which would occur if the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $700.0 million, measured as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, and we have been publicly reporting for at least 12 months), or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three-year period. For so long as we remain an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act, we will be subject to reduced public company reporting requirements. 
 Our investment activities are managed by our external investment adviser, Runway Growth Capital LLC (“RGC”). Runway Administrator Services LLC (the “Administrator”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of RGC, provides all administrative services necessary for us to operate. 
 About RGC

 ​
 Investment Committee 
 RGC’s investment committee (the “Investment Committee”) consists of R. David Spreng, who is its chairman and our President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of our Board of Directors, Thomas B. Raterman, our Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Secretary, Greg Greifeld, Managing Director and Head of Credit at RGC, and Brian Laibow, OCM Growth Holdings, LLC’s appointee. The Investment Committee meets regularly to consider our investments, review our strategic initiatives and supervise the actions taken by RGC on our behalf. In addition, the Investment Committee reviews and monitors the performance of our investment portfolio. Each investment must be approved by a majority of the

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 Investment Committee. In addition, Mr. Spreng, as chairman of the Investment Committee, has the right to veto the approval of any investment, and any investment by us that is outside of certain agreed upon investment criteria requires the affirmative vote of OCM Growth Holdings, LLC’s appointee to the Investment Committee. See “— Oaktree Strategic Relationship” below for more information. 
Board Approval of the Amended Advisory Agreement 
 Our Board of Directors, including a majority of the directors who were not “interested persons,” as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act, of us or RGC, approved the Amended Advisory Agreement at an in-person meeting on August 3, 2017 and recommended that our stockholders approve the Amended Advisory Agreement. In its consideration of the approval of the Amended Advisory Agreement, our Board of Directors focused on information it had received relating to, among other things: 
 •

 the nature, quality and extent of the advisory and other services provided to us by RGC under the terms of the previous investment advisory agreement between us and RGC, which was effective from December 15, 2016 until September 12, 2017 (the “Prior Advisory Agreement”), and to be provided under the terms of the Amended Advisory Agreement; 
 ​
 •

 our investment performance and the investment performance of RGC; 
 ​
 •

 comparative data with respect to advisory fees or similar expenses paid by other BDCs with similar investment objectives; 
 ​
 •

 information about the services being performed and the personnel performing such services under the Prior Advisory Agreement and to be performed under the Amended Advisory Agreement; 
 ​
 •

 our projected operating expenses and expense ratio compared to BDCs with similar investment objectives, including expenses related to investment due diligence, travel and investigating and monitoring investments; 
 ​
 •

 any existing and potential sources of indirect income to RGC from its relationship with us and RGC’s profitability; and 
 ​
 •

 the extent to which economies of scale would be realized as we grow and whether fee levels reflect these economies of scale for the benefit of our stockholders. 
 ​
 Our Board of Directors did not quantify, rank or otherwise assign relative weights to the specific factors it considered in reaching its decision. Our Board of Directors did not undertake to make any specific determination as to whether any particular factor, or any aspect of any particular factor, was favorable or unfavorable to its ultimate determination. Rather, our Board of Directors based its approval on the totality of information presented to, and the investigation conducted by, it. In considering the factors discussed above, individual directors may have given different weights to different factors. Based on its review of the above-mentioned factors and discussion of the Amended Advisory Agreement, our Board of Directors approved the Amended Advisory Agreement as being in our and our stockholders’ best interests. The Amended Advisory Agreement became effective on September 12, 2017, after approval by our stockholders at a special meeting of stockholders. 
 Duration and Termination 
 Unless terminated earlier as described below, the Amended Advisory Agreement will continue in effect for a period of two years from its effective date of September 12, 2017. Thereafter, the Amended Advisory Agreement will continue automatically for successive annual periods provided that such continuance is specifically approved at least annually by (i) (A) the affirmative vote of a majority of our Board of Directors or (B) the affirmative vote of a majority of our outstanding voting securities, and (ii) the affirmative vote of a majority of our directors who are not “interested persons,” as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act, of us, RGC or our respective affiliates. The Amended Advisory Agreement automatically terminates in the event of its assignment, as defined in the 1940 Act, and may be terminated, without penalty, upon not more than 60 days’ written notice, by (i) the affirmative vote of a majority of our outstanding voting securities, (ii) the affirmative vote of a majority of our Board of Directors, including a majority of our directors who are not “interested persons,” as defined in

 Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act, of us, RGC or our respective affiliates, or (iii) RGC. See “Risk Factors — Risks Related to our Business and Structure — RGC and our Administrator have the right to resign upon not more than 60 days’ notice, and we may not be able to find a suitable replacement for either within that time, or at all, resulting in a disruption in our operations that could adversely affect our financial condition, business and results of operations” in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K. 
About Our Administrator 
 We have entered into the Administration Agreement with our Administrator, a wholly-owned subsidiary of RGC, pursuant to which our Administrator is responsible for furnishing us with office facilities and equipment and provides us with clerical, bookkeeping, recordkeeping and other administrative services at such facilities. Pursuant to the Administration Agreement, we pay our Administrator an amount equal to our allocable portion (subject to the review of our Board of Directors) of our Administrator’s overhead resulting from its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including rent and the allocable portion of the cost of our Chief Compliance Officer and Chief Financial Officer and their respective staffs associated with performing compliance functions. Pursuant to the terms of the Administration Agreement, the amounts payable to the Administrator from us in any fiscal year will not exceed the greater of (i) 0.75% of the aggregate capital commitments as of the end of the most recently completed fiscal year and (ii) $1.0 million. 
Oaktree Strategic Relationship 
 In December 2016, we and RGC entered into a strategic relationship with Oaktree Capital Management, L.P. (“Oaktree”). Oaktree is a leading global alternative investment management firm with expertise in credit strategies. The firm was formed in 1995 by a group of individuals who had been investing together since the mid-1980s in high yield bonds, convertible securities, distressed debt, real estate, control investments and listed equities. Oaktree is a leader among global investment managers specializing in alternative investments, with $120 billion in assets under management as of December 31, 2018. The firm emphasizes an opportunistic, value-oriented and risk-controlled approach to investments in credit, private equity, real assets and listed equities. The firm has over 950 employees and offices in 18 cities worldwide. 
 In connection with the strategic relationship, OCM Growth Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“OCM”) managed by Oaktree, made an initial $125 million capital commitment to us, which was subsequently increased to $139 million (the “OCM Commitment”). OCM has granted a proxy to us pursuant to which the shares held by OCM will be voted in the same proportion as our other stockholders vote their shares. 
 In connection with the OCM Commitment, we entered into a stockholder agreement, dated December 15, 2016, with OCM pursuant to which OCM has a right to nominate a member of our Board of Directors for election. Brian Laibow was appointed to our Board of Directors, effective January 25, 2017, as OCM’s representative. OCM also holds an interest in RGC and has the right to appoint a member of RGC’s board of managers and a member of the Investment Committee. OCM’s initial appointee to RGC’s board of managers and Investment Committee is Brian Laibow. 
 We believe that our strategic relationship with Oaktree will provide us with access to additional resources and investment opportunities by expanding our network of relationships with venture backed companies. RGC expects to continue to draw upon Oaktree’s over 20-year history in the investment management business and to continue to benefit from Oaktree’s investment professionals’ significant credit expertise developed through investments in different industries and over numerous companies in the United States. In addition, we expect to utilize Oaktree’s relationships to gain better access to leverage facilities with better terms and provisions than we would otherwise be able to obtain. 
 Investor Liquidity Options 
 At any time after the third anniversary of the Initial Closing, we will offer our stockholders the option to elect to either (i) retain their ownership of shares of our common stock; or (ii) exchange their shares of our common stock for shares of common stock in a newly formed entity (the “Public Fund”) that will elect to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act and treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code, and 

 5

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 will use its commercially reasonable best efforts to complete an IPO of shares of its common stock not later than three years after the final closing of the Initial Private Offering, which occurred on December 1, 2017 provided, however, in no event will a stockholder be obligated to exchange his, her or its shares of our common stock for shares of common stock in the Public Fund. In order to effectuate these options, we expect that we would need to, among other things, transfer to the Public Fund, in exchange for newly issued shares of the Public Fund, a pro rata portion of our assets and liabilities attributable to the investors that have elected to invest in the Public Fund (such transfer of assets and liabilities and the mechanics relating thereto are referred to herein as the “Spin-Off transaction”). 
 We may exclude any stockholder from participating in the Spin-Off transaction if, in our reasonable discretion, there is a substantial likelihood that such stockholder’s exchange of shares of our common stock at such time would cause us or the Public Fund to (i) be in violation of, or noncompliance with, any law or regulation to which such entity is or would be subject or (ii) be deemed to hold “plan assets” under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”) or Section 4975 of the Code because the investments of “benefit plan investors” (within the meaning of Section 3(42) of ERISA and certain Department of Labor (“DOL”) regulations (such investors referred to herein as “Benefit Plan Investors”)) are deemed to be significant. 
 Because RGC would be managing both us and the Public Fund in connection with any Spin-Off transaction, and the 1940 Act prohibits entities under common control from engaging in certain transactions, we will likely be required to obtain exemptive and/or no-action relief from the SEC to permit us to transfer assets to a Public Fund, as well as with respect to other aspects relating to the Spin-Off transaction, including the calculation of incentive fee to be paid by us in connection with a Spin-Off transaction. We and RGC have applied for exemptive relief from the SEC to permit us to transfer assets to a Public Fund, as well as with respect to other aspects relating to the Spin-Off transaction, including the calculation of incentive fee to be paid by us in connection with a Spin-Off transaction, and we have received preliminary comments from the SEC. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such exemptive and/or no-action relief from the SEC. If we are unable to do so, then we will continue our operations in the manner otherwise set forth in this annual report on Form 10-K and our public filings with the SEC. 
 From time to time, we may also offer to repurchase a portion of our shares of common stock outstanding from stockholders. If we elect to offer to repurchase a portion of our shares of common stock outstanding, we expect that only a limited number of shares will be eligible for repurchase from stockholders. In addition, any such repurchases will be subject to applicable restrictions and requirements under the federal securities laws and the 1940 Act, will be at a price equal to our most recently determined net asset value per share, which may be at a discount to the price at which a stockholder purchased shares of common stock, and may be subject to any applicable lock-up period. 
 We may also make an alternative trading system (the “Trading Platform”) operated by The Nasdaq Private Market, LLC or its affiliates available to stockholders. It is anticipated that stockholders would be able to access such a Trading Platform to identify available secondary trading opportunities. Secondary trading on the Trading Platform, if available, will be subject to applicable law and would be restricted solely to accredited investors and subject to any applicable lock-up period. Stockholders who access the Trading Platform would be subject to certain transaction fees that will not be reimbursed by us or by RGC. 
 Investment Strategy and Approach 
 Our investment objective is to maximize our total return to our stockholders primarily through current income on our loan portfolio, and secondarily through capital appreciation on our warrants and other equity positions. Through our Sponsored Growth Lending and Non-Sponsored Growth Lending strategies, we invest in senior secured loans and second lien loans. We also expect to acquire equity securities in connection with our investments in secured loans. We expect to build a balanced portfolio with diversification among sponsored and non-sponsored transactions, diversification among sponsors within the sponsored segment, diversification among industry, geography, and stage of development, all contributing to a favorable risk adjusted return for the portfolio viewed as a whole. As we build our portfolio to scale, the effects of our diversification strategy on yield and other metrics may not be fully evident, and the impact of various weightings may be more pronounced from period to period until we achieve greater scale in our portfolio.

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 We typically invest in what we believe to be high growth-potential, private companies. We primarily originate our own investments in the debt and, to a lesser extent, equity of our portfolio companies and utilize a disciplined approach to providing growth capital to these companies. The types of loans in which we typically invest are senior secured and second lien secured loans, which generally fall into two strategies: Sponsored Growth Lending and Non-Sponsored Growth Lending. 
  Sponsored Growth Lending.   Our Sponsored Growth Lending generally includes loans to companies that are already backed by established venture capital and private equity firms. Our Sponsored Growth Lending typically includes the receipt of warrants and/or other equity from the venture-backed companies. We refer to these target borrowers as “venture-backed companies.” We target venture-backed companies at all stages of development, with a bias towards later-stage, including those that are pre-revenue. To a limited extent, we also selectively lend to publicly traded companies with venture capital ownership. We focus on lending to companies focused in technology, life sciences, healthcare information and services, business services and other high-growth industries. The technology sectors we focus on include communications, networking, data storage, software, cloud computing, semiconductor, power management, internet and media and consumer-related technologies. The life science sectors we focus on include biotechnology, drug discovery, drug delivery, bioinformatics and medical devices. The healthcare information and services sectors we focus on include diagnostics, medical-record services and software and other healthcare-related services and technologies that improve efficiency and quality of administered healthcare. 
 We believe that the Sponsored Growth Lending strategy we follow is particularly attractive because the loans have high yields and additional equity upside. Investors may receive significant current income while gaining access to equity upside in companies that are often backed by the nation’s top-tier and other respected venture capital investors. We believe our Sponsored Growth Lending strategy typically: 
 •

 provides us access to many high-quality companies backed by top-tier investors; 
 ​
 •

 delivers consistent returns through double-digit loan yields; and 
 ​
 •

 participates in equity upside via warrants. 
 ​
  Non-Sponsored Growth Lending.   Our Non-Sponsored Growth Lending generally includes loans to fast-growing private companies that are not backed by a professional equity investor sponsor, a venture capital firm or a private equity firm or are funded by entrepreneurs themselves or no longer require institutional equity investment, including publicly traded small-cap companies. We refer to these target borrowers as “non-sponsored growth companies.” As opposed to Sponsored Growth Lending, in the case of Non-Sponsored Growth Lending, we generally intend to target companies with annual revenue of at least $20 million per year. To a limited extent, we also selectively provide non-sponsored growth loans to publicly traded companies. 
 We believe that our lending approach significantly reduces the volatility inherent in financing emerging-growth companies. 
 We believe the following attributes, which we expect to be included in most of the loans of our investment strategies, present an attractive risk profile: 
 •

 meaningful amortization over the life of each loan and short to medium loan term; 
 ​
 •

 a low ratio of leverage to enterprise value; and 
 ​
 •

 a secured collateral position. 
 ​
 We believe there are significant barriers to entry in providing sponsored growth lending and non-sponsored growth lending, which results in an environment with a limited number of competitors. In particular, we believe we will be able to capitalize on the following crucial elements for success in the private growth company lending market: 
 •

 relationships with top-tier and other respected venture capital investors, growth company entrepreneurs, and other deal referral sources; 
 ​
 •

 reputation as a reliable, supportive, and value-added partner; 
 ​

​
  7

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 •

 ability to accurately determine credit risk and gauge warrant potential; and 
 ​
 •

 experience in the unique aspects of growth company debt pricing, structure, portfolio construction and management. 
 ​
 The above attributes are not easily acquired and take years to establish. We believe RGC’s experienced, disciplined, and cohesive investment team possesses these necessary capabilities. 
 In addition to our core strategy of providing sponsored growth lending and non-sponsored growth lending, we may also opportunistically participate in the secondary markets for sponsored growth lending and non-sponsored growth lending. 
 Typical attributes of our Sponsored Growth Lending and Non-Sponsored Growth Lending are as follows: 
 •

 loan-size ranges from $5 million to $30 million; 
 ​
 •

 short total repayment periods: typically, 36 to 60 months or less; 
 ​
 •

 may provide for interest-only or moderate loan amortization in the initial period of the loan; 
 ​
 •

 unlevered yield-to-maturity (i.e., the total return anticipated on a debt investment if it is held until maturity) generally ranging from 10% to 14%, which may include current interest payments, revenue participation, upfront and facility fees, an end-of-term payment and/or a payment-in-kind (“PIK”) interest payment; 
 ​
 •

 warrants to acquire preferred or common stock in the prospective borrower that allow us to participate in any equity appreciation and enhance our overall returns; 
 ​
 •

 senior secured lien on the borrower’s assets, including a pledge on or a promise by the borrower to not pledge the borrower’s intellectual property to another individual or lender; and 
 ​
 •

 limited and/or flexible covenant structures and, with certain affirmative and negative covenants, default penalties, lien protection, investor abandonment provisions, material adverse change provisions, change-of-control provisions, restrictions on additional use of leverage, and reimbursement for upfront and regular internal and third-party expenses and prepayment penalties. 
 ​
 Market Opportunity 
 Our target market consists of companies that combine experienced management and an emphasis on rapid growth in large markets.
  Diversified high growth-potential industries:   We target companies active in industries that support extremely rapid growth. Our Sponsored Growth Lending strategy is focused on industry sectors where venture capital investors are active, primarily technology, life sciences, healthcare information and services, business services and other high-growth industries. High-potential companies in sectors such as technology, life sciences, healthcare information and services and business services represent a large and fast-growing sector of the U.S. economy. This sector’s continued growth is supported by ongoing innovation and performance improvements in specific products as well as the adoption of innovative technologies and services across virtually all industries in response to competitive pressures. Term debt has been used by many of the largest, most successful venture-backed companies. For example, both Google and Facebook utilized term debt in their capital structures. Our Non-Sponsored Growth Lending strategy is not targeted at any specific industry sector, although we do intend to avoid restaurants, retail and real estate. 
  Sponsored Growth Lending:   An attractive market opportunity exists for a lender that invests in secured loans to high-potential companies that have not yet achieved profitability as there are strong incentives for borrowers and lenders in this market to transact with one another.

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 Sponsored growth lending provides an attractive source of funds for venture-backed companies, their management teams, and their equity capital investors, as it: 
 •

 is typically less dilutive and complements equity financing from venture capital and private equity funds; 
 ​
 •

 extends the time period during which a company can operate before seeking additional equity capital or pursuing a sale transaction or other liquidity event; and 
 ​
 •

 allows companies to better match cash sources with uses. 
 ​
 Potential benefits to sponsored growth lenders include: 
 •

 loan support in the form of cash proceeds from equity capital invested by venture capital and private equity firms with the goal of building enterprise value; 
 ​
 •

 interest rates that are usually higher than rates portfolio companies could secure if they could borrow from commercial financing institutions, which normally require asset coverage and operating cash flow covenants; 
 ​
 •

 relatively rapid amortization of loans; 
 ​
 •

 senior ranking to equity and collateralization of loans to minimize potential loss of capital; and 
 ​
 •

 potential equity appreciation through warrants. 
 ​
  Non-Sponsored Growth Lending:   An attractive market opportunity exists for a lender that invests in secured loans to high-potential companies that are growing rapidly, have reached profitability and need long-term growth capital but do not want the complications that come with selling equity to venture capital or private equity firms. 
 Non-sponsored growth lending provides an attractive alternative to equity capital as a source of funds for non-sponsored, high-potential, fast-growing companies, as it provides all or some of the following benefits: 
 •

 access to growth capital without the requirement to take on institutional-size investments that may exceed the company’s capital requirements; 
 ​
 •

 tax deductible interest payments; 
 ​
 •

 no significant operational involvement; 
 ​
 •

 no personal guarantees; 
 ​
 •

 very modest dilution, if any; and 
 ​
 •

 no loss of managerial control or forced redemption. 
 ​
 Capital Market Dynamics Creating More Opportunities for Sponsored Growth Lending
  Healthy, stable venture environment:   The number of companies receiving venture capital financing in 2018 was 8,948, according to the National Venture Capital Association (“NVCA”), and roughly 24.0% of these transactions were first-round financings. The number of financings has averaged over 8,200 for the past ten years, and during this period slightly over one-third of these transactions were first time financings. The annual level of venture investment since 2002 has generally been in the $20- to $40- billion range with a significant increase to $71.0 billion in 2014. Increased venture investment has continued to trend upward since 2014. Venture investment totaled $83.0 billion in 2015, $77.2 billion in 2016 and $83.0 billion in 2017. 2018 marked a record year, with $130.9 billion in venture investment. We believe this activity is evidence of a healthy, stable venture environment where venture capital investment is consistently flowing into high technology-related companies. The significant increase in investment amount in 2014 – 2018 is largely the result of growth investments in later-stage companies that are staying private longer. The sponsored growth lending market is estimated to be one-seventh of venture investment activity in any given year, translating to a market for loan origination of over $18 billion based on an average year of venture funding of

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 approximately $130 billion.1 We believe that these statistics validate a substantial market opportunity and simultaneously support availability of capital for repayment. Based on our experience, many sponsored-growth loans are repaid from proceeds of new venture-equity financing. 
  Growing pool of target companies:   The average time from initial venture capital investment to exit, either by IPO or M&A transaction, has lengthened considerably. According to the NVCA 2015 Yearbook, in 1998 the average number of years from initial venture investment to IPO of a U.S. venture capital-backed company was approximately three years; that number has steadily increased and has been approximately eight years since 2012.2 According to the 2018 Pitchbook NVCA Q4-2018 Venture Monitor, the median time to exit is now 5.3 years. Exits are a small (10 – 20%) proportion of companies financed by venture capital each year, and are on average less than 50% of the number of companies receiving initial funding. As a result, the pool of target companies has grown larger. 
  Venture investment consistently outstripping venture commitments:   According to the NVCA, in 2018, $55 billion was raised by 256 funds, compared to $131 billion invested in the same year. 2018 was the thirteenth year in which more money was invested by the industry than raised in new commitments; in fact, this ratio has been in place for seventeen out of the past nineteen years. This dynamic has created a strong interest in raising new venture funds; however, the fact that companies receiving venture equity investment have taken longer to achieve liquidity than similar companies a decade earlier has led to cautious investing, as traditional investors in limited partnership funds are hesitant to commit to new funds until older commitments are returned. As a result, venture capital firms continue to supplement their investment in equity capital with sponsored growth lending in many of their best portfolio companies. Sponsored growth lending is now a valued component in the capital structure of most venture-backed companies. 
  Limited competition:   Many viable venture-backed companies have been unable to obtain sufficient growth financing from traditional lenders, such as commercial banks or asset-based finance companies, because traditional lenders normally underwrite to tangible asset values and/or operating cash flows. If such firms do provide financing, their loans normally contain financial performance covenants stipulating tangible asset coverages or setting standards of operating performance that do not apply to our target companies. Because sponsored growth lending and non-sponsored growth lending require specialized underwriting and investment structures that fit the distinct characteristics of venture-backed companies and non-sponsored growth companies, more traditional lending approaches largely do not apply to these companies. 
 Competition 
 Our primary competitors for investments include public and private funds, other BDCs, commercial and investment banks, venture-oriented commercial banks, commercial financing companies and, to the extent they provide an alternative form of financing, private equity and hedge funds. Many of our competitors are substantially larger and have considerably greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. For example, we believe some competitors may have access to funding sources that are not available to us. In addition, some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments and establish more relationships than us. Furthermore, many of our competitors are not subject to the regulatory restrictions that the 1940 Act imposes on us as a BDC or to the distribution and other requirements we must satisfy to qualify and maintain our qualification as a RIC. 
 We do not compete primarily on the financing terms we offer and believe that some competitors make loans with rates that are comparable to or lower than our rates. We also believe that our relationship-based approach to investing, which leverages the expertise of the Investment Committee in developing strong relationships with venture capital investors and venture capital-backed companies, helps us to assess investment risks and determine appropriate pricing for our investments in portfolio companies. In addition, we expect that the relationships of RGC’s senior investment professionals will enable us to learn about, and

 compete effectively for, financing opportunities with attractive companies in the industries in which we seek to invest.

Dividend Reinvestment Plan 
 We have adopted a dividend reinvestment plan that provides for reinvestment of our dividends and other distributions on behalf of our stockholders, unless a stockholder elects to receive cash as provided below. As a result of adopting such a plan, if our Board of Directors authorizes, and we declare, a cash dividend or distribution, our stockholders who have not opted out of our dividend reinvestment plan will have their cash dividends or distributions automatically reinvested in additional shares of our common stock, rather than receiving cash. 
 No action will be required on the part of a registered stockholder to have his or her cash dividends and distributions reinvested in shares of our common stock. A registered stockholder could instead elect to receive a dividend or distribution in cash by notifying RGC in writing, so that such notice is received by RGC no later than ten days prior to the record date for distributions to the stockholders. RGC will set up an account for shares of our common stock acquired through the plan for each stockholder who does not elect to receive dividends and distributions in cash and hold such shares in non-certificated form. Those stockholders whose shares are held by a broker or other financial intermediary could receive dividends and distributions in cash by notifying their broker or other financial intermediary of their election. 
 Stockholders who receive dividends and distributions in the form of stock are generally subject to the same U.S. federal, state and local tax consequences as are stockholders who elect to receive their dividends and distributions in cash. However, since a participating stockholder’s cash dividends and distributions will be reinvested in our common stock, such stockholder will not receive cash with which to pay applicable taxes on reinvested dividends and distributions. A stockholder’s basis for determining gain or loss upon the sale of stock received in a dividend or distribution from us will generally be equal to the cash that would have been received if the stockholder had received the dividend or distribution in cash, unless we were to issue new shares that are trading at or above net asset value, in which case, the stockholder’s basis in the new shares will generally be equal to their fair market value. Any stock received in a dividend or distribution will have a new holding period for tax purposes commencing on the day following the day on which the shares are credited to the U.S. stockholder’s account. 
 Staffing 
 We do not currently have any employees. R. David Spreng, our President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of our Board of Directors, is also the founder, President, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Investment Officer of RGC. Thomas B. Raterman is our Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer, and Secretary, and serves as the Chief Financial Officer of RGC. Our Chief Financial Officer performs his functions for us under the terms of our Administration Agreement. We have also retained Carl Rizzo of Alaric Compliance Services LLC to serve as our Chief Compliance Officer pursuant to an agreement with Alaric Compliance Services LLC. Mr. Rizzo also serves as the Chief Compliance Officer for RGC. 
 Our day-to-day investment and administrative operations are managed by RGC and our Administrator. The Investment Committee is supported by a team of additional experienced investment professionals. RGC and our Administrator may hire additional investment and administrative professionals in the future to provide services to us, based upon our needs. 
 In addition, we reimburse the Administrator for its costs and expenses and our allocable portion of overhead incurred by it in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including compensation paid to or compensatory distributions received by our officers (including our Chief Compliance Officer and Chief Financial Officer) and any of their respective staff who provide services to us, operations staff who provide services to us, and any internal audit staff, to the extent internal audit performs a role in our internal control assessment under Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”).

 Implications of Being an Emerging Growth Company 
 We currently are, and expect to remain, an “emerging growth company,” as that term is used in the JOBS Act until the earliest of: 
 •

 the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of IPO, if any; 
 ​
 •

 the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues of $1,070,000,000 or more; 
 ​
 •

 the date on which we have, during the preceding three-year period, issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt; and 
 ​
 •

 the date that we become a “large accelerated filer” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, which would occur if the market value of the common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of any June 30. 
 ​
 Under the JOBS Act, we are exempt from the provisions of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which would require that our independent registered public accounting firm provide an attestation report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. This may increase the risk that material weaknesses or other deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting go undetected. See Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Business and Structure — We are obligated to maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting. Failure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could have a material adverse effect on our business and the value of our common stock.” 
 Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations 
 The following discussion is a general summary of the material U.S. federal income tax considerations applicable to us and to an investment in shares of our common stock. This discussion is based on the provisions of the Code and the regulations of the U.S. Department of Treasury promulgated thereunder, or “Treasury regulations,” each as in effect as of the date of this Form 10-K. 
 These provisions are subject to differing interpretations and change by legislative or administrative action, and any change may be retroactive. This discussion does not constitute a detailed explanation of all U.S. federal income tax aspects affecting us and our stockholders and does not purport to deal with the U.S. federal income tax consequences that may be important to particular stockholders in light of their individual investment circumstances or to some types of stockholders subject to special tax rules, such as financial institutions, broker dealers, insurance companies, tax-exempt organizations, partnerships or other pass-through entities, persons holding our common stock in connection with a hedging, straddle, conversion or other integrated transaction, non-U.S. stockholders (as defined below) engaged in a trade or business in the United States, persons who have ceased to be U.S. citizens or to be taxed as resident aliens or individual non-U.S. stockholders present in the United States for 183 days or more during a taxable year. This discussion also does not address any aspects of U.S. estate or gift tax or foreign, state or local tax. This discussion assumes that our stockholders hold their shares of our common stock as capital assets for U.S. federal income tax purposes (generally, assets held for investment). No ruling has been or will be sought from the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) regarding any matter discussed herein. 
 A “U.S. stockholder” is a beneficial owner of shares of our common stock that is for U.S. federal income tax purposes: 
 •

 an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States; 
 ​
 •

 a corporation created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state therein or the District of Columbia; 
 ​
 •

 an estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or 
 ​
 •

 a trust if a court within the United States can exercise primary jurisdiction over the administration of the trust and one or more U.S. persons have authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust. 
 ​

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 A “non-U.S. stockholder” means a beneficial owner of shares of our common stock that is for U.S. federal income tax purposes: 
 •

 a nonresident alien individual; 
 ​
 •

 a foreign corporation; or 
 ​
 •

 a foreign estate or trust. 
 ​
 If a partnership or other entity classified as a partnership, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, holds our shares, the U.S. tax treatment of the partnership and each partner generally will depend on the status of the partner, the activities of the partnership and certain determinations made at the partner level. A partnership considering an investment in our common stock should consult its own tax advisers regarding the U.S. federal income tax consequences of the acquisition, ownership and disposition of shares by the partnership. 
 Taxation of the Company 
 We have elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code for 2017 and intend to qualify for treatment as a RIC annually. As a RIC, we generally will not pay corporate-level federal income taxes on any ordinary income or capital gains that we timely distribute to our stockholders as dividends. 
 To qualify as a RIC, we must, among other things:
 •

 meet the annual distribution requirements;
 ​
 •

 derive in each taxable year at least 90% of our gross income from dividends, interest, payments with respect to certain securities loans, gains from the sale or other disposition of stock, securities or foreign currencies, other income derived with respect to our business of investing in stock, securities or currencies, or net income derived from an interest in a “qualified publicly traded partnership,” or “QPTP,” hereinafter the “90% Gross Income Test;” and 
 ​
 •

 diversify our holdings so that, at the end of each quarter of each taxable year: 
 ​
 •

 at least 50% of the value of our total assets is represented by cash and cash items, U.S. Government securities, the securities of other RICs and other securities, with other securities limited, in respect of any one issuer, to an amount not greater than 5% of the value of our total assets and not more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of such issuer, and 
 ​
 •

 not more than 25% of the value of our total assets is invested in the securities of any issuer (other than U.S. Government securities and the securities of other RICs), the securities of any two or more issuers that we control and that are determined to be engaged in the same business or similar or related trades or businesses, or the securities of one or more QPTPs, or the “Diversification Tests.” 
 ​
 In the case of a RIC that furnishes capital to development corporations, there is an exception relating to the Diversification Tests described above. This exception is available only to RICs which the SEC determines to be principally engaged in the furnishing of capital to other corporations which are principally engaged in the development or exploitation of inventions, technological improvements, new processes, or products not previously generally available (“SEC Certification”). We have not sought SEC Certification, but it is possible that we may seek SEC Certification in future years. If we receive SEC Certification, we generally will be entitled to include, in the computation of the 50% value of our assets (described above), the value of any securities of an issuer, whether or not we own more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of the issuer, if the basis of the securities, when added to our basis of any other securities of the issuer that we own, does not exceed 5% of the value of our total assets. 
 As a RIC, we (but not our stockholders) are generally not subject to U.S. federal income tax on investment company taxable income and net capital gains that we distribute to our stockholders in any taxable year with respect to which we distribute an amount equal to at least 90% of the sum of our (i) investment company taxable income (which includes, among other items, dividends, interest and the excess of any net realized short-term capital gains over net realized long-term capital losses and other 

 13

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 taxable income (other than any net capital gain), reduced by deductible expenses) determined without regard to the deduction for dividends and distributions paid and (ii) net tax-exempt interest income (which is the excess of our gross tax-exempt interest income over certain disallowed deductions), or the “Annual Distribution Requirement.” We intend to distribute annually all or substantially all of such income. Generally, if we fail to meet this Annual Distribution Requirement for any taxable year, we will fail to qualify for tax treatment as a RIC for such taxable year. To the extent we meet the Annual Distribution Requirement for a taxable year, but retain our net capital gains for investment or any investment company taxable income, we will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on such retained capital gains and investment company taxable income. We may choose to retain our net capital gains for investment or any investment company taxable income, and pay the associated federal corporate income tax, including the 4% U.S. federal excise tax described below. 
 We are subject to a nondeductible 4% U.S. federal excise tax on certain of our undistributed income, unless we timely distribute (or are deemed to have timely distributed) an amount equal to the sum of: 
 •

 at least 98% of our ordinary income (not taking into account any capital gains or losses) for the calendar year; 
 ​
 •

 at least 98.2% of the amount by which our capital gains exceed our capital losses (adjusted for certain ordinary losses) for a one-year period generally ending on October 31 of the calendar year (unless an election is made by us to use our taxable year); and 
 ​
 •

 certain undistributed amounts from previous years on which we paid no U.S. federal income tax. 
 ​
 While we intend to distribute any income and capital gains in order to avoid imposition of this 4% U.S. federal excise tax, we may not be successful in avoiding entirely the imposition of this tax. In that case, we will be liable for the tax only on the amount by which we do not meet the foregoing distribution requirement. 
 We are authorized to borrow funds and to sell assets in order to satisfy distribution requirements. However, under the 1940 Act, we are not permitted to make distributions to our stockholders while any senior securities are outstanding unless we meet the applicable asset coverage ratios. See “— Regulation as a Business Development Company — Senior Securities.” Moreover, our ability to dispose of assets to meet our distribution requirements may be limited by (1) the illiquid nature of our portfolio and/or (2) other requirements relating to our status as a RIC, including the Diversification Tests. If we dispose of assets in order to meet the Annual Distribution Requirement or to avoid the 4% U.S. federal excise tax, we may make such dispositions at times that, from an investment standpoint, are not advantageous. 
 A RIC is limited in its ability to deduct expenses in excess of its “investment company taxable income” (which is, generally, ordinary income plus the excess of net short-term capital gains over net long-term capital losses). If our expenses in a given year exceed investment company taxable income, we would experience a net operating loss for that year. However, a RIC is not permitted to carry forward net operating losses to subsequent years. In addition, expenses can be used only to offset investment company taxable income, not net capital gain. Due to these limits on the deductibility of expenses, we may, for tax purposes, have aggregate taxable income for several years that we are required to distribute and that is taxable to our stockholders even if such income is greater than the aggregate net income we actually earned during those years. Such required distributions may be made from our cash assets or by liquidation of investments, if necessary. We may realize gains or losses from such liquidations. In the event we realize net capital gains from such transactions, stockholders may receive a larger capital gain distribution than they would have received in the absence of such transactions. 
 Failure to Qualify as a RIC 
 While we have elected, and expect to qualify, to be treated as a RIC for 2018 and intend to qualify to be treated as a RIC annually, no assurance can be provided that we will qualify for tax treatment as a RIC for any taxable year. For example, we anticipate that we may have difficulty satisfying the Diversification Tests as we deploy initial capital and build our portfolio. In addition, we may have difficulty satisfying the diversification requirements after the consummation of the initial Spin-Off transaction if we decide to liquidate our portfolio since we will not be making additional investments. While we generally will not lose 

 14

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 our status as a RIC as long as we do not acquire any non-qualifying securities or other property, under certain circumstances we may be deemed to have made an acquisition of non-qualifying securities or other property. If we have previously qualified as a RIC, but were subsequently unable to qualify for treatment as a RIC, and certain amelioration provisions are not applicable, we would be subject to tax on all of our taxable income (including our net capital gains) at regular corporate rates. We would not be able to deduct distributions to stockholders, nor would we be required to make distributions. Distributions, including distributions of net long-term capital gain, would generally be taxable to our stockholders as ordinary dividend income to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits. Subject to certain limitations under the Code, corporate stockholders would be eligible to claim a dividend received deduction with respect to such dividend; non-corporate stockholders would generally be able to treat such dividends as “qualified dividend income,” which is subject to reduced rates of U.S. federal income tax. Distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits would be treated first as a return of capital to the extent of the stockholder’s tax basis, and any remaining distributions would be treated as a capital gain. In order to requalify as a RIC, in addition to the other requirements discussed above, we would be required to distribute all of our previously undistributed earnings attributable to the period we failed to qualify as a RIC by the end of the first year that we intend to requalify as a RIC. If we fail to requalify as a RIC for a period greater than two taxable years, we may be subject to regular corporate tax on any net built-in gains with respect to certain of our assets (i.e., the excess of the aggregate gains, including items of income, over aggregate losses that would have been realized with respect to such assets if we had been liquidated) that we elect to recognize on requalification or when recognized over the next five years. 
 The remainder of this discussion assumes that we qualify as a RIC for each taxable year. 
 Company Investments 
 Certain of our investment practices are subject to special and complex U.S. federal income tax provisions that may, among other things, (i) disallow, suspend or otherwise limit the allowance of certain losses or deductions, including the dividends received deduction, (ii) convert lower taxed long-term capital gains and qualified dividend income into higher taxed short-term capital gains or ordinary income, (iii) convert ordinary loss or a deduction into capital loss (the deductibility of which is more limited), (iv) cause us to recognize income or gain without a corresponding receipt of cash, (v) adversely affect the time as to when a purchase or sale of stock or securities is deemed to occur, (vi) adversely alter the characterization of certain complex financial transactions and (vii) produce income that will not qualify as good income for purposes of the 90% Gross Income Test. We monitor our transactions and may make certain tax elections and may be required to borrow money or dispose of securities to mitigate the effect of these rules and to prevent disqualification of us as a RIC but there can be no assurance that we will be successful in this regard. 
  Debt Instruments.   In certain circumstances, we may be required to recognize taxable income prior to the time at which we receive cash. For example, if we hold debt instruments that are treated under applicable tax rules as having original issue discount (such as debt instruments with an end-of-term payment and/or PIK interest payment or, in certain cases, increasing interest rates or issued with warrants), we must include in taxable income each year a portion of the original issue discount that accrues over the life of the obligation, regardless of whether cash representing such income is received by us in the same taxable year. Because any original issue discount accrued will be included in our investment company taxable income for the year of accrual, we may be required to make a distribution to our stockholders in order to satisfy the Annual Distribution Requirement and to avoid the 4% U.S. federal excise tax, even though we will not have received any corresponding cash amount. 
  Warrants.   Gain or loss realized by us from the sale or exchange of warrants acquired by us as well as any loss attributable to the lapse of such warrants generally are treated as capital gain or loss. The treatment of such gain or loss as long-term or short-term generally depends on how long we held a particular warrant and on the nature of the disposition transaction. 
  Foreign Investments.   In the event we invest in foreign securities, we may be subject to withholding and other foreign taxes with respect to those securities. We do not expect to satisfy the requirement to pass through to our stockholders their share of the foreign taxes paid by us.

 15

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
  Passive Foreign Investment Companies.   We may invest in the stock of a foreign corporation which is classified as a “passive foreign investment company” (within the meaning of Section 1297 of the Code), or “PFIC.” In general, unless a special tax election has been made, we are required to pay tax at ordinary income rates on any gains and “excess distributions” with respect to PFIC stock as if such items had been realized ratably over the period during which we held the PFIC stock, plus an interest charge. Certain adverse tax consequences of a PFIC investment may be limited if we are eligible to elect alternative tax treatment with respect to such investment. No assurances can be given that any such election will be available or that, if available, we will make such an election.
  Foreign Currency Transactions.   Under the Code, gains or losses attributable to fluctuations in exchange rates which occur between the time we accrue income or other receivables or accrue expenses or other liabilities denominated in a foreign currency and the time we actually collect such receivables or pay such liabilities generally are treated as ordinary income or loss. Similarly, on disposition of debt instruments and certain other instruments denominated in a foreign currency, gains or losses attributable to fluctuations if the value of the foreign currency between the date of acquisition of the instrument and the date of disposition also are treated as ordinary gain or loss. These currency fluctuations related gains and losses may increase or decrease the amount of our investment company taxable income to be distributed to our stockholders as ordinary income. 
Regulation as a Business Development Company 
 General 
 We have elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. A BDC must be organized in the United States for the purpose of investing in or lending to primarily private companies and making significant managerial assistance available to them. A BDC may use capital provided by stockholders and from other sources to make long-term, private investments in businesses. A BDC provides stockholders the ability to retain the liquidity of a publicly traded stock while sharing in the possible benefits, if any, of investing in primarily privately-owned companies. Until an IPO, if any, we do not intend to list our common stock on a stock exchange, and it will not be publicly traded. 
 We may not change the nature of our business so as to cease to be, or withdraw our election as, a BDC unless authorized by vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities, as required by the 1940 Act. A majority of the outstanding voting securities of a company is defined under the 1940 Act as the lesser of: (a) 67% or more of such company’s voting securities present at a meeting if more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities of such company are present or represented by proxy, or (b) more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities of such company. We do not anticipate any substantial change in the nature of our business. 
 As with other companies regulated by the 1940 Act, a BDC must adhere to certain substantive regulatory requirements. A majority of our directors must be persons who are not “interested persons,” as that term is defined in the 1940 Act. Additionally, we are required to provide and maintain a bond issued by a reputable fidelity insurance company to protect the BDC. Furthermore, as a BDC, we are prohibited from protecting any director or officer against any liability to us or our stockholders arising from willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of such person’s office. 
 As a BDC, we are generally required to meet an asset coverage ratio, defined under the 1940 Act as the ratio of our gross assets (less all liabilities and indebtedness not represented by senior securities) to our outstanding senior securities, of at least 200% after each issuance of senior securities. However, recent legislation has modified the 1940 Act by allowing a BDC to increase the maximum amount of leverage it may incur from an asset coverage ratio of 200% to an asset coverage ratio of 150%, if certain requirements are met. We are permitted to increase our leverage capacity if stockholders representing at least a majority of the votes cast, at an annual or special meeting at which quorum is met, approve a proposal to do so. If we receive such stockholder approval, we would be permitted to increase our leverage capacity on the first day after such approval. Alternatively, we may increase the maximum amount of leverage we may incur to an asset coverage ratio of 150% if the “required majority” of our independent directors as defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act approve such increase, with such approval becoming effective after one year. 

 16

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 Because our common stock is not listed on a national securities exchange, if we receive approval to increase the maximum amount of leverage we may incur to an asset coverage ratio of 150% from an asset coverage ratio of 200%, then we must offer to repurchase all of our common stock held by stockholders as of the date of such approval. In addition, we would be required to make certain disclosures on our website and in SEC filings regarding, among other things, the receipt of approval to increase our leverage, our leverage capacity and usage and risks related to leverage. 
 We may also be prohibited under the 1940 Act from knowingly participating in certain transactions with our affiliates without the prior approval of our directors who are not “interested persons,” as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act, of us, RGC or our respective affiliates and, in some cases, prior approval by the SEC. 
 We do not intend to acquire securities issued by any investment company that exceed the limits imposed by the 1940 Act. Under these limits, except for registered money market funds, we generally cannot acquire more than 3% of the voting stock of any investment company, invest more than 5% of the value of our total assets in the securities of one investment company or invest more than 10% of the value of our total assets in the securities of investment companies in the aggregate. The portion of our portfolio invested in securities issued by investment companies ordinarily will subject our stockholders to additional indirect expenses. Our investment portfolio is also subject to diversification requirements by virtue of our election to be treated as a RIC for U.S. tax purposes and our intention to continue to operate in a manner so as to qualify for the tax treatment applicable to RICs. See “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Business and Structure” in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K for more information. 
 In addition, investment companies registered under the 1940 Act and private funds that are excluded from the definition of “investment company” pursuant to either Section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of the 1940 Act may not acquire directly or through a controlled entity more than 3% of our total outstanding voting stock (measured at the time of the acquisition), unless the funds comply with an exemption under the 1940 Act. As a result, certain of our investors may hold a smaller position in our shares than if they were not subject to these restrictions. 
 We are generally not able to issue and sell our common stock at a price below net asset value per share. See “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Business and Structure — Regulations governing our operation as a BDC affect our ability to raise additional capital and the way in which we do so. As a BDC, the necessity of raising additional capital may expose us to risks, including the typical risks associated with leverage.” in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K. We may, however, sell our common stock, or warrants, options or rights to acquire our common stock, at a price below the then-current net asset value of our common stock if our Board of Directors determines that such sale is in our best interests and the best interests of our stockholders, and our stockholders approve such sale. In addition, we may generally issue new shares of our common stock at a price below net asset value in rights offerings to existing stockholders, in payment of dividends and in certain other limited circumstances. 
 As a BDC, we are generally limited in our ability to invest in any portfolio company in which RGC or any of its affiliates currently has an investment or to make any co-investments with our investment adviser or its affiliates without an exemptive order from the SEC, subject to certain exceptions. 
 We are subject to periodic examination by the SEC for compliance with the 1940 Act. 
 As a BDC, we are subject to certain risks and uncertainties. See “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Business and Structure” in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K. 
 Qualifying Assets 
 Under the 1940 Act, a BDC may not acquire any asset other than assets of the type listed in Section 55(a) of the 1940 Act, which are referred to as qualifying assets, unless, at the time the acquisition is made, qualifying assets represent at least 70% of the BDC’s gross assets. The principal categories of qualifying assets relevant to our business are the following: 
 (1)

 Securities purchased in transactions not involving any public offering from the issuer of such securities, which issuer (subject to certain limited exceptions) is an eligible portfolio company, or 
 ​

​
  17

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 from any person who is, or has been during the preceding 13 months, an affiliated person of an eligible portfolio company, or from any other person, subject to such rules as may be prescribed by the SEC. An eligible portfolio company is defined in the 1940 Act as any issuer which: 
 (a)

 is organized under the laws of, and has its principal place of business in, the United States; 
 ​
 (b)

 is not an investment company (other than a small business investment company wholly owned by the BDC) or a company that would be an investment company but for certain exclusions under the 1940 Act; and 
 ​
 (c)

 satisfies any of the following: 
 ​
 (i)

 does not have any class of securities that is traded on a national securities exchange; 
 ​
 (ii)

 has a class of securities listed on a national securities exchange, but has an aggregate market value of outstanding voting and non-voting common equity of less than $250 million; 
 ​
 (iii)

 is controlled by a BDC or a group of companies including a BDC and the BDC has an affiliated person who is a director of the eligible portfolio company; or 
 ​
 (iv)

 is a small and solvent company having gross assets of not more than $4.0 million and capital and surplus of not less than $2.0 million. 
 ​
 (2)

 Securities of any eligible portfolio company which we control. 
 ​
 (3)

 Securities purchased in a private transaction from a U.S. issuer that is not an investment company or from an affiliated person of the issuer, or in transactions incident thereto, if the issuer is in bankruptcy and subject to reorganization or if the issuer, immediately prior to the purchase of its securities, was unable to meet its obligations as they came due without material assistance other than conventional lending or financing arrangements. 
 ​
 (4)

 Securities of an eligible portfolio company purchased from any person in a private transaction if there is no ready market for such securities and we already own 60% of the outstanding equity of the eligible portfolio company. 
 ​
 (5)

 Securities received in exchange for or distributed on or with respect to securities described in (1) through (4) above, or pursuant to the exercise of warrants or rights relating to such securities. 
 ​
 (6)

 Cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities or high-quality debt securities maturing in one year or less from the time of investment. 
 ​
 If at any time less than 70% of our gross assets are comprised of qualifying assets, including as a result of an increase in the value of any non-qualifying assets or decrease in the value of any qualifying assets, we would generally not be permitted to acquire any additional non-qualifying assets, other than office furniture and equipment, interests in real estate and leasehold improvements and facilities maintained to conduct the business operations of the BDC, deferred organization and operating expenses, and other non-investment assets necessary and appropriate to its operations as a BDC, until such time as 70% of our then current gross assets were comprised of qualifying assets. We would not be required, however, to dispose of any non-qualifying assets in such circumstances. 
 Managerial Assistance to Portfolio Companies 
 In addition, a BDC must have been organized and have its principal place of business in the United States and must be operated for the purpose of making investments in the types of securities described above in Qualifying Assets categories (1), (2) or (3). However, in order to count portfolio securities as qualifying assets for the purpose of the 70% test, the BDC must either control the issuer of the securities or must offer to make available to the issuer of the securities (other than small and solvent companies described above in Qualifying Assets category (1)(c)(iv)) significant managerial assistance; except that, where the BDC purchases such securities in conjunction with one or more other persons acting together, one of the other persons in the group may make available such managerial assistance. Making available managerial assistance means, among other things, any arrangement whereby the BDC, through its 

 18

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 directors, officers or employees, offers to provide, and, if accepted, does so provide, significant guidance and counsel concerning the management, operations or business objectives and policies of a portfolio company. We may also receive fees for these services. RGC may provide, or arrange for the provision of, such managerial assistance on our behalf to portfolio companies that request this assistance, subject to reimbursement of any fees or expenses incurred on our behalf by RGC in accordance with our Amended Advisory Agreement. 
Temporary Investments 
 Pending investment in other types of “qualifying assets,” as described above, our investments may consist of cash, cash equivalents, U.S. government securities or high-quality debt securities maturing in one year or less from the time of investment, which we refer to, collectively, as temporary investments, so that 70% of our assets are qualifying assets. Typically, we will invest in U.S. Treasury Bills or in repurchase agreements, provided that such agreements are fully collateralized by cash or securities issued by the U.S. government or its agencies. A repurchase agreement involves the purchase by an investor, such as us, of a specified security and the simultaneous agreement by the seller to repurchase it at an agreed-upon future date and at a price which is greater than the purchase price by an amount that reflects an agreed-upon interest rate. There is no percentage restriction on the proportion of our assets that may be invested in such repurchase agreements. However, if more than 25% of our gross assets constitute repurchase agreements from a single counterparty, we would not meet the diversification tests in order to qualify as a RIC for federal income tax purposes. Thus, we do not intend to enter into repurchase agreements with a single counterparty in excess of this limit. RGC monitors the creditworthiness of the counterparties with which we enter into repurchase agreement transactions. 
Senior Securities 
 We are generally permitted, under specified conditions, to issue multiple classes of indebtedness and one class of stock senior to our common stock if our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, is at least equal to 200% immediately after each such issuance. However, recent legislation has modified the 1940 Act by allowing a BDC to increase the maximum amount of leverage it may incur from an asset coverage ratio of 200% to an asset coverage ratio of 150%, if certain requirements are met. We are permitted to increase our leverage capacity if stockholders representing at least a majority of the votes cast, at an annual or special meeting at which quorum is met, approve a proposal to do so. If we receive such stockholder approval, we would be permitted to increase our leverage capacity on the first day after such approval. Alternatively, we may increase the maximum amount of leverage we may incur to an asset coverage ratio of 150% if the “required majority” of our independent directors as defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act approve such increase, with such approval becoming effective after one year. Because our common stock is not listed on a national securities exchange, if we receive approval to increase the maximum amount of leverage we may incur to an asset coverage ratio of 150% from an asset coverage ratio of 200%, then we must offer to repurchase all of our common stock held by stockholders as of the date of such approval. In addition, we would be required to make certain disclosures on our website and in SEC filings regarding, among other things, the receipt of approval to increase our leverage, our leverage capacity and usage and risks related to leverage. 
 In addition, while any senior securities remain outstanding, we must make provisions to prohibit any distribution to our stockholders or the repurchase of such securities or shares unless we meet the applicable asset coverage ratios at the time of the distribution or repurchase. We may also borrow amounts up to 5% of the value of our gross assets for temporary or emergency purposes without regard to asset coverage. For a discussion of the risks associated with leverage, see “Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Business and Structure — We may borrow money, which would magnify the potential for gain or loss on amounts invested and may increase the risk of investing in us.” in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K. 
 Compliance Policies and Procedures 
 We and RGC have adopted and implemented written policies and procedures reasonably designed to detect and prevent violation of the federal securities laws and are required to review these compliance policies and procedures annually for their adequacy and the effectiveness of their implementation and designate a chief compliance officer to be responsible for administering the policies and procedures. Carl Rizzo currently serves as our Chief Compliance Officer.

 Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 
 The Sarbanes-Oxley Act imposes a wide variety of regulatory requirements on publicly held companies and their insiders. Many of these requirements affect us. For example: 
 •

 pursuant to Rule 13a-14 of the Exchange Act, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer must certify the accuracy of the financial statements contained in our periodic reports; 
 ​
 •

 pursuant to Item 307 of Regulation S-K, our periodic reports must disclose our conclusions about the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures; 
 ​
 •

 pursuant to Rule 13a-15 of the Exchange Act, our management must prepare a report regarding its assessment of our internal control over financial reporting and, starting from the date on which we cease to be an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act, must obtain an audit of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting performed by our independent registered public accounting firm should we become an accelerated filer; and 
 ​
 •

 pursuant to Item 308 of Regulation S-K and Rule 13a-15 of the Exchange Act, our periodic reports must disclose whether there were significant changes in our internal control over financial reporting or in other factors that could significantly affect these controls subsequent to the date of their evaluation, including any corrective actions with regard to significant deficiencies and material weaknesses. 
 ​
 The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires us to review our current policies and procedures to determine whether we comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder. We will continue to monitor our compliance with all regulations that are adopted under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and will take actions necessary to ensure that we are in compliance therewith. 
 Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures 
 We have delegated our proxy voting responsibility to RGC. The Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures of RGC are set forth below. The guidelines will be reviewed periodically by RGC and our non-interested directors, and, accordingly, are subject to change. For purposes of the Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures described below, “we,” “our” and “us” refers to RGC. 
 An investment adviser registered under the Advisers Act has a fiduciary duty to act solely in the best interests of its clients. As part of this duty, we recognize that we must vote client securities in a timely manner, free of conflicts of interest and in the best interests of our clients. 
 These policies and procedures for voting proxies for our investment advisory clients are intended to comply with Section 206 of, and Rule 206(4)-6 under, the Advisers Act. 
 Proxy Policies 
 We will vote proxies relating to our portfolio securities in what we perceive to be the best interest of our clients’ stockholders. We will review on a case-by-case basis each proposal submitted to a stockholder vote to determine its impact on the portfolio securities held by our clients. Although we will generally vote against proposals that may have a negative impact on our clients’ portfolio securities, we may vote for such a proposal if there exist compelling long-term reasons to do so. 
 Our proxy-voting decisions will be made by the senior officers who are responsible for monitoring each of our clients’ investments. To ensure that our vote is not the product of a conflict of interest, we will require that: (1) anyone involved in the decision-making process disclose to our management any potential conflict that he or she is aware of and any contact that he or she has had with any interested party regarding a proxy vote; and (2) employees involved in the decision-making process or vote administration are prohibited from revealing how we intend to vote on a proposal in order to reduce any attempted influence from interested parties. 
 Proxy Voting Records 
 You may obtain information about how we voted proxies by making a written request for proxy voting information to: Runway Growth Capital LLC, 205 N. Michigan Ave., Suite 4200, Chicago, IL 60601.
