Item 1. Business
Business Overview
 We are a clinical stage pharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of novel therapeutics for rare endocrine diseases and endocrine-related tumors. Endocrine pathways function to maintain homeostasis and commonly use peptide hormones acting through G protein coupled receptors, or GPCRs, to regulate many aspects of physiology including growth, energy, metabolism, gastrointestinal function and stress responses. We have assembled a seasoned team with extensive expertise in drug discovery and development in endocrine GPCRs and built a highly productive drug discovery organization. We have discovered a pipeline of oral nonpeptide (small molecule) new chemical entities that target peptide GPCRs to treat a variety of rare endocrine diseases where treatment options have significant efficacy, safety and/or tolerability limitations. Our lead product candidate, CRN00808, is currently in clinical development for the treatment of acromegaly, and we are advancing additional product candidates through preclinical studies in parallel. Our vision is to build the leading endocrine company which consistently pioneers new therapeutics to help patients better control their disease and improve their daily lives. 
 We focus on the discovery and development of oral nonpeptide therapeutics that target peptide GPCRs with well understood biological functions, validated biomarkers and the potential to substantially improve the treatment of endocrine diseases and/or endocrine-related tumors. Our pipeline consists of the following three product candidates and discovery program: 
  
• | CRN00808, our lead product candidate, establishes a new class of oral selective nonpeptide somatostatin receptor type 2, or sst2, biased agonists designed for the treatment of acromegaly. Somatostatin is a neuropeptide hormone that broadly inhibits the secretion of other hormones, including growth hormone, or GH, from the pituitary gland. Acromegaly arises from a benign pituitary tumor that secretes excess GH that in turn causes excess secretion of insulin-like growth factor-1, or IGF-1, by the liver. This loss of homeostasis in the GH axis results in excess tissue growth and other adverse metabolic effects throughout the body. More than 25,000 people in the United States suffer from acromegaly, and an

estimated 40% to 60% are candidates for chronic pharmacological intervention, of which somatostatin peptide analogs are the primary pharmacotherapy. In 2017, injected somatostatin peptide drugs accounted for approximately $2.7 billion in global sales for the treatment of acromegaly, neuroendocrine tumors, or NETs, and other uses. Currently marketed peptide drugs require painful monthly or daily injections and, in the case of somatostatin peptide drugs, often fail to fully control the disease in many acromegaly patients.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In March 2018, we reported initial results from a Phase 1, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, single- and multiple-ascending dose trial to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, or PK, and pharmacodynamics, or PD, of CRN00808 in 99 healthy volunteers. CRN00808 demonstrated clinical proof-of-concept by potently suppressing stimulated GH and baseline IGF-1 in these subjects. The plasma exposure of CRN00808 indicated the drug was well absorbed with a half-life of 42 to 50 hours, supporting once daily administration in patients. The safety and tolerability of CRN00808 observed in this trial was generally consistent with that of approved peptide somatostatin analogs, or SSAs. 
 We submitted an Investigational New Drug, or IND, application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, in August 2018. In late 2018, we initiated two global Phase 2 clinical trials of CRN00808 in acromegaly patients, the ACROBAT EVOLVE, or EVOLVE, and ACROBAT EDGE, or EDGE, trials. The EVOLVE trial is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized withdrawal study designed to evaluate the safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of CRN00808, in subjects with acromegaly that respond to octreotide LAR or lanreotide depot monotherapy. The EDGE trial is an open label exploratory study designed to evaluate the safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of CRN00808 in subjects with acromegaly that are treated with somatostatin analog based treatment regimens but do not respond completely to monotherapy. The EVOLVE and EDGE studies are being conducted at centers in the United States and in certain European countries.
  
• | CRN01941 is an oral nonpeptide sst2 biased agonist designed for the treatment of NETs that originate from neuroendocrine cells commonly found in the gut, lung or pancreas. Typically, NETs are only diagnosed at a time of extensive metastatic disease and will often progress to liver failure. NETs are present in approximately 171,000 adults in the United States. Most NETs overexpress sst2 receptors and injected depots of peptide somatostatin analogs have become the first-line standard of care for many NETs patients as detailed in National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines. CRN01941 is currently in first-in-human enabling studies, and we expect to initiate a Phase 1 human proof-of-concept clinical trial in the first half of 2019. We expect results from this trial in late 2019/early 2020.

• | We are developing a new class of oral selective nonpeptide somatostatin type 5 receptor, or sst5, agonists designed to treat congenital hyperinsulinism, or CHI. This is a devastating rare disease in which infants are born with mutations that cause excess secretion of the pancreatic hormone insulin resulting in profound hypoglycemia, a very low level of blood glucose. This loss of homeostatic control of blood glucose levels can lead to seizures, developmental disorders, learning disabilities, coma and even death. CHI occurs in approximately 1 in 30,000 to 50,000 new births in the United States. We conducted first-in-human enabling studies with our first product candidate, CRN02481. Due to a toxicity finding which we believe was specific to CRN02481, we are advancing new molecules through preclinical activities with the goal of selecting a new product candidate for CHI.

• | We have an ongoing discovery effort to identify and advance into development the first nonpeptide product candidate to antagonize the peptide adrenocorticotrophic hormone, or ACTH, designed for the treatment of Cushing’s disease. Cushing’s disease results from a pituitary tumor that secretes excess ACTH which in turn causes the downstream synthesis and over-secretion of cortisol by the adrenal glands. Cortisol is the body’s main stress hormone and excess amounts can cause significant increases in mortality and morbidity. Cushing’s disease is an orphan indication with a prevalence of approximately 13,000 patients in the United States.

 Patients with many other debilitating endocrine diseases await new therapeutic options, and we are continuously evaluating where next to deploy our drug discovery efforts. All of our product candidates have been discovered, characterized and developed internally and are the subject of composition of matter patent applications, including an issued U.S. patent covering CRN00808 extending to 2037. We have retained worldwide rights to commercialize our product candidates and do not have any royalty obligations. Over time, we intend to sell our products, if approved, through our own commercial organization, which we believe can be of modest size to cover the relatively small number of specialty endocrinologists who treat patients with rare endocrine diseases and endocrine-related tumors. 
 We were founded by a team of scientists with a track record of drug discovery and development to create important new therapeutic options for patients with rare endocrine diseases. Prior to founding the company, our Chief Executive Officer, Scott Struthers, Ph.D., was Senior Director and Head of Endocrinology and Metabolism at Neurocrine Biosciences, Inc. There, Dr. Struthers and his fellow co-founders, Stephen Betz, Ph.D. and Frank Zhu, Ph.D., as well as our VP of Development Ajay Madan, Ph.D., D.A.B.T., held key leadership roles in the discovery and development of ORILISSA (elagolix), a nonpeptide product candidate designed for the treatment of endometriosis and uterine fibroids that received marketing approval from the FDA in July 2018. In addition, Dr. Madan held a key leadership role in the discovery and

development of INGREZZA (valbenazine), which was approved by the FDA in 2017 for tardive dyskinesia. Our Chief Medical Officer, Alan Krasner, served as the Global Development Lead at Shire Pharmaceuticals for Natpara, the first recombinant human intact parathyroid hormone treatment for hypoparathyroidism.
 Our strategy 
 Our objective is to transform the treatment of rare endocrine diseases and endocrine-related tumors by creating a diversified portfolio of novel therapeutics that will advance the standard of care. To achieve this objective, we are pursuing the following strategy: 
  
• | Focus on rare endocrine diseases and endocrine-related tumors with significant unmet medical need. There are numerous rare endocrine diseases and endocrine-related tumors for which currently available pharmacological therapies (when they exist) have significant limitations in efficacy, safety and/or tolerability. Patients living with these diseases often experience significant morbidity, mortality and/or poor quality of life. We are focused on discovering, developing and commercializing orally available therapies for multiple rare indications across endocrinology to advance the standard of care for these patients. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Rapidly advance multiple product candidates in parallel to clinical proof-of-concept and late stage development by targeting diseases that require relatively small trials and employ validated biomarkers as clinical endpoints. Phase 1 clinical trials for rare endocrine diseases and endocrine-related tumors can often measure predictive biomarkers in healthy volunteers and lower the technical risk by providing a predictive measure of efficacy early in clinical development. Clinical trials in these indications often enroll relatively small numbers of trial subjects and use validated biomarkers as registration endpoints, which we believe will allow us to efficiently develop multiple clinical programs in parallel. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Continue to expand our therapeutic pipeline for rare endocrine diseases by leveraging the capabilities of our experienced discovery team in the area of peptide hormone GPCRs. Our discovery team has significant expertise in understanding and creating product candidates to influence the dynamic behavior of GPCRs and has developed a number of proprietary methods, techniques and tools that we believe will enable us to efficiently and reliably evaluate newly synthesized molecules. We employ an iterative strategy where compounds are designed, synthesized and rapidly characterized for pharmacologic and pharmaceutical properties. This approach has led to our current pipeline, and we will continue to invest in creating additional product candidates acting at this important class of targets. Peptide hormone GPCRs regulate many aspects of physiology and are attractive drug targets for treating a broad range of diseases. There are more than 80 known peptide hormones acting at more than 120 known different receptors. With each of our drug discovery programs, our goal is to specifically tailor a product candidate with pharmacologic and pharmaceutical properties highly optimized for its interaction with its specific GPCR target that we anticipate will translate to downstream benefits in our chosen therapeutic applications.

• | Retain commercialization rights to maximize the value of our product candidates. We plan to establish our own commercial organization in major markets and develop a network of third-party distributors in other selected markets. We believe this organization can be focused and modest in size due to the relatively small number of specialty endocrinologists who treat patients suffering from the diseases we target. Therefore, we do not expect that we will require larger pharmaceutical partners for commercialization of our product candidates, although we may consider partnering for certain territories or indications, or for other strategic purposes. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Maintain an entrepreneurial, scientifically rigorous and inclusive corporate culture where employees are fully engaged and strive to bring improved therapeutic options to patients. The patients we seek to treat currently only have options with significant drawbacks and often limited efficacy, safety and/or tolerability. We are passionate about developing new pharmacological therapies to help these patients better control their diseases and to reduce the impact of these diseases on their daily lives. We believe that building a successful and sustainable endocrine company requires not just specific expertise in multiple areas of biology, chemistry, drug discovery, development and commercialization, but a team-oriented culture that integrates and harnesses the creative energy, scientific insights and enthusiasm of the entire organization.

 The endocrine system 
 Overview 
 The endocrine system regulates most of the body’s physiological activities through the actions of hormones, which are chemical and biochemical messengers secreted from different organs that influence growth, gastrointestinal function, maturation and development, reproduction, stress, metabolism and nearly all aspects of homeostasis. Hormones are structurally variable and can be monoamines, steroids, amino acids, peptides or larger proteins. The endocrine system 
 4

includes, among other glands and organs, the pituitary gland, hypothalamus, pancreas, adrenal gland, thyroid and parathyroid, ovaries and testes, as well as specialized enteroendocrine cells. 
 Hormonal secretion is complex, and the body employs several mechanisms to exert positive and negative feedback control to maintain homeostasis. For example, the pituitary gland, which is located behind the eyes at the base of the brain, is sometimes referred to as “the master endocrine gland” because it regulates multiple endocrine systems. Positive and negative control of pituitary hormonal secretion is often dictated by the adjacent hypothalamus, which integrates feedback responses from other areas of the body, including the brain. In the case of GH, its synthesis and secretion are stimulated by growth hormone-releasing hormone, or GHRH, and inhibited by somatostatin, which are both hypothalamic peptides. Another example is the pancreas that secretes insulin and glucagon, which lower and raise blood glucose levels, respectively. Insulin and glucagon secretion are both inhibited by somatostatin, which is also locally produced in the pancreas. 
 Hormonal dysregulation can arise from endocrine organ defects, including injury, inflammation, genetic abnormalities or the growth of tumors derived from endocrine cells. These insults can result in the under-secretion or over-secretion of one or more hormones, disrupting homeostasis and causing disease. For example, several serious clinical disorders, including acromegaly and Cushing’s disease, result from pituitary tumors secreting excess hormones. In the pancreas, genetic defects or cellular dysfunction can give rise to disorders of under-secretion or over-secretion of pancreatic hormones (e.g., hyperinsulinemia). 
 Peptide hormone GPCRs 
 Various GPCRs are expressed in every type of cell in the body and their function is to transmit signals from outside the cell across the membrane to signaling pathways within the cell, between cells and between organ systems. Because of these critical actions, the GPCR superfamily is the largest and single most important family of drug targets as highlighted by the large number of approved therapeutics targeting this class. However, most currently available GPCR-targeting drugs act at receptors for which the native ligands are small molecules, such as histamine, adrenaline and neurotransmitters. 
 Most peptide hormones bind selectively to specific receptors located on the surface of cells in the target tissue. Receptors for peptide hormones are often GPCRs, which play a central role in many biological processes and are linked to a wide range of disease areas. There are more than 80 known peptide hormones acting at more than 120 known different receptors. Historically, it was assumed that small molecules could not replicate or compete with the complex interactions between peptides and their cognate GPCRs. As such, most drugs developed for peptide GPCRs have been and continue to be peptides themselves, which present manufacturing and formulation difficulties and force patients to undergo frequent injections because peptides generally are not orally bioavailable. We believe our approach to developing novel small molecule product candidates that uniquely engage peptide hormone GPCRs will enable us to generate orally bioavailable, and potentially more selective, effective and better tolerated therapeutics for patients. 
 The somatostatin receptor family of peptide GPCRs is an illustrative example of the complex and subtle control inherent in endocrine biology and peptide hormone physiology. The peptide hormone somatostatin, which was first isolated over 40 years ago, is produced by a variety of cell types and has pleiotropic effects throughout the body, many of which are related to the inhibition of secretion of other hormones or neurotransmitters, and selective activation of this activity has made somatostatin agonism a well-established, commercially-validated mechanism. These effects are mediated by five different somatostatin receptor proteins (sst1-sst5), which lower levels of cyclic adenosine monophosphate, or cAMP, a key intracellular signaling molecule regulated by GPCR activation. Each of these receptors is expressed in different subsets of tissues. For example, sst2 is the most widely expressed subtype in NETs and is the dominant receptor by which GH secretion is suppressed in the pituitary. The sst5 receptor is expressed by pancreatic islet cells where its activation potently inhibits insulin secretion.

Figure 1.    GPCR signaling is determined by many factors, including the binding characteristics of ligands, which dictate the responses of different signaling and regulatory pathways. Selectively favoring one pathway over others is termed biased signaling. Upon activation, GPCRs can also be trafficked into the cell, where they are either targeted for degradation or recycled back to the cell surface. 
 GPCRs were originally thought to function as simple on-off switches responding to hormones and neurotransmitters but have since been shown to exhibit complex and diverse molecular and cellular behaviors. Many lines of structural and mechanistic research demonstrate that distinct signaling cascades and feedback mechanisms create multi-dimensional pathways with distinct physiological responses. These different responses are based on ligand binding kinetics, receptor regulation and trafficking (Figure 1). Some transduce signals into the cell interior to regulate various cellular functions. Other responses attenuate hormonal signals to prevent overstimulation and include receptor internalization (a removal of the GPCR from the cell surface, which makes it unavailable for external ligands), desensitization and downregulation. The capacity of a GPCR ligand to preferentially affect one of these pathways, such as G-protein signaling, over others, such as receptor downregulation, is termed biased agonism. We believe our understanding of these different signaling pathways enables us to develop oral, small molecule product candidates that not only are highly selective for specific receptor subtypes but also are further custom-tailored to activate specific GPCR properties and ultimately improve patient outcomes.

Our product candidates 
 All of our product candidates have been discovered and developed internally and we have retained global rights to commercialize our product candidates and have no royalty or licensing obligations. The following table summarizes our product candidate pipeline and anticipated milestones. 
 

CRN00808 for the treatment of acromegaly 
 Our lead product, CRN00808, is an oral selective nonpeptide sst2 biased agonist in clinical development for the treatment of acromegaly. CRN00808 is the first nonpeptide sst2 agonist with reported results from a clinical trial. Initial results from our Phase 1 trial of CRN00808 demonstrated clinical proof-of-concept based on observed suppression of GH and IGF-1 secretion in healthy volunteers. We submitted an IND application to the FDA in August 2018 and initiated two global Phase 2 clinical trials of CRN00808 in acromegaly patients in late 2018. These studies will be conducted at centers in the United States and in certain European countries. 
 Disease background 
 Acromegaly is typically caused by a pituitary tumor that secretes excess GH. Pituitary tumors are generally benign adenomas that, in addition to GH secretion, also express membrane receptors for somatostatin. Increased GH secretion results in excess downstream secretion of IGF-1 from the liver. GH and IGF-1 promote tissue growth and have other metabolic effects throughout the body. 
 The symptoms of acromegaly include abnormal growth of hands and feet and changes in shape of the bones that result in alteration of facial features. Overgrowth of bone and cartilage and thickening of tissue can lead to arthritis, carpal tunnel syndrome, joint aches, enlarged lips, nose and tongue, deepening of voice due to enlarged vocal cords, sleep apnea due to obstruction of airways and enlargement of the heart, liver and other organs. Additional symptoms can include thick, coarse, oily skin, skin tags, excessive sweating and skin odor, fatigue and weakness, headaches, goiter, decreased libido, menstrual abnormalities in women and erectile dysfunction in men. As the tumor grows, it can impinge on the nerves in the optic chiasm leading to visual problems and potentially vision loss. Compression of the surrounding normal pituitary tissues can decrease production of other pituitary hormones, resulting in hypopituitarism. Acromegaly patients experience increased mortality rates, principally due to cardiovascular diseases (diabetes, hypertension), respiratory disease and cerebrovascular diseases. 
 Acromegaly is often suspected when the patient exhibits enlargement of extremities and an alteration of facial features. Pituitary tumors are also often found during clinical workup for severe headaches, vision changes or incidentally on cranial imaging initiated for other reasons. Elevation of serum IGF-1 levels confirms the suspicion of acromegaly, but a formal diagnosis requires lack of suppression of serum GH levels in response to an oral glucose tolerance test. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computerized tomography (CT) scan of the pituitary is then used to locate the tumor, determine its size and assess the potential for surgical intervention. There are an estimated 25,000 patients in the United States with acromegaly. 
 7

Current treatments and limitations 
 The major goals of treatment are to reduce serum GH and normalize IGF-1 levels, ameliorate symptoms and relieve any pressure resulting from the tumor. Surgical removal of the pituitary tumor is the first treatment option and often results in rapid improvement of symptoms. Surgery can be curative if the tumor is small and accessible enough to be fully resected. However, an estimated 40% to 60% of acromegaly patients turn to pharmacological treatments if they are not candidates for surgery or surgery was unsuccessful. Somatostatin analogs octreotide (marketed as Sandostatin) and lanreotide (marketed as Somatuline) are selective for sst2 receptors and are the preferred first-line pharmacologic treatments. However, these peptides leave many patients inadequately controlled. For example, a meta-analysis published in 2014 by the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism showed that approximately 50% of over 4,000 acromegaly patients treated with octreotide or lanreotide failed to achieve biochemical control. Pegvisomant (marketed as Somavert) is a daily injectable GH receptor antagonist and is generally used in patients resistant to or intolerant of somatostatin analogs. Pasireotide (marketed as Signifor) is a less-selective sst receptor agonist that is also used and has activity toward sst5, sst3 and sst2 receptors. However, pasireotide treatment leads to an increase in fasting plasma glucose levels in patients within the first two or three weeks of treatment and a pronounced shift to pre-diabetes and diabetes (as judged by HbA1c levels) within six months due to its insulin-suppressing sst5 activity. Orally administered dopamine agonists, such as bromocriptine and cabergoline, are also used, but do not achieve hormone normalization in most patients. For this reason, dopamine agonists are usually used as adjunct to somatostatin analogs. While these currently approved drugs reduce the disease burden, many patients still report acromegaly symptoms despite treatment, particularly at the end of the monthly dosing cycle. 
 Currently available therapies for acromegaly are peptide drugs that require injection, making them both painful and inconvenient. Octreotide and pasireotide are typically a monthly intramuscular injection, lanreotide a monthly deep subcutaneous injection and pegvisomant a daily subcutaneous injection. Patients report pain, swelling and bruising both at the time of injection and for days following injections. In addition, octreotide, lanreotide and pasireotide labels require injections by a trained healthcare provider and are therefore inconvenient for patients. Finally, the reconstitution of octreotide and pasireotide can be complex and prone to error for healthcare providers.
 We believe that a once-daily oral nonpeptide somatostatin agonist that reduces excess GH secretion and normalizes IGF-1 levels in acromegaly patients would represent a major clinical advance by eliminating painful injections and reducing the frequency of physician office visits. Additionally, we believe it should allow physicians to more quickly determine optimal dosing regimens compared to existing depot therapies. 
 CRN00808 overview and clinical development 
 CRN00808, our lead product candidate, pioneers a new class of oral selective nonpeptide sst2 biased agonists designed for the treatment of acromegaly and is the first agent in its class with reported clinical results. It is designed to reduce excess GH secretion from benign pituitary tumors and normalize IGF-1 levels in patients with acromegaly. In vitro pharmacology studies demonstrated that CRN00808 potently stimulated sst2 receptor activity as measured by a decrease in cAMP accumulation in cells expressing the human sst2 receptor (EC50=0.25 nM, the concentration that achieves 50% cAMP inhibition). Analogous experiments using the other sst receptor subtypes showed CRN00808’s selectivity for sst2 was 4,000 times greater than the other sst receptor subtypes. 
 Internalization and desensitization of sst2 is thought to contribute to the inability of some patients to fully respond to octreotide. Therefore, in creating CRN00808, we focused our discovery efforts on identifying biased agonists that were selective for inhibition of cAMP accumulation while minimizing receptor internalization. In vitro studies have shown that CRN00808 was 75 times more potent for cAMP inhibition than receptor internalization. Figure 2 illustrates the difference in bias between octreotide and CRN00808. Concentrations of octreotide where cAMP is maximally suppressed also induced extensive internalization of sst2 receptors whereas in the same experiment, nearly all receptors remained on the cell surface at concentrations where CRN00808 maximally suppressed cAMP. We believe that this increased bias suggests a reduced likelihood of desensitization of the sst2 receptor by CRN00808 at pharmacologically relevant concentrations.

White circles are from a cAMP assay measuring sst2 activation. Black circles are from an internalization assay measuring the amount of cell surface receptors. M = molar concentration. 
 In addition to somatostatin receptor-directed pharmacology, CRN00808 showed little off-target activity in a variety of assays for other GPCRs, enzymes, ion channels and transporters. Based on further in vivo studies in rats and dogs, CRN00808 suppressed GH and IGF-1 consistent with its mechanism of action. We conducted 28-day good laboratory practice, or GLP, toxicity studies in rats and dogs and identified no dose-limiting toxicities, which supported moving CRN00808 into human clinical trials. 
 We began a Phase 1, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in late 2017 to assess the safety, tolerability, PK and PD of CRN00808 in 99 healthy human volunteers. This trial was performed at a single center in Melbourne, Australia, and the overall trial design is shown in Figure 3. Safety, tolerability and PK were monitored in all subjects. Subjects in the single ascending dose, or SAD, arm (up to 20 mg) were also evaluated for the ability of CRN00808 to suppress GH secretion. Because GH secretion is pulsatile during the day, subjects in the first five SAD cohorts were given an intravenous bolus of GHRH (50 µg) to ensure a reliable window of high GH secretion. These GH responses were evaluated on day -1 (the day prior to dosing) and again on day 1 (the day of dosing either CRN00808 or placebo). The ability of CRN00808 to suppress serum IGF-1 was evaluated in the multiple ascending dose, or MAD, cohorts. A summary of the trial cohorts and an analysis of the data from this trial is presented below. 
 

Figure 3.    Design of CRN00808 Phase 1 trial. The SAD phase (N=8* per cohort (6 active, 2 placebo)) initially used an oral solution (1.25-20 mg) and switched to capsules for later cohorts (40-60 mg). The 10 mg SAD cohort also compared the plasma exposure of CRN00808 when it was administered as an oral solution, first generation capsules when fasted and as first-generation capsules when taken with a high-fat breakfast. The MAD phase (N=9 per cohort (6 active, 3 placebo)) only used capsules (5-30 mg). There was an additional cohort (N=8) to assess the potential for drug-drug-interactions (midazolam +/- 20 mg CRN00808). *The 20 mg SAD Cohort only enrolled 7 subjects due to a subject’s last-minute cancellation. 
 Figure 4 shows a summary of PK/PD data from the SAD arm of the trial. As illustrated for the 10 mg cohort in Figure 4a, administration of GHRH on day -1 resulted in a rapid surge of serum GH that lasted approximately 2 hours. In contrast to day -1, the presence of CRN00808 in plasma strongly suppressed (approximately 92%) stimulated GH secretion, consistent with the compound’s activity as an sst2 agonist. This response was dose dependent as shown in Figure 4b. The first-generation capsule achieved approximately 75% of the total plasma exposure (area under the curve, or AUC) of the same dose 
 9

administered as an oral solution to fasted subjects (Figure 4c). However, when the capsule was administered with a standardized high fat meal, plasma AUC was reduced by approximately 83%, suggesting that the current formulation should be taken under fasted conditions. In the drug-drug interaction cohort, repeated dosing of CRN00808 resulted in no change in the exposure of the sensitive CYP3A4 reporter midazolam, suggesting that CRN00808 is not likely to cause drug interactions by inhibiting the metabolism of other drugs that are primarily metabolized by the major CYP enzymes in the liver. 
 
 
Figure 4. PK/PD analysis of the single-ascending dose arm. a) Suppression of GHRH stimulated GH by 10 mg of CRN00808 administered as an oral solution on day 1 (filled circles), compared to day -1 (open circles). The plasma exposure of CRN00808 is shown in black squares. b) Dose response of GH suppression of CRN00808 (data excludes an outlier in the 1.25 mg cohort which was likely related to variability in method of GHRH administration. The methodology was corrected for cohorts 2.5 mg and higher). c) Comparison of CRN00808 plasma exposure following oral administration of 10 mg CRN00808 as an oral solution (black squares) and as a first-generation capsule (white squares). h = hour, Pbo=placebo. All data are mean ± standard error. 

 
In the MAD arm, subjects were dosed with CRN00808 for seven days (5 mg cohort) or ten days (10-30 mg cohorts) and serum IGF-1 levels were measured each day. In both acromegaly patients and healthy volunteers, sustained suppression of GH release results in lowering of serum IGF-1 levels. However, in contrast to the rapid effects of the GH response, IGF-1 levels are known to decrease more gradually and require several days of exposure to somatostatin agonists to produce an observable effect. Figure 5a illustrates the PK/PD relationship between trough plasma CRN00808 concentrations and IGF-1 levels. As CRN00808 concentrations reached steady state, serum IGF-1 concentrations began to decline. This decline reached steady state in approximately seven days. Of note, IGF-1 remained suppressed for several days after the final dose but began to recover as CRN00808 plasma concentrations fell. 
 As shown in Figure 5b, CRN00808 exhibited dose-proportional increase in exposure and a half-life of 42 to 50 hours, consistent with potential for once daily administration. Suppression of IGF-1 levels for the 10 mg, 20 mg and 30 mg cohorts was similar (Figure 5c) indicating that the 10 mg dose achieved a maximal response. This degree of IGF-1 suppression by CRN00808 was similar to that observed for peptide somatostatin analogs (octreotide, lanreotide) in previously reported healthy volunteer studies. Concentrations of somatostatin analogs in healthy volunteers that result in this level of suppression in healthy volunteers are comparable to the trough concentrations in patients on the highest approved dose. This suggests that drug concentrations that result in maximal suppression of IGF-1 in healthy volunteers translates to meaningful suppression of IGF-1 in acromegaly patients.

The safety and tolerability of CRN00808 in the trial was generally consistent with that of approved peptide somatostatin analogs. In the trial, CRN00808 resulted in mild gastrointestinal disorders (such as abdominal pain, flatulence, abdominal distension, and diarrhea) in approximately 30% of subjects and mild elevations of pancreatic enzymes in approximately 10% of subjects. One subject experienced moderate abdominal pain after a single 40 mg dose. Additional adverse events included headache, dizziness and cardiac rhythm abnormalities (including nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, or NSVT) which were not dose dependent and also observed in placebo subjects and/or prior to dosing. One serious adverse event of moderate NSVT was observed following a single 1.25 mg dose and was considered unlikely to be related to CRN00808. Based on the conclusions from this Phase 1 clinical study, we selected 10 mg as the initial dose in our Phase 2 trials. 
 Based on the initial results of our Phase 1 clinical trial, we believe we have demonstrated proof-of-concept for the ability of CRN00808 to suppress the GH axis in humans. We submitted an IND application to the FDA in August 2018 and initiated two global Phase 2 clinical trials in acromegaly patients in late 2018. The first of these, EVOLVE, is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial conducted in approximately 36 patients whose IGF-1 levels are currently controlled by octreotide or lanreotide. We are also conducting a second, open-label exploratory trial, EDGE, to evaluate the effects of CRN00808 on approximately 45 patients whose IGF-1 levels are not adequately controlled by octreotide or lanreotide alone. The EVOLVE and EDGE studies are being conducted at centers in the United States and in certain European countries. In parallel, we are developing a second-generation capsule formulation that may mitigate the food effect observed with the first-generation capsule.

A summary of the trial design for the EVOLVE and EDGE studies is presented below.
 

CRN01941 for the treatment of neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) 
 CRN01941 is an oral, selective nonpeptide sst2 biased agonist designed for the treatment of NETs that originate from neuroendocrine cells commonly found in the gut, lung or pancreas. We are currently conducting first-in-human enabling studies for CRN01941 and plan to initiate a Phase 1 human proof-of-concept clinical trial in the first half of 2019 with results expected in late 2019/early 2020. 
 Disease background 
 NETs arise from cells of the enteroendocrine system in the gastrointestinal tract (approximately 70% of cases) but can also arise from neuroendocrine cells in the lung (approximately 25% of cases) or, more rarely, the pancreas. These tumors are usually slow growing and often initially asymptomatic. Therefore, many patients are only diagnosed at a time of extensive metastatic disease, and these patients will often progress to liver failure. In approximately 10% of cases, these tumors are associated with excess secretion of serotonin resulting in carcinoid syndrome, which is characterized by severe diarrhea and flushing. Patients with well- and moderately-differentiated tumors and distant metastases have a five-year survival probability of 35%, according to a study published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology. NETs are present in approximately 171,000 adults in the United States and while still an orphan disease, it is the second most common gastrointestinal malignancy after colon cancer. 
 Current treatments and limitations 
 Most NETs overexpress sst2 receptors and injected depots of peptide somatostatin analogs have become a standard of care for patients with carcinoid syndrome. While somatostatin analogs have been historically indicated primarily for patients with carcinoid syndrome, there is an evolving understanding of the positive impact of somatostatin analog treatment on the broader NETs patient population. For example, lanreotide was approved for the treatment of gastroenteropancreatic NETs based on a long-term study that showed significant improvement in progression free survival. However, many patients eventually become increasingly resistant to somatostatin analogs requiring increased dosage of depot preparations or use of short-acting analogs as an add-on therapy. In 2017, the serotonin synthesis inhibitor, telotristat, was approved as an add-on therapy to somatostatin analogs to help prevent breakthrough symptoms of carcinoid syndrome. Second-line targeted therapies everolimus and sunitinib malate are typically only used in patients with high grade tumors which constitute only a small fraction of NETs. 
 The overexpression of sst2 in NETs is also the basis for somatostatin targeted radioimaging of the tumors for diagnosis and staging. Peptide somatostatin analogs modified to incorporate a chelating agent can use their sst2 binding activity to 
 12

concentrate radioisotopes in tumor tissue that can then be imaged using positron-emission tomography (PET). More recently, this approach has been adapted to deliver the alpha particle emitter 177Lu for anti-tumor activity. A drug using this mechanism, Lutathera, significantly improved progression free survival and led to a substantial reduction in the risk of disease progression or death when added onto octreotide LAR therapy compared to a double dose of octreotide LAR, in a Phase 3 trial in NET patients who had failed on somatostatin analog therapy. 
 CRN01941 overview and preclinical development 
 CRN01941 is an optimized, selective, orally available, nonpeptide biased agonist of sst2 receptor designed for the treatment of patients with NETs. The chemical structure of CRN01941 is derived from a different chemical scaffold from that of CRN00808. In vitro pharmacology studies demonstrated that CRN01941 potently (EC50=0.1 nM) stimulated sst2 receptor activity (as measured by a decrease in cAMP accumulation in cells expressing the human sst2 receptor) and is highly biased for Gi signaling versus receptor internalization (88-fold). Analogous experiments using the other sst receptor subtypes showed selectivity for sst2 was greater than 100-fold over the other sst receptor subtypes.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In a preclinical rodent model of efficacy, CRN01941 potently inhibited GHRH-induced GH production (Figure 8). This model is analogous to the PK-PD component in the Phase 1 clinical trial that we performed for CRN00808. In addition, the drug-like characteristics of CRN01941 met our rigorous internal criteria that we use to determine if a product candidate should enter into preclinical development. This includes extensive evaluation of pharmacology, selectivity, drug interaction potential, oral bioavailability and PK in multiple species, synthetic accessibility and preliminary non-GLP safety assessments including 14-day screening toxicology in rats and cardiovascular safety studies in dogs. 
 We are currently performing GLP first-in-human enabling studies on CRN01941 and expect to initiate a Phase 1 human proof-of-concept clinical trial in the first half of 2019. We expect results from this trial in late 2019/early 2020. 
 Product candidate for the treatment of hyperinsulinemias 
 We have identified oral selective nonpeptide sst5 receptor agonists that are designed to inhibit the excess insulin secretion associated with congenital and acquired disorders of hyperinsulinism, with our initial focus on CHI. We conducted first-in-human enabling studies with our first product candidate, CRN02481. Due to a toxicity finding which we believe was specific to CRN02481, we are advancing new molecules through preclinical activities with the goal of selecting a new product candidate for CHI. 
 Disease background 
 Hyperinsulinemia is a heterogeneous condition in which dangerously low blood sugar levels are caused by increased insulin secretion from pancreatic ß-cells. The most severe form of hyperinsulinemia arises from CHI, a disorder whose underlying pathology is driven by genetic mutations in key genes involved in regulating insulin secretion from ß-cells. The incidence of CHI is approximately 1 in 30,000 to 50,000 new births in the United States. Hyperinsulinemia is one of the most frequent causes of persistent hypoglycemia in neonates and infants. Early diagnosis is vital to prevent neurological complications due to chronic low blood sugar, which can result in apneas, seizures, developmental delays, learning disabilities, epilepsy and even death. Hyperinsulinemia can also be a severe complication for patients with insulin secreting tumors (insulinomas). Insulinomas are a specific type of NET derived from pancreatic ß-cells that secrete insulin and cause hypoglycemia. The incidence of insulinomas is 1 to 4 in 1,000,000 persons. In addition, hyperinsulinemic hyperglycemia following meals in patients who have undergone gastric bypass surgery (commonly referred to as Dumping Syndrome) occurs in approximately 10 to 15% of these patients. The number of gastric bypass surgeries continues to increase, from an estimated 158,000 surgeries in 2011 to 216,000 in 2016. 
 13

Current treatments and limitations 
 Maintaining glucose levels through feeding or glucose infusions is the first step in managing CHI. Diazoxide is the only approved therapy indicated for hyperinsulinemia. It acts at the ATP-sensitive potassium channels, or KATP, that are involved in insulin secretion and inhibits insulin secretion. However, mutations in these channels are present in approximately 55% to 60% of CHI patients, which limits the efficacy of the drug in this population. There are also serious side effects of diazoxide, which include hypertrichosis (abnormal and excessive hair growth over much of the body) and pulmonary hypertension, for which the FDA issued a warning regarding its use in infants and children. Octreotide (used off-label) is administered as subcutaneous injections up to six times/day in those who respond poorly to diazoxide. Octreotide is an sst2 agonist, which can suppress both insulin and glucagon secretion (Figure 6). As glucagon is a primary physiologic defense mechanism against hypoglycemia, targeting sst2 is not optimal for CHI patients, and octreotide therapy fails for approximately 70% to 75% of patients. Patients who fail pharmacological therapy often progress to partial or nearly complete pancreatectomy, which can result in type I diabetes that must be managed for the remainder of the patient’s life. We believe an orally available sst5 agonist would provide an important new therapeutic option that inhibits insulin secretion while avoiding glucagon suppression, allowing these patients to maintain normal glucose levels and possibly avoid pancreatectomy, the surgical removal of all or a part of the pancreas. 
 
Figure 7.    Hyperinsulinemia arising in CHI and the potential utility of sst5 agonists. 
 Preclinical development 
 In the process of discovering CRN00808, we synthesized many other drug-like nonpeptides, some of which also showed activity at other somatostatin receptor subtypes including sst5. Because activation of sst5 is known to strongly inhibit insulin secretion, we focused on optimizing selective sst5 agonists to identify potential product candidates, initially selecting CRN02481. This molecule is a highly potent agonist of the sst5 receptor (EC50 = 0.4 nM) with selectivity against other somatostatin receptors (>15-10,000-fold). 
 CRN02481 was examined in a rat model of CHI (Figure 7). In this model, rats were treated with sulfonylurea glyburide, which promotes insulin release by acting at KATP channels. This activity mimics the KATP channel mutations found in about half of CHI patients. This high level of insulin produced a decrease of blood glucose in rats. When these rats were then treated with CRN02481, blood glucose levels returned to normal, and at higher doses, even to a hyperglycemic state. Repeat dose experiments demonstrated that insulin continued to be suppressed after seven days. Further, glucagon secretion was not suppressed in these experiments.

To mimic a high insulin state similar to CHI, rats were treated with the sulfonylurea glyburide (30 mg/kg, black circles) or vehicle (white circles). CRN02481 was administered orally two hours after glyburide administration at either 3 mg/Kg (grey squares) or 10 mg/Kg (white squares). b) Effects on insulin and glucagon secretion by CRN02481 in rats. Animals were orally administered 30 mg/Kg glyburide (black bars) or glyburide + 10 mg/Kg CRN02481 (grey bars) daily for 7 days. Insulin and glucagon were measured three hours after CRN02481 administration on the first and last day of dosing. All data are mean ± standard error. 
 In addition, the drug-like characteristics of CRN02481 met our rigorous internal criteria that we use to determine if a product candidate should enter into preclinical development. This includes extensive evaluation of pharmacology, selectivity, drug interaction potential, oral bioavailability and PK in multiple species, synthetic accessibility and preliminary non-GLP safety assessments including 14-day screening toxicology in rats and cardiovascular safety studies in dogs. 
 CRN02481 entered preclinical development in 2018. Preclinical toxicology study results did not meet our standard for continued development. As such, we have discontinued development of CRN02481 and are currently optimizing advanced lead molecules to advance into preclinical development. 
 Product candidate for the treatment of Cushing’s disease 
 We have identified selective, orally available nonpeptide ACTH antagonist leads intended for the treatment of Cushing’s disease that are designed to prevent excessive stimulation of the adrenal glands by the high circulating levels of ACTH found in Cushing’s disease patients. 
 Disease background 
 Cushing’s syndrome was first described by Harvey Cushing over a century ago and results from a prolonged exposure to elevated levels of glucocorticoids, particularly cortisol. Common signs include growth of fat pads (collarbone, back of neck, face, trunk), excessive sweating, dilation of capillaries, thinning of the skin, muscle weakness, hirsutism, depression/anxiety, hypertension, osteoporosis, insulin resistance and hyperglycemia, heart disease and a range of other metabolic disturbances resulting in high morbidity. While excessive synthetic steroid administration or adrenal tumors can cause ACTH-independent forms of the disease, ACTH dependent Cushing’s syndrome (known as Cushing’s disease) is the most common form accounting for 60-80% of all cases and is most often due to tumors of pituitary corticotrophic cells that secrete excess ACTH. 
 Cushing’s disease is an orphan indication with a prevalence of approximately 13,000 patients in the United States. It presents much more commonly in women, and usually between 30 and 50 years of age. Cushing’s disease often takes many years to diagnose and may well be under-diagnosed in the general population as many of its symptoms such as lethargy, depression, obesity, hypertension, hirsuitism and menstrual irregularity can be incorrectly attributed to other more common disorders. 
 Current treatments and limitations 
 As with acromegaly, first-line therapy for Cushing’s disease is surgery to remove the pituitary tumor if possible. Pharmacological therapy is required when surgery is delayed, contraindicated or unsuccessful. Adrenal enzyme inhibitors 
 15

(e.g., metyrapone and ketoconazole) prevent the synthesis of cortisol and can improve symptoms but suffer from mechanistic side effects as a result of accumulation of precursor steroids and the resulting lack of negative feedback. For example, metyrapone is associated with hirsuitism in women and patients must be monitored carefully to avoid hypoadrenalism. Ketoconazole often requires progressively increasing dosage to maintain disease control, but this is ultimately limited by the hepatotoxicity of the drug. In addition, it is a potent inhibitor of one of the most important drug metabolizing enzymes in the liver, CYP3A4, resulting in the potential for negative drug-interactions as a side effect. Mifepristone, a potent glucocorticoid receptor antagonist, is approved for control of hyperglycemia in Cushing’s syndrome, but is difficult to titrate and has significant liabilities due to its potent anti-progesterone activity. The recently approved somatostatin analog, pasireotide, inhibits ACTH secretion, but in a recently published study, only 15-26% of patients in a Phase 3 trial achieved normalization of urinary free cortisol while 73% of patients experienced a hyperglycemia-related adverse event due to the compound’s potent inhibition of insulin secretion. Therefore, we believe a significant unmet medical need exists for improved agents to treat Cushing’s disease. 
 Product candidate discovery program 
 ACTH acts through a peptide GPCR called the melanocortin type 2 receptor, or MC2, that is specifically expressed in the adrenal gland. Activation of MC2 by ACTH results in increased synthesis of cAMP, enhanced synthesis and secretion of cortisol and hypertrophy of adrenal cells. Our discovery team has identified potent, selective nonpeptide antagonists of MC2 designed to block ACTH action and prevent its excessive stimulation of the adrenal gland in Cushing’s disease patients. In vitro and in vivo pharmacology data from one of our initial antagonists are shown in Figure 9 below. Pharmacological mechanism is confirmed both by blocking of radiolabeled ACTH in a binding assay, as well as inhibiting the agonistic ability of ACTH to stimulate cAMP in cells expressing MC2. In vivo proof-of-concept is demonstrated by the antagonist’s capacity to block corticosterone (CORT, the rat analog of cortisol) secretion in a rodent ACTH-challenge model, which mimics aspects of Cushing’s disease.

Competition 
 The commercialization of new drugs is competitive, and we could face competition from a number of pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies around the world. Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects or more convenient than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we do. The key competitive factors affecting the success of all of our programs are likely to be their efficacy, safety and convenience.

With respect to CRN00808, injected peptide somatostatin agonists and GH receptor antagonists are the main medical therapies for acromegaly patients where surgery is unsuccessful. There are three injected somatostatin analogs approved for the treatment of acromegaly: octreotide (marketed by Novartis AG), lanreotide (marketed by Ipsen Biopharmaceuticals, Inc.) and pasireotide (marketed by Novartis). Pegvisomant (marketed by Pfizer Inc.) is a daily injectable growth hormone receptor antagonist and is generally used in patients not fully controlled on somatostatin analogs. Orally administered dopamine agonists, such as bromocriptine and cabergoline, are also used. In terms of other products in clinical development, all of them are new formulations of peptide somatostatin agonists or GH receptor antagonists. Chiasma, Inc. is in Phase 3 development for an oral octreotide product candidate for the maintenance therapy of adult patients with acromegaly in whom prior treatment with somatostatin analogs has been shown to be effective and tolerated. Other companies developing new pharmaceutical therapies for acromegaly include Camurus AB, Dauntless Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Enesi Pharma Limited, Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc./Antisense Therapeutics Ltd., MidaTech Pharma PLC, Aquestive Therapeutics, Inc. and Ono Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. 
 With respect to CRN01941, injected depots of peptide somatostatin analogs are used as therapy for NETs. In adults whose carcinoid syndrome symptoms are inadequately controlled by somatostatin therapy, telotristat ethyl (marketed by Lexicon Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) is an orally administered add-on therapy. Targeted therapies everolimus (marketed by Novartis) and sunitinib malate (marketed by Pfizer) are typically only used in patients with high grade tumors which constitute only a small fraction of NETs. In 2018, the FDA approved Novartis’ Lutathera for the treatment of somatostatin receptor positive gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. Companies in Phase 3 development include Progenics Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and EUSA Pharma Inc. Other companies developing products for potential use in NETs include Apeiron Scientific, LLC, Camurus, Celgene Corporation, EpicentRx, Inc., Ipsen, Mateon Therapeutics, Inc., Merck & Co., Inc., MidaTech, Novartis, Oncoceutics, Inc. and Roche Holding AG.
 With respect to CHI, maintaining glucose levels through feeding or glucose infusions is the first step in managing the disease. Diazoxide (marketed by Teva Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) is the only approved therapy indicated for hyperinsulinemia. Octreotide (used off-label) is administered as subcutaneous injections in those who respond poorly to diazoxide. Patients who fail pharmacological therapy often progress to partial or nearly complete pancreatectomy, which can result in type I diabetes that must be managed for the remainder of the patient’s life. Companies in or entering Phase 3 are Eli Lilly and Company and Zealand Pharma A/S with glucagon analogs, and Xeris Pharmaceuticals, Inc. with glucagon Ready-To-Use (RTU). Other companies developing products for potential use in CHI include Eiger Biopharmaceuticals, Inc. and Rezolute, Inc. 
 As with acromegaly, first-line therapy for Cushing’s disease is surgery to remove the pituitary tumor if possible. Adrenal enzyme inhibitors (metyrapone, ketoconazole) prevent the synthesis of cortisol and can improve symptoms. Mifepristone (marketed by Corcept Therapeutics, Inc.), a glucocorticoid receptor antagonist, is approved for control of hyperglycemia in Cushing’s syndrome. The somatostatin agonist pasireotide is also approved for Cushing’s disease. Novartis and Strongbridge Biopharma are each conducting Phase 3 clinical trials with osilodrostat and levoketoconazole, respectively. Other companies developing products for potential use in Cushing’s disease include Corcept, Cyclacel Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Millendo Therapeutics, Inc. 
 There may be other earlier stage clinical programs that, if approved, would compete with our products. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we have. Additional mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical industry may result in even more resources being concentrated in our competitors. Competition may increase further as a result of advances made in the commercial applicability of technologies and greater availability of capital for investment in these fields. Our success will be based in part on our ability to build and actively manage a portfolio of drugs that addresses unmet medical needs and creates value in patient therapy. 
 Intellectual property 
 We strive to protect and enhance the proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are commercially important to our business, including seeking, maintaining and defending our patent rights. We own the issued patents and patent applications relating to our lead product candidate CRN00808, as well as our other product candidates. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing patent applications in the United States and in jurisdictions outside of the United States directed to our proprietary technology, inventions, improvements and product candidates that are important to the development and implementation of our business. We also rely on trade secrets and know-how relating to our proprietary technology and product candidates and continuing innovation to develop, strengthen and maintain our proprietary position in the field of endocrinology. We also plan to rely on data exclusivity, market exclusivity and patent term extensions when available. Our commercial success will depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for our technology, inventions and improvements; to preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets; to defend and enforce our proprietary rights, including any patents that we may own in the future; and to operate without infringing on the valid and enforceable patents and other proprietary rights of third parties. 
 17

We own three U.S. patents, three pending U.S. patent applications, six pending U.S. provisional patent applications and twenty-eight pending foreign patent applications, three of which are international patent applications filed under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) and three of which are European regional patent applications. More specifically, we own one U.S. patent with claims directed to our lead product candidate CRN00808 and other related compounds, as a composition of matter, as well as claims directed to pharmaceutical compositions and uses of such compounds, including the use of CRN00808, to treat acromegaly, neuroendocrine tumors, and/or pain. This U.S. patent is expected to expire in July 2037, absent any patent term extensions for regulatory delay. The other patents and patent applications are directed to various compounds as compositions of matter, pharmaceutical compositions comprising such compounds, and related methods of using such compounds. These issued patents, and any patents that may issue from our pending patent applications are expected to expire between 2036 and 2039, absent any patent term adjustments or extensions. We also possess substantial know-how and trade secrets relating to the development and commercialization of our product candidates, including related manufacturing processes and technology. We also own three trademark registration applications. 
 With respect to our product candidates and processes we intend to develop and commercialize in the normal course of business, we intend to pursue patent protection covering, when possible, compositions, methods of use, dosing and formulations. We may also pursue patent protection with respect to manufacturing and drug development processes and technologies. 
 Issued patents can provide protection for varying periods of time, depending upon the date of filing of the patent application, the date of patent issuance and the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In general, patents issued for applications filed in the United States can provide exclusionary rights for 20 years from the earliest effective filing date. In addition, in certain instances, the term of an issued U.S. patent that covers or claims an FDA approved product can be extended to recapture a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period, which is called patent term extension. The restoration period cannot be longer than five years and the total patent term, including the restoration period, must not exceed 14 years following FDA approval. The term of patents outside of the United States varies in accordance with the laws of the foreign jurisdiction, but typically is also 20 years from the earliest effective filing date. However, the actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product-by-product basis, from country-to-country, and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory-related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country and the validity and enforceability of the patent. 
 The patent positions of companies like ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. No consistent policy regarding the scope of claims allowable in patents in the field of endocrinology has emerged in the United States. The relevant patent laws and their interpretation outside of the United States is also uncertain. Changes in either the patent laws or their interpretation in the United States and other countries may diminish our ability to protect our technology or product candidates and could affect the value of such intellectual property. In particular, our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing products that infringe our intellectual property will depend in part on our success in obtaining and enforcing patent claims that cover our technology, inventions and improvements. We cannot guarantee that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications we may file in the future, nor can we be sure that any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our products, the methods of use or manufacture of those products. Moreover, even our issued patents do not guarantee us the right to practice our technology in relation to the commercialization of our products. Patent and other intellectual property rights in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology space are evolving and involve many risks and uncertainties. For example, third parties may have blocking patents that could be used to prevent us from commercializing our product candidates and practicing our proprietary technology, and our issued patents may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing related products or could limit the term of patent protection that otherwise may exist for our product candidates. In addition, the scope of the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar technology. Furthermore, our competitors may independently develop similar technologies that are outside the scope of the rights granted under any issued patents. For these reasons, we may face competition with respect to our product candidates. Moreover, because of the extensive time required for development, testing and regulatory review of a potential product, it is possible that, before any particular product candidate can be commercialized, any patent protection for such product may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing the commercial advantage the patent provides. 
 In addition, most of our intellectual property rights, including those for our lead programs, have been generated through the use of U.S. government funding provided from our Small Business Innovation Research Grants, or SBIR Grants, awarded to us by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases of the National Institutes of Health, and are therefore subject to certain federal regulations. As a result, the U.S. government may have certain rights to intellectual property embodied in our current or future product candidates pursuant to the Bayh-Dole Act of 1980. These U.S. government rights include a non-exclusive, non-transferable, irrevocable worldwide license to use inventions for any 
 18

governmental purpose. In addition, the U.S. government has the right, under certain limited circumstances, to require us to grant exclusive, partially exclusive, or non-exclusive licenses to any of these inventions to a third party in certain circumstances. The U.S. government also has the right to take title to these inventions if we fail to disclose the invention to the government or fail to file an application to register the intellectual property within specified time limits. 
 Manufacturing 
 Manufacturing, testing and storage of our product candidates for nonclinical and clinical studies is conducted at third-party contract manufacturers and distributors. We do not plan to build plants or facilities for development or commercial scale manufacture or storage of our product candidates. To date, the contract manufacturers have met our manufacturing requirements, and we expect them to be capable of providing sufficient quantities of our product candidates to meet estimated full-scale commercial needs. However, the contract manufacturers may be required to increase production scale, or we may need to secure alternate suppliers. 
 Sales and marketing 
 We intend to build the commercial infrastructure in major markets to effectively support the commercialization of our product candidates, if and when we believe a regulatory approval of the first of such product candidates in a particular geographic market appears imminent. The commercial infrastructure for orphan products typically consists of a targeted, specialty sales force that calls on a focused group of physicians supported by sales management, medical liaisons, internal sales support, an internal marketing group and distribution support. One challenge unique to commercializing therapies for rare diseases is the difficulty in identifying eligible patients due to the very small and sometimes heterogeneous disease populations. 
 Additional capabilities important to the orphan marketplace include the management of key accounts, such as managed care organizations, group purchasing organizations, specialty pharmacies and government accounts. To develop the appropriate commercial infrastructure, we will have to invest significant amounts of financial and management resources, some of which will be committed prior to any confirmation that any of our product candidates will be approved. 
 Where appropriate, we may elect in the future to utilize strategic partners, distributors or contract sales forces to assist in the commercialization of our product candidates. In certain instances, we may consider building our own commercial infrastructure. 
 Government regulation 
 Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, marketing and export and import of products such as those we are developing. A new drug must be approved by the FDA through the new drug application, or NDA, process before it may be legally marketed in the United States. 
 U.S. drug development process 
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDCA, and its implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. 
 The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 
  
• | completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in accordance with GLP regulations and other applicable regulations;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practice, or GCP, regulations to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its intended use;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an NDA;
--+---------------------------------

 19

--+------------------------------------

 Once a pharmaceutical candidate is identified for development, it enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, to the FDA as part of the IND. The sponsor will also include a protocol detailing, among other things, the objectives of the first phase of the clinical trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated, if the first phase lends itself to an efficacy evaluation. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, places the clinical trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. Clinical holds also may be imposed by the FDA at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns about on-going or proposed clinical trials or non-compliance with specific FDA requirements, and the trials may not begin or continue until the FDA notifies the sponsor that the hold has been lifted. 
 All clinical trials must be conducted under the supervision of one or more qualified investigators in accordance with GCP regulations, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial. They must be conducted under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the safety and effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND, and timely safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events. An IRB at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve each protocol before a clinical trial commences at that institution and must also approve the information regarding the trial and the consent form that must be provided to each trial subject or his or her legal representative, monitor the study until completed and otherwise comply with IRB regulations. 
 Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined: 
  
• | Phase 1: The product candidate is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, such as cancer, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients. Sponsors sometimes designate their Phase 1 clinical trials as Phase 1a or Phase 1b. Phase 1b clinical trials are typically aimed at confirming dosing, pharmacokinetics and safety in larger number of patients. Some Phase 1b studies evaluate biomarkers or surrogate markers that may be associated with efficacy in patients with specific types of diseases. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2: This phase involves clinical trials in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and appropriate dosage. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3: Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical study sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk-benefit ratio of the product candidate and provide, if appropriate, an adequate basis for product labeling. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 studies, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of an NDA. 
 The FDA or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. In addition, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. Depending on its charter, this group may determine whether a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the trial. 
 During the development of a new drug, sponsors are given opportunities to meet with the FDA at certain points. These points may be prior to submission of an IND, at the end of Phase 2, and before an NDA is submitted. Meetings at other times may 
 20

be requested. These meetings can provide an opportunity for the sponsor to share information about the data gathered to date, for the FDA to provide advice, and for the sponsor and the FDA to reach agreement on the next phase of development. Sponsors typically use the meetings at the end of the Phase 2 trial to discuss Phase 2 clinical results and present plans for the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials that they believe will support approval of the new drug. 
 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug. In addition, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 
 While the IND is active and before approval, progress reports summarizing the results of the clinical trials and nonclinical studies performed since the last progress report must be submitted at least annually to the FDA, and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and investigators for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, findings from other studies suggesting a significant risk to humans exposed to the same or similar drugs, findings from animal or in vitro testing suggesting a significant risk to humans, and any clinically important increased incidence of a serious suspected adverse reaction compared to that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. 
 There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed trial results to public registries. Sponsors of certain clinical trials of FDA-regulated products are required to register and disclose specified clinical trial information, which is publicly available at www.clinicaltrials.gov. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, trial sites and investigators and other aspects of the clinical trial is then made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to discuss the results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed until the new product or new indication being studied has been approved. 
 U.S. review and approval process 
 The results of product development, preclinical and other non-clinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the chemistry of the drug, proposed labeling and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product. The submission of an NDA is subject to the payment of substantial user fees; a waiver of such fees may be obtained under certain limited circumstances. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing is cGMP-compliant to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, guidelines that are currently in effect, the FDA has a goal of ten months from the date of “filing” of a standard NDA for a new molecular entity to review and act on the submission. This review typically takes twelve months from the date the NDA is submitted to FDA because the FDA has approximately two months to make a “filing” decision after it the application is submitted. The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days after submission, before accepting them for filing, to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. 
 The FDA may refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA may inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCP requirements. 
 After the FDA evaluates an NDA, it will issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete, and the application will not be approved in its present form. A Complete Response Letter usually describes the specific deficiencies in the NDA identified by the FDA and may require additional clinical data, such as an additional pivotal Phase 3 trial or other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, nonclinical studies or manufacturing. If a Complete Response Letter is issued, the sponsor must resubmit the NDA or, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. 
 21

If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. In addition, the FDA may require a sponsor to conduct Phase 4 testing, which involves clinical trials designed to further assess a drug’s safety and effectiveness after NDA approval, and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products which have been commercialized. The FDA may also place other conditions on approval including the requirement for a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, to assure the safe use of the drug. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the NDA must submit a proposed REMS. The FDA will not approve the NDA without an approved REMS, if required. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. Any of these limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the commercial promotion, distribution, prescription or dispensing of products. Marketing approval may be withdrawn for non-compliance with regulatory requirements or if problems occur following initial marketing. 
 The Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, requires a sponsor to conduct pediatric clinical trials for most drugs, for a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration. Under PREA, original NDAs and supplements must contain a pediatric assessment unless the sponsor has received a deferral or waiver. The required assessment must evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The sponsor or FDA may request a deferral of pediatric clinical trials for some or all of the pediatric subpopulations. A deferral may be granted for several reasons, including a finding that the drug is ready for approval for use in adults before pediatric clinical trials are complete or that additional safety or effectiveness data needs to be collected before the pediatric clinical trials begin. The FDA must send a non-compliance letter to any sponsor that fails to submit the required assessment, keep a deferral current or fails to submit a request for approval of a pediatric formulation. 
 Orphan drug designation 
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States or, if it affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States, there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. Orphan designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. 
 If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity or inability to manufacture the product in sufficient quantities. The designation of such drug also entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages and user-fee waivers. However, competitors, may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity. Orphan exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our product candidates for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same drug as defined by the FDA or if our product candidate is determined to be contained within the competitor’s product for the same indication or disease. In addition, if an orphan designated product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan exclusivity. 
 Expedited development and review programs 
 The FDA has a fast track designation program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drug products that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new drugs are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. Unique to a fast track product, the FDA may consider for review sections of the NDA on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the NDA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the NDA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA. 
 Any product submitted to the FDA for approval, including a product with a fast track designation, may also be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. A product is eligible for priority review if it has the potential to provide safe and effective therapy where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists or a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease compared to marketed products. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new drug 
 22

designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review. The FDA endeavors to review applications with priority review designations within six months of the filing date as compared to ten months for review of new molecular entity NDAs under its current PDUFA review goals. 
 In addition, a product may be eligible for accelerated approval. Drug products intended to treat serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions may be eligible for accelerated approval upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product. Fast track designation, priority review and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process. 
 The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, established a category of drugs referred to as “breakthrough therapies” that may be eligible to receive breakthrough therapy designation. A sponsor may seek FDA designation of a product candidate as a “breakthrough therapy” if the product is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other products, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The designation includes all of the fast track program features, as well as more intensive FDA interaction and guidance. The breakthrough therapy designation is a distinct status from both accelerated approval and priority review, which can also be granted to the same drug if relevant criteria are met. If a product is designated as breakthrough therapy, the FDA will work to expedite the development and review of such drug. 
 Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. We may explore some of these opportunities for our product candidates as appropriate. 
 Post-approval requirements 
 Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, certain manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further FDA review and approval. Drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP regulations and other laws and regulations. In addition, the FDA may impose a number of post-approval requirements as a condition of approval of an NDA. For example, the FDA may require post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization. 
 Any drug products manufactured or distributed by us or our partners pursuant to FDA approvals will be subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the drug, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, drug sampling and distribution requirements, complying with certain electronic records and signature requirements, and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements. The FDA strictly regulates labeling, advertising, promotion and other types of information on products that are placed on the market and imposes requirements and restrictions on drug manufacturers, such as those related to direct-to-consumer advertising, the prohibition on promoting products for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the product’s approved labeling (known as “off-label use”), industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the internet. Discovery of previously unknown problems or the failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements may result in restrictions on the marketing of a product or withdrawal of the product from the market as well as possible civil or criminal sanctions. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant or manufacturer to administrative or judicial civil or criminal sanctions and adverse publicity. FDA sanctions could include refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, clinical holds on post-approval clinical trials, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, debarment, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal penalties. 
 23

Marketing exclusivity 
 Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA can delay the submission or the approval of certain marketing applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to obtain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve or even accept for review an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or an NDA submitted under Section 505(b)(2), or 505(b)(2) NDA, submitted by another company for another drug based on the same active moiety, regardless of whether the drug is intended for the same indication as the original innovative drug or for another indication, where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement to one of the patents listed with the FDA by the innovator NDA holder. The FDCA alternatively provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the modification for which the drug received approval on the basis of the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs or 505(b)(2) NDAs for drugs containing the active agent for the original indication or condition of use. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. 
 Pediatric exclusivity is another type of marketing exclusivity available in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity provides for an additional six months of marketing exclusivity attached to another period of exclusivity if a sponsor conducts clinical trials in children in response to a written request from the FDA. The issuance of a written request does not require the sponsor to undertake the described clinical trials. In addition, orphan drug exclusivity, as described above, may offer a seven-year period of marketing exclusivity, except in certain circumstances. 
 U.S. coverage and reimbursement 
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any therapeutic product candidate for which we may seek regulatory approval. Sales in the United States will depend in part on the availability of sufficient coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors, which include government health programs such as Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE and the Veterans Administration, as well as managed care organizations and private health insurers. Prices at which we or our customers seek reimbursement for our therapeutic product candidates can be subject to challenge, reduction or denial by payors. 
 The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product is typically separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be available. Additionally, in the United States there is no uniform policy among payors for coverage or reimbursement. Third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own coverage and reimbursement policies, but also have their own methods and approval processes. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for products can differ significantly from payor to payor. If coverage and adequate reimbursement are not available, or are available only at limited levels, successful commercialization of, and obtaining a satisfactory financial return on, any product we develop may not be possible. 
 Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. In order to obtain coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for marketing, we may need to conduct expensive studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of any products, which would be in addition to the costs expended to obtain regulatory approvals. Third-party payors may not consider our product candidates to be medically necessary or cost-effective compared to other available therapies, or the rebate percentages required to secure favorable coverage may not yield an adequate margin over cost or may not enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in drug development. 
 Healthcare reform 
 In the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and continue to be, several legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of drug product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities, and affect the profitable sale of drug product candidates. 
 Among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access. In the 
 24

United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives. In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as subsequently amended by as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, collectively the ACA, was passed, which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both the government and private insurers, and significantly impacts the U.S. pharmaceutical industry. The ACA, as amended, among other things: (1) increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and extends the rebate program to individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations; (2) established an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents apportioned among these entities according to their market share in some government healthcare programs; (3) expanded the availability of lower pricing under the 340B drug pricing program by adding new entities to the program; (4) increased the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program; (5) expanded the eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs; (6) created a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research; (7) created a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 70% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D; (8) established a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research; and (9) established a Center for Medicare Innovation at the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drugs. 
 Some of the provisions of the ACA have yet to be implemented, and there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, as well as recent efforts by the Trump administration to repeal or replace certain aspects of the ACA. For example, President Trump has signed Executive Orders and other directives designed to delay the implementation of certain provisions of the ACA or otherwise circumvent some of the requirements for health insurance mandated by the ACA. Concurrently, Congress has considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the ACA. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the ACA have been signed into law. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 includes a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate.” On December 14, 2018, a U.S. District Court Judge in the Northern District of Texas, or the Texas District Court Judge, ruled that the individual mandate is a critical and inseverable feature of the ACA, and therefore, because it was repealed as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. While the Trump Administration and CMS have both stated that the ruling will have no immediate effect, and on December 30, 2018 the Texas District Court Judge issued an order staying the judgment pending appeal, it is unclear how this decision, subsequent appeals and other efforts to repeal and replace the ACA will impact the ACA and our business.  Further, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, among other things, amends the ACA, effective January 1, 2019, to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the “donut hole.” 
 Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted, including aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year and reduced payments to several types of Medicare providers. Moreover, there has recently been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products., Congress and the Trump administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. 
 On May 30, 2018, the Trickett Wendler, Frank Mongiello, Jordan McLinn, and Matthew Bellina Right to Try Act of 2017, or Right to Try Act, was signed into law. The law, among other things, provides a federal framework for patients to access certain investigational new drug products that have completed a Phase I clinical trial. Under certain circumstances, eligible patients can seek treatment without enrolling in clinical trials and without obtaining FDA approval under the FDA expanded access program. The Right to Try Act did not establish any new entitlement or positive right to any party or individual, nor did it create any new mandates, directives, or additional regulations requiring a manufacturer or sponsor of an eligible investigational new drug product to provide expanded access.

U.S. healthcare fraud and abuse laws and compliance requirements 
 Federal and state healthcare laws and regulations restrict business practices in the biopharmaceutical industry. These laws include anti-kickback and false claims laws and regulations, data privacy and security, and transparency laws and regulations. 
 The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease or order of any item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act and the civil monetary penalties statute. 
 The federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, prohibit, among other things, any individual or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. 
 The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created additional federal civil and criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program. In addition, HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of protected health information on HIPAA covered entities, which include certain healthcare provider, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses, and their business associates who conduct certain activities involving protected health information on their behalf. 
 The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to report annually to CMS information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians, certain other healthcare professionals, and teaching hospitals, and applicable manufacturers and applicable group purchasing organizations to report annually to CMS ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. 
 Similar state and foreign laws and regulations may also restrict business practices in the biopharmaceutical industry, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to business practices, including but not limited to, research, distribution, sales and marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non- governmental third-party payors, including private insurers, or by patients themselves; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; state laws and regulations that require drug manufacturers to file reports relating to pricing and marketing information, which requires tracking gifts and other remuneration and items of value provided to physicians, other healthcare providers and entities; state and local laws that require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives; and state and foreign laws governing the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts. 
 Efforts to ensure compliance with applicable healthcare laws and regulations can involve substantial costs. Violations of healthcare laws can result in significant penalties, including the imposition of significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other U.S. healthcare programs, integrity oversight and reporting obligations, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and curtailment or restructuring of operations. 
 Employees 
 As of February 28, 2019, we had 47 full-time employees, 16 of whom have a Ph.D. or M.D., and 2 part-time employees. None of our employees are represented by labor unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good. In addition, we rely on a number of consultants to assist us.
Insurance
 We maintain limited product liability insurance coverage for our clinical trials in the amount of $10 million per occurrence and $10 million in the aggregate. However, insurance coverage is becoming increasingly expensive, and we may not be able to obtain or maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses due to liability.
