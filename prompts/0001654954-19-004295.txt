 Business


  Overview
  
 We provide services and products to both government and private sector clients, with an emphasis on public safety, risk management and workforce solutions. Currently, as a leading provider of support services to the government contracting market, our primary clients are companies that serve the government. We provide professional services that offer scalable and compliant outsourced support to these companies. We help these clients capture business by winning government contracts and perform their contract requirements. We also provide specialized staffing services primarily in the aerospace and aviation industries to help clients manage risk by giving them the tools to be prepared for, and respond to, disruptive events and creating secure environments.
  
 A small but growing part of our business provides and manages public safety products and systems. As part of this business, we have been working since 2017 to develop and field test a line of mobile products and related services for use by law enforcement and other public safety entities. These operations are conducted by our Rekor Recognition Systems, Inc. subsidiary, which was formerly named Brekford Traffic Safety, Inc. and is herein referred to as “Brekford”. In connection with this effort, in March 2019 we acquired substantially all of the assets of OpenALPR Technology, Inc., as more fully described below. These assets are now held in our new subsidiary, OpenALPR Software Solutions, LLC (“OpenALPR”). For the purpose of this Annual Report on Form 10-K any references to OpenALPR are to OpenALPR Technology, Inc. prior to March 12, 2019 and to OpenALPR Software Solutions, LLC on and after March 12, 2019. The technology we acquired currently has the capability to analyze images produced by almost any Internet Protocol (“IP”) camera and identify license plates from over 70 countries, as well as the make, model and color of the vehicle. Our new line of mobile public safety equipment employs this technology and ownership of the rights to the technology allows us to protect what we believe are significant competitive advantages for this new line of products. In addition, due to the advantages we see in the accuracy and speed of this technology, as well as its ability to be used with many widely available camera systems, we also believe that this technology can be used more broadly in the global vehicle recognition system market and serve other large markets in the transportation, security and logistics areas, as more fully described below.
  
 As a result of the increasing involvement of technology in our operations, our Board of Directors has determined to organize our operations into two separate divisions, commencing with the first quarter of 2019. One division will be responsible for our businesses that provide professional services for the government contracting market, and staffing services for the aerospace and aviation markets, while the other division will be responsible for our activities in developing technology and distributing and licensing products and services for the public safety, vehicle recognition markets. In connection with this internal reorganization, we also expect to evaluate the possibility of reconfiguring, selling or discontinuing various business assets or entities.

  Professional and Specialty Staffing Services
  
  Government Contracting Support
  
 Our services assist government contractors with critical aspects of their business. Our services include: market intelligence and opportunity identification; capture and strategic advisory; proposal strategy and development; teaming support; and managed human capital services. Our services also help commercially-focused firms gain entry into the government contracting market. Since 1998, we have assisted our clients with over $144 billion of government contract awards.
 Specialty Staffing Services
  
 We provide quality specialized contract personnel, temp-to-hire professionals, direct hires, and temporary or seasonal hires to the Department of Defense and a diverse group of companies in the aerospace and aviation industry nationally and have been instrumental in placing highly-skilled technical professionals in some of the world’s most prestigious engineering firms and government facilities for over 20 years. Some of the professionals that we place in the aerospace and aviation industry include: FAA certified airframe and power plant mechanics; avionics and embedded software engineers; FCC certified avionic technicians; licensed aircraft inspectors; flight test engineers; process/repair engineers; and simulation engineers. Specialty staffing is a service that most large aviation and aerospace companies need due to the time-sensitive aspects of their contracts, and our customers use specialty staffing to fulfill a variety of roles.
 Vehicle Recognition, Public Safety and Risk Management Products and Services
  
  Vehicle Recognition and Public Safety Products and Services
  
 In 2018, we provided traffic safety systems to a number of municipalities in North America. These systems include hardware that identifies red light and school safety zone traffic violations and software that captures and records forensic images, analyses the images to provide data and supports citation management services. Since 2017, we have been working to develop and field-test a line of mobile vehicle recognition products and related services for use by law enforcement and other public safety entities. These products include innovative systems that assist in identifying and enforcing violations involving emergency vehicles and school buses, as well as other products and services that can identify vehicles using fixed- and mobile-camera systems. These products have applications for electronic toll collection, traffic management, parking, insurance and banking industries, as well as law enforcement.
  
 In March 2019, we acquired substantially all of the assets of a software development company, OpenALPR, as more fully described below. With this acquisition, we currently provide vehicle recognition and data management services covering paid contracts for over 9,000 cameras to customers in over 70 countries. The services, which operate in many installations at over a 99% accuracy rate, include a web server, self-managed database, and access to a powerful, cross-platform application programming interface. The software employs a convolutional neural network architecture to classify images and features include seamless video analysis and data analytics. Current customers include law enforcement agencies, highway authorities, parking system operators, private security companies, and wholesale and retail operations supporting logistics and customer loyalty programs.
  
  Risk Management Products and Services
  
 We help clients to both anticipate and evaluate risks and manage disruptive events when they occur. We assess, audit, develop, train and test strategies and programs encompassing predictive intelligence, business continuity, risk assessment, crisis management and communications, emergency and cyber incident response, behavioral risk and threat assessment, and workplace violence prevention. We are focused on prevention, in addition to planning and response initiatives. For example, BERTHA®, our behavioral risk and threat assessment program, positions schools, businesses and other organizations to prevent violence from occurring. This program helps our clients to identify early warning signs that may be exhibited by an individual before they are on a path to violence. In 2018, to complement our existing risk assessment, training and certification programs for child care programs and schools, we launched our FirstSight™ program to actively monitor social media activities of concern and provide assistance in taking appropriate preventive actions.

  Our Markets
 
  The Government Contracting Support Industry
  
 According to the U. S. Treasury, the total dollar value of federal government contracts awarded over each of the last ten fiscal years has ranged from a high of approximately $560 billion in fiscal year 2010 to a low of approximately $440 billion in fiscal year 2015, creating a stable markets for support services. According to the U.S. federal government’s System for Award Management (“SAM”) database, as of March 18, 2019, there were over 492,000 government contractors, of which over 49,000 are located in Washington, DC, Maryland and Virginia, many of which are located in an area commonly known as the “Beltway” and are in close proximity to our headquarters. The U.S. federal government’s contract spending in Washington, DC, Maryland and Virginia was more than $115 billion in fiscal year 2018, according to USASpending.gov. This represents over 21% of the $544 billion of total contract spending in fiscal year 2018. We believe these factors provide growth opportunities for us.
  
 Because of the geographic concentration of these clients, there is also a large, but fragmented, concentration of service providers for these companies. Although the businesses that provide resources to the government contracting sector are diverse and highly fragmented, their clients have many common needs resulting from the basic qualifications and standard requirements inherent in the government procurement process. We believe that there may be additional opportunities for consolidation in this sector, both in the Washington, DC market, and in other parts of the country, but our immediate goal is to improve our ability to serve this sector by pooling our subsidiaries’ resources and client contacts.
  
  Clients
  
 To be a government contractor, a company must be able to meet rigid standards. As a result, our clients are typically well-established, financially-stable businesses with both a reputation for excellence and high standards and a demonstrated ability to survive and prosper through innovation and adaptation. The U.S. federal government’s SAM database as of March 18, 2019 includes over 492,000 government contractors and over 49,000 are located in Washington, DC, Maryland and Virginia. Government contractors range from small privately-owned lifestyle companies to members of the Fortune 100. Since 1983, we have served thousands of these entities. In 2018, we provided services to 14 of the Top 100 largest federal contractors (based on their fiscal 2017 prime contracts in IT, systems integration, professional services and telecommunications) as identified by Washington Technology (https://washingtontechnology.com/toplists/top-100-lists/2018.aspx).
 Marketing and Sales
  
 We obtain client engagements primarily through business development efforts, cross-selling of our services to existing clients, and maintaining client relationships, as well as referrals from existing and former clients. Our business development efforts emphasize lead generation, industry group networking and corporate visibility. Most of our business development efforts are led by members of our professional teams, who are also responsible for managing projects. Our business development efforts are further supported by personnel located at our corporate headquarters. We are working to position ourselves as a preferred, single-source provider of specialized professional services to our clients. As our service offerings become more diverse, we anticipate increasing our cross-selling opportunities. Our goals are to offer a broader range of services to existing clients and to broaden our client base using our existing value-added solutions.
 Competition
  
 In the government contracting industry, the sectors in which we operate are highly fragmented and characterized by many smaller companies generally having fewer than ten employees. These companies tend to focus their operations on local customers or specialized niche activities. As a result, we compete with many smaller, more specialized companies that concentrate their resources in particular areas of expertise. The extent of our competition varies according to sectors and geographic areas. We believe we compete on quality of service, relevant experience, staffing capabilities, reputation, geographic presence, stability, and price. Price differentiation remains an important element in competitive tendering and is a significant factor in bidding for contracts. The importance of the foregoing factors varies widely based upon the nature, location, and scale of our clients’ needs. We believe that certain economies of scale can be realized by service providers that establish a national presence and reputation for providing high-quality and cost-effective services. Our ability to compete successfully will depend upon the effectiveness of our marketing efforts, the strength of our client relationships, our ability to accurately estimate costs and bid for work, the quality of the work we perform and our ability to hire and train qualified personnel.

  Competitive Strengths
  
 We believe we have developed a strong reputation for quality service in the government contracting market based upon our industry-recognized depth of experience, ability to attract and retain quality professionals, and expertise across multiple service sectors. We employ seasoned professionals with a broad array of specialties, a strong customer service orientation and in many cases, the required professional certifications and advanced degrees. As of March 31, 2019, 100% of our management and staff involved with proposal services received a Foundation Certification by the Association of Proposal Management Professionals. Our executive officers have significant operating and management experience and have been involved in analyzing potential acquisition transactions. We place a high priority on attracting, motivating and retaining top professionals to serve our clients, and our compensation system emphasizes the use of performance-based incentives, including opportunities for stock ownership, to achieve this objective. The services that we provide are highly-specialized professional services that have high barriers to entry. While we have a base of in-house professionals, we also have access to a very large group of consultants who can provide subject matter expertise for unique projects and who can supplement our workforce based on client demand. Our combination of niche market experience and professionals with requisite expertise has enabled us to develop strong relationships with our core clients. By serving clients on a long-term basis, we are able to gain a deep understanding of their overall business needs as well as the unique technical requirements of their projects. This increased understanding gives us the opportunity to provide superior value to our clients by allowing us to more fully assess and better manage the risks inherent in their projects.
 Growth Strategies
  
 In the government contracting market, we seek to expand our market share in our current areas of expertise. The universe of providers that service our clients is fragmented and diverse. Drawing on the insights and experience of our combined leadership team, we expect to both increase our contact with, and improve our understanding of, the needs of the enterprises we serve. By working together under common leadership, we believe our combined companies can better identify the qualities in our companies that the world’s leading businesses value most. We will then work to further enhance each company’s ability to perform in these areas by providing material support as well as exchanges of talent and ideas. By using our increased contact with our clients, we will also be working to enhance our clients’ awareness of these capabilities across our subsidiaries.
 Vehicle Recognition and Public Safety Industry
  
 The market for vehicle recognition products and services is diverse and includes: toll collection and traffic management; parking management and enforcement; safe cities programs; government, military, corporate, community and personal security; and wholesale and large retail logistics and customer loyalty programs, as well as public safety. Currently, our presence in these markets through OpenALPR and Brekford is small and concentrated mostly in North America. In 2016, IHS Market estimated that the number of cameras installed in North America would grow to over 60 million security cameras by 2016 and that 130 million surveillance cameras would be shipped globally in 2018. A substantial percentage of these cameras provide digital images that can be transferred over electronic networks and analyzed by software from OpenALPR.
 Clients
  
 Our clients in the public safety and vehicle recognition markets include governmental entities in the United States and Canada and major retailers, private security companies and parking management companies in these countries and others. We continue to explore new applications to further expand this growing client base. Brekford developed a first-of-its-kind camera and data management system designed to track and monitor violations of “move over” laws. The National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund reports that during the period from 2009 through 2018, 122 police officers have been killed when struck by vehicles in the United States. The Emergency Responder Safety Institute estimates that about seven emergency workers and 50 tow operators are killed annually by passing vehicles in U.S. In addition, we believe that there are many unreported injuries and near misses.
 Marketing and Sales
  
 We offer our products services in the public safety and vehicle recognition markets through a combination of programs. For existing traffic safety clients, our services include hardware installation and maintenance, as well as forensic database and citation management services. With the launch of our new Guardian line, the products and services we provide for law enforcement are expected to concentrate increasingly on the leasing of our hardware in conjunction with software services, based on processing fees. OpenALPR currently sells licenses for the use of its software on a per camera basis, as well as selling the services of license plate recognitions and database storage and support.

  Competition
  
 Our current emphasis in the public safety and vehicle recognition markets is on products and services that include license plate recognition features. There are several large operators currently engaged in providing these products and services, including ELSAG North America (a subsidiary of Leonardo – Società per azioni), Genetec Inc., Vigilant Solutions (now a division of Motorola Solutions), and ARH Inc. (based in Hungary). These vendors generally supply camera systems that use computer vision techniques based on optical character recognition algorithms to generate data in the form of license plate numbers with issuing jurisdiction. There are also a number of competitors developing and marketing artificial intelligence-based ALPR systems, including Sighthound Inc., PlateSmart Technologies, INEX Technologies, NueralLabs, Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology Co., Ltd., ARH, Inc. and NDI Recognition Systems, among others. The software developed by OpenALPR uses specialized neural network algorithms and takes advantage of over five years of machine learning using images from across the globe. Comparisons made by both OpenALPR personnel and independent evaluators indicate OpenALPR has high levels of accuracy for recognition of license plate numbers and issuing jurisdiction. In addition, the software can identify the make, model and color of the car and provides accurate readings from the images produced by lower-cost security cameras, which avoids the need to use specialized camera equipment. As a result, we believe that our products and services in this market currently can offer significant advantages in accuracy, usability and price that provide us with a competitive edge.
 Competitive Strengths
  
 In the public safety and vehicle recognition market, we believe we have, and can further develop, the following competitive strengths:
  
  ● 
 Higher Accuracy Rates for Vehicle Recognitions. Most existing vehicle recognition systems currently in place are accurate only within specified parameters of vehicle speed, viewing angles and lighting conditions. We believe OpenALPR software achieves superior accuracy rates under broader parameters of vehicle speed, viewing angles and lighting conditions.

 
  ● 
 Ability to Detect Make, Model and Color of Vehicle. We believe the ability to determine the make, model and color of a vehicle, in addition to the number and resident jurisdiction of a license plate, significantly enhances the value of our products and services as compared to systems that provide more limited recognition data or lower accuracy rates.

 
  ● 
 Functionality with any Internet Protocol Cameras. The optical character recognition-based systems marketed by our competitors in the public safety and vehicle recognition market often require customized cameras, while OpenALPR supports images captured by almost any digital camera that provides images that can be sent over the Internet. This allows us to create products and solutions using relatively inexpensive, consumer-grade, mass market components that are readily available, significantly smaller and lighter, and less expensive than products currently being used.

 
  ● 
 Increased Mobility. Because of the range and size of the cameras that can be used with OpenALPR software, Brekford’s new Guardian line of products will have significant advantages for use in mobile applications, such as law enforcement vehicles.

 
  Growth Strategies
  
 Our current emphasis for growth is to concentrate available resources on expanding sales of products and services that exploit the competitive advantages of our license plate reading technology. In particular, we are working to further develop our existing cloud-based subscription services for smaller clients and license our technology to original equipment manufacturers and large government and commercial customers for use with new and existing security, logistics, traffic management, vehicle location and customer loyalty systems. In pursuing larger government and enterprise clients, we intend to use the contacts, capabilities and resources of our legacy professional services businesses as we seek to expand our market. We are also working to develop a single operating system for use in connection with a variety of components in public safety vehicles, which will support products sold by other providers, as well as ours. In addition, we are taking steps toward qualifying our OpenALPR-based products and services to be available on the U.S. General Services Administration’s GSA Schedules Program.
  
 At the same time that we are working to develop the sales and marketing capabilities to support sales of new products, our development plan for technology-related products and services includes increasing our capabilities relating to subscription-based solutions providing access to software as a service (“SaaS”), as well as a bundling hardware and software as part of equipment leasing programs.
  
 In connection with our risk mitigation and crisis risk services, we are working to increase awareness of our initiatives by educating others on emerging threats and strategies to combat those threats through no-fee webinars, stress tests, and social media and blog articles. We partner with industry associations and aggregators to deliver meaningful risk mitigation strategies and education. We also serve clients ranging from large global companies to main street businesses across all industry sectors. We offer services to clients that enhance their ability to manage risk and respond to adverse events, thereby minimizing people, brand, reputation, financial, legal and regulatory impacts.

 Through our various businesses, we occasionally become aware of situations where our resources can play a critical role in bringing an organization to the next level in its development. Under appropriate circumstances we may acquire, receive or retain an interest in these organizations as part of our enterprise initiative. For example, we have retained a 19.9% interest in Global Public Safety, Inc., a growing provider of upfitting services for law enforcement vehicles, formerly owned by Brekford and now owned by LB&B Associates, Inc.
  
  Our History
  
 We are a Delaware corporation that was formed in February 2017 to effectuate the mergers of, and become a holding company for KeyStone Solutions, Inc. (“KeyStone”). Our services are currently provided through seven wholly owned subsidiaries: AOC Key Solutions, Inc. (“AOC Key Solutions”); Brekford; Firestorm Solutions, LLC and Firestorm Franchising, LLC (collectively referred to as “Firestorm” or the “Firestorm Entities”); Global Technical Services, Inc. (“GTS”) and Global Contract Professionals, Inc. (“GCP”) (collectively referred to as “Global” or the “Global Entities”); and as of March 12, 2019, OpenALPR. In 2018, the operations of Novume Media, Inc. (“Novume Media”) were discontinued. On February 28, 2019, we changed the name of Brekford to Rekor Recognition Systems, Inc. For narrative purposes, all references to Brekford are to this subsidiary under the name Brekford Traffic Safety, Inc. before February 28, 2019 and under the name Rekor Recognitions Systems, Inc. on and after February 28, 2019.
  
 AOC Key Solutions was originally organized in 1983. Brekford was organized in 1996. The Firestorm Entities were organized in 2005. The Global Entities were formed in 1989. OpenALPR was organized in 2015.
  
  Acquisitions
  
 Listed below is a summary of our acquisitions since January 2017. Additional information is provided in this Annual Report on Form 10-K under “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations.”
  
  ● 
 OpenALPR – On March 12, 2019, we completed our acquisition of substantially all of the assets of OpenALPR.

 

  ● 
 Secure Education Consultants – On January 1, 2018, we completed our acquisition of certain assets of Secure Education Consultants, LLC (“Secure Education”) by Firestorm Solutions, LLC (“Firestorm Solutions”).

 

  ● 
 BC Management – On December 31, 2017, we completed its acquisition of certain assets of BC Management, Inc. (“BC Management”) by Firestorm Solutions.

 

  ●

  ● 
 Brekford – On August 28, 2017, KeyStone and Brekford became wholly owned subsidies of Novume by way of merger. For the purpose of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, any references to KeyStone are to KeyStone Solutions, Inc. prior to August 28, 2017 and to KeyStone Solutions, LLC on and after August 28, 2017.

 

  ● 
 Firestorm – On January 25, 2017, we acquired the Firestorm Entities.

 
  Reportable Segments
  
 In 2018, we conducted core operations through our primary operating subsidiaries: AOC Key Solutions, Firestorm, Global and Brekford.
  
 Based on its analysis of operations, management has determined for the year ended December 31, 2018, Novume has only one operating and reportable segment. In 2018, the chief operating decision-maker did not consider entity, product, service or regional results separately and used aggregate results to make operating and strategic decisions. Therefore, we believe our entire operations were covered under a single reportable segment. With the recent acquisition of OpenALPR, we anticipate, beginning with the first quarter of 2019, changing our operating and reportable segments from one segment to two segments. The two segments are expected to reflect our separate management focus both on technology products and services and on professional services.
 Employees
  
 As of March 31, 2019, Novume had 505 employees, of which 122 were full time and 373 were project-based staff provided to our clients. We consider our employee relations to be good. To date, we have been able to locate and engage highly-qualified employees as needed and do not expect our growth efforts to be constrained by a lack of qualified personnel. We will, however, need to engage significant additional highly qualified personnel for our planned initiatives in the public safety and vehicle recognition markets.
 Trends and Seasonality
  
 We generate revenues from fees and reimbursable expenses for professional services primarily billed on an hourly rate, time-and-materials (“T&M”) basis. In the professional services and specialty staffing areas, or clients are typically invoiced monthly, with revenue recognized as the services are provided. Currently, T&M contracts represent over 87% of our client engagements in these areas and do not provide us with a high degree of predictability of future period performance. Approximately 12% of our contracts are fixed-fee engagements which can be invoiced once for the entire job, or there could be several “progress” invoices for accomplishing various phases, reaching contractual milestones or on a periodic basis.

 Novume’s financial results have been impacted principally by the demand by clients for support in the professional services and specialty staffing areas, the degree to which full-time staff can be kept occupied in revenue-generating activities, success of the sales team in generating client engagements, and number of business days in each quarter. The number of business days on which revenue is generated by our staff and consultants is affected by the number of vacation days taken, as well as the number of holidays in each quarter. There are typically fewer business work days available in the fourth quarter of the year, which can impact revenues during that period. The staff utilization rate can also be affected by seasonal variations in the demand for services from clients. Since earnings may be affected by these seasonal variations, results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year.
  
 Unexpected changes in the demand for our services can result in significant variations in revenues, and present a challenge to optimal hiring, staffing and use of consultants. The volume of work performed can vary from period to period.
  
 In our public safety activities, our revenues have typically been based on monthly reimbursements under long term contracts. These have been based on revenue generated in connection with the activities, which can vary according to seasonal trends. With the new line of products and services the Company is currently marketing, we expect to also experience seasonal variations where our income is based on the number of vehicle recognitions provided. However, we are also working to expand the number of contracts that provide fixed monthly payments on a per-camera basis.
  
  Insurance and Risk Management
  
 We maintain insurance covering professional liability and claims involving bodily injury, property and economic loss. We consider our present limits of coverage, deductibles, and reserves to be adequate. Whenever possible, we endeavor to eliminate or reduce the risk of loss on a project through the use of quality assurance and control, risk management, workplace safety, and other similar methods.
  
 Risk management is an integral part of our project management approach for fixed-price contracts and our project execution process. We also evaluate risk through internal risk analyses in which our management reviews higher-risk projects, contracts, or other business decisions that require corporate legal and risk management approval.
  
  Regulation
  
 We are regulated in some of the fields in which we operate. When working with governmental agencies and entities, we must comply with laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration, and performance of contracts. These laws and regulations contain terms that, among other things may require certification and disclosure of all costs or pricing data in connection with various contract negotiations. We also work with U.S. federal government contractors and have staff cleared to work on classified materials. Two of our leased facilities are cleared for classified material. We are subject to the laws and regulations that restrict the use and dissemination of information classified for national security purposes.
  
 To help ensure compliance with these laws and regulations, our employees are sometimes required to complete tailored ethics and other compliance training relevant to their position and our operations.
