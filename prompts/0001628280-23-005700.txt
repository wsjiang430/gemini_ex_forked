Our Industry
Attractive Pet Industry Trends. By year-end 2022, approximately 52% of total U.S. households owned a dog or cat, compared to 50% of total U.S. households in 2010. Packaged Facts estimates that by 2026 approximately 55% of United States households will own a pet:
▪Pet Humanization: In the United States, according to The Human Animal Bond Research Institute (HABRI) and Zoetis data for 2021, 95% of pet owners consider their pet a part of their family, and 98% reported that they have personally experienced health benefits from having a pet in their lives. With pets increasingly viewed as companions, friends and family members, pet owners behave like “pet parents” with a strong inclination for spending disposable income to meet all of their pets’ needs during all economic cycles. Pets have become a household and individual spending priority. In a Packaged Facts survey conducted in 2022, 68% of consumers reported that they have been cutting back on household expenses due to price inflation, economic uncertainty, or other factors, however only 14% to 15% reported cutting back in pet care categories.
▪Household demographics: There is an increase in high income homes with pets. According to Packaged Facts households with pets and annual household income of $100,000 or more increased 1.3 million from 2017 to 2019 and 3.9 million from 2019 to 2021. 
▪Increasing Consumer Focus on Pet Health and Wellness: Consumers are exhibiting greater interest in improved health for their pets and, as a result, are increasing their spending on veterinary care as well as purchases of the most effective veterinarian-grade pet products and supplies. In 2022, in the wake of COVID-19, Packaged Facts survey data showed that 58% of dog owners and 54% of cat owners strongly agree that they "look for products to improve my pet's’ health and wellness." 
▪Increasing Focus on Affordable Products and Services: According to Packaged Facts, 32% of dog/cat owners who consider their pets part of the family are concerned about the affordability of routine health care for their pets and 42% are concerned about the affordability of emergency care for their pets. In a 2021 survey, 68% of pet owners agreed that they were seeking lower prices, special offers, and sales on pet products. Pet owners of all demographic and income levels aspire to purchase leading veterinarian-grade treatments.
▪Increasing Market Size and Consumer Spending: Pet spending in the United States has steadily increased every year since 1994, with Americans spending approximately $122.8 billion on pet products and services for their pets in 2021, up from $81.8 billion in 2016, representing a Compound Annual Growth Rate ("CAGR)" of 8.5%. Packaged Facts projects the total U.S. pet products and services market to grow at a CAGR of 7.3% from 2021 to 2026.
Strong Growth in Pet Products. According to Packaged Facts, the $122.8 billion U.S. consumers spent on pet products and services in 2021 more than doubled 2010 spending of $53.7 billion. Veterinary channel sales of pet medications grew from an estimated $6.7 billion in 2018 to $8.3 billion in 2021, and overall retail and veterinary channel sales of pet medications and supplements are estimated to have grown from $9.7 billion in 2018 to $12.6 billion in 2021, according to Packaged Facts, with pet supplement sales growing from $626 million in 2018 to $942 million in 2021 in keeping with increasing consumer attention to pet health and wellness. Additionally, our innovative pet treats compete in the U.S. dog and cat treat market, which has grown every year since 2012. 
Growth of Pet Medication Purchases from Retail and E-commerce Channels. U.S. retail sales of pet medications reached $11.6 billion in 2021, inclusive of sales through veterinarians, brick-and-mortar stores and online retailers. Packaged Facts projects that pet medication sales will grow to $13.8 billion by 2026. The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated pet owner purchases of veterinary-grade pet products from retail and e-commerce channels including both brick-and-mortar and online offerings. We believe this migration will continue in the future as more consumers take advantage of the convenience of their local retail store and online.

Our Business Strategy
There are significant opportunities to grow our brand awareness, increase our net sales and profitability and deliver shareholder value by executing on the following initiatives:
Grow Consumer Awareness of Our Products in the Retail & E-commerce Channels. We are an established category leader in the pet health and wellness and medication market. We maintain strong relationships with the top distributors to the veterinary channel, we have strong penetration of the retail and e-commerce channels and high awareness among pet parents. We believe we will increase our share of the overall pet Rx and OTC medications and health and wellness products market through our broad network that includes leading U.S. retailers and e-commerce partners. We are increasingly focused on building consumer awareness, converting more pet owners to use products we manufacture or distribute and providing excellent value. In addition, our retail and e-commerce partners continue to see that our proprietary manufactured products bring significant value to their pet health and wellness category sales and profit. We continue to build pet owner awareness that our proprietary manufactured products offer the same quality and active ingredients at a significant savings versus national veterinary brands. 
Increase Volume of Products with Existing Retailer & E-commerce Partners. We conduct business with the majority of leading U.S. retailers and e-commerce partners with our core product offerings. We believe our net sales and profitability will continue to grow as we expand the number of products we have available for sale. We invest in research and development investments to support our own proprietary manufactured products that we expect to help us expand SKU placement within new and existing accounts. Additionally, we believe we are positioned to gain additional item placement and distribution in retail partners where we are also operating our veterinarian services offering. 
Provide Veterinarian Services in Conjunction with our Retail Partners. Through our Services segment, we participate in the veterinary services industry, which grew from $28.5 billion in 2018 to $32.3 billion in 2020, according to Packaged Facts. This growth equally reflects increased consumer focus on pet health and wellness. We provide a comprehensive suite of services at 2,600 community clinic locations and wellness centers hosted at retailers across 41 states. Our services include diagnostic tests, vaccinations, prescription medications, microchipping, grooming and hygiene and wellness checks. We believe we have the ability to expand these offerings within new and existing retailers which we expect to help drive pet parent traffic to our retail partners for the purchase of pet medication and health and wellness products, thereby expanding the sales of our product offerings through our retail partners. We expect to continue to open new wellness centers over the next several years with the potential to have approximately 1,000 wellness centers. We believe that our wellness centers will help us address the $10.0 billion underserved veterinary market according to an L.E.K. Consulting report from 2017, consisting of an estimated $7.4 billion of services and an estimated $2.6 billion in related product revenue generated from such services based on management estimates.
Our Products
Through our Products segment, we are a manufacturer and distributor of pet medication and health and wellness products to the retail and e-commerce channels. We focus our offerings on innovative, proprietary value-branded products, and leading third-party branded products for dogs and cats, including pet Rx medications, OTC medications, and wellness products. We offer and supply these products to customers primarily in the United States.
Rx Medications
The Rx pet medications we sell include flea and tick control, heartworm preventatives, arthritis, thyroid, diabetes and pain treatments, antibiotics and other specialty medications, all of which require a prescription from a veterinarian. We develop and manufacture our own proprietary value-branded products and distribute well-known leading third-party branded medications. 
Our proprietary value-branded Rx medications allow consumers to care for their pets with the same quality and active ingredients of national branded medications at a lower cost. We plan to continue to develop and manufacture our own proprietary manufactured products available at a value to pet parents which compete with other national branded pet Rx medication currently available. 
We sell over 350 SKUs of the most popular pet Rx medications to retailers and e-commerce partners, in multiple formats, that previously had been available primarily through the veterinarian channel. Our retail and e-commerce partners then sell these pet Rx medications to pet owners who have a prescription. We source these pet Rx medications directly from 
 6


manufacturers or through licensed distributors. Several of the top-selling Rx pet medications that we distribute include Nexgard®, Heartgard® Plus and Vetmedin®.
OTC Medications
The pet OTC medications we sell are primarily within the flea and tick control and behavior management categories and do not require a prescription from a veterinarian. These products are available in multiple forms that consumers choose between, such as spot on (topical) treatments, chewables, oral tablets and collars. We develop and manufacture our own propriety value-branded products and distribute well-known leading third-party branded OTC medications.
We sell over 320 SKUs of the leading OTC-branded and value-branded medications within the Animal Health OTC category to the retail and e-commerce channels. Most of our manufactured OTC medication volume is represented by PetArmor, Capstar, Nextstar, Sentry and Sergeants brands and we have manufacturing capabilities to produce multiple product forms within flea and tick control.
Health and Wellness Products
Our health and wellness products include specialty treats, dental treats and nutritional supplements (including hip and joint, vitamins and skin and coat products) and treats that disguise medication to aid in pet’s pill ingestion. We manufacture and distribute more than 400 SKUs of proprietary wellness products for dogs and cats, mainly under our PetArmor, VetIQ, Minties and Sentry product lines. 
Seasonality
While many of our products are sold consistently throughout the year, we do experience seasonality in the form of increased demand for our flea and tick product offerings in the first half of the year, both leading up to and throughout the spring and summer seasons. Additionally we may experience fluctuations in net sales related to the inventory management strategies of our retail customers.
Similarly, the practice of veterinary medicine is subject to seasonal fluctuation. In particular, demand for veterinary services is significantly higher during the warmer months as there are more fleas, ticks, and mosquitos during these months and products and services sold to prevent or treat illness or diseases related to these insects.
Product Innovation
We offer a broad portfolio of pet medications and health and wellness products to our retail and e-commerce customers, including an array of products that we develop, manufacture and distribute. To continue to grow our pet Rx medication, OTC medications and other health and wellness product offerings, we invest in research and development on an ongoing basis. We use a combination of in-house specialists, third-party consultants and animal health research and development experts to expand our proprietary value-branded portfolio and develop next-generation versions of our existing pet products.
In addition, we have harnessed our position to emerge as an attractive partner for outside research and development researchers and entrepreneurs developing and manufacturing new products and technologies in the strategic pet health and wellness field. We believe these scientists and entrepreneurs seek out our partnership on innovative products given our experience in proprietary value-branded manufacturing and relationships with key retail and e-commerce channel contacts. Our process of assessing partnerships with any outside research and development opportunity includes performing our own internal research and development review, testing and quality control procedures.
Channels
Traditional industry sales channels for pet Rx medications, OTC medications, and other health and wellness products include sales through the veterinarian, retail and e-commerce channels, depending primarily on the product involved. In recent years the retail and e-commerce channels have become intertwined with brick and mortar retailers expanding their online presence and online retailers opening brick and mortar stores. 
Historically, pet Rx and flea and tick medications have been sold through veterinarian offices and, to a lesser extent, e-commerce. We have focused on making these products, as well as our proprietary value-branded products, available directly to consumers through retail and e-commerce partners, which offer consumers convenient access to these products at lower prices. Our sales channels are primarily concentrated in five sub-channels of retail: (i) food, drug and mass market 
 7


sales (e.g., Kroger, Target and Walmart); (ii) club stores (e.g., BJ’s Wholesale Club, Costco Wholesale and Sam's Club); (iii) pet specialty stores (e.g., Petco, PetSmart and independent pet stores); (iv) e-commerce (e.g., Amazon.com and Chewy.com); and (v) independent pharmacies and pharmacy distributors. We believe we are a key participant in the sales growth of pet medication products to the retail channel, with the additional benefit of having access to the veterinary channel through solid relationships with established distributors. 
Customers
Approximately 99% of our 2022 and 2021 net sales were generated from customers located in the United States and Canada, with the remainder from foreign locations. Our customers are primarily national superstore chains, e-commerce, and national pet superstore chains, such as Amazon, Chewy.com, Costco, Kroger, Petco, PetSmart, Sam's Club, Target, The Tractor Supply Company, and Walmart. We supply each of these customers on a national basis. Our largest retail customers in 2022 were Chewy.com and Walmart, which represented 25% and 10%, respectively, of our net sales. Our largest retail customers in 2021 were Chewy.com and Walmart, which represented 26% and 9%, respectively, of our net sales. 
Finally, we believe that maintaining our level of customer care is critical in retaining and expanding our relationships with our key customers. Our in-house customer care representatives participate in ongoing training programs under the supervision of our training managers. These training sessions include a variety of topics such as product knowledge, computer usage and customer service tips. Our customer care representatives promptly respond to customer inquiries related to products, order status, prices and shipping. We believe that our customer care representatives are a valuable source of feedback regarding customer satisfaction.
Supply Chain
Proprietary Value-Branded Products
None of our suppliers for our proprietary value-branded products are individually significant. We believe there is ample available capacity, including of active pharmaceutical ingredients, for our value-branded products, including at contract manufacturing organizations around the world. Our proprietary value-branded products are currently manufactured by us at our facilities in Omaha, Nebraska, Daytona Beach, Florida and Springville, Utah and through a network of manufacturing facilities owned and operated by contract manufacturing partners across the United States and in Europe. We expect that the combined capacities of our facilities and those of our contract manufacturing partners will meet our forecasted needs for our proprietary value-branded products for the foreseeable future.
Distributed Products
We purchase branded and other products that we distribute, but do not manufacture, from a variety of sources in the United States and Europe, including certain manufacturers and licensed distributors. We believe that having strong relationships with our suppliers will ensure the availability of an adequate volume of products ordered by our retail customers and will enable us to provide more and better product information.
Fulfillment, Warehousing and Shipping
To accomplish efficient fulfillment for Rx medication products across the United States into retail, we utilize our established medication distribution channels with our distribution partner, Anda, Inc. We have a multi-year contract with Anda, Inc., which automatically renews for successive two year terms.
For most products, our in-house fulfillment and distribution operations manage the entire supply chain, beginning with the placement of the order, continuing through order processing and then fulfilling and shipping of the product to the customer. All customer orders are processed by our customer service team. We inventory our products at, and fill most customer orders from our distribution centers in Daytona Beach, Florida, Omaha, Nebraska and Springville, Utah. We also use third-party warehouse providers to fulfill a small amount of our orders. We ship our products using common carriers.
 8


Product Quality and Safety
We believe that product safety and quality are critical. We have developed, implemented and enforced a robust product safety and quality program. We have established critical control points throughout the entire supply chain from ingredient sourcing to finished goods to ensure compliance with our quality program.
The food safety program at our Utah plant, where our pet treats are made, is certified at Safe Quality Food (“SQF”) Level II (Food Safety) under Global Food Safety Initiative ("GFSI") Benchmarks. To achieve this qualification level, our Utah facility has been built to comply with particular food safety specifications and allows for correct airflow to prevent cross-contamination, among other things. This qualification level also requires us to have certain standard operating procedures in place written to SQF code specifications, hold regular training seminars for manufacturing employees and maintain reporting documentation evidencing compliance with such standard operating procedures.
In addition, our food safety and quality program includes strict guidelines for incoming ingredients, batching, processing, packaging and finished goods. As part of our focus on food safety and quality, we have implemented batch and lot traceability controls across our manufacturing network, including at our manufacturing facilities, where such controls have been implemented into our enterprise resource planning system. These controls allow us to track and tie discreet, inbound raw material components through the manufacturing process to the ultimate finished product, allowing us to maintain and control all finished product lot details and quickly access process manufacturing details.
At the Florida facility where our Rx and some OTC medications are held for distribution, we maintain a Veterinary Prescription Drug Wholesale Distributor license with the State of Florida Department of Business and Professional Regulation, which is the same government entity that regulates distribution facilities for human medications. In connection with our maintenance of this license, the State of Florida conducts random inspections of our facility. To pass these inspections, we must demonstrate safety compliance at the highest standard, including maintaining correct plant temperatures and environmental controls.
As described above, we use contract manufacturers to produce certain of our proprietary value-branded products. To ensure product quality, consistency and safety standards, we actively monitor each contract manufacturer’s operations through the standard operating procedures and facility audits described above.
At our Omaha location U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") and U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") regulated products are produced, packaged, and distributed from our nearby state of the art distribution center. Products include dog and cat flea and tick spot-on, shampoo, collars, toothpaste and hairball paste. We have a robust quality management program that includes quality processes for the laboratory, incoming inspection, manufacturing and packaging inspections, supplier quality, change control, deviations, and corrective and preventative actions. We manage customer interaction through our call centers and social media to ensure that products maintain the highest quality. All call data is tracked, trended and reviewed for signals that may indicate product quality issues. The Omaha site is inspected several times annually by external auditors and we perform annual internal audits and mock recalls. We have received high marks and consistently maintain compliance with current good manufacturing practices ("cGMPs") and retain certifications as required. 
All of our contract manufacturing facilities are required to have quality control standard operating procedures in place. We require our contract manufacturing facilities to maintain third-party certifications and pass our own quality system and safety audits, and for FDA-regulated products, to comply with the Good Manufacturing Practices of the FDA. Third-party certifications provide an independent and external assessment that a product and/or process complies with applicable safety regulations and standards, although a regulatory authority may disagree with that assessment. In addition, our quality control team conducts reviews of all aspects of our supply chain to ensure that ingredients, finished goods and manufacturing processes meet our strict safety and quality requirements and that all of our ingredients are rigorously tested prior to being used in our products.
Any consumer may call our customer service line, where we have trained representatives on staff. Any call reporting an adverse event relating to our products is further addressed by our third-party vendor, SafetyCall, through its own on-site veterinarians. On a quarterly basis, we submit filings in accordance with the EPA specifications reporting any adverse event associated with our flea and tick products.

Marketing and Advertising
Our marketing strategy largely focuses on building awareness and educating pet owners about our various brands and products. To accomplish this goal, we use a combination of television, digital marketing (e.g. digital coupons, display ads, pay per click, email), social media marketing and in-store displays and promotions. Our marketing message highlights the quality and cost-savings our products offer customers such as our proprietary, value-branded flea and tick products that contain the same active ingredients as leading brands at lower prices. 
Competition
The pet medication and health and wellness industry is highly competitive. In our Products segment, we compete on the basis of product quality, product availability, palatability, loyalty and trust, product variety and ingredients, product packaging and design, shelf space, reputation and brand, price point and promotional efforts. We compete directly and indirectly with both manufacturers and distributors of pet medication and health and wellness products and online distributors, as well as with veterinarians. We directly face competition from companies that distribute various pet medications to traditional retailers and pet health and wellness products companies such as Elanco (formerly Bayer AG), Hartz (Unicharm Corp.), Mars, Inc. (“Mars”), Manna Pro, Nestlé S.A., Spectrum Holdings, Promika LLC, Tevra Brands, and The J.M. Smucker Company, most of which are larger than we are and have greater financial resources. Similarly, we face intense competition from manufacturers who sell pet medications and pet health and wellness products to e-commerce and other retailers and to veterinarians, who compete directly with our retailers to offer consumers pet flea and tick and other pet health and wellness products.
Our retail customers compete with veterinarians for the sale of Rx and OTC pet medications and other health and wellness products. Many pet owners may prefer the convenience of purchasing their pet medications or other health products during a veterinarian visit. In order to effectively compete with veterinarians, we and retail partners must continue to price competitively and to educate pet owners about the product availability, service and savings offered by purchasing pet medications and other health products in their retail stores or from their websites.
Within our Services segment, we compete directly with veterinarians. Our primary competitors for our veterinary clinics in most markets are individual practitioners or small, regional multi-clinic practices. In addition, some national companies such as Banfield Pet Hospitals, VCA Animal Hospitals, or Petco are developing or have developed networks of veterinary clinics or hospitals in markets in which we currently operate.
Our Trademarks and Other Intellectual Property
We believe that our intellectual property is valuable and has contributed to the success of our business. Our primary trademarks include “PetIQ,” “PetArmor,” “VIP Petcare,” “VetIQ PetCare,” “VetIQ,” “Capstar,” “Advecta,” “SENTRY,” “Sergeants,” “TruProfen,” “Betsy Farms,” “PetAction,” “Minties,” “Vera” and “Delightibles” all of which are registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. We also have numerous other trademark registrations and pending applications, in the U.S., Canada and Europe, for product names that are central to our branding. Our trademarks are assets that reinforce our brand, our sub-brands and our consumers’ perception of our products. The current registrations of these trademarks in the U.S. and foreign countries are effective for varying periods of time and may be renewed periodically, provided that we, as the registered owner, or our licensees where applicable, comply with all applicable renewal requirements including, where necessary, the continued use of the trademarks in connection with the goods or services identified in the applicable registrations. In addition to trademark protection, we own numerous URL designations, including www.petarmor.com, www.vetiqpetcare.com, www.vippetcare.com, www.petvet.vippetcare.com, www.vetiq.com, www.advecta.com, www.sentrypetcare.com, www.sergeants.com, www.delightibles.com and www.mintiestreats.com, which are important to the successful implementation of our marketing and advertising strategy. We also have patents and pending patent applications for products, formulas and packaging that we consider important to our business. Including various methods of use, interomone, pheromone compositions and spot-on pesticide compositions. We rely on and carefully protect unpatented proprietary expertise, recipes and formulations, continuing innovation and other trade secrets to develop and maintain our competitive position. The contents of our websites are not intended to be incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K or in any other report or document we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), and any references to our websites are intended to be inactive textual references only.

Government Regulation
Along with our contract manufacturers, ingredient and packaging suppliers and third-party shipping providers, we are subject to a broad range of laws and regulations, both in the U.S. and elsewhere, intended to protect public health and safety, natural resources and the environment. Our products and operations in the U.S. are subject to regulation by the FDA, the EPA, the Florida Department of Health and the U.S. Department of Agriculture ("USDA") and by various other federal, state, local and foreign authorities regarding the registration, manufacturing, processing, packaging, storage, distribution, advertising, labeling and export of our products, including drug and food safety standards.
All Rx animal drugs are required to be approved by the FDA through either a New Animal Drug Application or, in the case of generic Rx animal drugs, an Abbreviated New Animal Drug Application (“ANADA”). Two of our proprietary value-branded products, TruProfen and Heart Shield Plus, have been approved by the FDA under ANADAs submitted to the FDA by third parties. We have agreements with these third parties that hold approved ANADAs to private label or proprietary value-branded products under such ANADAs. However, the third parties that hold the ANADAs are ultimately responsible for compliance with regulatory obligations associated with these products.
In addition, our foreign subsidiaries are subject to the laws of the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland and the European Union, as well as provincial and local regulations.
Under various statutes and regulations, these agencies and authorities, among other things, (i) prescribe the requirements for registration and establish the standards for quality and safety, (ii) regulate our marketing, advertising and sales to consumers and (iii) control the importing and exporting of our products. Certain of these agencies, in certain circumstances, must not only approve our products, but also review the manufacturing processes and facilities used to produce these products before they can be marketed in the United States and elsewhere. In particular, certain of our pet products require EPA or FDA approval prior to marketing. To market such a regulated pet product, the regulatory agency must approve a new product, supported by data from animal safety and effectiveness studies that adequately demonstrate the safety and efficacy of that product in the target animal for the intended indication; or, in the case of generic versions of previously approved reference-listed pet products, the regulatory agency, supported by data to demonstrate, among other things, that the proposed generic product has the same active ingredients in the same concentration as the reference-listed product and is bioequivalent to the reference listed product. After approval, manufacturers are required to collect reports of adverse events and submit them on a regular basis to either the EPA or FDA. Some of the approved products we distribute are held by third parties with whom we contract to distribute those products under our own label.
We are subject to labor and employment laws, safety and health regulations and other laws, including those promulgated by the EPA and the National Labor Relations Board. Our operations, and those of our contract manufacturers, ingredient and packaging suppliers and third-party shipping providers, are subject to various laws and regulations relating to worker health and safety matters as well as environmental and natural resource protection, including the availability and use of pesticides, emissions and discharges to the environment, and the treatment, handling, storage and disposal of materials and wastes. We monitor changes in these laws and believe that we are in material compliance with applicable laws and regulations. No assurance can be given, however, that material costs and liabilities will not arise in the future, such as due to a change in the law or the discovery of currently unknown conditions.
Certain states have laws, rules and regulations which require that veterinary medical practices be either wholly-owned or majority-owned by licensed veterinarians and that corporations which are not wholly-owned or majority-owned by licensed veterinarians refrain from providing, or holding themselves out as providers of, veterinary medical care. In these states and provinces, we provide management and other administrative services to veterinary practices rather than owning such practices or providing such care. In some cases, in addition to providing management and administrative services we may lease the veterinary facility and equipment to the veterinary practice. Although we have structured our operations to comply with our understanding of the veterinary medicine laws of each state and province in which we operate, interpretive legal precedent and regulatory guidance varies by jurisdiction and is often sparse and not fully developed.
In addition, all of the states in which we operate impose various registration permit and/or licensing requirements. To fulfill these requirements, we have registered each of our facilities with appropriate governmental agencies and, where required, have appointed a licensed veterinarian to act on behalf of each facility. All veterinarians practicing in our animal wellness centers are required to maintain valid state licenses to practice.

Human Capital
We employed approximately 1,888 people as of December 31, 2022, of which 1,847 are employed within the United States. Our workforce is comprised of approximately 57% full time and 43% part time employees. Of our total employees, approximately 1,338 of our employees worked in our Services division. In addition, we regularly contract with veterinarians to provide veterinary services in our mobile community clinics and wellness centers. During the year ending December 31, 2022, we had approximately 1,555 veterinarians that were independent contractors.
The animal health industry is highly competitive and PetIQ is a fast growing company. PetIQ’s benefit offerings are designed to meet the evolving needs of a diverse workforce across the Company. Attraction and retention of key talent is a focal point for the Company. To support these objectives, our human resources programs are designed to reward and support employees through competitive pay and benefits; support and facilitate internal talent mobility; and evolve and invest in technology, tools, and resources to enable employees at work.
