ITEM 1. BUSINESS. Overview
History of Value Exchange International, Inc.
 
History. We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on June 26, 2007 under the name “China Soaring Inc.” We changed the Company’s name to “Sino Payments, Inc.” on November 26, 2008. We changed to our current corporate name, “Value Exchange International, Inc.”, on December 5, 2017. 
 
On January 1, 2014, we received 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of in VEI CHN in exchange for i) newly issued 12,000,000 shares of our common stock to the majority stockholder of VEI CHN; and ii) 166,667 shares of our common stock held by VEI CHN to be transferred to the majority stockholder of VEI CHN (“Share Exchange”). This transaction resulted in the owners of VEI CHN obtaining a majority voting interest in the Company and VEI CHN’s business becoming the primary business and revenue generating operation of the Company. 
 
For financial reporting purposes, the January 1, 2014 transaction with VEI CHN represented a “reverse merger” rather than a business combination and the Company was deemed to be the accounting acquiree in the transaction. The transaction was accounted for as a reverse merger and recapitalization. The Company was the legal acquirer but accounting acquiree for financial reporting purposes and VEI CHN was the acquired company but accounting acquirer. Consequently, the assets and liabilities and the operations that reflected in the historical financial statements prior to the transaction will be those of VEI CHN and will be recorded at the historical cost basis of VEI CHN, and no goodwill will be recognized in this transaction. The consolidated financial statements after completion of the transaction include the assets and liabilities of VEI CHN and the Company, and the historical operations of the Company and the combined operations of VEI CHN from the initial closing date of the transaction. 
 
Current Business Focus. We are a provider of customer-centric technology solutions for the retail industry in Hong Kong SAR and certain regions of China and Philippines. We intend to seek expansion of that territory to other parts of Southeast Asia. We have not made any significant progress in expanding our markets in fiscal year 2018 (excepting the operation of TapServices, Inc. in the Manilla, Philippines market). “New Developments” below discusses efforts to expand our markets. 
 
By integrating market-leading Point-of-Sale/Point-of-Interaction (“POS/POI”), Merchandising, Customer Relations Management or “CRM” and related rewards, Locational Based (GPS & Indoor Positioning System (“IPS”)) Marketing, Customer Analytics, Business Intelligence solutions, our products and services are intended to provide retailers with the capability to offer a consistent shopping experience across all channels, enabling them to easily and effectively manage the customer lifecycle on a one-to-one basis. We promote ourselves as a single IT source for retailers who want to extend existing traditional transaction processing to multiple points of interaction, including the Internet, kiosks and wireless devices. Our products and services are focused on helping retailers realize the full benefits of Customer Chain Management with its suite of solutions that focus on the customer, on employees, and the infrastructure that supports the selling channel. Company is headquartered in Hong Kong and with offices in Shenzhen, Guangzhou, Shanghai, Beijing, China; Manila, Philippines; and Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.
 
We believe that the IT Business often presents opportunities to expand a provider’s market reach or customer base by acquisitions of existing businesses or operating assets. The Company’s business strategy includes reviewing possible acquisitions of existing businesses or operating assets in existing or adjacent markets and to do so when and if such an acquisition appears to be compatible and an enhancement of our core business lines and can be consummated with available cash and other resources. Our ability to pursue and consummate acquisitions may be limited by available cash and other resources and the perceived cost and burdens of acquiring and integrating in our operations the target business or new operating assets. The availability of funding and cash flow are the most significant limitations on our ability to expand through acquisitions of businesses and assets – both in terms of money on hand and ability to finance acquisitions. 
 
Initial Business Focus. Our initial intended, primary business was to operate a credit card processing and merchant-acquiring services company that provide credit card clearing services to merchants and financial institutions in PRC. Since inception, we have strived to implement our business plan, including the key step of creating our Global Processing Platform (“SinoPay GPP”). Specifically, the Company’s IP business was to be a provider of Internet Protocol (“IP”) processing services in Asia to bank card-accepting merchants (“IP Business”). We market our services to local merchants with regional retail locations in our existing markets of China, Hong Kong and Philippines while seeking business from retailers with market presence across Asia Pacific (as potential customers of their IP and related credit card and debit card processing systems). We offer interoperability through what is envisioned as a highly efficient infrastructure and perceived exceptional knowledge of the IP processing market through our SinoPay GPP platform. The SinoPay GPP system facilitates the processing of all major credit card types (Visa/MC/AMEX/Diners/Discover/JCB) and will be integrated with China UnionPay to provide processing of UnionPay Debit cards in China.

As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we still have not implemented any IP Business services to any customer. While we have a functioning SinoPay GPP system product for sale, we have yet to sell any SinoPay GPP system to a customer as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We will continue to promote the SinoPay GPP system, but our primary focus is on growing our IT Business because of our strategic decision that IT Business presents greater growth and profit potential than IP Business in the short term. Further, we believe that the SinoGPP system will require ongoing and potentially expensive marketing and sales effort due to the highly competitive market for Point Of Sale (“POS”) systems and longer sales cycle for POS systems than IT Business project and consulting sales. 
 
New Developments. SinoPay GPP and related IP Business. Since the Company has been unable to develop a revenue generating business for the IP Business, and the Company is focusing its resources on the more lucrative IT Business, the Company has decided to explore an alternative approach to the effort to develop a revenue generating IP Business. The Company believes that the emphasis on the IT Business and Company’s limited cash flow and funding resources requires any future promotion and development of the IP Business must be conducted as a joint venture with a third party willing to raise the capital necessary to produce a commercially viable e-commerce system for the IP Business. The Company lacks the strategic focus and current, available capital (as well as funding sources) to engage in the development of a viable modern e-commerce system for a commercially viable IP Business. 
 
Matthew Mecke, a director of the Company, has proposed forming a joint venture with the Company to be operated as a majority owned subsidiary of the Company and to be funded by yet-to-be-identified third party investors to be located by Mr. Mecke. Mr. Mecke has formed a new company, named Koinon Technology Services, Inc. (“KTSI”) and incorporated in the U.S. Virgin Islands, as part of his proposal to operate the e-payment concept of SinoPay GPP as a subsidiary of the Company. KTSI’s incorporation and formation was completed as of January 24, 2019 by Mr. Mecke. The formation of KTSI was a condition to the Company considering Mr. Mecke’s proposal to commercially exploit the SinoPay GPP concept as a joint venture between the Company and KTSI. Mr. Mecke and Mr. Johan Pehrson, a director of the Company, are the initial directors of KTSI. 
 
Mr. Mecke has proposed a joint venture effort based on KTSI operating as majority owned subsidiary of the Company, the Company transferring its rights to the SinoPay GPP concept and know-how to KTSI in exchange, and Mr. Mecke undertaking the responsibility for funding KTSI’s effort to develop a updated, modern e-commerce system based on the SinoPay GPP concept or a derivative IP Business platform. As of the filing date of this Annual Report of Form 10-K, neither KTSI nor Mr. Mecke has raised any funds or received any funding commitments for KTSI or any development effort for a new e-commerce system. Under this proposal, the Company would provide only limited funding to KTSI and KTSI would be expected to raise the necessary working capital for KTSI through third party investors or lenders. Under the proposed joint venture agreement with KTSI, the Company would make an initial working capital loan to KTSI of $25,000 for KTSI and the loan would be based on commercially reasonable terms and conditions. 
 
It is uncertain if KTSI and Mr. Mecke can raise the working capital necessary to develop and market a commercially viable, modern e-commerce system derived from the SinoPay GPP concept or some derivative technological e-commerce concept (“New System”). 
 
At a March 28, 2019 meeting of the Company’s Board of Directors, a majority of the directors approved the pursuit of a final, definitive JV Agreement based on the proposed joint venture with KTSI. The Company and KTSI are working to finalize and close a draft JV Agreement. The Company and KTSI is are in the process of finalizing a definitive joint venture agreement (“JV Agreement”) based on the above proposal from Mr. Mecke, but have not yet finalized and closed on a definitive JV Agreement. The Company expects that a definitive JV Agreement will be finalized and agreed by Company and KTSI by May 15, 2019. 
 
The pursuit of the proposed joint venture with KTSI is, at this time, merely a change in the strategic plan for developing a revenue generating IP Business. KTSI has not raised the funding for developing a modern e-commerce system for the IP Business and KTSI has not developed a specific design for a new e-commerce system (other than the need for the new e-commerce system with digital currency capabilities and related blockchain technology functionality). If and when the JV Agreement is finalized, KTSI may be unable to fund the development or a commercially viable IP Business or any IP Business developed by KTSI ay also fail to achieve revenue generating status or profitability. The Company believes that development of a new e-commerce system is necessary for a commercially viable IP Business because the SinoPay GPP concept, developed years ago, has limited functionality compared to current, modern e-commerce and e-payment systems. The IP Business industry are very competitive and marked by rapid changes in technology and advances in functionality of e-payment and e-commerce systems, especially smart device based applications. 
 
Matthew Mecke recused himself in all votes by the Company board of directors on the JV Agreement and KTSI proposal.

Any joint venture by the Company in the IP Business or e-commerce or e-payment systems faces daunting challenges in achieving revenues and then profitability because: (1) the superior resources, both technical, research and development, financial, brand recognition and established market share of many competitors; (2) evolving nature of e-commerce, blockchain and e-payment technologies and services and existing technology challenges to produce a commercially viable system with profitable market demand; (3) significant computing power that may be required for a e-payment/e-commerce/blockchain system; (4) limited or lack of adequate, affordable funding for a start-up concern like KTSI; (5) impact of potential, future regulation and existing regulatory burdens (such as anti-money laundering laws, securities compliance laws, international financial transaction reporting burdens, banking laws, foreign currency regulation and privacy law burdens); (6) threat of evolving cloud technology and smart device e-pay technology undermining the probably technology and market approach of a KTSI e-payment or e-commerce system; and (7) the need for ongoing capital infusions to sustain operations prior to achieving self-sustaining cash flow from operations.
 
Smart Baggage Tags. Through a cooperative effort with another company, Company has the ability to market a smart baggage tag that allows consumers to track the location of their baggage through a smart phone or device using the smart baggage tag and related application. In December 2018 and January 2019, Company made an in-person presentation to the airport authority for the Washington, D.C. region to sell the smart baggage tag in the airport authority’s airports. No decision on the presentation has been made as of the date of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The smart baggage tag has not yet produced any significant revenues. Nonetheless, smart baggage device represents an effort by the Company to expand its markets and product line. The Company intends to solicit interest in the smart baggage tag in first half of 2019 from two to four targeted U.S. airport authorities for major metropolitan areas. It is uncertain if these efforts will occur or will, if undertaken, will result in any acceptance of Company proposal to allow the sale of the smart baggage tags in U.S. airports. The smart baggage tags can be sold by vending machine or from retail counters in the airport terminals. If sold at retail counters, the smart baggage tags would be sold by established vendors at the airport terminal.
History of Value Exchange Int’l (China) Limited. VEI CHN was first established on November 16, 2001 in Hong Kong SAR as a limited liability company under the name of “Triversity Hong Kong Limited” and subsequently changed its name to “Triversity (Asia Pacific) Limited” on April 24, 2002 and then further changed its name to “TAP Investments Group Limited” on November 16, 2007. TAP Investments Group Limited changed its name to its current name as “Value Exchange Int’l (China) Limited” on May 13, 2013.
 
VEI CHN is an investment holding company with two subsidiaries established in Hong Kong SAR, namely TAP Services (HK) Limited which was incorporated on August 25, 2003 and acquired by VEI CHN on September 25, 2008, and subsequently changed to its current name as Value Exchange Int’l (Hong Kong) Limited (“VEI HKG”) on May 13, 2013, and Cucumbuy.com Limited (“CUCUMBUY”), which was incorporated on May 14, 2013 and disposed on May 21, 2018 with consideration of HK$1. VEI CHN also set up a Wholly-owned Foreign Enterprise (WOFE) in Shanghai, PRC, in September 2, 2008 in the name of Value Exchange Int’l (Shanghai) Limited (“VEI SHG”). In January 2017, VEI CHN acquired TapServices, Inc., a corporation organized under the laws of the Republic of the Philippines (the “TSI”). Prior to acquisition of TSI, the Company provided extensive consulting services to TSI and, from such relationship, the Company was familiar with TSI operations. 
 
Principal business of VEI and its Subsidiaries
 
VEII is a holding company for its operating subsidiaries. VEI CHN operations are the primary operations of the Company. The principal business of VEI CHN for more than 15 years is to provide the IT Business (consisting of select services and solutions in computer software programming and integration, and computer systems, Internet and information technology systems engineering, consulting, administration and maintenance, including e-commerce and payment processing) to the Retail Sector, primarily to leading retailers in Hong Kong SAR, Macau SAR and PRC and as more fully described below. As is customary in the industry, such services and solutions are provided by both company employees, contractors and consultants. The primary services and products of the IT Business are:
 
a)Systems maintenance and related service

VEI CHN Group provides development, customization of software and hardware, enhancements thereto and maintenance services for installed POS system. VEI CHN Group markets, sells and maintains its own brand POS software – edgePOS as well as third party brands (e.g. NCR/Retalix), which is one of the leading POS software programs in the market. These software enhancements and programming can integrate with different IP systems.
 
Systems maintenance services consist of: i) software maintenance service, including software patches and software code revisions; ii) installing, testing and implementing software; iii) training of customer personnel for the use of software; and iv) technical support for software systems. 

8



Other services include system installation and implementation, including i) project planning; ii) analysis of customer information and business needs from a IT perspective (“System Analysis”); iii) design of the entire system; iv) hardware and consumables selection advice and sales; and v) system hardware maintenance. These services typically consist of customer projects for New Store Opening (“NSO”) and Install, Move, Add and Change (“IMAC”) for retail, and ad-hoc custom system projects for other business sectors. Our primary focus is the retail sector in Hong Kong SAR, PRC and Philippine. 
 
b)Systems development and integration 

VEI CHN Group provides value-added software, which integrates with customer owned or licensed software, and ad-hoc software development projects for other business sectors. Besides use of proprietary, custom software code, our services may from time to time license standard third party software programs. 
 
Business partner and customers
 
The main business partner of the IT Business group is the Chinese and Hong Kong subsidiary operations (“WN”) of Diebold Nixdorf AG (formerly, “Wincor Nixdorf AG”, a German public company), a U.S.-German public company subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, (“DN”). Since 1990’s, VEI CHN Group served the AS Watson Group, a retail conglomerate including Watsons, Parknshop and Fortress, directly and through a sub-contracting arrangement with WN in the China-Hong Kong region. This contributes almost half of the gross sales revenue each year to VEI CHN. 
 
In recent years, VEI CHN has striven to broaden its clientele in retail sector and to other business sectors. VEI CHN Group secured a number of service contracts for leading retail groups, Robinson Retails Group in Philippines and Dairy Farm in Hong Kong. PCCW, a leading telecommunication company in Hong Kong, and Inland Revenue Department of the Hong Kong SAR Government have also become major customers of the VEI CHN Group. The focus on expanding clientele in the retail sector is a current priority of Company’s growth strategy. 
 
The annual sales of VEI CHN Group have been increasing over the past few years in its IT Business by expanding its customer base and its scope of services. VEI CHN Group solution now runs in over 10,000 POS in the region and provides a solid foundation to VEII’s IP system. Also, VEI CHN Group is seeking to leverage its existing POS solution customer base to expand into the mobile Customer Relationship Management and Rewards market. MasterCard’ 2016 Survey Reveals showed two in five Hong Kong consumers shop on smartphones in Hong Kong. The importance of the mobile market in commerce is globally recognized. Even through the Mobile Customer Relationship Management and Rewards programs has not produced any significant revenues to the Group, the programs seek to exploit the increasing use of mobile devices to shop and purchase products and services, to sustain consumer loyalty by rewards for repeat purchases by mobile devices and to permit companies to develop consumer profile databases used to fashion targeted marketing to the consumers based on purchasing habits. 
 
With respect to the IP Business, the Company will seek to implement its IP Business and related credit card and debit card processing systems as part of and as an supplement and enhancement for the IT Business to the Retail Sector. There has been no significant integration of the businesses in fiscal year 2017 and 2018 and there is no deadline for such integration, which will occur as and when, if ever, that the Company can afford to and deems it propitious to integrate operations.
 
We will evaluate the merits of this business and growth strategy from time to time and may elect in the future to continue to pursue an IP Business, IT Business or focus more on one segment than the other, including seek business opportunities in the applications of digital technology which can raise our customers’ competitive edge leading to increase in market share and profitability in their business sectors. Any change in business focus will be based on current economic conditions, competitive environment, our available cash and infrastructure resources, current customer demand trends and financial results of each segment of our post-Share Exchange business plan. See “New Developments” for a description of current Company efforts to develop a revenue generating IP Business. As of the date of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we are pursuing our emphasis on IT Business in our core Hong Kong SAR and PRC market while also exploring expansion opportunities in adjacent Asia Pacific markets. Our ability to exploit adjacent market opportunities for expansion will be limited and governed by available, affordable funding and cash flow. 
 
Marketing Efforts in U.S. AS disclosed under “New Developments” above, the Company has no North American generated revenues or operations. As reported in “New Developments” above: We have made an effort to pitch the Smart Tag to Washington, D.C. Airport Authority as a vending machine offering to consumers using the airports under that authority’s management. A decision on the pitch has not been received as of the date of the filing of this Report on Form 10-K. This effort represents the first organized effort to establish a revenue source in North America. The Company may or may seek to pitch the Smart Tag to one to three other airports serving major metropolitan areas in the U.S. These efforts may fail to produce any airport approval to sell the Smart Tags in these airports or any revenues or significant revenues even if the Smart Tag gains entry into a U.S. airport.

As of the date of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, it is uncertain about the Smart Tag’s prospects in North America or any other new market.
 
Health and Cosmetic Retailer Agreement. On February 16, 2018, VEI SHG, signed a January 24, 2018 stores equipment support agreement (“Agreement”) with the largest health care and beauty retailer (“Retailer”) in China. Under the Agreement, the Retailer has contracted for site and preventive maintenance and support for computer and point of sale systems (“Systems”) as well as new store and store renovation install and migration services for Systems from the VEI SHG. The Agreement is non-exclusive, covers Retailer’s stores in the northern and eastern region of China and runs through December 2019.
 
In fiscal year 2018, VEI SHG realized $
1,577,682 in gross revenues from the work under the Agreement.
 
CORPORATE STRUCTURE
 
Our corporate organizational chart, as of December 31, 2018, is as follows:
 

Acquisition of Philippines IT Business.  On 26 January 2017, nine Company stockholders who have in the aggregate had more than fifty percent (50%) of the voting power of the issued and outstanding shares of the Common Stock as of the record date approved the Stock Purchase Agreement, dated 23 January 2017, (“TSI SPA”). The TSI SPA is by and among VEI CHN; the Company; TSI; and the sole shareholder of TSI (“TSI shareholder”). Under the TSI SPA: (a) the TSI shareholder who owned One Thousand Two Hundred and Fifty (1,250) shares of TSI Common Stock (the “TSI Shares”), constituting One Hundred Percent (100%) of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of TSI, sold all of those TSI Shares to VEI; and (b) TSI issued Eighty-Eight Thousand and Forty-four (88,044) shares of TSI Common Stock to VEI under the TSI SPA (“TSI C-Shares”). The aggregate purchase price for all of the TSI Shares (the “Purchase Price”) was Two Thousand Six Hundred and Thirty-Six United States Dollars (US$2,636.00). The aggregate subscription price for all of the TSI C-Shares (the “C-Share Purchase Price”) was Two Hundred Thousand United States Dollars (US$200,000.00), which amount was deposited with TSI by the Company as a good faith earnest money deposit in January 2015. The TSI SPA was unanimously approved by VEI CHN’s Board of Directors and by the Company’s Board of Directors at a combined board of directors meeting held on 23 January 2017 in Hong Kong SAR. VEI and Company signed the TSI SPA on 25 January 2017 in Hong Kong SAR. As of 26 January 2017, the Company had received written consents from nine Stockholders approving the corporate action, which written consents represent 16,095,324 shares of Common or 54.27% of the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock as of the record date – there being 29,656,130 shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding as of the record date. TSI’s board of directors approved and signed the TSI SPA on 23 January 2017. The Seller signed the TSI SPA on 26 January 2017. With the consummation of the TSI SPA, TSI is being operated as a wholly owned subsidiary of VEI CHN. For U.S. federal securities law purposes, the consummation of the stock purchase under the TSI SPA occurred with the mailing of a definitive information statement by the Company, which occurred on or about March 15, 2017 TSI is being operated as a subsidiary and VEI’s IT Business operation in greater Manila, Philippines region. 
 
The TSI SPA is attached as Exhibit 10.1 to the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K, dated January 25, 2017, and filed with the Commission on January 27, 2017. The foregoing summary of the TSI SPA is qualified in its entirety by reference to the TSI SPA.

Marketing
 
Marketing activities are designed to inform potential clients about the benefits of using our services and include and will include the following: face-to-face sales and marketing; development and distribution of marketing literature; direct mail and email; advertising; promotion of our web site; attendance at trade shows or product seminars; and industry analyst relations campaign. 
 
Sales are managed at the subsidiary level by each subsidiary. The Company has a Sales and Marketing team in each regional office of its existing China/Hong Kong and Manilla markets to promote and maintain good business relationships with our customers. We strive to provide high quality and fast response services to our customers in our Help Centre, Maintenance Support Team and Professional IT Engineer to help customers solve their problems and satisfy their IT needs.
 
VEI CHN Group has been serving in IT Business sectors for over 15 years, focusing on POS maintenance and support to retail sector. The VEI CHN Group will continue its key business and seek to expand its client base to gain more market share in PRC, Hong Kong SAR, and certain other areas of Asia Pacific. VEII may consider acquiring companies in the Asia Pacific region with similar business, subject to financial wherewithal to do so and subject to a suitable and affordable acquisition opportunity. The perceived cost of market penetration will also be a factor in deciding whether to pursue any acquisition opportunities. The Company and its subsidiaries do not currently have ready access to funding for acquisitions and would have to locate sufficient, affordable funding to pursue any acquisition or merger with a significant cash consideration requirement. The Company and its subsidiaries may be unable to locate the funding needed to consummate a merger or acquisition, especially since the Company is a small reporting company with a penny stock common stock. 
 
We use strategic partnerships as another way of marketing and selling our IT Business. The operating subsidiaries will also cooperate with strategic partners in the local markets to secure and provide maintenance services to major retail customers and as a basis for attempting to expand our business in our markets. In fiscal year 2018, we had over 10 strategic partner arrangements engaged in providing our services to customers in our China/Hong Kong markets. 
 
Competition
 
We operate in a highly competitive, customer-driven industry and we compete against a variety of local and regional competitors of varying operational sizes, product/service offerings and resources. In some instances, our competitors have fewer regulatory burdens, easier access to financing, greater resources, greater operating capabilities and efficiencies of scale, stronger brand-name recognition, longstanding relationships with regulatory authorities and customers, more customers, and more flexibility to offer discounted services and/or products.
 
We face significant competition from large multinational service providers, such as DN, NCR, Fujitsu IBM, Toppan Forms and large national companies, such as Octopus card, an electronic payment in online or offline system in Hong Kong SAR. Though VEI CHN Group faces keen competition in the maintenance service market, it believes that it has a well-trained technical team that offers services to the satisfaction of our customers, and, as is the case with many smaller companies in the IT segment, we believe we can offer more customized and cost effective services to certain customers than larger competitors. Without extensive teaming with strategic partners, we lack the capabilities to compete directly with larger competitors in projects or work requiring capabilities of a large company. This can from time to time limit the number and nature projects that we can pursue or handle. VEII may also experience a competitive disadvantage in bids or prospective work where extensive and broad prior projects in certain areas of IT are required to bid and to win bids. An instance of such a competitive disadvantage would be technical work in which we do not have extensive prior experience or we do not have a prior relationship with the customer in question.
 
We also face competition from companies that are of comparable size and resources. In such competition, price and scope of services or qualification of personnel often determines the winning provider. Competition for qualified personnel is a challenge faced by all companies in the IT Business industry. 
 
Some of our competitors in our industry have substantially greater capital and technical resources than we have and, operate as subsidiaries of financial institutions or bank holding companies, which may allow them on a consolidated basis to own and conduct depository and other banking activities that we do not have the regulatory authority to own or conduct. Since they are affiliated with financial institutions or banks, these competitors do not incur the costs associated with being sponsored by a bank for registration with card networks and they can settle transactions quickly for their own merchants. We do not, however, currently contemplate pursuing an acquisition or strategic relationship with a financial institution in order to increase our competitiveness and such an acquisition or strategic relationship is not prominent in our current business and growth strategy. Our current operational focus is to improve the efficiency and profitability of existing IT Business. As of the date of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, VEII has not pursued or identified such a financial institution and there can be no assurance that we could consummate a merger or strategic relationship with any financial institution. 

11



Cybersecurity and Security of Computer Networks
 
We maintain certain computer networks, computer systems and databases in connection with our business operations and services. We use readily available third party security programs to protect these systems and databases and we periodically review security measures. Any security system or program may be vulnerable to hacking or security breaches, especially since hacking and malicious programs are constantly evolving to overcome new security measures. Like any company’s computer and network systems and databases, our systems and databases could be vulnerable to security hacking or malicious programs. We may also be vulnerable to security leaks and violations by employees and contractors, which is a threat faced by all IT Business companies. We have not experienced any significant security breaches or problems as of the date of filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. VEII technical staff typically evaluates cybersecurity and security measures from time to time as new threats become known to us. 
 
There can be no assurance that our efforts to protect our computer systems, networks and other information systems will prevent any of the problems identified as cyber security attacks or problems. The problem of this type might be caused by events such as computer hacking, computer viruses, worms and other destructive or disruptive software, “cyber-attacks” and other malicious activity, defects in the hardware and software comprising our network and information systems, as well as natural disasters, power outages, terrorist attacks and similar events. Such events could have an adverse impact on us and our customers, including degradation of service, service disruption, excessive call volume to help centers and damage to our or customers’ equipment and data. Operational or business delays for our operations or customer operations may result from the disruption of computer systems, network or information systems and the subsequent remediation activities. These events may create negative publicity resulting in reputation or brand damage with customers and our results of operations could suffer. Since we provide computer, software and system services and products to customers, cyber security attacks on our computer systems, networks and other information systems may affect our customers’ computer systems, networks and other information systems and produce liabilities on our part to such customers. 

Key Personnel
 
The following personnel are considered critical to our operations: Kenneth Tan and Benny Lee, who provide executive management services and strategic direction. We do not have key man insurance to fund replacement of any key personnel. We also frequently use third party consultants acting as independent contractors to assist in the completion of various projects, which consultants are usually hired on a project-by-project basis. Third parties are instrumental to keep the development of projects on time and on budget. Reliance on independent contractors is common in technology services businesses. We do not anticipate and have not experienced any significant problem in securing needed technical expertise, but the inability to secure needed technical expertise is a risk faced by IT service companies like our company. 
 
The Company has not developed a succession plan in the event of the retirement, disability or death of key personnel. IN the event of the loss of the services of any key personnel, the Company would in all likelihood be forced to recruit an outside person to fill a key personnel position. The Company may lack sufficient cash and benefits to attract qualified personnel for key personnel positions. 
 
A common problem in our industry is key or important contractors and employees being lured to more attractive or lucrative work opportunities. VEII cannot typically match the level and scope of financial incentives offered by larger competitors to workers. VEII has to rely on active recruitment coupled with offering projects that match workers’ skills and interests as well as providing an appealing work environment and competitive base compensation in order to maintain or create an adequate work force on a project-by-project basis. 
 
Insurance
 
Except the Company’s subsidiaries in (i) PRC are required to cover its employees with medical, retirement and unemployment insurance programs, and (ii) Hong Kong are required to cover its employees with labor insurance programs under the prevailing laws and regulations of the PRC and in Hong Kong, we do not maintain other insurance. Because we may not have sufficient insurance, if we are made a party to a liability legal action, we may not have sufficient funds to defend the litigation or may suffer another liability. If that occurs a judgment or liability that is not covered by any insurance or covered by available cash or funding, could cause us to cease or reduce operations. We did not experience any significant claims against our insurance in fiscal year 2018. 

12



Government Regulation
 
We are not currently subject to direct Chinese, United States federal, state or local regulation other than regulations applicable to businesses generally or directly applicable to our IT Business and the U.S. securities laws applicable to the Company. However, the Internet is increasingly popular and essential on a global basis. As a result, it is possible that a number of international and local laws and regulations may be adopted with respect to the Internet applications and transactions, including ones used in or serviced by our service. These laws may cover issues such as user privacy, freedom of expression, pricing, content and quality of products and services, taxation, advertising, intellectual property rights and information security. Furthermore, the growth of electronic commerce may prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection laws. Existing and future laws and regulations governing the privacy of end users or their customers’ information is or may become part of the regulatory burden of conducting our business lines. We do not provide our services in the U.S. as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, but the global nature of the Internet and e-commerce and financial transactions means that any company may become subject from time to time to U.S. or foreign laws on privacy, financial regulation, business regulation or tax law. 
 
We are not certain how our existing business may be affected by the application of existing, evolving laws, or extension of foreign laws to our operations and, governing issues such as property ownership, copyrights, encryption and other intellectual property issues, taxation, libel, obscenity and export or import matters. The vast majority of such laws were adopted prior to the advent of the Internet. As a result, they do not contemplate or address the unique issues of the Internet and related technologies. Changes in laws intended to address such issues could create uncertainty in the Internet market place, including areas affecting our business lines. Such uncertainty could reduce demand for services or increase the cost of doing business as a result of litigation or regulatory costs or increased service delivery costs. In addition, because our services could be available over the Internet in multiple states and foreign countries, other jurisdictions may claim that we are required to qualify to do business in each such state or foreign country. Our failure to qualify a business in a jurisdiction where it is required to do so could subject it to taxes and penalties. It could also hamper our ability to enforce contracts in such jurisdictions. The application of laws or regulations from jurisdictions whose laws do not currently apply to our business could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
 
Like many companies, and from time to time, the Company may review the economic and tax advantages of various jurisdictions for businesses like the Company business in order to determine if there are any significant long-term advantages in relocating or expanding the Company operations to another jurisdiction, whether in whole or in part. Any such review is part of the customary strategic planning of the Company. 
 
We are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practice Act, or “FCPA,” and other laws that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials and political parties by U.S. persons and issuers as defined by the statute for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Our activities in Asia create the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by consultants or agents of our company, because these parties are not always subject to our control. It is our policy to implement safeguards to discourage these practices by our employees. Also, our existing safeguards and any future improvements may prove to be less than effective, and consultants, sales agents of our Company may engage in conduct for which we might be held responsible. Violations of the FCPA may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, and we may be subject to other liabilities, which could negatively affect our business, operating results and financial condition. The U.S. government may seek to hold our Company liable for successor liability FCPA violations committed by companies in which we invest or that we acquire.
