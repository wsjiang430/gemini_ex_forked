Item 1. Business
Company Overview
Viemed Healthcare, Inc. (the "Company" or "Viemed"), through its subsidiaries, is a provider of home medical equipment ("HME") and post-acute respiratory healthcare services in the United States. The Company’s service offerings are focused on effective in-home treatment with clinical practitioners providing therapy and counseling to patients in their homes using cutting edge technologies. The Company currently serves patients in all 50 states of the United States. 
Viemed’s primary objective is to focus on the growth of its business and thereby solidify its position as one of the largest providers of home therapy for patients suffering from respiratory diseases that require a high level of service, with such programs being designed specifically for payors to have the ability to treat patients in the home for less total cost and with a superior quality of care. Viemed's services include respiratory disease management, neuromuscular care, in-home sleep testing and sleep apnea treatment, oxygen therapy, respiratory equipment rentals, and healthcare staffing services. 
Viemed expects to use a growth model whereby expansion is effectuated through existing service areas as well as in new regions through a cost efficient launch that reduces location expenses. Viemed expects that it will continue to employ more respiratory therapists ("RTs") in order to assure the high service model is accomplished in the home. By focusing overhead costs to personnel that service the patient rather than physical location costs, Viemed anticipates continuing to efficiently scale its business in regions that are currently not being effectively serviced.
The continued trend of servicing patients in the home rather than in hospitals is aligned with Viemed’s business objectives and management anticipates that this trend will continue to offer growth opportunities for the Company. Viemed expects to continue to be a solution to the rising healthcare costs in the United States by offering more cost effective home based solutions while increasing the quality of life for patients fighting serious respiratory diseases.
Viemed focuses on disease management and improving the quality of life for respiratory patients through clinical excellence, education and technology. Its service offerings are based on effective home treatment with respiratory care practitioners providing therapy and counseling to patients in their homes using cutting edge technologies. Viemed also provides in-home sleep testing for sleep apnea sufferers and health care staffing services for healthcare facilities.
Viemed is one of the largest independent non-invasive ventilator providers in the United States with a service coverage area of all 50 states of the United States and intends to continue to grow rapidly through increased market penetration.

December 31, 2022 and 2021 

◦Respiratory disease management, including treatment of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (“COPD”), aims to improve quality of life and reduce hospital readmissions by using proven methodology and leading technologies, such as non-invasive ventilation (“NIV”), percussion vests, and other therapies. Viemed provides ventilation (both invasive and non-invasive) and related equipment and supplies to patients suffering from COPD through a high-touch model.
◦Neuromuscular care is focused on helping neuromuscular patients breathe more comfortably while living an active, healthier life and uses respiratory therapy treatments which can lessen the effort required to breathe.
◦Oxygen therapy provides patients with extra oxygen, which is sometimes used to manage certain chronic health problems, including COPD. Oxygen therapy may be performed in the home or in another setting.
◦Sleep apnea management provides sleep solutions and/or equipment such as Positive Airway Pressure (“PAP”), the AutoPAP (automatic continuous positive airway pressure), and BiPAP machines.
•In-home sleep testing: Viemed provides in home sleep apnea testing services, which is an alternative to the traditional sleep lab testing environment. 
•Healthcare staffing: Viemed provides healthcare staffing and recruitment services to supplement the workforce needs of third party healthcare facilities by utilizing its network of healthcare professionals.
Monthly rental revenue from ventilators represented approximately 68% and 77%, respectively, of Viemed's 2022 and 2021 traditional revenue, excluding COVID-19 response sales and services. While Viemed plans to continue investigating and introducing new complementary products and services and further expanding the coverage of existing products, home ventilation (both invasive and non-invasive) is expected to continue to represent the substantial majority of Viemed’s revenue.
Patients suffering from neuromuscular or respiratory diseases experience severe difficulty in breathing and require assistance from a ventilator to effectively move air in and out of their lungs. Invasive and non-invasive ventilation differ in how the air is delivered to the person. Invasive ventilation delivers air via a tube inserted into the windpipe. Non-invasive ventilation delivers air through a sealed mask that can be placed over the mouth.
The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) Medicare National Coverage Determinations Manual stipulates that ventilators are covered for the treatment of conditions associated with neuromuscular diseases, thoracic restrictive diseases, and chronic respiratory failure consequent to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Ventilators are also included in Medicare’s Frequently & Substantially Serviced payment category and are reimbursed under the Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (“HCPCS”) codes E0465 (invasive ventilation), E0466 (non-invasive ventilation) and E0467 (multi-function ventilation).
Viemed’s patients are served by RTs who are each licensed members of the American Association for Respiratory Care (“AARC”). The RT licensure and AARC membership ensure that Viemed is able to provide patients with in-home respiratory care services, equipment setup, training, and on-call services with state-of-the-art clinical protocols. Additionally, Viemed’s Chief Medical Officer, Dr. William Frazier, is a board certified pulmonary disease specialist and oversees clinical protocols.
Viemed sources hardware from vendors and pairs them with industry leading respiratory therapy. The emerging nature of the market presents risks that vendors may not be able to provide equipment to satisfy demand. Viemed has historically funded patient related capital expenditures through cash generated from operations or financing through an affiliate of its primary vendors. Additionally, Viemed patient related capital expenditures can be financed through its existing commercial credit facilities comprised of a revolving credit facility of up to $30.0 million, a delayed draw term loan facility of up to $30 million, and an accordion feature allowing the Company to increase the size of such facilities by up to an additional $30 million, subject to certain conditions, for a total borrowing capacity of up to $90 million. While Viemed currently has no immediate plans to draw on these facilities, the credit facilities allow flexibility in funding future operations.
Government Regulation
We are subject to extensive government regulation, including numerous laws directed at regulating reimbursement of our products and services under various government and commercial programs and preventing fraud and abuse, as more fully described below. We maintain certain safeguards intended to reduce the likelihood that we will engage in conduct or enter into arrangements in violation of these restrictions. Federal and state laws require that we obtain facility and other regulatory licenses and that we enroll as a supplier with federal and state health programs. Notwithstanding these measures, due to changes in and new interpretations of such laws and regulations, and changes in our business, among other factors, violations of these laws and regulations may still occur, which could subject us to: civil and criminal enforcement actions; licensure revocation, suspension, or non-renewal; severe fines and penalties; and even the termination of our ability to provide services, including those provided under certain government programs such as Medicare and Medicaid.

Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services
CMS requires providers of products or services to attain and maintain accreditation in order to participate in federally funded healthcare programs. To attain and maintain accreditation, companies are required to institute policies and procedures that, among other things, formalize the interaction of the company with patients. Accrediting bodies that are approved by CMS will perform audits of these policies and procedures every three years. Should a company fall out of compliance with the requirements of the accrediting body, expulsion from the Medicare program could follow. In December 2008, we became a Durable, Medical Equipment, Prosthetics, Orthotics, and Supplies accredited Medicare supplier by the Accreditation Commission for Health Care for our solutions. Our Medicare accreditation must be renewed every three years through passage of an on-site inspection. We last renewed our accreditation with Medicare in August 2021. Maintaining our accreditation and Medicare enrollment requires that we comply with numerous business and customer support standards. If we are found to be out of compliance with accreditation standards, our enrollment status in the Medicare program could be jeopardized, up to and including termination.
CMS also requires that all durable medical equipment ("DME") providers who bill the Medicare program maintain a surety bond of $50,000 per National Provider Identifier (“NPI”) number which Medicare has approved for billing privileges. We obtained surety bonds before the October 2009 deadline, and such bonds automatically renew annually.
In order to ensure that Medicare beneficiaries only receive medically necessary and appropriate items and services, the Medicare program has adopted a number of documentation requirements. For example, the DME Medicare Administrative Contractor (“MAC”) Supplier Manuals provide that clinical information from the “patient’s medical record” is required to justify the initial and ongoing medical necessity for the provision of DME. Some DME MACs, CMS staff and government subcontractors have taken the position, among other things, that the “patient’s medical record” refers not to documentation maintained by the DME supplier but instead to documentation maintained by the patient’s physician, healthcare facility or other clinician, and that clinical information created by the DME supplier’s personnel and confirmed by the patient’s physician is not sufficient to establish medical necessity. It may be difficult, and sometimes impossible, for us to obtain documentation from other healthcare providers. Moreover, auditors’ interpretations of these policies are inconsistent and subject to individual interpretation. This is then translated to individual supplier error rates and aggregated into a Durable Medical Equipment, Prosthetics, Orthotics and Supplies (“DMEPOS”) industry error rate, which is significantly higher than other Medicare provider/supplier types. High error rates lead to further audit activity and regulatory burdens. DME MACs continue to conduct extensive pre-payment and post-payment reviews across the DME industry and have determined a wide range of error rates. DME MACs have repeatedly cited documentation insufficiencies as the primary reason for claim denials. If these or other burdensome positions are generally adopted by auditors, DME MACs, other contractors or CMS in administering the Medicare program, we would have the right to challenge these positions as being contrary to law. If these interpretations of the documentation requirements are ultimately upheld, however, it could result in our making significant refunds and other payments to Medicare and our future revenues from Medicare may be significantly reduced. We have adjusted certain operational policies to address the current expectations of Medicare and its contractors. We cannot predict the adverse impact, if any, these interpretations of the Medicare documentation requirements or our revised policies might have on our operations, cash flow, and capital resources, but such impact could be material.
CMS maintains a Master List of Items Frequently Subject to Unnecessary Utilization. This list identifies items that could potentially be subject to prior authorization as a condition of Medicare payment. CMS has added home ventilators used with a non-invasive interface to the Master List of Items Frequently Subject to Unnecessary Utilization. If CMS requires prior authorization requirements for noninvasive home ventilation, it could materially impact our business.

Competitive Bidding Process
The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 required the Secretary of Health and Human Services ("HHS") to establish and implement programs under which competitive acquisition areas are established throughout the United States for purposes of awarding contracts for the furnishing of competitively priced items of durable medical equipment.
CMS conducts a competition for each competitive acquisition area under which providers submit bids to supply certain covered items of DME. Under the competitive bidding program, DME suppliers compete to become Medicare contract suppliers by submitting bids to furnish certain items in competitive bidding areas. As part of the competitive bidding process, single payment amounts (“SPAs”) replace the current Medicare DME fee schedule payment amounts for selected items in certain areas of the country. The SPAs are determined by using bids submitted by DME suppliers. In 2019, CMS included non-invasive ventilator products on the list of products subject to the competitive bidding program in Round 2021. On March 9, 2020, CMS announced that due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the United States President's exercise of the Defense Production Act, public concern regarding access to ventilators, and the non-invasive ventilators product category being new to the competitive bidding program, non-invasive ventilators were removed as a product category from Round 2021. On October 27, 2020, CMS announced that it had removed 13 of the 15 remaining product categories from Round 2021, including oxygen and PAP devices, because the payment amounts did not achieve expected savings. As a result of these announcements, we retain the ability to continue to furnish non-invasive ventilators and oxygen and PAP devices for all of our Medicare accredited areas. However, we are uncertain if non-invasive ventilators and oxygen and PAP devices will be included in future competitive bidding programs. The current Round 2021 contracts expire on December 31, 2023 and CMS has not announced a new round of competitive bidding. Historically, CMS announces new rounds of competitive bidding and starts the process approximately 18 months prior to the contract start date. We cannot predict the outcome of the competitive bidding process for contracted supplier selection or the impact of the competitive bidding process on reimbursements to our existing customers.
Licensure
Several states require that DME providers be licensed in order to sell products to patients in that state. Certain of these states require that durable medical equipment providers maintain an in-state location. Most of our state licenses are renewed on an annual basis. Although we believe we are in compliance with all applicable state regulations regarding licensure requirements, if we were found to be noncompliant, we could lose our licensure in that state, which could prohibit us from selling our current or future products to patients in that state. In addition, we are subject to certain state laws regarding professional licensure.
Accreditation
Many payors require accreditation under payor contracts. If we lose accreditation at any location, it could have an adverse impact on our reimbursement under payor contracts.
Fraud and Abuse Regulations
Federal Anti-Kickback and Self-Referral Laws. The Federal Anti-Kickback Statute, among other things, prohibits the knowing and willful offer, payment, solicitation or receipt of any form of remuneration, whether directly or indirectly and overtly or covertly, in return for, or to induce the referral of an individual for the:
•furnishing or arranging for the furnishing of items or services reimbursable in whole or in part under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs; or
•purchase, lease, or order of, or the arrangement or recommendation of the purchasing, leasing, or ordering of any item or service reimbursable in whole or in part under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs.
There are a number of narrow safe harbors to the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Such safe harbors permit certain payments and business practices that, although they would otherwise potentially implicate the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute, are not treated as an offense under the same if all of the requirements of the specific applicable safe harbor are met.
The Federal Anti-Kickback Statute applies to certain arrangements with healthcare providers, product end users and other parties, including marketing arrangements and discounts and other financial incentives offered in connection with the sales of our products. Although we believe that we have structured such arrangements to be in compliance with the Anti-Kickback Statute and other applicable laws, regulatory authorities may determine that our marketing, pricing, or other activities violate the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute or other applicable laws. Noncompliance with the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute can result in civil, administrative and/or criminal penalties, restrictions on our ability to operate in certain jurisdictions, and exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. In addition, to the extent we are found to not be in compliance, we may be required to curtail or restructure our operations. Any penalties, damages, fines, exclusions, curtailment or restructuring of our operations could adversely affect our ability to operate our business, our financial condition and our results of operations.

The Ethics in Patient Referrals Act, commonly known as the “Stark Law,” prohibits a physician from making referrals for certain “designated health services” payable by Medicare to an entity, including a company that furnishes DME, in which the physician or an immediate family member of such physician has an ownership or investment interest or with which the physician has entered into a compensation arrangement, unless a statutory exception applies. Violation of the Stark Law could result in denial of payment, disgorgement of reimbursements received under a noncompliance arrangement, civil penalties, damages and exclusion from Medicare or other governmental programs. Although we believe that we have structured our provider arrangements to comply with current Stark Law requirements, these requirements are highly technical and there can be no guarantee that regulatory authorities will not determine or assert that our arrangements are in violation of the Stark Law and do not otherwise meet applicable Stark Law exceptions.
Additionally, because some of these laws continue to evolve, we lack definitive guidance as to the application of certain key aspects of these laws as they relate to our arrangements with providers with respect to patient training. We cannot predict the final form that these regulations will take or the effect that the final regulations will have on us. As a result, our provider arrangements may ultimately be found to be noncompliant with applicable federal law.
False statements. The federal false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing, or omitting a material fact or making any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of healthcare benefits, items, or services. In addition to criminal penalties, violation of this statute may result in collateral administrative sanctions, including exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs.
Federal False Claims Act and Civil Monetary Penalties Law. The Federal False Claims Act provides, in part, that the federal government or a private party on behalf of the government may bring a lawsuit against any person whom it believes has knowingly presented, or caused to be presented, a false or fraudulent request for payment from the federal government, or who has made a false statement or used a false record to get a claim paid or to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government or who has knowingly retained an overpayment. In addition, amendments in 1986 to the Federal False Claims Act have made it easier for private parties to bring whistleblower lawsuits against companies.
The Civil Monetary Penalties Law provides, in part, that the federal government may seek civil monetary penalties against any person who presents or causes to be presented claims to a Federal healthcare program that the person knows or should know is for an item or services that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent, or the person has made a false statement or used a false record to get a claim paid. The federal government may also seek civil monetary penalties for a wide variety of other conduct, including offering remuneration to influence a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary’s selection of providers and violations of the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute.
Although we believe that we are in compliance with the Federal False Claims Act as well as the Civil Monetary Penalties Law, if we are found in violation of the same, we could be subject to various liabilities and penalties, including fines ranging from $13,508 to $27,018 for each false claim in violation of the Federal False Claims Act (as of 2023, and subject to annual adjustments for inflation) and varying amounts based on the type of violation of the Civil Monetary Penalties Law, plus up to three times the amount of damages that the federal government sustained because of the act of that person. In addition, the federal government may also seek exclusion from participation in all federal healthcare programs.
In addition, we bill Medicare Part B and other insurers directly for each sale to patients. As a result, we must comply with all laws, rules and regulations associated with filing claims with the Medicare program, including the Social Security Act, Medicare regulations, the Federal False Claims Act and the Civil Monetary Penalties Law, as well as a variety of additional federal and state laws. During an audit, insurers typically expect to find explicit documentation in the medical record to support a claim. Physicians and other clinicians, who are responsible for prescribing our products for patients, are expected to create and maintain the medical records that form the basis for the claims we submit to Medicare and other insurers. Any failure by physicians and other clinicians to properly document the medical records for patients using our products could invalidate claims, impair our ability to collect submitted claims and subject us to overpayment liabilities, Federal False Claims Act liabilities and other penalties including exclusion from the Medicare, Medicaid or private insurance programs.
To the extent we are found to not be in compliance with applicable federal and state laws and regulations, we may be required to curtail or restructure our operations. Any penalties, damages, fines, exclusions, curtailment or restructuring of our operations could adversely affect our ability to operate our business, our financial condition and our results of operations.
State fraud and abuse provisions. Many states have also adopted some form of anti-kickback and anti-referral laws and false claims acts that apply regardless of payor, in addition to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs. In some states, these laws apply and we believe that we are in compliance with such laws. Nevertheless, a determination of liability under such laws could result in fines and penalties, as well as restrictions on our ability to operate in these jurisdictions.

The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and Other Anti-Corruption Laws. We may be subject to a variety of domestic and foreign anti-corruption laws with respect to our regulatory compliance efforts and operations. The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”) is a criminal statute that prohibits an individual or business from paying, offering, promising or authorizing the provision of money (such as a bribe or kickback) or anything else of value (such as an improper gift, hospitality, or favor), directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining, retaining, or directing business or other advantages (such as favorable regulatory rulings). The FCPA also obligates companies with securities listed in the United States to comply with certain accounting provisions. Those provisions require a company such as ours to (i) maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions, expenses and asset dispositions, and (ii) devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that transactions are properly authorized, executed and recorded. The FCPA is subject to broad interpretation by the U.S. government. The past decade has seen a significant increase in enforcement activity. In addition to the FCPA, there are a number of other federal and state anti-corruption laws to which we may be subject, including, the U.S. domestic bribery statute contained in 18 USC § 201 (which prohibits bribing U.S. government officials) and the U.S. Travel Act (which in some instances addresses private-sector or commercial bribery both within and outside the United States).
We could be held liable under the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws for the illegal activities of our employees, representatives, contractors, collaborators, agents, subsidiaries, or affiliates, even if we did not explicitly authorize such activity. Although we will seek to comply with anti-corruption laws, there can be no assurance that all of our employees, representatives, contractors, collaborators, agents, subsidiaries or affiliates will comply with these laws at all times. Violation of these laws could subject us to whistleblower complaints, investigations, sanctions, settlements, prosecution, other enforcement actions, disgorgement of profits, significant fines, damages, other civil and criminal penalties or injunctions, suspension and/or debarment from contracting with certain governments or other persons, the loss of export privileges, reputational harm, adverse media coverage and other collateral consequences. In addition, our directors, officers, employees, and other representatives who engage in violations of the FCPA and certain other anti-corruption statutes may face imprisonment, fines and penalties. If any subpoenas or investigations are launched, or governmental or other sanctions are imposed, or if we do not prevail in any possible civil or criminal litigation, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially harmed. In addition, responding to any action will likely result in a materially significant diversion of management’s attention and resources and significant defense costs and other professional fees. Enforcement actions and sanctions could further harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
HIPAA. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) established uniform standards governing the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protecting the security and privacy of individually identifiable health information maintained or transmitted by healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses (collectively “covered entities”). The following standards have been promulgated under HIPAA’s regulations:
•the Standards for Privacy of Individually Identifiable Health Information, which restrict the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health information, or “protected health information”;
•the Standards for Electronic Transactions, which establish standards for common healthcare transactions, such as claims information, plan eligibility, payment information and the use of electronic signatures;
•the Security Standards, which require covered entities to implement and maintain certain security measures to safeguard certain electronic health information, including the adoption of administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect such information; and
•the breach notification rules, which require covered entitles to provide notification to affected individuals, the HHS and the media in the event of a breach of unsecured protected health information.
In 2009, Congress passed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (“ARRA”) which included sweeping changes to HIPAA, including an expansion of HIPAA’s privacy and security standards. ARRA includes the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 (“HITECH”) which, among other things, made HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to business associates of covered entities. A business associate is a person or entity that performs certain functions or activities on behalf of a covered entity that involve the use or disclosure of protected health information. As a result, business associates are now subject to significant civil and criminal penalties for failure to comply with applicable standards. Moreover, HITECH creates a new requirement to report certain breaches of unsecured, individually identifiable health information and imposes penalties on entities that fail to do so. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions.

The 2013 final HITECH omnibus rule (the “HITECH Final Rule”) modifies the breach reporting standard in a manner that makes more data security incidents qualify as reportable breaches. Any liability from a failure to comply with the requirements of HIPAA or the HITECH Act could adversely affect our financial condition. The costs of complying with privacy and security related legal and regulatory requirements are burdensome and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. The HITECH Final Rule will continue to be subject to interpretation by various courts and other governmental authorities, thus creating potentially complex compliance issues for us, as well as referring providers.
In addition to federal regulations issued under HIPAA, some states have enacted privacy and security statutes or regulations that, in certain cases, are more stringent than those issued under HIPAA. In those cases, it may be necessary to modify our planned operations and procedures to comply with the more stringent state laws. Most states have also adopted breach notification laws that require notification to affected individuals and certain state agencies if there is a security breach of certain individually-identifiable information. If we suffer a privacy or security breach, we could be required to expend significant resources to provide notification to the affected individuals and address the breach, as well as reputational harm associated with the breach. If we fail to comply with applicable state laws and regulations, we could be subject to additional sanctions. Any liability from failure to comply with the requirements of HIPAA, HITECH or state privacy and security statutes or regulations could adversely affect our financial condition. The costs of complying with privacy and security related legal and regulatory requirements are burdensome and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
General Regulatory Compliance and Health Care Reform
The evolving regulatory and compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust systems to comply with different compliance or reporting requirements in multiple jurisdictions increase the possibility that a healthcare company may fail to comply fully with one or more of these requirements. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the health regulatory laws described above or any other laws that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including potentially significant criminal and civil and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business, financial condition and our results of operations.
In March 2010, the Affordable Care Act (“ACA”) was enacted into law in the United States. This healthcare reform, which included a number of provisions aimed at improving the quality and decreasing the cost of healthcare, has resulted in significant reimbursement cuts in Medicare payments to hospitals and other healthcare providers in the healthcare reimbursement system, evolving toward value- and outcomes-based reimbursement methodologies. It is uncertain what long-term consequences these provisions will have on patient access to new technologies and what impact these provisions will have on Medicare reimbursement rates. Other elements of the ACA, including comparative effectiveness research, an independent payment advisory board and payment systems reform, including shared savings pilots and other reforms, may result in fundamental changes to federal healthcare reimbursement programs. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 ("TCJA") repealed penalties for noncompliance with the requirement for insurance coverage known as the “individual mandate.” This change could affect whether individuals enroll in health plans and could impact insurers with which we contract. Other changes to the ACA could impact the number of patients who have access to our products. Existing and additional legislative or administrative reforms, or any repeal of provisions, of the U.S. healthcare reimbursement systems may significantly reduce reimbursement or otherwise impact coverage for our medical devices, or adverse decisions relating to our products by administrators of such systems in coverage or reimbursement issues could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.
Third-Party Reimbursement
In the United States and elsewhere, sales of medical devices depend in significant part on the availability of coverage and reimbursement to providers and patients from third-party payors. Third-party payors include private insurance plans and governmental programs. As with other medical devices, reimbursement for our products can differ significantly from payor to payor, and our products are not universally covered by third-party commercial payors. Further, third-party payors continually review existing technologies for continued coverage and can, with limited notice, deny or reverse coverage for existing products.
Two principal governmental third-party payors in the United States are Medicare and Medicaid. Medicare is a federal program that provides certain medical insurance benefits to persons age 65 and over, certain disabled persons and others. In contrast, Medicaid is a medical assistance program jointly funded by federal and state governments to serve certain individuals and families with low incomes and who meet other eligibility requirements. Each state administers its own Medicaid program which determines the benefits made available to the Medicaid recipients in that state. The Medicare and Medicaid statutory framework is subject to administrative rulings, interpretations and discretion that affect the amount and timing of reimbursement made under Medicare and Medicaid.

CMS, which is the agency within the HHS that administers both Medicare and Medicaid, has the authority to decline to cover particular products or services if it determines that they are not “reasonable and necessary” for the treatment of Medicare beneficiaries. A coverage determination for a product, which establishes the indications that will be covered, and any restrictions or limitations, can be developed at the national level by CMS through a National Coverage Determination (“NCD”) or at the local level through a Local Coverage Determination (“LCD”) by a regional DME MAC. CMS could issues new NCDs or the regional DME MACs could issue LCDs related to a full range of respiratory DME products. If such NCDs or LCDs are issued or revised, they could significantly alter the coverage under Medicare and materially impact our business.
With respect to our ventilator products, an NCD for the DME Reference List, which has been effective since April 1, 2003, indicates that ventilators, including our products, are covered for the treatment of neuromuscular diseases, thoracic restrictive diseases, and chronic respiratory failure consequent to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. While the NCD for the DME Reference List has been updated, no separate NCD has been issued for ventilators. Monthly rental revenue from ventilators represented approximately 68% and 77%, respectively, of traditional revenue, excluding COVID-19 response sales and services, for 2022 and 2021. Medicare Administrative Contractors responsible for processing durable medical equipment claims have issued LCDs for Respiratory Assist Devices (“RADs”) which contain language describing an overlap in conditions used to determine coverage for RADs and ventilator devices. These LCDs state that the treatment plan for any individual patient, including the determination to use a ventilator or a BiPAP, may vary and will be made based upon the specifics of each individual beneficiary’s medical condition. Due to this variability, determinations of coverage for our ventilator products are subject to scrutiny of individual medical records and claims. Revenues from Medicare and Medicaid accounted for 56% and 64%, respectively, of traditional revenue, excluding COVID-19 response sales and services, for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021.
Because Medicare criteria is extensive, we have a team dedicated to educating prescribers to help them understand how Medicare policy affects their patients and the medical record documentation needed to meet both NCD and LCD requirements. We maintain open communication with physician key opinion leaders and with Medicare Administrative Contractors to provide data as it becomes available that could potentially influence coverage decisions. We also continue to closely monitor our Medicare business to identify trends that could have a negative impact on certain Medicare patients’ access to our products, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
Commercial payors that reimburse for our products do so in a variety of ways, depending on the insurance plan’s policies, employer and benefit manager input, and contracts with their provider network. Moreover, Medicaid programs and some commercial insurance plans, especially Medicare Advantage plans (commercial insurers that are administering Medicare benefits to certain beneficiaries), are frequently influenced by Medicare coverage determinations. In working with payors who follow Medicare criteria, we have focused on clear communications with insurers to ensure mutual understanding of criteria interpretation, which differs significantly among the plans from very restrictive to quite lenient, and we then work closely with prescribers to educate them accordingly. While this approach has had positive impact, we do not know if or when additional payors may adopt the LCD criteria nor do we know how they will choose to interpret it.
We believe a reduction or elimination of coverage or reimbursement of our products by Medicare would likely cause some commercial third-party payors to implement similar reductions in their coverage or reimbursement of our products. If we are unable to expand coverage of our products by additional commercial payors, or if third-party payors that currently cover or reimburse for our products reverse or limit their coverage in the future, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.
Emerging Growth Company Status
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the “JOBS Act”). For as long as we are an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding advisory “say-on-pay” votes on executive compensation and shareholder advisory votes on golden parachute compensation. We will remain an “emerging growth company” until the earliest of (i) the last day of our fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenues of $1.07 billion (as such amount is indexed for inflation every five years by the SEC to reflect the change in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, setting the threshold to the nearest $1 million) or more; (ii) the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of our first sale of common equity securities pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”); (iii) the date on which we have, during the prior three-year period, issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt; and (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a “large accelerated filer” under the Exchange Act.
We cannot predict if investors will find our common shares less attractive to the extent we rely on the exemptions available to emerging growth companies. If some investors find our common shares less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common shares and our share price may be more volatile.

December 31, 2022 and 2021 

In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. An emerging growth company can therefore delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We may choose to take advantage of such extended transition period.
Competition
The respiratory care industry is highly competitive. While Viemed is one of the top three providers of NIV and related services in the United States, its current competitors may gain market share, and any new entrants, with greater financial and technical resources, may provide additional competition. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that Viemed will be able to grow its operations organically to meet the competitive environment.
Significant Customers
For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, Viemed had no customers that accounted for 10% or more of its consolidated traditional revenue streams. 
Viemed earns revenues by seeking reimbursement from Medicare and private health insurance companies, with the Medicare program of the United States government being the primary entity making payments. If the Medicare program were to slow payments of Viemed receivables for any reason, Viemed would be adversely impacted.
A majority of the Company’s revenues are derived from the fee-for-service pricing guidelines set by CMS. These pricing guidelines are subject to change at the discretion of CMS.
Employees
At December 31, 2022, Viemed had 743 employees, in addition to consultants working directly with hospitals and other healthcare providers to help simplify the administrative process for patients transitioning from hospital to home care.
