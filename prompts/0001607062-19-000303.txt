Item 1. Business
 
We are an Emerging growth company with permanent revenue generating operations. We were formed on June 23, 2017 and have two years of business experience.
 
The United Express intends to operate as a general company of transportation and delivery of merchandise, household goods, and other items for companies and individuals across the United State. As such, it is difficult to determine the average customer of the Company as the business will have the licensure and the ability to effectively arrange for the transportation any type of merchandise. Management anticipates that the business will receive orders for service from companies seeking to move merchandise, as well as, people relocating to different areas of the target regional market area. A primary concern for the Company is its ability to quickly respond to customer request, give affordable price for the services, and carry the full responsibility from pick up to drop off. In 2018-2019, the price of oil and its associated refined energy products has been within a reasonable, steady range. Lack of major volatile in oil prices has caused the freight and logistic industries costs to be on a straight level during last 12 months. In the event of an increase in the price of fuel, we will also reasonably increase prices (at a standardized rate of markup) to ensure the profitability of the business. The Company hires drivers from any state with CDL or class “B” driver license at least one year of experience.
 
As the transportation provider we provide shipping by cargo vans based upon delivery requirements, transportation routes, type of shipment, equipment requirements, cargo size, delivery time and price.
 
During reported period our business activities have focused mostly on the development of our business plan, locating producers of goods, despatchers, cargo brokers, researching for new customers, drivers, storages, van supplies, development of optimal traffic routes.
 
 Revenues
 
Our revenues from July 1, 2018 to June 30, 2019 was $89,964. We currently have many customers who working with us. We generated revenue from transportation services and logistics.
 
Marketing Program
 
We expect that the business will expand during the next five years of operation. Mr. Stoukan intends to implement marketing campaigns that will effectively target small businesses, medium sized businesses, product sellers, and distribution companies within the target market.
