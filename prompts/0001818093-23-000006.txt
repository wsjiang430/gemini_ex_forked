Item 1. Business. 
Company Overview
The Beauty Health Company is a global category-creating company focused on delivering beauty health experiences that help consumers reinvent their relationship with their skin, bodies and self-confidence. Our flagship brand, Hydrafacial, created the category of hydradermabrasion by using a patented Vortex-Fusion Delivery System (“Delivery System”) to cleanse, extract, and hydrate the skin with proprietary solutions and serums. Hydrafacial provides a non-invasive and approachable skincare experience. Together, with our powerful community of aestheticians, consumers and partners, we are personalizing skin care solutions for all ages, genders, skin tones, and skin types. 
Growth Strategy in General
We intend to fulfill our vision by employing the following strategy, which we believe will generate a flywheel effect to increase our platform’s momentum:
1.Expand our footprint by selling innovative products and connected experiences to providers and consumers
2.Invest in our providers, especially the trusted aesthetician, to help turn them into brand evangelists and advocates providing first-class experiences
3.Nurture direct relationships with our consumers, building brand awareness and driving them to our trusted community
4.Leverage our global infrastructure and a connected technology platform to fuel growth and community engagement
5.Supercharge our platform with targeted acquisitions to complement our portfolio 
Our strategy begins with developing a network of providers, brand partners, and retail partners to build a distribution platform for our innovative products and experiences. We intend to utilize our sales force to sell our offering, inviting providers and partners to become a part of our community. We believe that each placement of our offering will grow the platform and increase consumers’ awareness of us, ultimately building a recognizable and aspirational brand drawing in consumers. In this process, we will particularly focus on the trusted aesthetician.
Historically, companies in the medical aesthetics industry focused on physicians, nurses, front-office staff, and business owners. Notably absent from their focus was the aesthetician, a highly influential provider who serves as a source of skincare information and recommendations for their clients and patients. We recognized the opportunity to empower the aesthetician and created programs to elevate their skills, knowledge, and confidence through a continued relationship so they feel supported. As a result, we have open dialogue with our aesthetician providers and receive valuable information on consumer preferences and behaviors they see in their practices. These aestheticians have since become our most influential ambassadors, driving awareness, recommending our products, and becoming a point of education for our consumers. While they are not our employees or contractors, we believe they provide an important competitive advantage to us, as a well-trained aesthetician can provide consumers with a consistent, memorable, first-class experience no matter where a consumer accesses our products and experiences. We believe that this in turn builds loyalty from the consumer to BeautyHealth. 
Aestheticians are one part of our community that we recognize as powerful. We continue to focus on our other providers, including physicians, nurses, and other partners to build consumer awareness for our brands. By investing in our providers, we believe we are creating a thriving community as they recommend our products and experiences as part of any skincare and wellness routine. In our view, investing our efforts in any part of our community drives utilization amongst consumers, resulting in a potent formula for growth. 
Another focus area of our growth strategy is nurturing our relationship with the consumer. As the ultimate end user, the consumer is at the core of our efforts. We have an experienced team who meticulously curate the consumer journey, from lead generation that invites consumers to our community to the user experience of our offerings. We employ a multi-pronged approach to consumer acquisition and engagement, including but not limited to agile marketing activation events, storytelling, gamification, and loyalty. We believe driving increased consumer traffic to our network of providers, retailers, and brand 
partners will increase the utilization of our products and experiences, further cementing the compelling value proposition we offer to our partners and thereby driving increased purchases from them.
We believe our products and experiences are universal in their appeal across cultures, genders, skin tones, and skin types, making a compelling case for our international expansion. We believe there is significant opportunity in exporting our products and experiences to global markets and applying our strategy abroad to further increase the reach and influence of our platform. Our offering is available in over 90 countries through either a direct commercial presence or distributors. We have global commercial infrastructure supporting our 16 direct markets across the world, which should position us to quickly adapt to and penetrate these key markets. 
Lastly, we intend to supercharge our platform via targeted acquisitions, expanding the breadth of our platform with additional innovative products and experiences. We believe the introduction of additional offerings will generate increased engagement among our community while further expanding it via the introduction of the acquired company’s established base of consumers.
We will take a disciplined approach to acquisitions, adhering to the below criteria in search for opportunities that:
1.Include a differentiated product or service, which can generally be demonstrated with a high Net Promoter Score, which is a customer loyalty and satisfaction measurement
2.Complement our existing platform and community, leveraging the aesthetician; and
3.Provide a financially attractive profile via compelling revenue growth, recurring revenue characteristics, or profitability.
These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular acquisition may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that our management may deem relevant.
Hydrafacial – Our Flagship Brand
Our first BeautyHealth brand and the cornerstone of our portfolio is Hydrafacial. Using our patented Delivery System to cleanse, extract, and hydrate the skin with proprietary solutions and serums, Hydrafacial created the category of hydradermabrasion. As an experience appropriate for all ages, genders, skin types, and skin tones, Hydrafacial bridges the world of medical skin correction to traditional over-the-counter beauty. As such, we employ an omnichannel strategy to place Delivery Systems where consumers live, work, and play, including medical offices, medispas, day spas, hotels, resorts, gyms, wellness centers, and other retail settings. We anticipate continuing to expand the types of channels where Delivery Systems are sold. To date, Hydrafacial has a foundation of more than 25,000 Delivery Systems across 90+ countries.  
Business Model
Hydrafacial uses a razor / razor blade business model. The Delivery System, which facilitates the Hydrafacial treatment, is the razor. Delivery Systems are purchased by providers to offer Hydrafacial to their clients and patients. In conjunction with the sale of Delivery Systems, we also sell our serum solutions and consumables (collectively “Consumables”). The Consumables are akin to the razor blades, consisting of single-use tips, solutions, and serums used during a Hydrafacial treatment. Delivery Systems and Consumables can be bought together or separately.
Delivery Systems follow a traditional capital equipment cycle, with the Delivery System lasting providers for years. Oftentimes, providers buy additional Delivery Systems to increase the number of Hydrafacial treatments their business can provide at any given time.
Consumables follow a recurring revenue model as they are purchased on a periodic basis by providers as they exhaust their supplies. The expansion of the number of Delivery Systems providing experiences, or “install base,” increases the foundation for future recurring revenue by providing a platform for more treatments, driving higher Consumables sales. Additionally, increasing the utilization of the install base will also contribute to higher Consumables revenue. As we optimize our install base, we believe Consumables revenue will ultimately become a larger share of Hydrafacial’s business.
Hydrafacial operates through a direct sales force in 16 markets. We believe Hydrafacial has significant upside opportunities across the globe, particularly in China, Japan, South Korea, and Europe. These markets have a large and growing group of 
consumers searching for non-invasive beauty health experiences, and we aim to invest in initiatives that will increase consumer penetration in these markets. 
The Hydrafacial Experience
A Hydrafacial treatment is a noninvasive hydradermabrasion process utilizing a patented Delivery System to cleanse, extract, and hydrate skin with proprietary solutions and serums. We believe Hydrafacial is accessible and appropriate for consumers across all genders, ages, skin types, and skin tones. 
The Hydrafacial experience results in instantly gratifying glowing skin and a “gunkie” container that collects dead skin cells and debris that were extracted from the skin. We believe the instant gratification provided by our Hydrafacial treatment generates high consumer and provider affinity for our brand.
A summary of the Hydrafacial treatment is set forth below. In addition, consumers and providers can personalize their Hydrafacial treatments to target specific skin concerns or needs by adding customized chemical peels, various serums, LED light therapy, and/or lymphatic drainage. Furthermore, a Hydrafacial treatment can be applied to the neck/decolletage, back, hands, or other parts of the body.

Hydrafacial Treatment Steps
Step 1: Cleanse | Skin is cleansed through Vortex Fusion Technology, a specially designed tip, and a cleansing solution. The outermost layer of skin is exfoliated with a customized peel which removes dead skin cells.
Step 2: Extract | Extractions and removal of remaining debris is performed with Vortex Fusion Technology, a specialized tip, and proprietary solutions. 
Step 3: Hydrate | Vortex Fusion Technology is paired with a specialized tip to deliver and infuse hyaluronic acid and antioxidants to the skin to nourish, hydrate, and protect. 

Among consumers, the Hydrafacial experience has generated a high Net Promoter Score (“NPS”), a customer loyalty and satisfaction measurement assessed by asking customers how likely they are to recommend a certain product or service to others. Based on a study performed by a major consulting firm on our behalf, which surveyed over 1,000 Hydrafacial users, Hydrafacial received an NPS of 44, considered a best-in-class score as it is higher than the NPS for other skin care regimens that Hydrafacial users reported they also commonly used.
Hydrafacial Products
At the core of Hydrafacial’s product offering is Syndeo, the current generation Delivery System, and its associated Consumables. We believe each Delivery System provides an attractive return on investment to providers with a short payback period to recoup the cost of the Delivery System.
Syndeo
Syndeo is the current generation Hydrafacial Delivery System that launched in the United States in March 2022. The system is designed to elevate every part of the treatment and connects providers to consumers’ preferences to create more personalized experiences. The hardware and software in the Syndeo Delivery System has been fully updated and includes Wi-Fi connectivity and radio frequency identification (“RFID”). These technologies allow providers and us to collect data on Hydrafacial consumers to ultimately provide a better experience for them.
We expect to launch Syndeo in our EMEA and APAC markets in the first half of 2023. In the meantime, we are selling our Elite Tower Delivery System, our previous Delivery System model that was first launched in 2016, in the EMEA and APAC markets. Upon Syndeo’s launch in EMEA and APAC, we anticipate that we will no longer market our Elite Tower in our direct markets.
Consumables
Our Consumables consist of single-use tips, solutions, and serums used to provide a Hydrafacial treatment. The table below summarizes our Consumables product offering:

Hydrafacial Consumables
Consumable | Description | Replenishment Frequency 
Tips | Patented, patterned caps placed on the handpiece of the Delivery System to create pneumatic suction and deliver solutions and serums to the skin | Minimum 3 single-use tips used per Hydrafacial experience 
Solutions | Proprietary formulations of ingredients delivered at different steps of the Hydrafacial experience | 4 bottle SKUs required to provide a Hydrafacial experience; the bottles provide for approximately 15 treatments3 SKUs contain varying strength chemical peel treatments. The provider chooses which strength to use during treatment, and each SKU lasts 1-2 treatments.
Serums | Optional add-on to target specific skin concerns. Offering includes proprietary boosters co-developed via collaborations with various skincare brands. | 1-2 treatments per serum vial 

Product Development Pipeline
Boosters 
A key differentiating factor of the Hydrafacial treatment is how we partner with leading skincare brands to co-develop boosters, an optional add-on serum that tailors a Hydrafacial treatment based on a consumer’s skincare concerns. 
We do not believe there is another beauty health offering in the market that features leading third-party skincare brands on its platform. By leveraging the unique technologies of our partners, we believe our booster strategy allows us to innovate rapidly and cost effectively, staying current with dynamic skincare trends and gaining exposure to new consumers through our partner brands.
We currently offer a portfolio of approximately 20 boosters and intend to continue partnering with new brands internationally and locally to offer innovative and tailored booster products to our consumers.
Hydrafacial Nation App
A beta version of the Hydrafacial Nation app launched in 2021. The app is intended to allow consumers to learn about their skin health, discover which treatment options are right for them, and track their treatments over time. If a consumer elects to do so, the app will pair the consumer with Syndeo, allowing providers to share treatment details with the consumer and continue to build a 1:1 relationship outside of the treatment room.
Keravive
Keravive is a treatment for scalp health that includes an in-office component and a 30-day take home spray. The treatment is designed to cleanse, exfoliate, and hydrate the scalp, which helps lead to a healthier scalp and promotes healthier, thicker, and fuller-looking hair. We are evaluating the optimal re-launch strategy for Keravive and believe it will take time before sales of Keravive become a meaningful part of Hydrafacial’s business.
Hydrafacial Growth Strategy
Our growth strategy for Hydrafacial is predicated on our BeautyHealth flywheel strategy. First, we intend to expand our footprint by selling Delivery Systems and connected experiences to our community. The Syndeo Delivery System represents a milestone for us in connecting our community, introducing a digital experience by collecting data to better understand consumer and provider behaviors. With this data, we believe we will have meaningful opportunity to boost engagement and utilization via storytelling, branding, and gamification.
Second, we intend to invest in our providers as we enhance the overall consumer experience. We also intend to employ unique activation and engagement programs that empower beauty health professionals to expand their knowledge of our products, experiences, industry, and marketing, which we believe will help turn our providers into brand evangelists and advocates that provide first-class experiences to consumers. 
Third, we intend to nurture our relationship with consumers to help build awareness and drive them to our providers. We will continue to pursue high return on investment opportunities within sales, marketing, and training to help catalyze our presence in business to consumer channels and expand our reach to consumers where they live, work, and play. These investments include a focus on growth marketing efforts to build campaigns in paid social, influencer and content marketing. 
Lastly, we intend to build out our global infrastructure to support our growth ambitions and connected platform. We believe these investments should create degrees of operating leverage to accelerate our goal of increased profitability in the future. 
Industry Overview
We are a pioneer and key player in the emerging category of beauty health, which represents the intersection of over-the-counter consumer beauty / wellness products with medical aesthetic / health products and procedures. Historically, these categories were viewed separately, but they are part of a spectrum aimed at helping consumers look and feel their best. The beauty / wellness industry sells widely accessible topicals, supplements, and digital tools. However, the market is a crowded and confusing space – the sheer volume of products can leave consumers overwhelmed by choice. On the other end of the spectrum, medical aesthetics offers more corrective and invasive products and procedures such as injectables and energy-based treatments. The high price tag and clinical setting of these treatments may serve as barriers to generating wider consumer demand. We seek to position ourselves not as a substitute for or competitor to either of these categories, but rather as the complimentary bridge linking the two categories. We believe that the consumer who follows a beauty and wellness regimen with topicals or supplements may someday graduate to medical procedures, while the medical aesthetics patient is almost certainly a loyal consumer of beauty topical products. 
We don’t believe we have to be an “either/or” company (beauty or health/non-invasive or minimally invasive). Rather, we believe we are an “and” company. We intend to gather insights to inform our strategy as the consumer travels through the worlds of beauty and health, whether it be at home or in a provider’s office, allowing us to tailor increasingly engaging experiences that ultimately generate revenue. Many of our providers offer Hydrafacial treatments as a bundle with other procedures, such as injectables or energy-based treatments.
Manufacturing; Sourcing and Material
We outsource the manufacturing of many of our products to multiple contract manufacturers that are primarily located in North America, Europe, and Asia. However, the Hydrafacial Delivery Systems are assembled in our Long Beach, California manufacturing facility, where our quality assurance team monitors and ensures the integrity of the Delivery Systems we manufacture and conducts compliance audits. In the future, we plan to localize the assembly of delivery systems in the regions in which we operate, beginning with in-region manufacturing for China.
The components and raw materials used in our products are sourced from a variety of component and raw material suppliers. To provide products to customers on a timely, cost-effective basis, we review existing contract manufacturers and suppliers and evaluate new partners and suppliers periodically with the objectives of improving quality, increasing innovation, accelerating speed-to-market, maintaining supply sufficiency, and reducing costs. As we integrate acquired businesses, distributors, and/or brands, we will continually seek new ways to leverage our production and sourcing capabilities to improve our overall supply chain performance.
We purchase components and raw materials for our products from various third parties and third-party contract manufacturers on a purchase order basis. We also purchase packaging components manufactured to our design specifications. We collaborate with our suppliers and contract manufacturers to ensure that they follow our established product design specifications and quality assurance programs. We also have our suppliers and contract manufacturers go through a vendor qualification and audit process to verify and ensure that they meet our manufacturing standards and expectations. We ensure our partners have the requisite experience to produce our products and accessories and develop relationships with them to maintain access to the resources needed to scale. To have control of supply and component pipelines, we own certain tooling and equipment required to manufacture our products.
While we have single supply relationships for certain of our key components, we try to mitigate related risks through various measures. We qualify alternative suppliers and manufacturers when possible, maintain controls and methods to mitigate risk through buffer maintenance, implement dual and/or co-sourcing, if needed, and develop contingency plans for responding to disruptions, such as maintaining inventory of single source components or leverage alternative freight modes that can have cost implications. However, given the current global supply and freight constraints driven by the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as natural disasters, we have faced, and may continue to face, challenges with various manufacturing related components and raw material shortages. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we believe that we currently have adequate sources of supply for all our products.
Distribution Facilities
We operate and distribute finished products from our leased distribution facilities in Long Beach, California. We also have a global network of fulfillment and distribution centers that supports our international customers. We regularly evaluate our distribution infrastructure and consolidate or expand our distribution capacity as we believe appropriate for our operations and to meet anticipated needs.
Research and Development
Our research and development team, which includes scientists, engineers, analysts, and other employees involved in product and packaging innovation, works closely with our marketing and product development teams and third-party suppliers to generate ideas, develop new products and product line extensions, create new packaging concepts, and improve, redesign, or reformulate existing products. In addition, these research and development personnel work to identify recent trends using market intelligence and consumer needs to bring products to market. 
We have increased our focus on innovation in Europe and in Asia, particularly in China, Japan, and South Korea to both support our growth internationally and to satisfy the demand for locally-relevant consumer products.
Quality and Regulatory 
Our quality and regulatory team are responsible for registrations, ensuring product safety, and meeting regulatory compliance for all jurisdictions in which we operate.
Competition
The beauty and personal care market is fragmented and highly competitive, with several companies specializing in different subsectors, including skincare, haircare, supplements, and medical products and procedures. Many of our competitors such as DiamondGlow, Dermasweep, Cartessa, OxyGeneo, Venus Glow, JetPeel, SaltFacial, and Glownar seek to compete with us by offering similar skin care and facial treatment products and services, and offering such products and services at similar or aggressive pricing. 
Our ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of new products and services, as well as staying relevant within the market and conforming to beauty and health trends. Principal competitive factors important to us include price, product and service features and offerings, relative price to performance, beauty health trends, marketing and distribution capability, service and support, and corporate reputation.
We believe our efforts to expand our brand recognition, cultivate our BeautyHealth community, invest in marketing capabilities, and activate consumers across channels will allow us to compete effectively as we expand globally. We are focused on expanding the beauty health category and creating a premier beauty health experience.
Sales and Marketing
Push and Pull Marketing
Our ability to effectively market our brand is critical to our operational success. Our marketing spend is based on a targeted “push and pull” marketing model that engages with both providers and consumers. On the “push” side, we intend to continue investing in training aestheticians and other providers (as further explained below), creating a loyalty program, and supporting other ongoing engagements. 
Over the last few years, we have focused on developing the marketing “pull” side by creating consumer demand, which is expected to be one of the key elements of growth to lead to an increase in recurring revenue from our customers. This focus on business to consumer marketing began with our rebranding of Hydrafacial in 2017, which provided a unique, differentiated identity. 
We believe transformational experiences are key to growing brand awareness. With aided brand awareness at 8%, we have focused on introducing our brand to highly targeted consumer growth markets around the world. We intend to continue our marketing activation efforts by using digital and location-based engagement.
Digital Marketing
We are also continuously innovating to increase our sales by elevating our digital presence, social media presence, and influencer marketing efforts all designed to build brand equity and consumer engagement. Furthermore, we utilize different methods to customize the consumer experience, including using artificial intelligence-powered tools to provide personalized advice on selecting and using products.
Customers
The majority of our customers are providers within the professional medical industry (dermatologists, plastic surgeons, and medical spas), aesthetician, and beauty retail industry (spas, hotels, and other retailers). We currently sell approximately 66% of our Delivery Systems and Consumables into the professional medical channel. No individual customer accounted for 10% or more of our net sales in fiscal 2022. We expect that trend to continue on a global scale. In 2022, revenue derived from markets outside the United States and Canada comprised approximately 34% of total revenue. Going forward, we expect total revenue share from our global markets to increase as we continue to invest in expanding our global footprint in markets such as China, Japan, South Korea, and Europe. 
Trademarks, Patents and Domain Names
As of December 31, 2022, we had 83 patents with 49 pending patent applications worldwide to protect Hydrafacial’s current and contemplated technology platform. Our patent portfolio covers key aspects of certain products, systems, and designs, including several issued U.S. patents directed to features of the Hydrafacial MD® liquid-based skin exfoliation system. The portfolio includes issued U.S. patents, which will begin to expire in 2026, directed to the manifold and console of the Hydrafacial MD® system and skin treatment tips used in the system. 
We also own and have applied to register numerous trademarks and service marks in the United States and in other countries throughout the world. Some of our trademarks are of material importance. The duration of trademark registrations varies from country to country. However, trademarks are generally valid and may be renewed indefinitely as long as they are in use and/or their registrations are properly maintained. In addition, we have registered and maintain numerous internet domain names. 
Seasonality and Quarterly Results
Our business is subject to moderate seasonal fluctuations. We typically experience the highest revenues and operating income in the fiscal fourth quarter and lowest revenues and operating income in the first fiscal quarter. New product and service introductions can also impact net sales, cost of sales, and operating expenses. The timing of product and service introductions can also impact the Company’s net sales to its distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an older or similar product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and distributors anticipate a product introduction.
Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has had an impact on consumer behaviors worldwide resulting in changes in the seasonal fluctuations of our business, especially in China since the second fiscal quarter of 2022. Furthermore, as our business outside of the United States grows, seasonal fluctuations may smooth out. As a result, results for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year. 
Government Regulation
As a consumer-driven organization delivering comprehensive beauty health services and treatments, we are subject to the laws of the United States of America and multiple foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. The rules and regulations of various governing bodies may differ among jurisdictions. Certain of our products and our operations are subject to extensive regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), and other federal and state authorities in the United States, as well as comparable authorities in foreign jurisdictions. For example, certain of our products are subject to regulation as medical devices or cosmetics in the United States under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”), as implemented and enforced by the FDA.
Regulation of Medical Devices
The FDA regulates the development, design, non-clinical and clinical research, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, packaging, storage, installation, servicing, recordkeeping, premarket clearance or approval, adverse event reporting, advertising, promotion, marketing and distribution, and import and export of medical devices to ensure that medical devices distributed domestically are safe and effective for their intended uses and otherwise meet the requirements of the FDCA.
FDA Premarket Clearance and Approval Requirements
Unless an exemption applies, each medical device commercially distributed in the United States requires either FDA clearance of a premarket notification submitted under Section 510(k) of the FDCA, or approval of a premarket approval application (“PMA”). Under the FDCA, medical devices are classified into one of three classes—Class I, Class II or Class III—depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of manufacturer and regulatory control needed to ensure the device’s safety and effectiveness. Class I includes devices with the lowest risk to the patient and are those for which safety and effectiveness can be assured by adherence to the FDA’s General Controls for medical devices, which include compliance with the applicable portions of the Quality System Regulation (“QSR”); facility registration and product listing; reporting of adverse medical events; and truthful and non-misleading labeling, advertising, and promotional materials. Class II devices are subject to the FDA’s General Controls, and Special Controls as deemed necessary by the FDA to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device. These Special Controls can include performance standards, post-market surveillance, patient registries and recommendations set forth in FDA guidance documents.
While most Class I devices are exempt from the 510(k) premarket notification requirement, manufacturers of most Class II devices are required to submit to the FDA a premarket notification application under Section 510(k) of the FDCA before engaging in commercial distribution for the device. The FDA’s permission to commercially distribute a device subject to a 510(k) premarket notification is generally known as 510(k) clearance. Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risks, such as life sustaining, life supporting or some implantable devices, or devices that have a new intended use, or use advanced technology that is not substantially equivalent to that of a legally marketed device, are placed in Class III, requiring approval of a PMA. Some pre-amendment devices are unclassified, but are subject to FDA’s premarket notification and clearance process in order to be commercially distributed.
510(k) Clearance Marketing Pathway
To obtain 510(k) clearance, the sponsor must submit to the FDA a premarket notification submission demonstrating that the proposed device is “substantially equivalent” to, including that it is as safe and as effective as, a legally marketed predicate device. A predicate device is a legally marketed device that was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976 (pre-amendments device), a device which has been reclassified from Class III to Class II or I, a device which has been found to be substantially equivalent through the 510(k) process, or a device that was granted marketing authorization via the De Novo classification process under section 513(f)(2) of the FDCA and not exempt from premarket notification requirements. Once submitted, the FDA’s 510(k) clearance process usually takes from three to twelve months, but may take longer. The FDA may require additional information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence. In addition, FDA collects user fees for certain medical device submissions and annual fees for medical device establishments. For fiscal year 2023, the standard user fee for a 510(k) premarket notification submission is $19,125, with the fee being $4,781 for small businesses.
If the FDA agrees that the device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device currently on the market, it will grant 510(k) clearance to commercially market the device. If the FDA determines that the device is “not substantially equivalent” to a previously cleared device, the applicant may resubmit another 510(k) clearance application with new data, request a risk-based classification determination for the device in accordance with the De Novo process, which is a route to market for novel medical devices that are low to moderate risk and are not substantially equivalent to a predicate device, request reclassification through reclassification petitions pursuant to 21 U.S.C. § 360c, or submit a PMA application.
After a device receives the 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a new or different intended use, will require a new 510(k) clearance or, depending on the modification, a PMA approval. The FDA requires each manufacturer to determine whether the proposed change requires submission of a 510(k) or a PMA application in the first instance, but the FDA may review such decision and may disagree with a manufacturer’s determination. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer’s determination, the FDA can require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or request the recall of the modified device until such marketing authorization has been granted. Also, in these circumstances, the manufacturer may be subject to significant regulatory fines, penalties, or other regulatory actions from the FDA.
Over the last several years, the FDA has proposed reforms to its 510(k) clearance process, and such proposals could include increased requirements for clinical data and a longer review period, or could make it more difficult for manufacturers to utilize the 510(k) clearance process for their products. For example, in November 2018, FDA officials announced steps that the FDA intended to take to modernize the 510(k) pathway. Among other things, the FDA announced that it planned to develop proposals to drive manufacturers utilizing the 510(k) pathway toward the use of newer predicates. These proposals included 
plans to potentially sunset certain older devices that were used as predicates under the 510(k) clearance pathway, and to potentially publish a list of devices that have been cleared on the basis of demonstrated substantial equivalence to predicate devices that are more than 10 years old. These proposals have not yet been finalized or adopted, although the FDA may work with Congress to implement such proposals through legislation.
More recently, in September 2019, the FDA issued revised final guidance describing an optional “safety and performance based” premarket review pathway for manufacturers of “certain, well-understood device types” to demonstrate substantial equivalence under the 510(k) clearance pathway by showing that such device meets objective safety and performance criteria established by the FDA, thereby obviating the need for manufacturers to compare the safety and performance of their medical devices to specific predicate devices in the clearance process. The FDA has developed and maintains a list device types appropriate for the “safety and performance based” pathway and continues to develop product-specific guidance documents that identify the performance criteria for each such device type, as well as the testing methods recommended in the guidance documents, where feasible.
PMA Pathway
Class III devices require PMA approval before they can be marketed, although some pre-amendment Class III devices for which FDA has not yet required a PMA are cleared through the 510(k) process. The PMA process is more demanding than the 510(k) premarket notification process. In a PMA, the manufacturer must demonstrate that the device is safe and effective, and the PMA must be supported by extensive data, including data from preclinical studies and human clinical trials. The PMA must also contain a full description of the device and its components, a full description of the methods, facilities, and controls used for manufacturing, and proposed labeling. Following receipt of a PMA, the FDA determines whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review. If the FDA accepts the application for review, it has 180 days under the FDCA to complete its review of a PMA, although in practice, the FDA’s review often takes significantly longer, and can take up to several years. An advisory panel of experts from outside the FDA may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the FDA as to the approvability of the device. The FDA may or may not accept the panel’s recommendation. In addition, the FDA will generally conduct a pre-approval inspection of the applicant or its third-party manufacturers’ or suppliers’ manufacturing facility or facilities to ensure compliance with the QSR. PMA applications are also subject to the payment of user fees, which for fiscal year 2023 includes a standard application fee of $441,547.
The FDA will approve the new device for commercial distribution if it determines that the data and information in the PMA constitute valid scientific evidence and that there is reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective for its intended use(s). The FDA may approve a PMA with post-approval conditions intended to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device, including, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale and distribution, and collection of long-term follow-up data from patients in the clinical study that supported PMA approval or requirements to conduct additional clinical studies post-approval. The FDA may condition PMA approval on some form of post-market surveillance when deemed necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and efficacy data for the device in a larger population or for a longer period of use. In such cases, the manufacturer might be required to follow certain patient groups for a number of years and to make periodic reports to the FDA on the clinical status of those patients. Failure to comply with the conditions of approval can result in material adverse enforcement action, including withdrawal of the approval.
Certain changes to an approved device, such as changes in manufacturing facilities, methods, or quality control procedures, or changes in the design performance specifications, which affect the safety or effectiveness of the device, require submission of a PMA supplement. PMA supplements often require submission of the same type of information as a PMA, except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the original PMA and may not require as extensive clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel. Certain other changes to an approved device require the submission of a new PMA, such as when the design change causes a different intended use, mode of operation, and technical basis of operation, or when the design change is so significant that a new generation of the device will be developed, and the data that were submitted with the original PMA are not applicable for the change in demonstrating a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness.
Clinical Trials
Clinical trials are almost always required to support a PMA and are sometimes required to support a 510(k) submission. All clinical investigations of devices to determine safety and effectiveness must be conducted in accordance with the FDA’s investigational device exemption (“IDE”) regulations that govern investigational device labeling and prohibit promotion of the investigational device while specifying an array of recordkeeping, reporting and monitoring responsibilities of study sponsors and study investigators. If the device presents a “significant risk” to human health, as defined by the FDA, the FDA requires the 
device sponsor to submit an IDE application to the FDA, which must become effective prior to commencing human clinical trials. If the device under evaluation does not present a significant risk to human health, then the device sponsor is not required to submit an IDE application to the FDA before initiating human clinical trials, but must still comply with abbreviated IDE requirements when conducting such trials. A significant risk device is one that presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety or welfare of a patient and either is implanted; used in supporting or sustaining human life; substantially important in diagnosing, curing, mitigating or treating disease or otherwise preventing impairment of human health; or otherwise presents a potential for serious risk to a subject. An IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory test results, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. The IDE will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA unless the FDA notifies the company that the investigation may not begin. If the FDA determines that there are deficiencies or other concerns with an IDE for which it requires modification, the FDA may permit the clinical trial to proceed under a conditional approval.
Regardless of the degree of risk presented by the medical device, clinical studies must be approved by, and conducted under the oversight of, an Institutional Review Board (“IRB”), for each clinical site. The IRB is responsible for the initial and continuing review of the IDE, and may impose additional requirements for the conduct of the study. If an IDE application is approved by the FDA and one or more IRBs, human clinical trials may begin at a specific number of investigational sites with a specific number of patients, as approved by the FDA. If the device presents a non-significant risk to the patient, a sponsor may begin the clinical trial after obtaining approval for the trial by one or more IRBs without separate approval from the FDA, but must still follow abbreviated IDE requirements, such as monitoring the investigation, ensuring that the investigators obtain informed consent, and complying with labeling and record-keeping requirements. In some cases, an IDE supplement must be submitted to, and approved by, the FDA before a sponsor or investigator may make a change to the investigational plan that may affect its scientific soundness; study plan; or the rights, safety or welfare of human subjects.
During a study, the sponsor is required to comply with the applicable FDA requirements, including, for example, trial monitoring, selecting clinical investigators and providing them with the investigational plan, ensuring IRB review, adverse event reporting, record keeping and complying with the prohibitions on the promotion of investigational devices or on making safety or effectiveness claims for them. The clinical investigators in the clinical study are also subject to FDA’s regulations and must obtain patient informed consent, rigorously follow the investigational plan and study protocol, control the disposition of the investigational device, and comply with all reporting and recordkeeping requirements. After a trial begins, the sponsor, the FDA or the IRB could suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the risks to study subjects outweigh the anticipated benefits.
Post-market Regulation
After a device is cleared or approved for marketing, numerous and pervasive regulatory requirements continue to apply. These include:
•establishment registration and device listing with the FDA;
•QSR requirements, which require manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the design and manufacturing process;
•labeling regulations and FDA prohibitions against the promotion of investigational products, or the promotion of “off-label” uses of cleared or approved products;
•requirements related to promotional activities;
•clearance or approval of product modifications to 510(k)-cleared devices that could significantly affect safety or effectiveness or that would constitute a new or different intended use of a cleared device, or approval of certain modifications to PMA-approved devices;
•medical device reporting regulations, which require that a manufacturer report to the FDA if a device it markets may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or has malfunctioned and the device or a similar device that it markets would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury, if the malfunction were to recur;
•correction, removal and recall reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA that may present a risk to health;
•the FDA’s recall authority, whereby the agency can order device manufacturers to recall from the market a product that is in violation of governing laws and regulations; and
•post-market surveillance activities and regulations, which apply when deemed by the FDA to be necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device.
Manufacturing processes for medical devices are required to comply with the applicable portions of the QSR, which cover the methods and the facilities and controls for the design, manufacture, testing, production, processes, controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, distribution, installation and servicing of finished devices intended for human use. The QSR also requires, among other things, maintenance of a device master file, device history file, and complaint files. As a manufacturer, we are subject to periodic scheduled and unscheduled inspections by the FDA. Failure to maintain compliance with the QSR requirements could result in adverse inspection or audit reports such as Form 483 Notices of Inspectional Observations; the shut-down of, or restrictions on, manufacturing operations; recall, market withdrawal, or seizure of marketed products; or other enforcement actions by the FDA or other regulatory agencies. The discovery of previously unknown problems with any marketed products, including unanticipated adverse events or adverse events of increasing severity or frequency, whether resulting from the use of the device within the scope of its clearance or approval, or off-label by a physician in the practice of medicine, could result in restrictions on the device, including the removal of the product from the market or voluntary or mandatory device recalls.
The FDA has broad regulatory compliance and enforcement powers. If the FDA determines that a manufacturer has failed to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, it can take a variety of compliance or enforcement actions, which may result in any of the following, among others:
•warning letters, untitled letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties;
•recalls, withdrawals, or administrative detention or seizure of our products;
•operating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production;
•refusing or delaying requests for 510(k) clearance or PMA approvals of new or modified products;
•withdrawing 510(k) clearances or PMA approvals that have already been granted;
•refusal to permit importation of the manufacturer’s products through import detention or refusals, or import alerts;
•refusal to grant export approvals for our products; or
•criminal prosecution. 
Regulation of Cosmetics
The FDCA defines cosmetics as articles or components of articles intended for application to the human body to cleanse, beautify, promote attractiveness, or alter the appearance. The labeling of cosmetic products is subject to the requirements of the FDCA, the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act, the Poison Prevention Packaging Act and other FDA regulations. Cosmetics are not subject to pre-market approval by the FDA; however, certain ingredients, such as color additives, must be pre-approved for the specific intended use of the product and are subject to certain restrictions on their use. If a company has not adequately substantiated the safety of its products or ingredients by, for example, performing appropriate toxicological tests or relying on already available toxicological test data, then a specific warning label is required. The FDA may, by regulation, require other warning statements on certain cosmetic products for specified hazards associated with such products. FDA regulations also prohibit or otherwise restrict the use of certain types of ingredients in cosmetic products. 
In addition, the FDA requires that cosmetic labeling and claims be truthful and not misleading, and cosmetics may not be marketed or labeled for use in treating, preventing, mitigating, or curing disease or other conditions or in affecting the structure or function of the body because such claims would render the products to be a drug and subject to regulation as a drug. The FDA has issued warning letters to cosmetic companies alleging improper drug claims regarding their cosmetic products, including, for example, product claims regarding hair growth or preventing hair loss. In addition to FDA requirements, the FTC as well as state consumer protection laws and regulations can subject a cosmetics company to a range of requirements and theories of liability, including similar standards regarding false and misleading product claims, under which FTC or state enforcement or class-action lawsuits may be brought. 
In the United States, the FDA has not promulgated regulations establishing GMPs for cosmetics. However, Congress enacted the Modernization of Cosmetics Regulation Act of 2022 (“MoCRA”) on December 29, 2022 that requires FDA to promulgate regulations relating to GMPs for cosmetics. The effective date for most of the MoCRA provisions is December 29, 2023. Specifically with regard to GMPs for cosmetics, FDA is required to promulgate the proposed rules by December 29, 2024, and final regulations by December 29, 2025. Subsequently, compliance with such GMP requirements will become mandatory for 
manufacturers of cosmetic products. Until then, FDA’s existing draft guidance on cosmetic GMPs, most recently updated in June 2013 and other guidance such as the FDA’s Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) Guidelines/Inspection Checklist from February 2022, will continue to provide guidance and recommendations related to process documentation, recordkeeping, building and facility design, and equipment maintenance and personnel. Compliance with these recommendations can reduce the risk that products will be adulterated or misbranded in violation of the FDCA and its regulations. 
In addition to GMP requirements, MoCRA will bring on additional changes and updates to FDA’s cosmetics regulations. For example, cosmetic manufacturing and processing facilities will be required to be registered with FDA, and any products that are marketed after MoCRA’s effective date will need to be listed with FDA. Adulterated or misbranded cosmetic products will be subject to recalls that are mandated by FDA, similar to medical devices. In addition, a responsible person will be required to report any serious adverse events that result from the use of a cosmetic product manufactured, packaged, or distributed by the person, and the records relating to each adverse event report will be required to be kept for six years. Additionally, cosmetic labels will need to identify the responsible person for the purpose of serious adverse event reporting, and cosmetic labels will also need to identify fragrance allergens. The provisions relating to labels become effective on December 29, 2024.
The FDA also recommends that manufacturers maintain product complaint and recall files and voluntarily report adverse events to the agency. The FDA monitors compliance of cosmetic products through market surveillance and inspection of cosmetic manufacturers and distributors to ensure that the products are not manufactured under unsanitary conditions, or labeled in a false or misleading manner. Inspections also may arise from consumer or competitor complaints filed with the FDA. In the event the FDA identifies unsanitary conditions, false or misleading labeling, or any other violation of FDA regulation, FDA may request or a manufacturer may independently decide to conduct a recall or market withdrawal of product or to make changes to its manufacturing processes or product formulations or labels. 
Foreign Government Regulation
In addition to United States regulations, we are subject to a variety of foreign government regulations applicable to medical devices and cosmetic products.
Regulation of Medical Devices in the European Union
The European Union, (“EU”), has adopted specific directives and regulations regulating the design, manufacture, clinical investigation, conformity assessment, labeling and adverse event reporting for medical devices. 
Until May 25, 2021, medical devices were regulated by Council Directive 93/42/EEC (the “EU Medical Devices Directive) which has been repealed and replaced by Regulation (EU) No 2017/745 (the “EU Medical Devices Regulation”). Our current certificates have been granted under the EU Medical Devices Directive whose regime is described below. However, as of May 26, 2021, some of the EU Medical Devices Regulation requirements apply in place of the corresponding requirements of the EU Medical Devices Directive with regard to registration of economic operators and of devices, post-market surveillance and vigilance requirements. Pursuing marketing of medical devices in the EU will notably require that our devices be certified under the new regime set forth in the EU Medical Devices Regulation when our current certificates expire.
Medical Devices Directive
Under the EU Medical Devices Directive, all medical devices placed on the market in the EU must meet the relevant essential requirements laid down in Annex I to the EU Medical Devices Directive, including the requirement that a medical device must be designed and manufactured in such a way that it will not compromise the clinical condition or safety of patients, or the safety and health of users and others. In addition, the device must achieve the performance intended by the manufacturer and be designed, manufactured, and packaged in a suitable manner. The European Commission has adopted various standards applicable to medical devices. These include standards governing common requirements, such as sterilization and safety of medical electrical equipment and product standards for certain types of medical devices. There are also harmonized standards relating to design and manufacture. While not mandatory, compliance with these standards is viewed as the easiest way to satisfy the essential requirements as a practical matter as it creates a rebuttable presumption that the device satisfies that essential requirement.
To demonstrate compliance with the essential requirements laid down in Annex I to the EU Medical Devices Directive, medical device manufacturers must undergo a conformity assessment procedure, which varies according to the type of medical device and its (risk) classification. As a general rule, demonstration of conformity of medical devices and their manufacturers with the 
essential requirements must be based, among other things, on the evaluation of clinical data supporting the safety and performance of the products during normal conditions of use. Specifically, a manufacturer must demonstrate that the device achieves its intended performance during normal conditions of use, that the known and foreseeable risks, and any adverse events, are minimized and acceptable when weighed against the benefits of its intended performance, and that any claims made about the performance and safety of the device are supported by suitable evidence. Except for low-risk medical devices (Class I non-sterile, non-measuring devices), where the manufacturer can self-assess the conformity of its products with the essential requirements (except for any parts which relate to sterility or metrology), a conformity assessment procedure requires the intervention of a notified body. Notified bodies are independent organizations designated by EU member states to assess the conformity of devices before being placed on the market. A notified body would typically audit and examine a product’s technical dossiers and the manufacturers’ quality system (the notified body must presume that quality systems which implement the relevant harmonized standards – which is ISO 13485:2016 for Medical Devices Quality Management Systems – conform to these requirements). If satisfied that the relevant product conforms to the relevant essential requirements, the notified body issues a certificate of conformity, which the manufacturer uses as a basis for its own declaration of conformity. The manufacturer may then apply the CE mark to the device, which allows the device to be placed on the market throughout the EU. 
Throughout the term of the certificate of conformity, the manufacturer will be subject to periodic surveillance audits to verify continued compliance with the applicable requirements. In particular, there will be a new audit by the notified body before it will renew the relevant certificate(s).
Medical Devices Regulation
The regulatory landscape related to medical devices in the EU has now evolved. On April 5, 2017, the EU Medical Devices Regulation was adopted with the aim of ensuring better protection of public health and patient safety. The EU Medical Devices Regulation establishes a uniform, transparent, predictable and sustainable regulatory framework across the EU for medical devices and ensure a high level of safety and health while supporting innovation. Unlike the EU Medical Devices Directive, the EU Medical Devices Regulation is directly applicable in EU member states without the need for member states to implement into national law. This aims at increasing harmonization across the EU.
The EU Medical Devices Regulation became effective on May 26, 2021. The new Regulation among other things:
•strengthens the rules on placing devices on the market (e.g. reclassification of certain devices and wider scope than the EU Medical Devices Directive) and reinforces surveillance once they are available;
•establishes explicit provisions on manufacturers’ responsibilities for the follow-up of the quality, performance and safety of devices placed on the market;
•establishes explicit provisions on importers’ and distributors’ obligations and responsibilities; 
•imposes an obligation to identify a responsible person who is ultimately responsible for all aspects of compliance with the requirements of the new regulation;
•improves the traceability of medical devices throughout the supply chain to the end-user or patient through the introduction of a unique identification number, to increase the ability of manufacturers and regulatory authorities to trace specific devices through the supply chain and to facilitate the prompt and efficient recall of medical devices that have been found to present a safety risk;
•sets up a central database (Eudamed) to provide patients, healthcare professionals and the public with comprehensive information on products available in the EU; and
•strengthens rules for the assessment of certain high-risk devices, such as implants, which may have to undergo a clinical evaluation consultation procedure by experts before they are placed on the market.
Devices lawfully placed on the market pursuant to the EU Medical Devices Directive prior to May 26, 2021 may generally continue to be made available on the market or put into service until May 26, 2024 under transitional provisions with a further ‘sell-off’ deadline by May 26, 2025, provided that the requirements of the transitional provisions are fulfilled. In particular, the certificate in question must still be valid. However, even in this case, manufacturers must comply with a number of new or reinforced requirements set forth in the EU Medical Devices Regulation, in particular the obligations described below. On January 6, 2023, the European Commission proposed a draft regulation to extend the transition periods under the EU Medical Devices Regulation for certain devices and thus extending the validity of the CE certificates that were issued under the EU Medical Devices Directive. The Commission also proposes to delete the ‘sell-off’ deadline. The draft amending regulation is subject to the accelerated adoption procedure of the European Parliament and Council.
The EU Medical Devices Regulation requires that before placing a device, other than a custom-made device, on the market, manufacturers (as well as other economic operators such as authorized representatives and importers) must register by submitting identification information to the electronic system (Eudamed), unless they have already registered. The information to be submitted by manufacturers (and authorized representatives) also includes the name, address and contact details of the 
person or persons responsible for regulatory compliance. The new Regulation also requires that before placing a device, other than a custom-made device, on the market, manufacturers must assign a unique identifier to the device and provide it along with other core data to the unique device identifier (“UDI”) database. These new requirements aim at ensuring better identification and traceability of the devices. Manufacturers are also notably responsible for entering the necessary data on Eudamed, which includes the UDI database, and for keeping it up to date. The obligations for registration in Eudamed will become applicable at a later date (as Eudamed is not yet fully functional). Until Eudamed is fully functional, the corresponding provisions of the EU Medical Devices Directive continue to apply for the purpose of meeting the obligations laid down in the provisions regarding exchange of information, including, and in particular, information regarding registration of devices and economic operators.
All manufacturers placing medical devices on the market in the EU must comply with the EU medical device vigilance system which has been reinforced by the EU Medical Devices Regulation. Under this system, serious incidents and Field Safety Corrective Actions (“FSCAs”), must be reported to the relevant authorities of the EU member states. These reports will have to be submitted through Eudamed – once functional – and aim to ensure that, in addition to reporting to the relevant authorities of the EU member states, other actors such as the economic operators in the supply chain will also be informed. Until Eudamed is fully functional, the corresponding provisions of the EU Medical Devices Directive continue to apply. A serious incident is defined as any malfunction or deterioration in the characteristics or performance of a device made available on the market, including use-error due to ergonomic features, as well as any inadequacy in the information supplied by the manufacturer and any undesirable side-effect, which, directly or indirectly, might have led or might lead to the death of a patient or user or of other persons or to a temporary or permanent serious deterioration of a patient's, user's or other person's state of health or a serious public health threat. 
Manufacturers are required to take FSCAs defined as any corrective action for technical or medical reasons to prevent or reduce a risk of a serious incident associated with the use of a medical device that is made available on the market. An FSCA may include the recall, modification, exchange, destruction or retrofitting of the device. FSCAs must be communicated by the manufacturer or its legal representative to its customers and/or to the end users of the device through Field Safety Notices. For similar serious incidents that occur with the same device or device type and for which the root cause has been identified or a FSCA implemented or where the incidents are common and well documented, manufacturers may provide periodic summary reports instead of individual serious incident reports.
The advertising and promotion of medical devices is subject to some general principles set forth in EU legislation as well as in national legislation of the EU Member States and industry codes of conduct. According to the EU Medical Devices Regulation, only devices that are CE-marked may be marketed and advertised in the EU in accordance with their intended purpose. Directive 2006/114/EC concerning misleading and comparative advertising and Directive 2005/29/EC on unfair commercial practices, while not specific to the advertising of medical devices, also apply to the advertising thereof and contain general rules, for example, requiring that advertisements are evidenced, balanced and not misleading. Specific requirements are defined at a national level. EU member states’ laws related to the advertising and promotion of medical devices, which vary between jurisdictions, may limit or restrict the advertising and promotion of products to the general public and may impose limitations on promotional activities with healthcare professionals. 
Many EU member states have adopted specific anti-gift statutes that further limit commercial practices for medical devices, in particular vis-à-vis healthcare professionals and organizations. Additionally, there has been a recent trend of increased regulation of payments and transfers of value provided to healthcare professionals or entities and many EU member states have adopted national “Sunshine Acts” which impose reporting and transparency requirements (often on an annual basis), similar to the requirements in the United States, on medical device manufacturers. Certain countries also mandate implementation of commercial compliance programs.
The aforementioned EU rules are generally applicable in the European Economic Area (“EEA”), which consists of the 27 EU Member States plus Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland. 
UK Regulation of Medical Devices following Brexit 
Since January 1, 2021, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (“MHRA”), has become the sovereign regulatory authority responsible for Great Britain (i.e. England, Wales and Scotland) medical device market according to the requirements provided in the UK Medical Devices Regulations 2002 (SI 2002 No 618, as amended) that sought to give effect to the three pre-existing EU directives governing active implantable medical devices, general medical devices and in vitro diagnostic medical devices whereas Northern Ireland continues to be governed by EU rules according to the Northern Ireland Protocol. Following the end of the Brexit transitional period on January 1, 2021, new regulations require medical devices to be registered with the MHRA (but manufacturers were given a grace period of four to 12 months to comply with the new 
registration process) before being placed on Great Britain market. The MHRA only registers devices where the manufacturer or their United Kingdom (“UK”) Responsible Person has a registered place of business in the UK. Manufacturers based outside the UK need to appoint a UK Responsible Person that has a registered place of business in the UK to register devices with the MHRA in line with the grace periods. By July 1, 2024, in Great Britain, all medical devices will require a UK Conformity Assessed (“UKCA”) mark but CE marks issued by EU notified bodies will remain valid until this time. Manufacturers may choose to use the UKCA mark on a voluntary basis until June 30, 2024. However, UKCA marking will not be recognized in the EU. The rules for placing medical devices on the market in Northern Ireland, which is part of the UK, differ from those in the rest of the UK. Compliance with this legislation is a prerequisite to be able to affix the UKCA mark to our products, without which they cannot be sold or marketed in Great Britain.
An MHRA public consultation was opened until end of November 2021 on the post-Brexit regulatory framework for medical devices and diagnostics. In June 2022, the UK government published its response to the consultation regarding the new UK medical device regulatory framework which seeks to amend the UK Medical Devices Regulations 2002 (which are based on EU legislation, primarily the EU Medical Devices Directive, the EU AIMD and the EU In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Devices Directive 98/79/EC), in particular to create a new access pathways to support innovation, create an innovative framework for regulating software and artificial intelligence as medical devices, reform in vitro diagnostic medical devices regulation, and foster sustainability through the reuse and remanufacture of medical devices. The regime is expected to come into force in July 2024, coinciding with the end of the acceptance period for EU CE marks in Great Britain, subject to appropriate transitional arrangements. The consultation indicated that the MHRA will publish guidance in relation to the changes to the regulatory framework and may rely more heavily on guidance to add flexibility to the regime.
In addition, the Trade Deal between the UK and the EU generally provides for cooperation and exchange of information between the parties in the areas of product safety and compliance, including market surveillance, enforcement activities and measures, standardization-related activities, exchanges of officials, and coordinated product recalls. As such, processes for compliance and reporting should reflect requirements from regulatory authorities.
European Union Regulation of Cosmetic Products
In the EU, the sale of cosmetic products is regulated under the EU Cosmetics Regulation (EC) No 1223/2009, (the “EU Cosmetics Regulation”) setting out the general regulatory framework for finished cosmetic products and their ingredients. The EU Cosmetics Regulation is directly applicable in, and binding on all EU member states and is enforced at the national member state level. Over the years, the EU cosmetics legal regime has been adopted by many countries around the world.
Under the EU Cosmetics Regulation, a product is considered to be a cosmetic if it is presented as protecting the skin, maintaining the skin in good condition or improving the appearance of the skin, provided that it is not a medicinal product due to its composition or intended use. By contrast, a substance or mixture intended to be ingested, inhaled, injected or implanted into the human body shall not be considered a cosmetic product, nor shall a product (i) the composition of which is such that it has a significant action on the body through a pharmacological, immunological or metabolic action; or (ii) for which medical claims are made. Legally, such a product is considered a medicinal product, not a cosmetic, in the EU. No test has been determined yet to determine the significance of the effect. A product may fall within the definition of both a cosmetic product and a medicinal product in which case the non-cumulation principle provides that the product will be regulated as a medicinal product (under the Medicinal Products Directive 2001/83/EC).
Generally, there is no requirement for pre-market approval of cosmetic products in the EU. The overarching requirement is that a cosmetic product made available on the EU market must be safe for human health when used under normal or reasonably foreseeable conditions of use. However, centralized notification of all cosmetic products placed on the EU market is required via the EU cosmetic products notification portal (“CPNP”). The company that is ‘responsible’ for placing a cosmetic product on the EU market (which could be the manufacturer, importer or a third person appointed by the former), referred to as the “responsible person”, is responsible for safety of their marketed finished cosmetic products (and each of its ingredients), and must ensure that they undergo an appropriate scientific safety assessment before cosmetic products are sold. Obligations of the responsible person further include:
•Manufacturing cosmetic products in compliance with GMPs.
•Creating and keeping a product information file (“PIF”), for each cosmetic product, including test results that demonstrate the claimed effects for the cosmetic product, and the cosmetic product safety report.
•Registering and submitting information on every product through the CPNP.
•Complying with Regulation (EU) No. 655/2013 which lists common criteria for the justification of claims used in relation to cosmetic products.
•Reporting serious undesirable effects attributable to cosmetics use to national competent authorities and taking corrective measures where required.
Some ingredients used in cosmetic products must undergo rigorous evaluation, including safety assessments and quality testing to make sure that they are safe for use, for example preservatives, and can also be subject to additional procedures such as an authorization by the European Commission and/or prior notification on a separate module of the CPNP, for example nanomaterials. Additionally, the EU Cosmetics Regulation includes a list of ingredients that are prohibited and a list of ingredients that are restricted in cosmetic products. A special database with information on cosmetic substances and ingredients, known as CosIng, enables easy access to data on cosmetic ingredients, including legal requirements and restrictions. We rely on expert consultants for our EU product registrations and review of our labeling for compliance with the EU Cosmetics Regulation.
The EU Cosmetics Regulation requires the manufacture of cosmetic products to comply with GMPs, which is presumed where the manufacture is in accordance with the relevant harmonized standards. In addition, in the labelling, making available on the market and advertising of cosmetic products, text, names, trademarks, pictures and figurative or other signs must not be used to imply that these products have characteristics or functions they do not have; any product claims in labeling must be capable of being substantiated and comply with the aforementioned list of common criteria. 
Moreover, in the EU, animal testing is prohibited for finished cosmetic products and their ingredients. Marketing finished cosmetic products and ingredients in the EU which were tested on animals is equally prohibited.
Each member state appoints a competent authority to enforce the EU Cosmetics Regulation in its territory and to cooperate with the other member state authorities and the European Commission. The European Commission is responsible for driving consistency in the way the Cosmetics Regulation is enforced across the EU. 
The aforementioned EU rules are generally applicable in the EEA.
UK Regulation of Cosmetic Products following Brexit 
The UK formally left the EU on January 31, 2020, commonly referred to as “Brexit”. Following the end of a transition period, since January 1, 2021, the UK operates under a distinct regulatory regime, and the aforementioned EU laws now only apply to the UK in respect of Northern Ireland (as laid out in the Protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland). 
As a consequence, from January 1, 2021, Schedule 34 of the Product Safety and Metrology etc. (Amendment etc.) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (the “UK Cosmetics Regulation”), applies to cosmetic products placed on the market in Great Britain, which includes England, Scotland and Wales. Cosmetic products placed on the market in Northern Ireland are still covered by the EU Cosmetics Regulation. However, to date, there are no significant differences between the frameworks of the UK Cosmetics Regulation and the EU Cosmetics Regulation. 
Environmental Regulations
We believe we are compliant in all material respects with applicable environmental laws. Presently, we do not anticipate such compliance will have a material effect on capital expenditures, earnings, or our competitive position with respect to any of our operations.
Information Technology 
Information technology supports all aspects of our business, including our products, product development, marketing, sales, order processing, production, distribution, and finance. We continue to maintain and enhance our information technology systems in alignment with our long-term strategy. An increasing portion of our global information technology infrastructure is cloud-based. This allows for a more scalable platform to support current and future requirements and improves our agility and flexibility to respond to the demands of our business by leveraging more advanced technologies.
We recognize that technology presents opportunities for competitive advantage, and we continue to invest in new capabilities and the use of emerging technologies across various aspects of our business. During fiscal 2022, we continued to respond to shifting employee, provider, and consumer behaviors driven by the COVID-19 pandemic, which included new, hybrid ways of working for our office-based employees. We invested in hardware, software, education and support structures to create engaging and collaborative work environments across our facilities, in both virtual and hybrid settings. We also continued to 
invest in new marketing and provider and consumer engagement capabilities globally with a focus on innovative digital experiences across our omnichannel landscape. Our strategy over the next few years includes continuing to build a strong and secure technology infrastructure to adapt to evolving business dynamics, which includes the expansion of our omnichannel capabilities, modernizing and upgrading our existing facilities to be powered by technology, and the utilization of data-driven analytics to optimize our supply and demand planning. 
Data Privacy and Security 
Numerous state, federal and foreign laws, regulations and standards govern the collection, use, access to, confidentiality and security of health-related and other personal information, and could apply now or in the future to our operations or the operations of our partners. In the United States, numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including data breach notification laws, health information privacy and security laws and consumer protection laws and regulations govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal information. In addition, certain foreign laws govern the privacy and security of personal data, including health-related data. For example, the EU General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) imposes strict requirements for processing the personal data of individuals within the European Economic Area. Companies that must comply with the GDPR face increased compliance obligations and risk, including more robust regulatory enforcement of data protection requirements and potential fines for noncompliance of up to €20 million or 4% of the annual global revenues of the noncompliant company, whichever is greater. Further, from January 1, 2021, companies have had to comply with the GDPR and also the United Kingdom (“UK”) GDPR, which, together with the amended UK Data Protection Act 2018, retains the GDPR in UK national law. The UK GDPR mirrors the fines under the GDPR, i.e., fines up to the greater of €20 million (£17.5 million) or 4% of global turnover. Privacy and security laws, regulations, and other obligations are constantly evolving, may conflict with each other to complicate compliance efforts, and can result in investigations, proceedings, or actions that lead to significant civil and/or criminal penalties and restrictions on data processing. 
Effect of Government Regulations
We believe that our operations are substantially in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations and that we hold all necessary permits to operate our business in each jurisdiction in which our facilities are located. Laws and government regulations are subject to change and interpretation.
No significant pollution or other types of hazardous emission result from our operations and it is not anticipated that our operations will be materially affected by federal, state or local provisions concerning environmental controls. Our costs of complying with environmental, health and safety requirements have not been material. Furthermore, compliance with these laws, rules, and regulations have not had, and are not expected to have, a material effect on our capital expenditures, results of operations, and competitive position as compared to prior periods. 
Environmental, Social and Governance Matters
We are committed to maintaining a strong sense of good corporate citizenship that places a high value on the welfare of our employees, the communities in which we operate, and the world as a whole. Highlights of each of these values are set forth below. These values are reflective of our commitment to Environmental, Social, and Governance (“ESG”) matters and are fundamentally embedded in our operations and culture. We believe effectively prioritizing and managing our ESG topics will create long-term value for our stakeholders, including our providers, consumers, suppliers, and partners, which in turn will create long-term value for our stockholders. We also believe that transparently disclosing the goals and relevant metrics related to our ESG topics will allow our stakeholders to be informed about our progress. 
Social
Data Privacy and Security
We value consumer privacy and have implemented certain policies and procedures that are designed to protect the data we collect. Our website includes our privacy policy, which describes how we use and disclose the data we collect, and provides options for controlling personal data, including opting-out, accessing, updating, or deleting it.
In recognition of the importance of data protection to our operations, including cybersecurity, we have certain measures in places that are designed to safeguard the security, confidentiality, and privacy of our systems and information assets. 
Human Rights
We endorse and respect the goals and principles of the United Nations (“UN”) Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Labor Organization Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work.
This includes everyone’s right to life and liberty, the protection of law, and freedom from slavery and torture – within our operations and business relationships. We also seek to apply relevant sections of the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.
While government authorities have the primary responsibility for protecting human rights, we believe we have a duty to respect the human, cultural, and legal rights of individuals and communities, and to avoid adverse human rights impacts through our own activities. This responsibility includes the fair treatment and meaningful involvement of all people, regardless of race, ethnicity, color, gender, gender identity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation or income level. In addition, we adhere to and comply with all local and national regulations in our operating areas and aim to respect the rights of all people within our spheres of influence.
Our commitment to many of these rights is articulated in our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and other company policies. Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and related policies prohibit workplace harassment, violence or discrimination. These policies apply to our employee recruitment, training, development, compensation, performance management and benefits at the Company.
We also identify and proactively engage with stakeholders within or adjacent to our operations regarding potential risks, including human rights risks, and our response plans. Additionally, we are committed to ensuring that slavery, human trafficking, and other human rights violations do not exist in our supply chain or in any part of our business.
Environmental Matters
We participate in a recycling program through our local waste management facility to divert all recyclable materials – bottles, cans, plastics, paper, and cardboard – from landfills. Across our organization, our facilities provide for recycling, and our electronic waste is sent to locally approved e-waste recycling centers.
Governance
Business Ethics
We have placed the highest emphasis on conducting our business with honesty and integrity. The highest ethical standards are expected of management and employees alike, and we continuously strive to create a corporate culture of honesty, integrity, and trust. Throughout our operations and in our dealings with our stakeholders, we endeavor to engender the confidence that our conduct is beyond reproach.
The policies we have developed are intended to:
•Offer guidance in understanding our policies, interpreting laws, and handling company-related issues and situations
•Foster clear, ethical behaviors and conduct to create an atmosphere of respect, trust, cooperation, and collaboration throughout the Company and our activities; and
•Provide clear and well-defined procedures by which our employees can easily obtain information, ask questions, and, if necessary, report any suspected violations of any of our business ethics policies.
In addition to abiding by all applicable laws, all management and employees are required to comply fully with our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics which sets forth the Company’s values, business culture, and practices.
A copy of our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics may be found on our website: www.beautyhealth.com under the heading “Governance”, and then “Documents & Charters”.
Corporate Governance
We are committed to ensuring strong corporate governance practices on behalf of our stockholders and other stakeholders. We believe strong corporate governance provides the foundation for financial integrity and stockholder confidence. Our Board of 
Directors is responsible for the oversight of risks facing the Company, and our management is responsible for the day-to-day management of risk. Our Board of Directors, as a whole, directly oversees our strategic and business risk, including risks related to financial reporting, compensation practices, ESG, and product developments.
More information about our corporate governance features (including information about our Audit Committee, Compensation Committee, and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee) can be found in our annual proxy statement.

Talent Attraction and Development 
Hiring, retaining, and developing the best talent globally is key to our success in sustaining long-term growth.
We employ targeted marketing practices through our careers website, which personalizes a user’s experience based on jobseeker location and searching behavior. Jobseekers can also apply for roles from anywhere using any device. 
Our talent strategy is focused on employee engagement and investments in career development, as well as measuring, recognizing, and rewarding performance. Our investments include providing programs to ensure our employees are equipped with the right skillsets and knowledge, as well as providing opportunities to transfer to other functions or regions through short-term and long-term assignments. For instance, we provide our employees with a 3-5 day training program that informs and educates our employees about our business model, marketing strategies, and other related topics about our business operations. We believe these programs and opportunities create a pipeline of talent and leadership among our employees, while fostering a sense of shared ownership necessary to drive and deliver on our long-term strategy.
To enhance our culture and measure our human capital objectives, we regularly engage with our employees. We provide several mechanisms for our employees to provide their feedback, including direct discussions with managers, employee surveys, interactive town hall meetings, and team offsite meetings. Based on our review of employee feedback, we develop action plans and implement them to enhance employee satisfaction and to ensure alignment with our overall human capital strategy.
Workplace Practices and Policies
The Company is an equal opportunity employer committed to inclusion and diversity and to providing a workplace free of harassment or discrimination.
Diversity and Inclusion 
As a beauty health company, we believe that it is important for our workforce to reflect the diversity of our consumers and be representative of the society in which we live. We firmly believe an inclusive work environment is essential for a successful and thriving business and enables us to better understand our consumers, drive innovation, and stimulate creativity. We recognize the importance of all types of diversity at leadership levels and throughout our organization. 
Our objective in creating an environment of inclusion is to enhance our ability to attract and retain the best talent globally and promote a sense of belonging. We continuously encourage a culture of fairness, equal access to opportunities, including positions of leadership, and transparency in employment matters. We have enhanced our strategy in many areas including hiring, employee engagement, development, and talent management to further support diversity and inclusion across our organization. For instance, we have identified several priorities designed to guide our efforts in this matter such as increasing diverse representation throughout our organization, creating an environment where every employee feels included and valued for who they are, and promoting equal opportunity in recruitment, hiring, training, development, and advancement across our organization.

Compensation and Benefits 
Consistent with our core values, our “Total Rewards” programs take care of our employees by offering competitive compensation and flexible, comprehensive benefits programs designed to attract, motivate, and retain world-class talent.
We continuously review and ensure our compensation packages are competitive across all of the markets in which we operate. For instance, in addition to base pay (which is based on specific circumstances, including role and experience, geographic location, and performance), we offer annual cash performance-based incentives and equity-based long-term incentive awards for eligible employees. 
Our robust benefit programs, which vary by country, include basic and supplemental health and insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts, access to a personal health advocate, family leave, life and disability insurance, employee assistance programs, physical, mental and financial wellbeing programs, a U.S. employee stock purchase plan, retirement savings plans, and pet insurance, to name a few. 
Workplace Health and Safety
We work to prioritize the health and welfare of our employees and our environment. The core elements of our employee health and safety strategy are risk analysis, incident management, documented processes, training, and occupational health. We continually strive to improve processes across field safety training, incident training, and professional investigations.
Throughout the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented health and safety protocols and modified our business practices to protect our employees. After our original plan was disseminated to our employees, additional updates from management have included the most up-to-date information from the U.S. Department of State, Center for Disease Control (“CDC”) and World Health Organization (“WHO”), and we have, at all times, encouraged employees to keep management informed of the need for any additional support. Our health and safety protocols specify several CDC-recommended measures to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 in the workplace, the importance of social and physical distancing and frequent handwashing, and that employees are to remain home if feeling unwell and self-quarantine following any possible exposure to 
the virus. In addition to these measures, we have increased sanitation procedures and updated our travel policy to ensure the safety of those employees who have resumed working in the office and those who travel for business.
We will continue to monitor mandates, guidelines, and recommendations issued by CDC, WHO, and local governments as they are released, and revise our health and safety protocols accordingly.
