Item 1. Business
In this report, the terms the “Company,” “Apollo Investment,” “AIC,” “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to Apollo Investment Corporation unless the context specifically states otherwise.
General
Apollo Investment Corporation, a Maryland corporation organized on February 2, 2004, is a closed-end, externally managed, non-diversified management investment company that has elected to be treated as a business development company (“BDC”) under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the “1940 Act”). In addition, for tax purposes we have elected to be treated as a regulated investment company (“RIC”) under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). We commenced operations on April 8, 2004 upon completion of our initial public offering that raised $870 million in net proceeds from selling 62 million shares of common stock at a price of $15.00 per share (20.7 million shares at a price of $45.00 per share adjusted for the one-for-three reverse stock split). Since then, and through March 31, 2019, we have raised approximately $2.21 billion in net proceeds from additional offerings of common stock and we have repurchased common stock for $170.9 million.
Our investment objective is to generate current income and capital appreciation. We invest primarily in various forms of debt investments, including secured and unsecured debt, loan investments and/or equity in private middle-market companies. We may also invest in the securities of public companies and in structured products and other investments such as collateralized loan obligations (“CLOs”) and credit-linked notes (“CLNs”). A CLO is a form of securitization in which the cash flows of a portfolio of loans are pooled and passed on to different classes of owners in various tranches. A CLN is a note where the payment of principal and/or interest is based on the performance of one or more debt obligations. CLNs are not securitizations.
Our portfolio is comprised primarily of investments in debt, including secured and unsecured debt of private middle-market companies that, in the case of senior secured loans, generally are not broadly syndicated and whose aggregate tranche size is typically less than $250 million. Our portfolio also includes equity interests such as common stock, preferred stock, warrants or options. In this Form 10-K, we use the term “middle-market” to refer to companies with annual revenues between $50 million and $2 billion. While we primarily invest in investments in U.S. secured and unsecured loans, other debt securities and equity, we may also invest a portion of the portfolio in other investment opportunities, including foreign securities and structured products. Most of the debt instruments we invest in are unrated or rated below investment grade, which is often an indication of size, credit worthiness and speculative nature relative to the capacity of the borrower to pay interest and principal. Generally, if the Company's unrated investments were rated, they would be rated below investment grade. These securities, which are often referred to as “junk” or “high yield,” have predominantly speculative characteristics with respect to the issuer's capacity to pay interest and repay principal. They may also be difficult to value and are illiquid.
During the year ended March 31, 2019, we invested $1.3 billion across 42 new and 46 existing portfolio companies primarily through a combination of primary and secondary debt investments. This compares to $1.0 billion across 39 new and 28 existing portfolio companies during the year ended March 31, 2018. Investments sold or repaid during the year ended March 31, 2019 totaled $1.1 billion versus $1.2 billion during the year ended March 31, 2018. The weighted average yields on our secured debt portfolio, unsecured debt portfolio, total debt portfolio and total portfolio as of March 31, 2019 at our current cost basis were 10.2%, 0.0%,10.2% and 9.6%, respectively. As of March 31, 2018, the yields were 10.7%, 11.3%, 10.7% and 9.6%, respectively. The portfolio yields may be higher than an investor’s yield on an investment in us due to sales load and other expenses. For the years ended March 31, 2019 and March 31, 2018, the total return based on the change in market price per share and taking into account dividends and distributions, if any, reinvested in accordance with the dividend reinvestment plan was 8.3% and (12.1)%, respectively. Such returns do not reflect any sales load that stockholders may have paid in connection with their purchase of shares of our common stock.
As of March 31, 2019, our portfolio consisted of 113 portfolio companies and was invested 89% in secured debt, 0% in unsecured debt, 2% in structured products and other, 1% in preferred equity, and 8% in common equity/interests and warrants measured at fair value. As of March 31, 2018, our portfolio consisted of 90 portfolio companies and was invested 82% in secured debt, 5% in unsecured debt, 3% in structured products and other, 1% in preferred equity, and 9% in common equity/interests and warrants measured at fair value.
Since the initial public offering of Apollo Investment in April 2004 and through March 31, 2019, invested capital totaled $19.4 billion in 478 portfolio companies. Over the same period, Apollo Investment completed transactions with more than 100 different financial sponsors.

As of March 31, 2019, 0% or $0.0 billion is fixed rate debt and 100% or $1.5 billion is floating rate debt, measured at fair value. On a cost basis, 0% or $0.0 billion is fixed rate debt and 100% or $1.5 billion is floating rate debt. As of March 31, 2018, 8% or $0.1 billion was fixed rate debt and 92% or $1.2 billion was floating rate debt, measured at fair value. On a cost basis, 8% or $0.1 billion was fixed rate debt and 92% or $1.2 billion was floating rate debt. The interest rate type information is calculated using the Company’s corporate debt portfolio and excludes aviation, oil and gas, structured credit, renewables, shipping, commodities and investments on non-accrual status.
Apollo Investment Management, L.P.
Apollo Investment Management, L.P. (the “Investment Adviser” or “AIM”) is our investment adviser and an affiliate of Apollo Global Management, LLC and its consolidated subsidiaries (“AGM”). The Investment Adviser, subject to the overall supervision of our Board of Directors, manages the day-to-day operations of, and provides investment advisory services to the Company. AGM and other affiliates manage other funds that may have investment mandates that are similar, in whole or in part, with ours. AIM and its affiliates may determine that an investment is appropriate both for us and for one or more of those other funds. In such event, depending on the availability of such investment and other appropriate factors, AIM may determine that we should invest on a side-by-side basis with one or more other funds. We make all such investments subject to compliance with applicable regulations and interpretations, and our allocation procedures. Certain types of negotiated co-investments may be made only in accordance with the terms of the exemptive order we received from the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) permitting us to do so.
AIM is led by John Hannan, James Zelter, Howard Widra, Patrick Ryan and Tanner Powell. Potential investment and disposition opportunities are generally approved by one or more committees composed of personnel across AGM, including Messrs. Zelter, Widra, Ryan and Powell, by all or a majority of Messrs. Zelter, Widra, Ryan or Powell depending on the underlying investment type and/or the amount of such investment. The composition of such committees and the overall approval process for the Company’s investments may change from time to time. AIM draws upon AGM’s more than 28 year history and benefits from the broader firm’s significant capital markets, trading and research expertise developed through investments in many core sectors in over 200 companies since inception.
Apollo Investment Administration, LLC
Apollo Investment Administration, LLC (the “Administrator” or “AIA”), an affiliate of AGM, provides, among other things, administrative services and facilities for the Company. In addition to furnishing us with office facilities, equipment, and clerical, bookkeeping and recordkeeping services, AIA also oversees our financial records as well as prepares our reports to stockholders and reports filed with the SEC. AIA also performs the calculation and publication of our net asset value, the payment of our expenses and oversees the performance of various third-party service providers and the preparation and filing of our tax returns. Furthermore, AIA provides on our behalf managerial assistance to those portfolio companies to which we are required to provide such assistance.
Operating and Regulatory Structure
Our investment activities are managed by AIM and supervised by our Board of Directors, a majority of whom are independent of AGM and its affiliates. AIM is an investment adviser that is registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. Under our investment advisory management agreement, we pay AIM an annual base management fee based on our average gross assets as well as an incentive fee.
As a BDC, we are required to comply with certain regulatory requirements. Also, while we are permitted to finance investments using debt, our ability to use debt is limited in certain significant respects (see “Item 1A. Risk Factors”). We have elected to be treated for federal income tax purposes as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code.
Investments
Apollo Investment seeks to create a portfolio that includes primarily debt investments including secured loans and unsecured loans and, to a lesser extent, equity investments by investing, on an individual portfolio company basis, approximately $20 million to $250 million of capital, on average, in the securities of middle-market companies, as well as structured products such as CLOs and CLNs. The average investment size will vary as the size of our capital base varies. Our target portfolio consists primarily of long-term secured debt, as well as unsecured and mezzanine positions of private middle-market companies. Structurally, unsecured and mezzanine debt usually ranks subordinate in priority of payment to senior debt, such as bank debt, and is characterized as unsecured. As such, other creditors may rank senior to us in the event of an insolvency.
4

However, unsecured and mezzanine debt ranks senior to common and preferred equity in a borrowers’ capital structure. Unsecured and mezzanine debt may have a fixed or floating interest rate. Additional income can be generated from upfront fees, call protections including call premiums, equity co-investments or warrants. We may also invest in debt and equity positions of structured products, such as CLOs and CLNs.
Our principal focus is to provide capital to middle-market companies in a variety of industries. We generally seek to target companies that generate positive free cash flows or that may support debt investments with strong asset coverage, and we may provide debtor-in-possession or reserve financing. Additionally, we may acquire investments in the secondary market if we believe the risk-adjusted returns are attractive.
The following is a representative list of the industries in which we have invested as of March 31, 2019:

• | Advertising, Printing & Publishing


• | Aerospace & Defense


• | Automotive


• | Aviation and Consumer Transport


• | Beverage, Food & Tobacco


• | Business Services


• | Chemicals, Plastics & Rubber


• | Construction & Building


• | Consumer Goods – Durable


• | Consumer Goods – Non-durable


• | Consumer Services


• | Containers, Packaging & Glass


• | Diversified Investment Vehicles, Banking, Finance, Real Estate


• | Energy – Electricity


• | Energy – Oil & Gas


• | Food & Grocery


• | Healthcare & Pharmaceuticals


• | High Tech Industries


• | Hotel, Gaming, Leisure, Restaurants


• | Manufacturing, Capital Equipment


• | Media – Diversified & Production


• | Metals & Mining


• | Telecommunications


• | Transportation – Cargo, Distribution


• | Utilities – Electric

We may also invest in other industries if we are presented with attractive opportunities. In an effort to increase our returns and the number of investments that we can make, we may in the future seek to securitize our debt investments. To the extent we elect to include higher quality portfolio holdings in the securitization vehicle and retain lower quality holdings in our portfolio, investing in our shares may be riskier. To securitize debt investments, we may create a wholly owned subsidiary and contribute a pool of loans to the subsidiary. We may sell debt of or interests in the subsidiary on a non-recourse basis to purchasers whom we would expect to be willing to accept a lower interest rate to invest in investment-grade securities. We may use the proceeds of such sales to reduce indebtedness or to fund additional investments. We may also invest through special purpose entities or other arrangements, including total return swaps and repurchase agreements, in order to obtain non-recourse financing or for other purposes.
5

We may invest, to the extent permitted by law, in the securities and instruments of other investment companies and in private funds. We may also co-invest on a concurrent basis with affiliates of ours, subject to compliance with applicable regulations and our allocation procedures. Certain types of negotiated co-investments may be made only in accordance with the terms of the exemptive order we received from the SEC permitting us to do so. On March 29, 2016, we received an exemptive order from the SEC (the “Order”) permitting us greater flexibility to negotiate the terms of co-investment transactions with certain of our affiliates, including investment funds managed by AIM or its affiliates, subject to the conditions included therein. Under the terms of the Order, a “required majority” (as defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act) of our independent directors must be able to reach certain conclusions in connection with a co-investment transaction, including that (1) the terms of the proposed transaction are reasonable and fair to us and our stockholders and do not involve overreaching of us or our stockholders on the part of any person concerned, and (2) the transaction is consistent with the interests of our stockholders and is consistent with our Board of Directors approved criteria. In certain situations where co-investment with one or more funds managed by AIM or its affiliates is not covered by the Order, the personnel of AIM or its affiliates will need to decide which fund will proceed with the investment. Such personnel will make these determinations based on allocation policies and procedures, which are designed to reasonably ensure that investment opportunities are allocated fairly and equitably among affiliated funds over time and in a manner that is consistent with applicable laws, rules and regulations. The Order is subject to certain terms and conditions so there can be no assurance that we will be permitted to co-invest with certain of our affiliates other than in the circumstances currently permitted by regulatory guidance and the Order.

Investment Selection and Due Diligence
We are committed to a value oriented philosophy of, among other things, capital preservation and commit resources to managing risks associated with our investment portfolio. Our Investment Adviser conducts due diligence on prospective portfolio companies. In conducting its due diligence, our Investment Adviser uses information provided by the company and its management team, publicly available information, as well as information from their extensive relationships with former and current management teams, consultants, competitors and investment bankers and the direct experience of the senior partners of our affiliates.
Our Investment Adviser’s due diligence will typically include:

• | review of historical and prospective financial information;


• | on-site visits;


• | interviews with management, employees, customers and vendors of the potential portfolio company;


• | review of loan documents;


• | background checks; and


• | research relating to the company’s management, industry, markets, products and services, and competitors.

Upon the completion of due diligence and a decision to seek approval for an investment in a company, the professionals leading the proposed investment generally present the investment opportunity to and seek approval in accordance with our investment approval process. Additional due diligence with respect to any investment may be conducted on our behalf by attorneys and accountants prior to the closing of the investment, as well as other outside advisers, as appropriate.
Investment Structure
Once we have determined that a prospective portfolio company is suitable for investment, we work with the management of that company and its other capital providers, including senior, junior and equity capital providers, to structure an investment.
We generally seek to structure our investments as secured loans with a direct lien on the assets or cash flows of the company that provide for increased downside protection in the event of insolvency while maintaining attractive risk-adjusted returns and current interest income. We generally seek for these secured loans to obtain security interests in the assets of our portfolio companies that serve as collateral in support of the repayment of these loans. This collateral may take the form of first or second priority liens on the assets of a portfolio company. In some cases, we may enter into debt investments that, by their terms, convert into equity or additional debt securities or defer payments of interest after our investment. Also, in some cases our debt investments may be collateralized by a subordinated lien on some or all of the assets of the borrower. Typically, our loans have maturities of three to ten years.
We seek to tailor the terms of our investments to the facts and circumstances of the transaction and the prospective portfolio company, negotiating a structure that protects our rights and manages our risk while creating incentives for the portfolio company to achieve its business plan and improve its profitability.
7

For example, in addition to seeking a senior position in the capital structure of our portfolio companies, we seek to limit the downside potential of our investments by:

• | requiring an expected total return on our investments (including both interest and potential equity appreciation) that compensates us for credit risk;


• | generally incorporating call protection into the investment structure where possible; and


• | negotiating covenants and information rights in connection with our investments that afford our portfolio companies flexibility in managing their businesses, but which are still consistent with our goal of preserving our capital. Such restrictions may include affirmative and negative covenants, default penalties, lien protection, change of control provisions and board rights, including either observation or participation rights. Our investments may include equity features, such as warrants or options to buy a minority interest in the portfolio company. Any warrants we receive with our debt securities generally require only a nominal cost to exercise, and thus, as a portfolio company appreciates in value, we may achieve additional investment return from this equity interest. We may structure the warrants to provide provisions protecting our rights as a minority-interest holder, as well as puts, or rights to sell such securities back to the company, upon the occurrence of specified events. In many cases, we may also seek to obtain registration rights in connection with these equity interests, which may include demand and “piggyback” registration rights.

We expect to hold most of our investments to maturity or repayment, but we may sell certain of our investments sooner if a liquidity event takes place such as a sale or recapitalization or worsening of credit quality of a portfolio company, among other reasons.
Investment Valuation Process
The following is a description of the steps we take each quarter to determine the value of our portfolio. Our portfolio of investments is recorded at fair value as determined in good faith by or under the direction of our Board of Directors pursuant to a written valuation policy and a consistently applied valuation process utilizing the input of our Investment Adviser, independent valuation firms, third party pricing services and the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Since this process necessarily involves the use of judgment and the engagement of independent valuation firms, there is no certainty as to the value of our portfolio investments. Investments for which market quotations are readily available are recorded in our financial statements at such market quotations if they are deemed to represent fair value. Market quotations may be deemed not to represent fair value where AIM believes that facts and circumstances applicable to an issuer, a seller or purchaser or the market for a particular security causes current market quotes not to reflect the fair value of the security, among other reasons. Examples of these events could include cases in which material events are announced after the close of the market on which a security is primarily traded, when a security trades infrequently causing a quoted purchase or sale price to become stale or in the event of a “fire sale” by a distressed seller.
With respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available or when such market quotations are deemed not to represent fair value, our Board of Directors has approved a multi-step valuation process each quarter, as described below:

1. | Our quarterly valuation process begins with each investment being initially valued by the investment professionals of our Investment Adviser who are responsible for the portfolio company.


2. | Preliminary valuation conclusions are then documented and discussed with senior management of our Investment Adviser.


3. | Independent valuation firms are engaged by our Board of Directors to conduct independent appraisals by reviewing our Investment Adviser’s preliminary valuations and then making their own independent assessment.


4. | The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors reviews the preliminary valuation of our Investment Adviser and the valuation prepared by the independent valuation firms and responds, if warranted, to the valuation recommendation of the independent valuation firms.


5. | The Board of Directors discusses valuations and determines in good faith the fair value of each investment in our portfolio based on the input of our Investment Adviser, the applicable independent valuation firm, and the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.


6. | For Level 3 investments entered into within the last 15 business days of the current quarter-end period, the purchase price or any recent comparable trade activity on the security investment shall be considered to reasonably approximate the fair value of the investment, provided that no material change has since occurred in the issuer’s business, significant inputs or the relevant environment.

8

Investments determined by these valuation procedures which have a fair value of less than $1 million during the prior fiscal quarter may be valued based on inputs identified by the Investment Adviser without the necessity of obtaining valuation from an independent valuation firm, if once annually an independent valuation firm using the procedures described herein provides valuation. In addition, some of our investments provide for payment-in-kind (“PIK”) interest or dividends. Such amounts of accrued PIK interest or dividends are added to the cost of the investment on the respective capitalization dates and generally become due at maturity of the investment or upon the investment being called by the issuer. Upon capitalization, PIK is subject to the fair value estimates associated with their related investments.
Ongoing Relationships with Portfolio Companies
Monitoring
AIM monitors our portfolio companies on an ongoing basis and also monitors the financial trends of each portfolio company to determine if each is meeting its respective business plans and to assess the appropriate course of action for each company. In addition, senior investment professionals of AIM may take board seats or obtain board observation rights for our portfolio companies.
AIM has several methods of evaluating and monitoring the performance and fair value of our investments, which can include, but are not limited to, the assessment of success of the portfolio company in adhering to its business plan and compliance with covenants; periodic and regular contact with portfolio company management and, if appropriate, the financial or strategic sponsor, to discuss financial position, requirements and accomplishments; comparisons to other portfolio companies in the industry; attendance at and participation in board meetings; and review of monthly and quarterly financial statements and financial projections for portfolio companies.
AIM also uses an investment rating system to characterize and monitor our expected level of returns on each investment in our portfolio. These ratings are just one of several factors that AIM uses to monitor our portfolio, but they are not in and of themselves a determinative of fair value. AIM grades the credit risk of all investments on a scale of 1 to 5 no less frequently than quarterly. This system is intended primarily to reflect the underlying risk of a portfolio investment relative to our initial cost basis in respect of such portfolio investment (i.e., at the time of acquisition), although it may also take into account under certain circumstances the performance of the portfolio company’s business, the collateral coverage of the investment and other relevant factors.
Under this system, investments with a grade of 1 involve the least amount of risk to our initial cost basis. The trends and risk factors for this investment since origination or acquisition are generally favorable, which may include the performance of the portfolio company or a potential exit. Investments graded 2 involve a level of risk to our initial cost basis that is similar to the level of risk underwritten at the time of origination or acquisition. This portfolio company is generally performing in accordance with our analysis of its business and the full return of principal and interest or dividend is expected. Investments graded 3 indicate that the risk to our ability to recoup the cost of such investment has increased since origination or acquisition, but full return of principal and interest or dividend is expected. A portfolio company with an investment grade of 3 requires closer monitoring. Investments graded 4 indicate that the risk to our ability to recoup the cost of such investment has increased significantly since origination or acquisition, including as a result of factors such as declining performance and noncompliance with debt covenants, and we expect some loss of interest, dividend or capital appreciation, but still expect an overall positive internal rate of return on the investment. Investments graded 5 indicate that the risk to our ability to recoup the cost of such investment has increased materially since origination or acquisition and the portfolio company likely has materially declining performance. Loss of interest or dividend and some loss of principal investment is expected, which would result in an overall negative internal rate of return on the investment. For investments graded 4 or 5, AIM enhances its level of scrutiny over the monitoring of such portfolio company.
AIM monitors and, when appropriate, changes the investment ratings assigned to each investment in our portfolio. In connection with our valuation process, AIM reviews these investment ratings on a quarterly basis, and the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors monitors such ratings. It is possible that the grade of certain of these portfolio investments may be reduced or increased over time.
Managerial Assistance
As a BDC, we must offer, and must provide upon request, significant managerial assistance to certain of our portfolio companies. This assistance could involve, among other things, monitoring the operations of our portfolio companies, participating in board and management meetings, consulting with and advising officers of portfolio companies and providing other organizational and financial guidance. We may receive fees for these services.
9

Competition
Our primary competitors in providing financing to middle-market companies include public and private funds, commercial and investment banks, commercial financing companies, other BDCs or hedge funds, and, to the extent they provide an alternative form of financing, private equity funds. Some of our existing and potential competitors are substantially larger and have considerably greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. For example, some competitors may have a lower cost of funds and access to funding sources that are not available to us. In addition, some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments and establish more relationships than us. Furthermore, many of our competitors are not subject to the regulatory restrictions that the 1940 Act imposes on us as a BDC or the restrictions that the Code imposes on us as a RIC.
We also expect to use the industry information of AGM’s investment professionals to which we have access to assess investment risks and determine appropriate pricing for our investments in portfolio companies. In addition, we believe that the relationships of the senior managers of AIM and those of our affiliates enable us to learn about, and compete effectively for, financing opportunities with attractive middle-market companies in the industries in which we seek to invest.
Staffing
The Company has no employees. All of the services we utilize are provided by third parties. Our Chief Financial Officer, Chief Legal Officer and Chief Compliance Officer and additional personnel assisting them in such functions are employees of AIA and perform their respective functions under the terms of the administration agreement with AIA. Certain of our other executive officers are managing partners of our Investment Adviser. Our day-to-day investment operations are managed by our Investment Adviser, which draws on the broader capabilities of the Opportunistic Credit segment of AGM’s credit business. In addition, we generally reimburse AIA for our allocable portion of expenses incurred by it in performing its obligations under the administration agreement, including rent and our allocable portion of the cost of our Chief Financial Officer, Chief Legal Officer and Chief Compliance Officer and their respective staffs.
Investment Advisory Management Agreement
Management Services
AIM serves as our investment adviser and is a wholly-owned direct subsidiary of Apollo Global Management. AIM is registered as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the “Advisers Act”). Subject to the overall supervision of our Board of Directors, the investment adviser manages the day-to-day operations of, and provides investment advisory and management services to, Apollo Investment. Under the terms of the investment advisory management agreement, AIM:

• | determines the composition of our portfolio, the nature and timing of the changes to our portfolio and the manner of implementing such changes;


• | identifies, evaluates and negotiates the structure of the investments we make (including performing due diligence on our prospective portfolio companies); and


• | closes and monitors the investments we make.

AIM’s services under the investment advisory management agreement are not exclusive, and it is free to furnish similar services to other entities so long as its services to us are not impaired.
Management and Incentive Fee
Pursuant to the investment advisory management agreement, we incur a fee payable to AIM for investment advisory and management services consisting of two components - a base management fee and an incentive fee. For the fiscal years ended March 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, we accrued $35.73 million, $47.94 million and $52.93 million, respectively, in base management fees and incurred $21.19 million, $28.71 million and $18.78 million, respectively, in performance-based incentive fees.
10

Base Management Fee
Effective April 1, 2018, the base management fee is calculated initially at an annual rate of 1.50% (0.375% per quarter) of the lesser of (i) the average of the value of the Company’s gross assets (excluding cash or cash equivalents but including other assets purchased with borrowed amounts) at the end of each of the two most recently completed calendar quarters and (ii) the average monthly value (measured as of the last day of each month) of the Company’s gross assets (excluding cash or cash equivalents but including other assets purchased with borrowed amounts) during the most recently completed calendar quarter; provided, however, in each case, the base management fee is calculated at an annual rate of 1.00% (0.250% per quarter) of the average of the value of the Company’s gross assets (excluding cash or cash equivalents but including other assets purchased with borrowed amounts) that exceeds the product of (A) 200% and (B) the value of the Company’s net asset value at the end of the prior calendar quarter. The base management fee will be payable quarterly in arrears. The value of the Company’s gross assets shall be calculated in accordance with the Company's valuation policies.
For the period from April 1, 2017 through March 31, 2018, the base management was calculated at an annual rate of 2% (0.5% per quarter) of the average of the value of the Company’s gross assets (excluding cash or cash equivalents but including other assets purchased with borrowed amounts) at the end of each of the two most recently completed calendar quarters. For the same period, the Investment Adviser agreed to waive 25% of its base management fee so the base management fee was reduced from 2% to 1.5%.
Performance-based Incentive Fee
The incentive fee (the “Incentive Fee”) consists of two components that are determined independent of each other, with the result that one component may be payable even if the other is not. A portion of the Incentive Fee is based on income and a portion is based on capital gains, each as described below:
A. Incentive Fee based on Income
(i) Incentive Fee on Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income - (April 1, 2017 - December 31, 2018)
The first part of the incentive fee was calculated and payable quarterly in arrears based on our pre-incentive fee net investment income for the immediately preceding calendar quarter at an annual rate of 20%. For this purpose, pre-incentive fee net investment income means interest income, dividend income and any other income (including, without limitation, any accrued income that the Company has not yet received in cash and any other fees such as commitment, origination, structuring, diligence and consulting fees or other fees that the Company receives from portfolio companies) accrued during the calendar quarter, minus the Company’s operating expenses accrued during the calendar quarter (including, without limitation, the Base Management Fee, administration expenses and any interest expense and dividends paid on any issued and outstanding preferred stock, but excluding the Incentive Fee on Income and the Incentive Fee on Capital Gains). Pre-incentive fee net investment income did not include any realized or unrealized gains or losses. Pre-incentive fee net investment income, expressed as a rate of return on the value of our net assets at the end of the immediately preceding calendar quarter, is compared to the rate of 1.75% per quarter (7% annualized) (the “performance threshold”). For the period from April 1, 2017 through December 31, 2018, if the resulting incentive fee rate was less than 20% due to the incentive fee waiver discussed below, the percentage at which the Investment Adviser’s 100% catch-up is complete would also be reduced ratably from 2.1875% (8.75% annualized) to as low as 2.06% (8.24% annualized) (“catch-up threshold”).
The Company pays the Investment Adviser an incentive fee with respect to our pre-incentive fee net investment income in each calendar quarter as follows: (1) no incentive fee in any calendar quarter in which our pre-incentive fee net investment income does not exceed the performance threshold; and (2) 100% of our pre-incentive fee net investment income with respect to that portion of such pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds 1.75% but does not exceed the catch-up threshold in any calendar quarter; and (3) for the period from April 1, 2017 through December 31, 2018, 15% to 20% of the amount of our pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds the catch-up threshold in any calendar quarter. These calculations are appropriately prorated for any period of less than three months. The effect of the fee calculation described above is that if pre-incentive fee net investment income is equal to or exceeds the catch-up threshold, the Investment Adviser will receive a fee of 15% to 20% of our pre-incentive fee net investment income for the quarter.

Incentive Fee Waiver
For the period from April 1, 2018 through December 31, 2018, the Investment Adviser agreed to waive 25% of its performance based incentive fee so that the incentive fee on pre-incentive fee net investment income was accrued at 15%.
For the period from April 1, 2017 through March 31, 2018, the Investment Adviser agreed to waive up to 25% of its performance based incentive fee so that the incentive fee on pre-incentive fee net investment income could be accrued at as low a rate as 15% to the extent the Company experienced cumulative net realized and change in unrealized losses during the waiver period (“cumulative net losses”). The inclusion of cumulative net gains and cumulative net losses were measured on a cumulative basis from April 1, 2017 through the end of each quarter during the waiver period. Any cumulative net gains would have resulted in a dollar for dollar increase in the incentive fee payable up to a maximum rate of 20% and any cumulative net losses would have resulted in a dollar for dollar decrease in the incentive fee payable down to a minimum rate of 15%.
(ii) Incentive Fee on Pre-Incentive Fee Net Income - effective from January 1, 2019
As of January 1, 2019, the incentive fee on pre-incentive fee net investment income is determined and paid quarterly in arrears by calculating the amount by which (x) the aggregate amount of the pre-incentive fee net investment income in respect of the current calendar quarter and each of the eleven preceding calendar quarters beginning with the calendar quarter that commences on or after April 1, 2018 (the “trailing twelve quarters”) exceeds (y) the preferred return amount in respect of the trailing twelve quarters.
The preferred return amount will be determined on a quarterly basis, and will be calculated by summing the amounts obtained by multiplying 1.75% by the Company’s net asset value at the beginning of each applicable calendar quarter comprising the relevant trailing twelve quarters. The preferred return amount will be calculated after making appropriate adjustments to the Company’s net asset value at the beginning of each applicable calendar quarter for Company capital issuances and distributions during the applicable calendar quarter.
The amount of the Incentive Fee on Income that will be paid to the Investment Adviser for a particular quarter will equal the excess of the incentive fee on pre-incentive fee net investment income, so calculated less the aggregate incentive fee on pre-incentive fee net investment income that were paid to the Investment Adviser (excluding waivers, if any) in the preceding eleven calendar quarters comprising the relevant trailing twelve quarters.
The Company will pay the Investment Adviser an incentive fee with respect to our pre-incentive fee net investment income in each calendar quarter as follows:
(1) no incentive fee in any calendar quarter in which our pre-incentive fee net investment income for the trailing twelve quarters does not exceed the preferred return amount.
(2) 100% of our pre-incentive fee net investment income for the trailing twelve quarters, if any, that exceeds the preferred return amount but is less than or equal to an amount (the “catch-up amount”) determined by multiplying 2.1875% by the Company’s net asset value at the beginning of each applicable calendar quarter comprising the relevant trailing twelve quarters.
(3) for any quarter in which the Company’s pre-incentive fee net investment income for the trailing twelve quarters exceeds the catch-up amount, the incentive fee shall equal 20% of the amount of the Company’s pre-incentive fee net investment income for such trailing twelve quarters.
The Incentive Fee on Income as calculated is subject to a cap (the “Incentive Fee Cap”). The Incentive Fee Cap in any quarter is an amount equal to (a) 20% of the Cumulative Pre-Incentive Fee Net Return (as defined below) during the relevant trailing twelve quarters less (b) the aggregate Incentive Fees on Income that were paid to the Investment Adviser (excluding waivers, if any) in the preceding eleven calendar quarters (or portion thereof) comprising the relevant trailing twelve quarters.
For this purpose, “Cumulative Pre-Incentive Fee Net Return” during the relevant trailing twelve quarters means (x) Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income in respect of the trailing twelve quarters less (y) any Net Capital Loss, since April 1, 2018, in respect of the trailing twelve quarters. If, in any quarter, the Incentive Fee Cap is zero or a negative value, the Company shall pay no Incentive Fee on Income to the Investment Adviser in that quarter. If, in any quarter, the Incentive Fee Cap is a positive value but is less than the Incentive Fee on Income calculated in accordance with the calculation described above of the 1940 Act, the Company shall pay the Investment Adviser the Incentive Fee Cap for such quarter. If, in any quarter, the Incentive Fee Cap is equal to or greater than the Incentive Fee on Income calculated in accordance with the calculation described above, the Company shall pay the Investment Adviser the Incentive Fee on Income for such quarter.
“Net Capital Loss” in respect of a particular period means the difference, if positive, between (i) aggregate capital losses, whether realized or unrealized, in such period and (ii) aggregate capital gains, whether realized or unrealized, in such period.

The following is a graphical representation of the calculation of the Incentive Fee based on income:
Incentive Fee based on Income
Percentage of Ordinary Income comprising the Incentive Fee based on Income
(expressed as an annualized rate of return on the value of net assets as of the beginning
of each of the quarters included in the Trailing Twelve Quarters)
B. Incentive Fee on Cumulative Net Realized Gains
The Incentive Fee on Capital Gains is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year (or upon termination of the investment advisory management agreement). This fee shall equal 20.0% of the sum of the Company’s realized capital gains on a cumulative basis, calculated as of the end of each calendar year (or upon termination of the investment advisory management agreement), computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation on a cumulative basis, less the aggregate amount of any Incentive Fees on Capital Gains previously paid to the Investment Adviser. The aggregate unrealized capital depreciation of the Company shall be calculated as the sum of the differences, if negative, between (a) the valuation of each investment in the Company’s portfolio as of the applicable calculation date and (b) the accreted or amortized cost basis of such investment.
For accounting purposes only, we are required under GAAP to accrue a theoretical capital gains incentive fee based upon net realized capital gains and unrealized capital gain and loss on investments held at the end of each period. The accrual of this theoretical capital gains incentive fee assumes all unrealized capital gain and loss is realized in order to reflect a theoretical capital gains incentive fee that would be payable to the Investment Adviser at each measurement date. There was no accrual for theoretical capital gains incentive fee for the three months ended June 30, 2018 and 2017. It should be noted that a fee so calculated and accrued would not be payable under the Advisers Act or the investment advisory management agreement, and would not be paid based upon such computation of capital gains incentive fees in subsequent periods. Amounts actually paid to the Investment Adviser will be consistent with the Advisers Act and formula reflected in the investment advisory management agreement which specifically excludes consideration of unrealized capital gain.
On January 16, 2019, the we entered into a fee offset agreement with AIM in connection with revenue realized by AIM and its affiliates for the management of certain aircraft assets.  We will receive an offsetting credit against total incentive fees otherwise due to AIM under the the investment advisory management agreement.  The amount offset will initially be 20% of the management fee revenue earned and incentive fee revenue realized by AIM and its affiliates in connection with managing aircraft assets on related insurance balance sheets (“New Balance Sheet Investments”), new aircraft managed account capital (“New Managed Accounts”) and new dedicated aircraft funds (“New Aircraft Funds”). Once the aggregate capital raised by New Aircraft Funds or New Managed Accounts and capital invested by the New Balance Sheet Investments exceeds $3 billion cumulatively, the fee offset will step down to 10% of the amount of incremental management fee revenue earned and incentive fee revenue realized by AIM and its affiliates. The fee offset will be in place for seven years, however the incentive fees realized by AIM and its affiliates after this seven-year period from applicable investments that were raised or made within the seven-year period will also be used to offset incentive fees payable to AIM by us. The offset will be limited to the amount of incentive fee payable by the us to AIM and any unapplied fee offset which exceeds the incentive fees payable in a given quarter will carry forward to be credited against the incentive fees payable by us in subsequent quarters.
