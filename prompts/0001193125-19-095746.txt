ITEM 1. | Business
--------+---------

 Dave & Busters Entertainment, Inc. (D&B Entertainment) is a leading owner and operator of high-volume entertainment and dining venues (stores) that operate under the name Dave & Busters. The core of our concept is to offer our customers the opportunity to Eat Drink Play and Watch all in one location, providing a fun, upbeat atmosphere with interactive entertainment options for adults and families, while serving high-quality food and beverages. We opened the first Dave & Busters store in Dallas, Texas in 1982, and as of February 3, 2019 (the last day of fiscal 2018), we owned and operated 121 stores located in 39 states, Puerto Rico and one Canadian province. Subsequent to the end of fiscal 2018, we closed our store in Duluth (Atlanta), Georgia on March 3, 2019. Unless otherwise provided in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, references to Dave & Busters, we, us, our or the Company refer to D&B Entertainment and its wholly-owned subsidiaries and any predecessor entities. 
 Our fiscal year consists of 52 or 53 weeks ending on the Sunday after the Saturday closest to January 31. Each quarterly period has 13 weeks, except in a 53-week year when the fourth quarter has 14 weeks. Fiscal 2017 contained 53 weeks. Fiscal 2018, 2016, 2015, and 2014, each contained 52 weeks. We refer to our fiscal years as 2018, 2017, 2016, 2015, and 2014 throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K. All dollar amounts are presented in thousands, unless otherwise noted, except share and per share amounts. 
 Eat Drink Play and Watch - All Under One Roof 
 We have developed a distinctive brand based on our customer value proposition: Eat Drink Play and Watch. The interaction between playing games, watching sports, dining and enjoying our full-service bar areas is the defining feature of the Dave & Busters customer experience, and the layout of each store is designed to promote crossover between these activities. We believe this combination creates an experience at a single location that cannot be easily replicated elsewhere. Our stores are also designed to accommodate premium sports viewing events, private parties, business functions and other corporate-sponsored events. Our customer mix skews moderately to males, primarily between the ages of 21 and 39, and we believe we also serve as an attractive venue for families with children and teenagers. We believe we appeal to a diverse customer base by providing a highly customizable experience in a dynamic and fun setting. 
Eat 
 We strive to differentiate our food from other casual dining concepts with our new Crafting Craveability strategy. This was developed to help us serve quality, flavorful and craveable food offerings. We have made improvements to many of our food items, including upgrading to all-natural chicken breasts and 100% Angus butchers blend burgers. In addition, there has been a renewed focus on cooking technique and execution. We have also significantly reduced the number of menu items to enable better execution. 
 While our menu appeals to a broad spectrum of customers, we continue to evolve it to reflect the changing tastes of our 21-39 year-old primary target guests, with options for full meals as well as grabbing an appetizer to share with friends. We deliver high-quality offerings, including a wide variety of starters, one-of-a-kind burgers, choice-grade steaks, and health-conscious options comparable to those of other higher-end casual dining operators. We believe our broad menu offers something for everyone and is appropriate for many different occasions. To ensure that we stay on-trend with societal shifts, we roll out menus that feature new food items two times a year. 
 Our food revenues, which include non-alcoholic beverages, accounted for approximately 68% of our food and beverage revenues and approximately 29% of our total revenues during fiscal 2018.

 Drink 
 Each of our locations also offers full bar service, including a variety of beers, hand-crafted cocktails, and premium spirits. We are executing the Crafting Craveability strategy in beverage as well. We have re-crafted recipes, switched to more fresh juices and purees and house-made mixers. We have also reduced the number of featured cocktails in our beverage menu to improve focus and execution by our bartender staff. Beverage service is typically available throughout the entire store, allowing for multiple point of sale opportunities. We believe that our high margin beverage offering is complementary to each of the Eat, Play and Watch aspects of our brand. Our alcoholic beverage revenues accounted for approximately 32% of our total food and beverage revenues and approximately 13% of our total revenues during fiscal 2018. 
Play 
 The games in our Midway are a key aspect of the Dave & Busters entertainment experience, which we believe is the core differentiating feature of our brand. The Midway in each of our stores is an area where we offer a wide array of amusement and entertainment options, some of which are exclusive to Dave & Busters on a permanent or temporary basis. Each of our stores typically has 150 redemption and simulation games as well as our proprietary virtual reality platform that we introduced in fiscal 2018. Most of our games are activated by game play credits on cards or other RFID devices (collectively, Power Cards). A customer purchases the game play credits or chips at an automated kiosk, through a mobile application or from an employee. Our amusement and other revenues accounted for approximately 58% of our total revenues during fiscal 2018. Redemption games, which represented approximately 74% of our amusement and other revenues in fiscal 2018, offer our customers the opportunity to win tickets that are redeemable at a retail-style space in our stores that we have branded WIN!, with prizes ranging from branded novelty items to high-end electronics. We believe this opportunity to win creates a fun and highly energized social experience that is an important aspect of the Dave & Busters in-store experience and cannot be easily replicated at home. Many of our non-redemption games, which include our virtual reality, video and simulation offerings, can be played by multiple customers simultaneously and include some of the latest high-tech games that are commercially available. These games represented approximately 23% of our amusement and other revenues in fiscal 2018. Other traditional amusements, such as billiards and bowling, represented the remainder of our amusement revenues in fiscal 2018. 
Watch 
 Sports-viewing is another key component of the entertainment experience at Dave & Busters. All of our stores have multiple large screen televisions and high-quality audio systems providing customers with a venue for watching live sports and other televised events. Our D&B Sports areas provide an immersive viewing environment that provides customers with an average of 40 televisions, including 100+ inch high definition televisions, to watch televised events and enjoy our full bar and extensive food menu. We believe that we have created an attractive and comfortable environment that includes a differentiated and interactive viewing experience that offers a reason for customers to visit Dave & Busters. Through continued development of the D&B Sports concept in new stores and additional renovations of existing stores, our goal is to build awareness of D&B Sports as the best place to watch sports and the only place to watch the games and play the games. 
Our Companys Core Strengths 
 We believe we benefit from the following strengths: 
 Strong, distinctive brand with broad customer appeal. We believe that the multi-faceted customer experience of Eat Drink Play and Watch at Dave & Busters, supported by our national marketing, has helped us create a widely recognized brand with no direct national competitor that combines all four elements in the same way. Nationally, over 80% of casual dining customers stated that they are aware of our brand as a dining and entertainment venue. Our customer research shows that our brand appeals to a relatively balanced mix of 
 
4 


  male and female adults, which is moderately skewed to males, primarily between the ages of 21 and 39, as well as families and teenagers. Based on customer survey results, we also believe that the average annual household income of our customers is approximately $75, which we believe represents an attractive demographic. 
 Multi-faceted customer experience highlights our value proposition. We believe that our combination of interactive games, attractive television viewing areas, high-quality dining and full-service beverage offerings, delivered in a highly-energized atmosphere, provides a multi-faceted customer experience that cannot be easily replicated at home or elsewhere without having to visit multiple destinations. We aim to offer our customers a value proposition comparable or superior to many of the separately available dining and entertainment options. We are continuously working with game manufacturers and others to create new games and attractions that include content that is exclusively available at Dave & Busters on a permanent or temporary basis. Our new games in combination with new food and beverage offerings and focused attention to the customer experience help us to retain and generate customer traffic. Our value proposition is enhanced by marketing initiatives, including free game play that often features the introduction of our new games, Super Charge Power Card offerings (when purchasing or adding value to a Power Card, the customer is given the opportunity to add more chips to the Power Card at a lower cost per chip amount), and Half-Price Game Play (every Wednesday, from open to close, we reduce the price of every game in the Midway by one-half). In addition, we expanded the All You Can Eat wings limited time promotional offer in fiscal 2018. We believe these initiatives have helped increase customer visits and encourage customers to participate more fully across our broad range of food, beverage and entertainment offerings. 
 Vibrant, contemporary store design that integrates entertainment and dining. We continue to enhance the Dave & Busters brand through our store design, including our D&B Sports concept. Our core store design provides a contemporary, engaging atmosphere for our customers with clearly differentiated spaces designed to convey the components of our customer value proposition: Eat Drink Play and Watch. During fiscal 2017, we developed a new store design that we refer to as the 17K. The 17K format will allow us to enter smaller markets than our traditional stores. During fiscal 2018 we opened two stores utilizing the 17K format. The 17K format retains the Play components of our large and small formats, combines the Eat and Watch elements in an expanded sports viewing area and maintains the ability to Drink throughout the facility. This new design will be utilized in addition to our large and small formats in future expansion. Our core store design in all our formats includes a modern approach to the finishes and layout of the store, which we believe encourages participation across each of the stores elements. The oversized graphics and images throughout the store are intended to communicate our brand personality by being fun, contemporary and larger-than-life. The dining room décor includes booth and table seating and colorful artwork, often featuring local landmarks. Our WIN! area provides a retail-like environment where customers can redeem their tickets for prizes. We believe our D&B Sports area provides an attractive opportunity to market our broader platform to new and existing customers through a year-round calendar of programming and promotions tied to popular sporting events and sport-related activities. The large television screens, comfortable seating, a full menu of food and beverages and artwork often featuring images of local sports teams and sports icons help create what we believe to be an exciting environment for watching sports programming. 
 Strong history of growth. We have a proven track record of improving operating results and expanding the footprint of our brand and over the past five fiscal years, we have increased our net income by $115,052, EBITDA margins by approximately 370 basis points and our Adjusted EBITDA Margins (both defined in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsNon-GAAP Financial Measures) by approximately 430 basis points. We expect our continued focus on operating performance at individual stores and leveraging general and administrative expense and advertising expense will positively impact operating margins and will partially offset pressure from wage inflation and occupancy costs, although there is no guarantee that our efforts will be successful. 
 Store model generates favorable store economics and strong returns. We believe our store model offering entertainment, food and beverages provides certain benefits in comparison to traditional restaurant concepts, as 
 
5 


  reflected by our fiscal 2018 average annual comparable store revenues of $11,100, average comparable store operating income margins of 21.7% and comparable Store Operating Income Before Depreciation and Amortization Margins (defined in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsNon-GAAP Financial Measures) of 30.4%. 
 Our entertainment offerings have low variable costs and produced gross margins of 88.9% for fiscal 2018. With approximately 58% of our revenues from entertainment, we have less exposure than traditional restaurant concepts to food costs, which represented only 8% of our total revenues in fiscal 2018. Our business model generates strong cash flow that we can use to execute our growth strategy. We believe the combination of our operating income margins, our Store Operating Income Before Depreciation and Amortization Margins, our refined new store formats and the fact that our stores typically open with high volumes that drive margins in year one will help us achieve our targeted average year one cash-on-cash returns of approximately 35% and five-year average cash-on-cash returns in excess of 25% for both our large format and small format store openings, however there is no guarantee such results will occur with future store openings. The 62 stores that we have opened since the beginning of 2008 (that have been open for more than 12 months as of February 3, 2019) have generated average year one cash-on-cash returns of approximately 53%. The 54 stores that opened subsequent to fiscal 2010 have generated average year one cash-on-cash returns of approximately 56%. We define and calculate cash-on-cash returns for an individual store as (a) Store Operating Income Before Depreciation and Amortization, excluding pre-opening expenses, national marketing expense allocation, non-cash charges related to asset disposals, currency transactions and changes in non-cash deferred amusement revenue and ticket liability, divided by (b) our net development costs. Net development costs include equipment, building, leaseholds and site costs, net of tenant improvement allowances and other landlord payments, excluding pre-opening costs and capitalized interest. 
 Commitment to customer satisfaction. We aim to enhance our combination of food, beverage and entertainment offerings through our service philosophy of providing a high quality and consistent customer experience through dedicated training and development of our team members and a corporate culture that encourages employee engagement. In 2018, 85.7% of respondents to our Guest Satisfaction Survey rated us Top Box (score of 5 out of a possible 5) in Overall Experience and 86.7% of respondents rated us Top Box in Intent to Recommend. By comparison, in 2012, 80.6% of respondents rated us Top Box in Overall Experience and 83.6% of respondents rated us Top Box in Intent to Recommend. We utilize our loyalty program to market directly to members with promotional emails and location-based marketing. Through our loyalty program, we email offers and coupons to members and notify them of new games, food, drinks and local events. In addition, members can earn game play credits based on the dollar amount of qualifying purchases at our stores. We expect that as our loyalty program grows it will be an important method of maintaining customers connection with our brand and further drive customer satisfaction. 
 Experienced management team. We believe we are led by a strong senior management team averaging over 20 years of experience with national brands in all aspects of casual dining, entertainment and other consumer centric operations. We believe that our management teams prior experience combined with its experience at Dave & Busters provides us with insights into our customer base and enables us to create the dynamic environment that is core to our brand. 
 Our Growth Strategies 
 The operating strategy that underlies the growth of our concept is built on the following key components: 
 Drive our comparable store sales. We intend to grow our comparable store sales in the highly competitive dining and entertainment segment by seeking to differentiate the Dave & Busters brand from other food and entertainment alternatives, through the following strategies: 

 | Introduce compelling content in our amusements. We believe that our Midway games are the core differentiating feature of the Dave & Busters brand and staying current with the latest offerings creates
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
6 


 
new content and excitement to drive repeat visits and increase length of customer stay. We plan to continually update our games each year through development of innovative and proprietary games and the purchase of new games that will resonate with our customers and drive brand relevance due to a variety of factors, including their large scale, eye-catching appearance, virtual reality features, association with recognizable brands or the fact that they cannot be easily replicated at home. We aim to leverage our investment in games by featuring exclusive game offerings in our marketing initiatives. We also plan to continually elevate the redemption experience in our WIN! area with prizes that we believe customers will find more attractive, which we expect will favorably impact customer visitation and game play.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Leverage D&B Sports. We intend to continue leveraging our investments in D&B Sports by building awareness of Dave & Busters as the only place to watch the games and play the games through national cable advertising. In addition, we are strategically optimizing our year-round sporting and pay-per-view content to drive increased traffic and capture a higher share of the sports-viewing customer base.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Continually enhance our food and beverage offerings. Our menu has a variety of items, from hamburgers to steaks to salads that represent our Crafting Craveability mantra. We aim to ensure a pipeline for two new menu launches each year, as well as two to three limited time offers. This strategy has been well received by our customers as the percentage of customers rating our food quality as Excellent was 85.5% in fiscal 2018. Similarly, the percentage of customers rating our beverage quality as Excellent in fiscal 2018 was 89.1%.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Grow our special events usage. The special events portion of our business represented 9.8% of our total revenues in fiscal 2018. We believe our special events business is an important sampling and promotional opportunity for our customers because many customers are experiencing Dave & Busters for the first time. We plan to leverage our existing special events sales force and call center to attract new corporate customers. In addition, we will continue to expand our online booking capability beyond strictly social events.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Enhance brand awareness and generate additional visits to our stores through marketing and promotions. We believe offering new items from each of the Eat Drink Play and Watch pillars will keep the brand relevant to customers and drive traffic and frequency. We typically have seven-to-nine key promotional periods each year when we feature this New News in national advertising. To increase national awareness of our brand, we plan to continue to invest a significant portion of our marketing expenditures in national cable television advertising, while also increasing our investment in digital media. Our messaging focuses on promoting our capital investments in new games, and new food and beverage offerings. We also have customized local store marketing programs to increase new visits and repeat visits to individual locations. We will continue to utilize our loyalty program and digital efforts to communicate promotional offers directly to our most passionate brand fans, and we are aggressively optimizing our search engine and social marketing efforts.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Drive customer frequency through greater digital and mobile connectivity. We believe that there is potential to increase customer frequency by enhancing the in-store and out-of-store customer experience via digital and mobile strategic initiatives. We continue to optimize our search, programmatic media and paid social media to create customer engagement and drive recurring customer visitation. In addition, we will continue to leverage our customer relationship management program and our growing loyalty database, by delivering more targeted individualized offers and creative content.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Build great new stores. We will continue to pursue what we believe to be a disciplined new store growth strategy in both new and existing markets where we feel we are capable of achieving targeted revenue levels, operating income margins and Store Operating Income Before Depreciation and Amortization Margins as well as strong cash-on-cash returns. We believe that the Dave & Busters brand has significant growth opportunities, as 
 
7 


  internal studies and third-party research suggests a total store potential in the United States and Canada in excess of 230 stores (including our 121 stores as of the end of fiscal 2018). We anticipate that approximately 25% of our future new store openings will utilize our new 17K design and that the balance of our future openings will be fairly evenly split between our traditional large and small formats. We opened fifteen stores in fiscal 2018. Store openings during the past six fiscal years were primarily financed with available cash and operating cash flows. In 2019 and the near future, we believe that we can continue opening new stores at an annual growth rate of 10% or more of our then existing store base. 
 Our store expansion strategy is driven by a site selection process that allows us to evaluate and select the location, size and design of our stores based on consumer research and analysis of operating data from sales in our existing stores. Our site selection process and flexible store design enable us to customize each store with the objective of maximizing return on capital given the characteristics of the market and the location. Our current store large formats are 30,001 to 45,000 square feet in size and our current store small formats span 25,000 to 30,000 square feet. Our small and 17K formats provide us the flexibility to enter new smaller markets and further penetrate existing markets. Our various store formats also provide us with the ability to strategically choose between building new stores and converting existing space, which can be more cost efficient for certain locations. We are targeting average year one cash-on-cash returns of approximately 35% for both our large format and small format stores and approximately 25% for the 17K format. To achieve this return for large format stores, we target average net development costs of approximately $8,300 to $8,800 and first-year store revenues of approximately $10,000 to $12,200. For small format stores, we target average net development costs of approximately $6,800 and average first year store revenues of approximately $8,700. For 17K format stores, we target average net development costs of approximately $5,000 and first-year store revenues of approximately $5,000. Additionally, for both large format and small format stores, we target average year one margins on operating income (excluding allocated national marketing costs) of approximately 18%, and Store Operating Income Before Depreciation and Amortization (excluding allocated national marketing costs) of approximately 29%. For our 17K format store, we target average year one margins on operating income (excluding allocated national marketing costs) of approximately 12% and Store Operating Income Before Depreciation and Amortization (excluding allocated national marketing costs) of approximately 25%. 
 Expand the Dave & Busters brand internationally. We believe that in addition to the growth potential that exists in North America, the Dave & Busters brand can also have significant appeal in certain international markets. We are currently assessing these opportunities while maintaining a conservative and disciplined approach towards the execution of our international development strategy. As such, we have retained the services of a third-party consultant to assist in identifying and prioritizing potential markets for expansion as well as potential franchise or joint venture partners. Thus far, we have identified our international market priorities and begun the process of identifying potential international partners. 
 Site Selection 
 We believe that the location of stores is critical to our long-term success. The experience and relationships of our current development team has enabled us to focus our attention on the most relevant network of real estate brokers, which has given us access to a larger pool of qualified potential store sites. In addition, we believe the more contemporary look of our stores has been one of the key drivers in attracting new developers and building our new store pipeline. We devote significant time and resources to strategically analyze each prospective market, trade area and site. We continually identify, evaluate and update our database of potential locations for expansion. We base new site selection on an analytical evaluation of a set of drivers we believe increase the probability of successful, high-volume stores. 
Our Store Formats 
 We currently operate stores varying in size from 16,000 to 66,000 square feet. To optimize sales per square foot and further enhance our store economics, the target size of our future large format stores is expected to be 
 
8 


  between 30,001 and 45,000 square feet while our small format stores span 25,000 to 30,000 square feet. Additionally, our newly-developed 17K design which will span 15,000 to 20,000 square feet, should allow us to enter markets with store size requirements less than our traditional large and small store formats. Our initial stores with this new design opened in fiscal 2018 in Rogers, Arkansas and Corpus Christi, Texas. 
 We utilize smaller format stores to penetrate less densely populated markets and backfill existing markets. The smaller format has reduced the back-of-house space and optimized the sales area dedicated to video and redemption games. We believe that the smaller format maintains the dynamic customer experience that is the foundation of our brand and allows us flexibility in our site selection process. We also believe that the smaller store format allows us to take less capital investment risk per store. As a result, we expect these smaller format stores to enable us to expand into additional markets. We anticipate that approximately 25% of our future new store openings will utilize our new 17K design and that the balance of our future openings will be fairly evenly split between our traditional large and small formats. At February 3, 2019, 23 of our 121 operating stores were the small store format and two were the new 17K format. Our fiscal 2018 new store openings included eleven large format stores, two small format stores and two 17K format stores. 
 Marketing, Advertising and Promotion 
 Our corporate marketing department manages all consumer-focused initiatives for the Dave & Busters brand. In order to drive sales and expand our customer base, we focus our efforts in three key areas: 

 | Marketing: national advertising, media (linear and digital), promotions, in-store merchandising, pricing
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Food and beverage: menu and product development
--+------------------------------------------------


 | Customer insights: research, brand health and tracking
--+-------------------------------------------------------

 We spent approximately $40,767 in marketing efforts in fiscal 2018, $37,876 in fiscal 2017, and $33,795 in fiscal 2016. Our annual marketing expenditures include the cost of national television and radio advertising totaling $30,437, $30,003, and $25,845, in fiscal years 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. 
 We continually seek to improve our marketing effectiveness through a number of initiatives, including: 
 

 | refining our marketing strategy to better reach both young adults and families;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | creating new advertising campaigns;
--+------------------------------------


 | investing in menu research and development to differentiate our food offerings from our competition and improve key product attributes (quality, consistency, value and overall customer satisfaction) and execution;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | developing product/promotional strategies to attract new customers and increase spending/length of stay;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | leveraging our loyalty database to create stronger relationships with consumers to engage and motivate them to visit; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | reflecting a consistent brand identity that represents our positioning and commitment to quality.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 To drive traffic and increase visit frequency and average check size, the bulk of our marketing budget is allocated to national cable television media. To enhance that effort, we also: 
 

 | conduct digital initiatives including search engine marketing, mobile campaigns, programmatic marketing and social media;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | maintain and optimize the website for search;
--+----------------------------------------------


 | run in-store promotions and create point-of-purchase materials;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------

 
9 


 
 | leverage the customer loyalty program, including promotional and trigger emails; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | create local marketing plans to address specific objectives in individual stores or markets.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We work with external advertising, digital, media and design agencies in the development and execution of these programs. 
 Special Event Marketing 
 Our corporate and group sales programs are managed by our sales department, which provides direction, training, and support to the special events managers and their teams within each store. They are supported by a special events call center located at our corporate office, targeted print and online media plans, as well as promotional incentives at appropriate times during the year. In addition, we have online booking for social parties in order to provide additional convenience in booking events for our customers. 
Operations 
 Management 
 Our typical store team consists of a General Manager supported by an average of nine additional management positions. There is a defined structure of development and progression of job responsibilities from Area Operations Manager through various positions up to the General Manager role. This structure ensures that an adequate succession plan exists within each store. Each management member handles various departments within the store including responsibility for hourly employees. A typical store employs approximately 120 hourly employees, most of whom work part time. The General Manager and the management team are responsible for the day-to-day operation of that store, including the hiring, training and development of team members, as well as financial and operational performance. Each store is overseen by a Regional Operations Manager, Regional Operations Director or Vice President of Operations (collectively, Regional Management) who directly or indirectly report to our Chief Operating Officer. Our stores are generally open seven days a week, from 11:30 a.m. to midnight on Sunday through Thursday and 11:30 a.m. to 2:00 a.m. on Friday and Saturday. 
Operational Tools and Programs 
 Our managers have daily routines focused on driving consistent execution in food, beverage and gaming. We utilize a customized food and beverage analysis program that determines the theoretical food and beverage costs for each store and provides additional tools and reports to help us identify opportunities, including waste management. In addition to our own routines, we leverage a third-party vendor to help ensure quality beverage operations, responsible alcohol service and loss prevention. A mobile salesmanship application with daily sales contests is used by our management team to evaluate sales performance by shift and to drive staff engagement. We have developed tools to forecast sales and schedule labor to assist our managers in optimizing hourly labor based on anticipated sales volumes. This program was enhanced during fiscal 2018 with the introduction of a new workforce management platform which offers real time data that allows management to quickly add or reduce labor based on business needs. Our amusement team uses a proprietary system that is supported by a mobile application that identifies gaming issues and needed repairs to help ensure our games are operational and meeting our ideal playing standard. Complementing this program is our routine preventative maintenance program, designed to prevent game failure and extend the functionality of our midway games. To maximize the performance of our new store openings, we have a New Store Gold Card process that defines a clear path and timeline to bring each new store in line with our established store efficiencies. Consolidated reporting tools for the key drivers of our business are provided to our Regional Management to identify and troubleshoot any systemic issues. 
Management Information Systems 
 We utilize a number of proprietary and third-party management information systems. These systems are designed to enable our games functionality, improve operating efficiencies, provide us with timely access to 
 
10 


  financial and marketing data and reduce store and corporate administrative time and expense. We believe our management information systems are sufficient to support our store expansion plans. 
 Training 
 We strive to maintain quality and consistency in each of our stores through the careful training and supervision of our team members and the establishment of, and adherence to, high standards relating to personnel performance, food and beverage preparation, game playability and maintenance of our stores. We provide all new team members with complete orientation and one-on-one training for their positions to help ensure they are able to meet our high standards. All of our new team members are trained by partnering with a certified trainer to assure that the training and information they receive is complete and accurate. Team members are certified for their positions by passing a series of tests, including alcohol awareness training. 
 We require our new store managers to complete an eight-week training program that includes front-of-house service, kitchen, amusements and management responsibilities. Newly trained managers are then assigned to their home store where they receive additional training with their General Manager. We place a high priority on our continuing management development programs in order to ensure that qualified managers are available for our future openings. We conduct semi-annual evaluations with each manager to discuss prior performance and future performance goals. We hold an annual General Manager conference in which our General Managers share best practices and also receive an update on our business plan. 
 When we open a new store, we provide varying levels of training to team members in each position to ensure the smooth and efficient operation of the store from the first day it opens to the public. Prior to opening a new store, our dedicated training and opening team travels to the store to prepare for an intensive two-week training program for all team members hired for the new store opening. Part of the training team stays on site during the first week of operation. We believe this additional investment in our new stores is important, because it helps us provide our customers with a quality experience from day one. 
 After a store has been opened and is operating smoothly, the store managers supervise the training of new team members. 
 Recruiting and Retention 
 We seek to hire experienced managers and team members and offer competitive wage and benefit programs. Our store managers all participate in a performance-based incentive program that is based on sales and profit goals. In addition, our salaried and hourly employees are also eligible to participate in a 401(k) plan, medical/dental/vision insurance plans and receive vacation/paid time off based on tenure. Additionally, General Managers are eligible for long-term incentive awards depending upon operating performance. 
Food Preparation, Quality Control and Purchasing 
 We strive to maintain high food quality standards. To ensure our quality standards are met, we negotiate directly with independent producers of food products. We provide detailed quality and yield specifications to suppliers for our purchases. Our systems are designed to protect the safety and quality of our food supply throughout the procurement and preparation process. Within each store, the Kitchen Manager is primarily responsible for ensuring the timely and correct preparation of food products, per the recipes we specify. We provide each of our stores with various tools and training to facilitate these activities. 
Foreign Operations 
 We own and operate two stores outside of the United States, in the Canadian province of Ontario, including one that opened during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. These stores generated revenues of approximately 
 
11 


  $18,848, $20,075 and $13,369 in fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, representing approximately 1.5%, 1.8%, and 1.3%, respectively, of our consolidated revenues. As of February 3, 2019, less than 2.0% of our long-lived assets were located outside of the United States. 
 The foreign activities of these stores are subject to various risks of doing business in a foreign country, including currency fluctuations, changes in laws and regulations and economic and political stability. We do not believe there is any material risk associated with the Canadian operations or any dependence by the domestic business upon the Canadian operations. 
 Store-Level Quarterly Fluctuations and Seasonality 
 Our operating results fluctuate significantly as a result of seasonal factors. Typically, we have higher revenues associated with the spring and year-end holidays, which will continue to be susceptible to the impact of severe or unseasonably mild weather on customer traffic and sales during that period. Our third quarter, which encompasses the back-to-school fall season, has historically had lower revenues as compared to other quarters. 
 Suppliers 
 The principal goods used by us are redemption game prizes and food and beverage products, which are available from a number of suppliers. We currently purchase a significant amount of our amusement merchandise through a direct import program, a program in which we purchase WIN! merchandise and certain glassware, plateware and furniture directly from offshore manufacturers. We are a large buyer of traditional and amusement games and as a result believe we receive discounted pricing arrangements. Federal and state health care mandates and mandated increases in the minimum wage and other macro-economic pressures could have the repercussion of increasing expenses, as suppliers may be adversely impacted and seek to pass on higher costs to us. 
Competition 
 The out-of-home entertainment market is highly competitive. We compete for customers discretionary entertainment dollars with providers of out-of-home entertainment, including localized attraction facilities such as movie theaters, sporting events, bowling alleys, sports activity centers, arcades and entertainment centers, night clubs and restaurants as well as theme parks. We also face competition from local, regional and national establishments that offer entertainment experiences similar to ours and restaurants that are highly competitive with respect to price, quality of service, location, ambience and type and quality of food. Some of these establishments may exist in multiple locations, and we may also face competition on a national basis in the future from other concepts that are similar to ours. We also face competition from increasingly sophisticated home-based forms of entertainment, such as internet and video gaming and home movie streaming and delivery. 
Intellectual Property 
 We have registered the trademarks Dave & Busters®, Power Card®, Eat & Play Combo®, Eat Drink Play®, and Eat Drink Play Watch®, and have registered or applied to register certain additional trademarks with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and in various foreign countries. We consider our tradename and our logo to be important features of our operations and seek to actively monitor and protect our interest in this property in the various jurisdictions where we operate. We also have certain trade secrets, such as our recipes, processes, proprietary information and certain software programs that we protect by requiring all of our employees to sign a code of ethics, which includes an agreement to keep trade secrets confidential. 
Employees 
 As of February 3, 2019, we employed 16,098 persons, 285 of whom served at our corporate headquarters, 1,219 of whom served as management personnel and the remainder of whom were hourly personnel.

 None of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements and we have never experienced an organized work stoppage, strike or labor dispute. We believe working conditions and compensation packages are competitive with those offered by competitors and consider our relations with our employees to be good.
