ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

Unless the context otherwise requires, the terms “Company,” “Patrick,” “we,” “our,” or “us” refer to Patrick Industries, Inc. and its subsidiaries.
Company Overview
Patrick Industries, Inc. was founded in 1959 and incorporated in the state of Indiana in 1961. Patrick is a major manufacturer of component products and distributor of building products and materials serving original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) primarily in the recreational vehicle (“RV”), manufactured housing (“MH”) and marine 
3

markets. The Company also supplies products to adjacent industrial markets, such as kitchen cabinet, office and household furniture, fixtures and commercial furnishings, and other industrial markets. 
The Company operates through a nationwide network that includes, as of December 31, 2018, 107 manufacturing plants and 42 warehouse and distribution facilities located in 22 states, China, Canada and the Netherlands. The Company operates within two reportable segments, Manufacturing and Distribution, through a nationwide network of manufacturing and distribution centers for its products, thereby reducing in-transit delivery time and cost to the regional manufacturing footprint of its customers. The Manufacturing and Distribution segments accounted for 77% and 23% of the Company’s consolidated net sales for 2018, respectively. Financial information about these operating segments is included in Note 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (the "Form 10-K") and incorporated herein by reference. 
The Company’s strategic and capital allocation strategy is to optimally manage and utilize its resources and leverage its platform of operating brands to continue to grow and reinvest in its business. Through strategic acquisitions, geographic expansion, expansion into new product lines and investment in infrastructure and capital expenditures, Patrick seeks to ensure that its operating network contains capacity, technology and innovative thought processes to support anticipated growth needs, effectively respond to changes in market conditions, inventory and sales levels, and successfully integrate manufacturing, distribution and administrative functions.
Over the last three years, the Company has executed on a number of new product initiatives and invested approximately $734 million to complete 23 acquisitions involving 34 companies, which directly complement its core competencies and existing product lines as well as expand its presence in the marine industry. The combination of improved economic conditions and demographic trends benefiting the RV, MH and marine industries and the execution of the strategic initiatives identified above, among others, resulted in increases in sales, operating income, net income and cash flows over the last several years. 
The Company’s principal executive and administrative offices are located at 107 West Franklin Street, Elkhart, Indiana 46515 and the telephone number is (574) 294-7511; Internet website address: www.patrickind.com. The information on Patrick's website is not incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K. The Company makes available free of charge through the website, its Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and all amendments to those reports filed with the SEC as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC.

Recreational Vehicles
The RV industry experienced a decline in wholesale unit shipments in 2018 following eight straight years of growth as RV OEMs continued to adjust their production levels in tandem with the rebalancing of dealer inventories in the retail marketplace. According to the Recreation Vehicle Industry Association ("RVIA"), total RV industry wholesale shipments fell 4% compared to 2017, with shipments reaching a total of 483,672 units, the second highest annual total since 1973. The principal types of recreational vehicles include (1) towables: conventional travel trailers, fifth wheels, folding camping trailers, and truck campers; and (2) motorized: motor homes. The Company estimates that its mix of RV revenues related to towable units and motorized units is consistent with the overall RV industry production mix. In 2018, towable and motorized unit shipments represented approximately 88% and 12%, respectively, of total RV industry wholesale shipments. The towable sector decreased 4% in 2018 compared to the prior year and the motorized sector decreased 8% per the RVIA.
The Company’s RV products are sold primarily to major manufacturers of RVs, smaller OEMs, and to a lesser extent, manufacturers in adjacent industries. The RV market is primarily dominated by Thor Industries, Inc. (“Thor”) and Forest River, Inc. (“Forest River”) which combined held 84% of retail market share for towables and 61% for motorized units as reported per Statistical Surveys, Inc. ("SSI") for 2018.
Recreational vehicle purchases are generally consumer discretionary income purchases, and therefore, any situation which causes concerns related to discretionary income can have a negative impact on this market. The Company believes that industry-wide retail sales and the related production levels of RVs will continue to be dependent on the overall strength of the economy, consumer confidence levels, equity securities market trends, fluctuations in dealer inventories, the level of disposable income, and other demographic trends. 
Demographic and ownership trends continue to point to favorable market growth in the long term, as there is a shift toward outdoor, nature-based tourism activities, with a large segment of the population’s “millennials” embracing this outdoor lifestyle and entering into the RV marketplace. Per the 2018 KOA North American Camping Report, 40% of all campers are millennials, and 23% or 19 million, of the 83 million millennials in the United States ("U.S.") consider themselves to be highly-likely RV buyers. In addition, the number of “baby-boomers” reaching retirement age is steadily increasing, and the RV owning population in the 35-54 year-old demographic continues to grow. 
Detailed narrative information about the Company’s sales to the RV industry is included in Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” (the "MD&A") of this Form 10-K. 
Marine 
The marine industry reflects the similar active, outdoor leisure-based, family-oriented lifestyle that characterizes the RV industry and the Company has increased its focus and expanded its presence in the adjacent marine market through recent acquisitions and organic growth, particularly within the last three years. Consumer demand in the marine market is generally driven by the popularity of the recreational and leisure lifestyle and by economic conditions.
The Company’s sales to the marine industry are primarily focused on the powerboat sector of the market which is comprised of four main categories: fiberglass, aluminum, pontoon and ski & wake. Based on current available data per SSI, marine powerboat retail unit shipments increased 2% in 2018 compared to 2017, marking the eighth consecutive year of growth in new boat shipments. Detailed narrative information about the Company’s sales to the marine industry is included in the MD&A of this Form 10-K.
Manufactured Housing
The Company’s manufactured housing products are sold primarily to major manufacturers of manufactured homes, other OEMs, and to a lesser extent, to manufacturers in adjacent industries. In the aggregate, the top three manufacturers produced approximately 79% of MH market retail unit shipments in 2018 per SSI.

Although wholesale unit shipments have increased in the MH industry from a low of approximately 49,800 units in 2009 to 96,540 units in 2018, they are still trending well below historical levels. The Company believes there is significant upside potential for this market in the long term driven by pent-up demand, multi-family housing capacity, improving consumer credit and financing conditions, residential housing market conditions, higher consumer confidence levels, increased affordability and quality, demographic trends such as first time home buyers and those looking to downsize, new home pricing, and improved consumer savings levels. 
Factors that may favorably impact production levels further in this industry include improving quality credit standards in the residential housing market, new jobs growth, consumer confidence, favorable changes in financing regulations, a narrowing in the difference between interest rates on MH loans and mortgages on traditional residential "stick-built" housing, and any improvement in conditions in the asset-backed securities markets for manufactured housing loans.
Detailed narrative information about the Company’s sales to the MH industry is included in the MD&A of this Form 10-K. 
Industrial Markets
The Company estimates that approximately 60% of its industrial net sales in 2018 were associated with the U.S. residential housing market. The Company believes that there is a direct correlation between the demand for its products in this market and new residential housing construction and remodeling activities. Patrick's sales to the industrial market generally lag new housing starts by six to nine months and will vary based on differences in regional economic prospects. 
Many of Patrick's core manufacturing products are also utilized in the kitchen cabinet, office and household furniture, hospitality, and fixtures and commercial furnishings markets.  These markets are generally categorized by a more performance-than-price driven customer base, and provide an opportunity for the Company to diversify its customer base. Additionally, other residential and commercial segments have been less vulnerable to import competition, and therefore, provide opportunities for increased sales penetration and market share gains. Over the past three years, the residential housing market in particular has shown signs of improvement across the country and that trend is expected to continue in 2019, albeit at a more modest level.
Detailed narrative information about the Company’s sales to the industrial markets is included in the MD&A of this Form 10-K. 
Strategic Acquisitions
The Company is focused on driving growth in each of its primary markets through the acquisition of companies with strong management teams having a strategic fit with Patrick’s core values, business model and customer presence, as well as additional product lines, facilities, or other assets to complement or expand its existing businesses. The Company may explore strategic acquisition opportunities that are not directly tied to the four primary markets it serves in order to further leverage its core competencies in manufacturing and distribution and to diversify its end market exposure and presence.
In 2018, the Company invested approximately $337.6 million to complete nine acquisitions involving 13 companies. See the MD&A for a description of the 2018 acquisitions and Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the acquisitions completed by the Company in 2018, 2017 and 2016. 
Competition
The RV, MH, marine and industrial markets are highly competitive, both among manufacturers and the suppliers of various components. The barriers to entry for each industry are generally low and include compliance with industry standards, codes and safety requirements, and the initial capital investment required to establish manufacturing operations. In addition, the Company competes with manufacturers of manufactured homes with vertically 
7

integrated operations. Across the Company’s range of products and services, competition exists primarily on price, product features and innovation, timely and reliable delivery, quality and customer service. Several competitors compete with Patrick in each product line on a regional and local basis. However, in order for a competitor to compete with Patrick on a national basis, the Company believes that a substantial capital commitment and investment in personnel and facilities would be required. 
Capacity and Plant Expansions
Patrick has the ability to fulfill demand for certain products in excess of capacity at certain facilities by shifting production to other facilities. Capital expenditures for 2018 consisted of $34.5 million of investments to replace and upgrade production equipment, expand facilities outside of core Midwest markets to align with OEM expansions, increase capacity, and provide more advanced manufacturing automation. Management regularly monitors capacity at its facilities and reallocates existing resources where needed to maintain production efficiencies throughout all of its operations and capitalize on commercial and industrial synergies in key regions to support profitable growth, grow its customer base, and expand its geographical product reach outside its core Midwest market. 
Branding 
New product development is a key component of the Company’s efforts to grow its market share and revenue base, adapt to changing market conditions, and proactively address customer demand. The Company has expanded its product and service offerings with the integration of new and innovative product lines into its operations that bring additional value to customers and create additional scale advantages. 
The Studio
The Company's Design/Innovation Center and Showroom, The Studio, is located in Elkhart, Indiana. The Studio presents the latest design trends and products in the markets served by Patrick, and provides a creative environment for customers to design products and enhance their brand. The 45,000 square foot facility includes a 25,000 square foot showroom devoted to the display of products, capabilities and services offered by each of Patrick’s business units, in addition to offices and conference rooms. The Company’s specialized team of designers, engineers and graphic artists works with RV, MH, marine and industrial customers to meet their creative design and product needs, including creating new styles and utilizing new colors, patterns, products, and wood types for panels and mouldings, cabinet doors, furniture, lighting and other products. Other services provided at The Studio include product development, 3D CAD illustration, 3D printing, photography and marketing.
Operating Brands
Through its operating brands, the Company provides customers with specific product knowledge, expertise and support that is tailored to their needs. The Company strives to be the supplier of choice for its customers by elevating the customer purchasing experience with expert product line managers, and support staff and strategic partnerships for each operating brand, which help drive efficiency and maximize value for its customers.
Patrick has no material patents, licenses, franchises, or concessions and does not conduct significant research and development activities.
Marketing and Distribution
As of December 31, 2018, the Company had over 2,400 active customers. Its revenues from the RV market include sales to two major manufacturers of RVs that each account for over 10% of the Company's net sales, Forest River and Thor. Both Forest River and Thor have multiple businesses and brands that operate independently under the parent company and these multiple businesses and brands purchase our products independently from one another. The Company’s sales to the various businesses of Forest River and Thor, on a combined basis, accounted for 49% and 57% of our consolidated net sales, for the years ended December 31, 2018, and 2017, respectively.

The Company generally maintains supplies of various commodity products in its warehouses to ensure that it has product on hand at all times for its distribution customers. The Company purchases a majority of its distribution segment products in railcar, container, or truckload quantities, which are warehoused prior to their sale to customers. Approximately 15% and 19% of the Company's distribution segment’s sales were from products shipped directly from the suppliers to Patrick customers in 2018 and 2017, respectively. Typically there is a one to two-week period between Patrick receiving a purchase order and the delivery of products to its warehouses or customers and, as a result, the Company has no significant backlog of orders. In periods of declining market conditions, customer order rates can decline, resulting in less efficient logistics planning and fulfillment and thus increasing delivery costs due to increased numbers of shipments with fewer products in each shipment. 
Raw Materials
Patrick has arrangements with certain suppliers that specify exclusivity in certain geographic areas, pricing structures and rebate agreements among other terms. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company purchased approximately 37% of its raw materials and distributed products from 20 different suppliers. The five largest suppliers accounted for approximately 16% of the Company's total purchases. 
Raw materials are primarily commodity products, such as lauan, gypsum, particleboard and other lumber products, aluminum, resin, fiberglass and overlays, among others which are available from many suppliers. Our customers do not maintain long-term supply contracts, and therefore, the Company bears the risk of accurate forecasting of customer orders. Its sales in the short-term could be negatively impacted in the event any unforeseen negative circumstances were to affect its major suppliers. In addition, demand changes in certain market sectors can result in fluctuating costs of certain more commodity-oriented raw materials and other products that are utilized and distributed. 
The Company continually explores alternative sources of raw materials and components, both domestically and from outside the U.S. Alternate sources of supply are available for all of its material purchases. 
Regulation and Environmental Quality
The Company’s operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations administered by federal, state, and local regulatory authorities including requirements relating to air, water and noise pollution. Additionally, these requirements regulate the Company's use, storage, discharge and disposal of hazardous chemicals used or generated during specific manufacturing processes.
Select products are subject to various legally binding or voluntary standards. For example, the composite wood substrate materials that Patrick uses to produce products for its customers in the RV marketplace have been certified as to compliance with applicable emission standards developed by the California Air Resources Board (“CARB”). All suppliers and manufacturers of composite wood materials are required to comply with the current CARB regulations.
The Company is certified to sell Forestry Stewardship Council (“FSC”) materials to its customers at certain of its manufacturing branches. The FSC certification provides a link between responsible production and consumption of materials from the world’s forests and it assists the Company’s customers in making socially and environmentally responsible buying decisions on the products they purchase.
Upholstered products and mattresses provided by the Company for RVs must comply with Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards regulated by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration regarding flammability.
The Company also produces and provides products for manufactured homes that must comply with performance and construction regulations promulgated by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (“HUD”).

Seasonality
Manufacturing operations in the RV, marine and MH industries historically have been seasonal and at their highest levels when the weather is moderate. Accordingly, the Company’s sales and profits had generally been the highest in the second quarter and lowest in the fourth quarter. Seasonal industry trends in the past several years have included the impact related to the addition of major RV manufacturer open houses for dealers in the August/September timeframe, resulting in dealers delaying certain restocking purchases until new product lines are introduced at these shows. In addition, current and future seasonal industry trends may be different than in prior years due to the impact of national and regional economic conditions and consumer confidence on retail sales of RVs and other products for which the Company sells its components, timing of dealer orders, fluctuations in dealer inventories, and from time to time, the impact of severe weather conditions on the timing of industry-wide wholesale shipments. 
Employees
At December 31, 2018, we had 8,113 employees. The Company believes its relations with its employees are good. The Company is not subject to any collective bargaining agreements with its employees.
