Item 1. Business
Overview
 
FingerMotion Inc. (the “Company,” “we,” “us,” “our” or “FingerMotion”) is a US fintech company incorporated in Delaware, USA, with its corporate offices in New York, NY. FingerMotion previously operated as a mobile video gaming platform business and as the Company attempted to increase its market share, it discovered new opportunities in the Peoples’ Republic of China (“China” or the “PRC”) requiring only slight modifications to the existing infrastructure.
 
FingerMotion ventured into the telecommunications industry by offering Mobile Payment and Recharge services in the China market, beginning in September 2018. Chinese mobile phone consumers often utilize third-party e-marketing websites to pay their phone bills. If the consumer connected directly to the telecommunications provider to pay his or her bill, the consumer would miss out on any benefits or marketing discounts that e-marketers provide. Thus, consumers log on to these emarketers’ websites, click into their respective phone provider’s store, and “top up,” or pay, their telecommunications provider for additional mobile data and talk time.
 
To connect to the respective mobile telecommunications providers, these e-marketers must utilize a portal licensed by the applicable telecommunication company that processes the payment. We have been granted one of these licenses by China United Network Communications Group Co., Ltd. (“China Unicom”) and China Mobile Communications Corporation (“China Mobile”), each of which is a major telecommunications provider in China. We principally earn revenue by providing mobile payment and recharge services to customers of China Unicom and China Mobile.
 
FingerMotion started and commercialized its “Business to Business” (“B2B”) model by integrating with various e-commerce platforms to provide its Mobile Payment and Recharge services to subscribers or end consumers. In the first quarter of 2019, FingerMotion expanded its business by commercializing its first “Business to Consumer” (“B2C”) model, offering Mobile Payment and Recharge services directly to subscribers or customers of the e-commerce company, PinDuoDuo (“PDD”). FingerMotion is planning to further expand its Recharge platform by setting up “B2C” stores on several other major e-commerce platforms in China.
 
We believe FingerMotion’s ability to offer reliable and efficient Mobile Payment and Recharge services, while providing a high level of customer service, will help solidify the industry’s reliance on the FingerMotion brand.
 
For scale, China’s top-up market’s gross transaction volume (GTV) is estimated at US$22 billion monthly. FingerMotion’s GTV for February was US$42 million and US$56 million for March. This translated into revenues of US$210,000 and US$280,000, respectively (50 basis points or $0.50 for every $100).
 
For the Company to continue to grow, the deposit with the telecommunications companies needs to increase, as the GTV processed by the Company is dependent on the size of the deposit residing with each telecom. And since the telecom companies, China Unicom and China Mobile, are AAA-rated and monitored by the government, FingerMotion retains comfort in its deposits by dealing with financially strong and reputable partners.
 
FingerMotion has initiated other significant revenue streams that are less capital-intensive but could provide greater profits albeit at lower volumes. FingerMotion’s relationship with the telecom companies allows it to acquire bulk SMS bundles at reduced prices, which it can pass along to various clientele. The Company has recently secured the SMS contracts for several enterprise clients including premium car manufacturers, hotel chains and e-commerce companies.
 
Corporate Information
 
The Company was initially incorporated as Property Management Corporation of America on January 23, 2014 in Delaware.
 
On June 21, 2017, the Company amended its certificate of incorporation to effect a 1-for-4 reverse stock split of the Company’s common stock, to increase the authorized shares of common stock to 200,000,000 and to change the name of the Company from Property Management Corporation of America to FingerMotion, Inc. (the “Corporate Actions”). The Corporate Actions and the amended certificate of incorporation became effective on June 21, 2017.

Effective July 13, 2017, the Company entered into that certain Share Exchange Agreement (the “Share Exchange Agreement”) by and among the Company, Finger Motion Company Limited, a Hong Kong corporation (“FMCL”) and certain shareholders of FMCL (the “FMCL Shareholders”). Pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement, the Company agreed to exchange the outstanding equity stock of FMCL held by the FMCL Shareholders for shares of common stock of the Company. On the closing date of the Share Exchange Agreement, the Company issued approximately 12,000,000 shares of common stock to the FMCL shareholders. In addition, the Company issued 600,000 shares to consultants in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Share Exchange Agreement, and 2,562,500 additional shares to accredited investors.
 
As a result of the Share Exchange Agreement and the other transactions contemplated thereunder, FMCL became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. FMCL, a Hong Kong corporation, was formed on April 6, 2016 and is an information technology company that specializes in operating and publishing mobile games. We operate our video game division through FMCL.
 
On October 16, 2018, the Company, through its indirect wholly owned subsidiary, Shanghai JiuGe Business Management Co., Ltd. (“JiuGe Management”), entered into a series of agreements known as variable interest agreements (the “VIE Agreements”) pursuant to which Shanghai JiuGe Information Technology Co., Ltd. (“JiuGe Technology”) became our contractually controlled affiliate. The use of VIE agreements is a common structure used to acquire PRC corporations, particularly in certain industries in which foreign investment is restricted or forbidden by the PRC government. The VIE Agreements include a Consulting Services Agreement, a Loan Agreement, a Power of Attorney Agreement, a Call Option Agreement, and a Share Pledge Agreement in order to secure the connection and commitments of the JiuGe Technology. We operate our mobile payment platform business through JiuGe Technology.
 
Our principal executive offices are located at 1460 Broadway, New York, New York 10036, and our telephone number at that address is (347) 349-5339.
 
Our Video Game Division
 
The video game industry covers multiple sectors and is currently experiencing a move away from physical games towards digital software. Advances in technology and streaming now allow users to download games rather than visiting retailers. Video game publishers are expanding their direct-to-consumer channels with mobile gaming, the current growth leader, and eSports and virtual reality gaining momentum as the next big sectors.
 
FMCL secured a strategic alliance with Games Development Studio in China to design and develop games for the Company. To date, we have three games licenses and the licenses cover worldwide distribution rights (except China). The two current game genres are Action Role Playing Games and the other is Simulated Life Game.
 
In June 2018, FMCL temporarily paused its publishing and operating plans for existing games, and the Company’s board of directors decided to re-focus the company’s resources into new business opportunities in China, particularly the mobile phone payment and data business.
 
Our Mobile Payment Platform
 
As noted above, we conduct our mobile payment business through JiuGe Techology, which became our contractually controlled affiliate through the VIE Agreements in October 2018. The use of VIE agreements is a common structure used to acquire PRC corporations, particularly in certain industries in which foreign investment is restricted or forbidden by the PRC government. The VIE Agreements included:

● | a Consulting Services Agreement through which JiuGe Management is mainly engaged in data marketing, technical services, technical consulting and business consultancy to JiuGe Technology;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | a Loan Agreement through which JiuGe Management grants a loan to JiuGe Technology for the purpose of capital contribution;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | a Power of Attorney Agreement under which the owners of JiuGe Technology have vested their collective voting control over JiuGe Technology to JiuGe Management and will only transfer their equity interests in JiuGe Technology to JiuGe Management or its designee(s);
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | a Call Option Agreement under which the owners of JiuGe Technology have granted to JiuGe Management the irrevocable and unconditional right and option to acquire all of their equity interests in JiuGe Technology or transfer these rights to a third party; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | a Share Pledge Agreement under which the owners of JiuGe Technology have pledged all of their rights, titles and interests in JiuGe Technology to JiuGe Management to guarantee JiuGe Technology’s performance of its obligations under the Consulting Services Agreement.

In September, JiuGe Technology launched and commercialized mobile payment and recharge services to businesses for China Unicom. The JiuGe Technology mobile payment and recharge platform enables the seamless delivery of real-time payment and recharge services to third-party channels and businesses. We earn a negotiated rebate amount from each of China Unicom and China Mobile for all monies paid by consumers to China Unicom and China Mobile that we process. To encourage consumers to utilize our portal instead of using our competitors’ platforms or paying China Unicom or China Mobile directly, we offer mobile data and talk time at a rate discounted from these companies’ stated rates, which are also the rates we must pay to them to purchase the mobile data and talk time provided to consumers through the use of our platform. Accordingly, we earn income on the rebates we receive from the telecommunications companies, reduced by the amounts by which we discount the mobile data and talk time sold through our platform.
 
Competition
 
Our industry is highly competitive, rapidly changing, highly innovative and increasingly subject to regulatory scrutiny and oversight. We compete against a wide range of businesses, including those that are larger than we are, have a dominant and secure position or offer other products and services to consumers and merchants that we do not offer. We believe we are in an advantageous position compared to many of our competitors or potential competitors because we have been granted a license to act as an authorized processor of payments in China for China Unicom and China Mobile.
 
Our mobile payments business competes principally against two alternatives. First, we compete directly with other holders of licenses from the major mobile telecommunications providers in China. We understand there are a limited number of these licenses, but believe that certain other license holders are large, diversified companies with deep financial resources. We also compete with payment processors that are not authorized licensees of the mobile telecommunications companies but nevertheless provide similar services. Separately, and more generally, we compete with all forms and methods of paying for additional data and minutes, including credit and debit cards, other electronic payment platforms and bank transfers.
 
Because we have been awarded a contract to process payments for China Unicom and China Mobile and are therefore able to offer services directly to market with value added services, we believe the Company is in an advanced position as compared to its competition. We look to take advantage of the position that we have been afforded.
 
Intellectual Property
 
FingerMotion has sufficient intellectual property rights to operate its Mobile Payment and Recharge platform system. The Company will continue to enhance the system to meet market and consumer demands and requirements.
Regulation
 
We operate in a rapidly evolving regulatory environment characterized by a heightened regulatory focus on all aspects of the payments industry. That focus continues to become even more heightened as regulators on a global basis focus on such important issues as countering terrorist financing, anti-money laundering, privacy, cybersecurity and consumer protection. Some of the laws and regulations to which we are subject were enacted recently, and the laws and regulations applicable to us, including those enacted prior to the advent of digital and mobile payments, are continuing to evolve through legislative and regulatory action and judicial interpretation. New or changing laws and regulations, including how such laws and regulations are interpreted and implemented, as well as increased penalties and enforcement actions related to non-compliance, could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Therefore, as we grow, we will need to develop the capacity to monitor these areas closely to design compliant solutions for our customers who depend on us.
 
Government regulation impacts key aspects of our business. We are subject to regulations that affect the payments industry in the markets in which we operate.

Payments Regulation. Various laws and regulations govern the payments industry in China, where our mobile recharge platform principally operates. Our activities in this regard are, or may be, supervised by one or more financial regulatory authorities, including the People’s Bank of China. Other national or provincial regulatory agencies may have or assert jurisdiction over our activities, including agencies and authorities outside of China, if our platform is utilized by consumers in such jurisdictions. The laws and regulations applicable to the payments industry in any given jurisdiction are subject to interpretation and change.
 
Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing. FingerMotion is subject to anti-money laundering (“AML”) laws and regulations in China, the U.S. and other jurisdictions, as well as laws designed to prevent the use of the financial systems to facilitate terrorist activities. As we grow our business, we will need to develop an AML program designed to prevent our payment network from being used to facilitate money laundering, terrorist financing, and other illicit activities, or to do business in countries or with persons and entities included on designated country or person lists promulgated by the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Controls (“OFAC”) and equivalent authorities in China and other countries whose jurisdiction we may become subject as a result of our operations. Any AML and sanctions compliance program we put in place will need to involve policies, procedures and internal controls designed to address these legal and regulatory requirements and assist in managing money laundering and terrorist financing risks.
 
Data Protection and Information Security. Aspects of our operations or business may be subject to privacy and data protection regulation in China, the U.S. and elsewhere. In the U.S., we are subject to privacy information safeguarding requirements under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act that require the maintenance of a written, comprehensive information security program, among other laws. Regulatory authorities around the world are considering numerous legislative and regulatory proposals concerning privacy and data protection that may contain additional privacy and data protection obligations than exist today. In addition, the interpretation and application of these privacy and data protection laws in China, the U.S. and elsewhere are often uncertain and in a state of flux.
 
Anti-Corruption. FingerMotion is subject to applicable anti-corruption laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, and similar anti-corruption laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Anti-corruption laws generally prohibit offering, promising, giving, accepting or authorizing others to provide anything of value, either directly or indirectly, to or from a government official or private party in order to influence official action or otherwise gain an unfair business advantage, such as to obtain or retain business. We have implemented policies, procedures and internal controls that are designed to comply with these laws and regulations.
 
Additional Regulatory Developments. Various regulatory agencies continue to examine a wide variety of issues, including virtual currencies, identity theft, account management guidelines, privacy, disclosure rules, cybersecurity and marketing that may impact the Company’s business.
Compliance with Environmental Laws
 
Compliance with foreign, federal, state and local laws that have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, have not had a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position.
Employees
 
As of February 28, 2019, we had 28 total employees, of whom 25 were full time. We have approximately 25 employees in China, 2 employees in Malaysia and 1 employee in Canada. We believe that we enjoy good relations with our employees.
