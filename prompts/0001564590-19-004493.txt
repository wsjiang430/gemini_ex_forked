Overview
 We are a growth-oriented limited partnership focused on developing, owning and operating midstream energy infrastructure assets that are strategically located in the core producing areas of unconventional resource basins, primarily shale formations, in the continental United States. Our systems gather natural gas from pad sites, wells and central receipt points connected to our systems. Gathered natural gas volumes are then compressed, dehydrated, treated and/or processed for delivery to downstream pipelines serving processing plants and/or end users. We also contract with producers to gather crude oil and produced water from wells connected to our systems for delivery to downstream pipelines and third-party rail terminals in the case of crude oil and to third-party disposal wells in the case of produced water. We generally refer to all of the services our systems provide as gathering services.
 We classify our midstream energy infrastructure assets into two categories:
  
• | Core Focus Areas – production basins in which we expect our gathering systems to experience greater long-term growth, driven by our customers’ ability to generate more favorable returns and support sustained drilling and completion activity in varying commodity price environments. In the near-term, we expect to concentrate the majority of our capital expenditures in our Core Focus Areas. Our Utica Shale, Ohio Gathering, Williston Basin, DJ Basin and Permian Basin reportable segments (as described below) comprise our Core Focus Areas.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Legacy Areas – production basins in which we expect our gathering systems to experience relatively lower long-term growth compared to our Core Focus Areas, given that our customers require relatively higher commodity prices to support drilling and completion activities in these basins. Upstream production served by our gathering systems in our Legacy Areas is generally more mature, as compared to our Core Focus Areas, and the decline rates for volume throughput on our gathering systems in the Legacy Areas are typically lower as a result. We expect to continue to moderate our near-term capital expenditures in these Legacy Areas. Our Piceance Basin, Barnett Shale and Marcellus Shale reportable segments (as described below) comprise our Legacy Areas.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We are the owner-operator of, or have significant ownership interests in, the following gathering systems, which comprise our Core Focus Areas:

--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Summit Permian, an associated natural gas gathering and processing system in the northern Delaware Basin, which includes the Bone Spring and Wolfcamp formations, in southeastern New Mexico.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We are the owner-operator of the following gathering systems, which comprise our Legacy Areas:
  
• | Grand River, a natural gas gathering and processing system located in the Piceance Basin, which includes the Mesaverde formation and the Mancos and Niobrara shale formations in western Colorado and eastern Utah;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | DFW Midstream, a natural gas gathering system operating in the Fort Worth Basin, which includes the Barnett Shale formation in north-central Texas; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Mountaineer Midstream, a natural gas gathering system operating in the Appalachian Basin, which includes the Marcellus Shale formation in northern West Virginia.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The systems that we operate and/or have significant ownership interests in have a diverse group of customers and counterparties comprising affiliates and/or subsidiaries of some of the largest natural gas and crude oil producers in North America. 
 Key customers in our Core Focus Areas are as follows:
  
• | Utica Shale – XTO Energy Inc. ("XTO") and Ascent Resources - Utica, LLC ("Ascent") are the key customers for Summit Utica.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Ohio Gathering – Ascent and Gulfport Energy Corporation ("Gulfport") are the key customers for Ohio Gathering;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Williston Basin – Whiting Petroleum Corp. ("Whiting") and Zavanna, LLC (“Zavanna”) are the key customers for Polar and Divide. Oasis Petroleum, Inc. ("Oasis") and a large U.S. independent crude oil and natural gas company, are the key customers for Bison Midstream. Hess Corp. (“Hess”) is the key customer for Tioga Midstream.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | DJ Basin – HighPoint Resources Corporation ("HighPoint") and a large U.S. independent crude oil and natural gas company are the key customers for Niobrara G&P.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Permian Basin – XTO is the key customer for Summit Permian.
--+------------------------------------------------------------

 We believe that our gathering systems in the Core Focus Areas are positioned for long-term growth through further development by our customers and increased utilization of our gathering systems. We intend to continue expanding our operations and creating additional scale in our Core Focus Areas through the execution of new, and the expansion of existing, strategic partnerships with our existing and prospective customers.
 Key customers in our Legacy Areas are as follows:
  
• | Piceance Basin – Caerus Oil & Gas LLC ("Caerus") and Terra Energy Partners LLC ("Terra") are the key customers for Grand River.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Barnett Shale – Total Gas & Power North America, Inc. ("Total") is the key customer for DFW Midstream.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 8


 
• | Marcellus Shale – Antero Resources Corp. ("Antero") is the key customer for Mountaineer Midstream.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We believe that our customers in our Legacy Areas will pursue a slower pace of drilling and completion activity than customers in our Core Focus Areas. As a result, volume throughput in our Legacy Areas could experience a lower rate of growth than our gathering systems in our Core Focus Areas or volume declines. In general, our gathering systems in our Legacy Areas have larger and longer-lived MVCs and experience lower volume throughput decline rates as compared to our gathering systems in our Core Focus Areas. We may also consider divestitures of certain of our lower growth gathering systems included in our Core Focus Areas or our Legacy Areas, which could result in a reallocation of capital or other resources to our Core Focus Areas. For example, in February 2019, SMLP announced that it had executed definitive agreements with Hess Infrastructure Partners LP and one of its affiliates (collectively, “Hess Infrastructure”) related to the sale of Tioga Midstream for cash consideration of $90 million, subject to adjustment.
 Our financial results are primarily driven by volume throughput across our gathering systems and by expense management. During 2018, aggregate natural gas volume throughput averaged 1,673 MMcf/d and crude oil and produced water volume throughput averaged 94.9 Mbbl/d. A majority of the volumes that we gather, treat and/or process have a fixed-fee rate structure which enhances the stability of our cash flows by providing a revenue stream that is not directly subject to fluctuations in commodity prices. Activities that expose us directly to commodity prices include (i) the sale of physical natural gas and/or NGLs purchased under percentage-of-proceeds arrangements with certain of our customers on the Bison Midstream and Grand River systems, (ii) natural gas and crude oil marketing services in and around our gathering systems, (iii) the sale of natural gas we retain from certain DFW Midstream customers and (iv) the sale of condensate we retain from our gathering services at Grand River. These additional activities, including marketing transactions comprised of buy and sell arrangements, directly expose us to fluctuations in commodity prices and accounted for approximately 27% of total revenues during the year ended December 31, 2018. These additional activities, excluding marketing transactions comprised of buy and sell arrangements, accounted for approximately 11% of total revenues during the year ended December 31, 2018. 
 In addition, the vast majority of our gathering and/or processing agreements in both our Core Focus Areas and our Legacy Areas include AMIs. Our AMIs cover approximately 3.3 million surface acres in the aggregate, which includes more than 0.8 million surface acres associated with Ohio Gathering. Certain of our gathering and processing agreements also include MVCs. To the extent the customer does not meet its MVC, it must make an MVC shortfall payment to cover the shortfall of required volume throughput not shipped or processed, either on a monthly, annual or multi-year basis. We have designed our MVC provisions to ensure that we will generate a certain amount of revenue from each customer over the life of the associated gathering and/or processing agreement, whether by collecting gathering or processing fees on actual throughput or from cash payments to cover any MVC shortfall. As of December 31, 2018, we had remaining MVCs totaling 2.2 Tcfe. Our MVCs have a weighted-average remaining life of 6.4 years (assuming contracted minimum volume commitments for the remainder of the term) and average approximately 1.0 Bcfe/d through 2023. 
 We use a variety of financial and operational metrics to analyze our performance, including among others, throughput volume, revenues, operation and maintenance expenses and segment adjusted EBITDA. We view each of these operational and/or GAAP metrics as important factors in evaluating our profitability and determining the amount of cash distributions we pay to our unitholders.
 For additional information on our results of operations, see Item 6. Selected Financial Data and the "Results of Operations" section included in the Item 7. MD&A.
 Our Sponsor and Summit Investments.  Energy Capital Partners, together with its affiliated funds, is a private equity firm with over $19.0 billion in capital commitments that is focused on investing in North America's energy infrastructure. Energy Capital Partners has significant energy and financial expertise to complement its investment in us, including investments in the power generation, midstream oil and gas, electric transmission, energy equipment and services, environmental infrastructure and other energy-related sectors.
 Summit Investments, which was formed in 2009 by members of our management team and our Sponsor, is the ultimate owner of our General Partner. We are managed and operated by the Board of Directors and executive 
 9


officers of our General Partner, which is managed and operated by Summit Investments. As a result, due to its ownership interest in Summit Investments and its representation on Summit Investments' board of managers, Energy Capital Partners controls our General Partner and its activities, thereby controlling SMLP.
 Recent Developments
 On February 26, 2019, we announced our execution of the following agreements:
  
• | Purchase and sale agreements with Hess Infrastructure pursuant to which SMLP agreed to sell Tioga Midstream for $90 million, subject to adjustment (“Tioga PSAs”).
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | An amendment to the Contribution Agreement (the “Amendment”) related to the 2016 Drop Down pursuant to which the Partnership shall make a cash payment of $100 million to SMP Holdings. Following the closing of the Amendment, the Remaining Consideration will be fixed at $303.5 million, and will be payable by the Partnership in one or more payments over the period from March 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020, payable in (i) cash, (ii) the Partnership’s common units or (iii) a combination of cash and the Partnership’s common units, at the discretion of the Partnership. No less than 50% of the Remaining Consideration shall be paid on or before June 30, 2020 and interest shall accrue at a rate of 8% per annum on any portion of the Remaining Consideration that remains unpaid after March 31, 2020.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | An equity restructuring agreement with the General Partner and SMP Holdings (the “Equity Restructuring Agreement”) pursuant to which the IDRs and the 2% general partner interest held by the General Partner will be converted into 8,750,000 common units and a non-economic general partner interest (the “Equity Restructuring” and collectively with the Tioga PSAs and the Amendment, the “February 2019 Transactions”).
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The February 2019 Transactions are expected to close before the end of the first quarter of 2019, subject to customary closing conditions. Immediately following the closing of the Equity Restructuring Agreement, SMP Holdings will directly own a 42.1% limited partner interest in SMLP and an affiliate of Energy Capital Partners II, LLC will directly own a 7.2% limited partner interest in SMLP. In connection with the February 2019 Transactions, the Partnership announced that it expects to reduce its common unit distribution to $0.2875 per quarter, beginning with the distribution to be paid in respect of the first quarter of 2019.
 
Business Strategies
 Our key business strategies are as follows:
  
• | Maintaining our focus on fee-based revenue with minimal direct commodity price exposure. We intend to maintain our focus on providing midstream energy services under primarily long-term and fee-based contracts. We believe that our focus on fee-based revenues with minimal direct commodity price exposure is essential to maintaining stable cash flows. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Enhancing our asset base by expanding our midstream service offerings in our Core Focus Areas. The systems that comprise our Core Focus Areas are located in production basins that we believe enable our customers to generate more favorable upstream returns and support sustained drilling and completion activity in varying commodity price environments. In some cases, production from our customers in these Core Focus Areas is expected to grow in excess of our existing throughput capacity over time, which will create opportunities for additional midstream infrastructure development. We intend to leverage our management team's expertise in constructing, developing and optimizing our midstream assets to enhance our operating footprint and increase our scale in our Core Focus Areas. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Maintaining strong producer relationships to maximize utilization of all of our midstream assets. We have cultivated strong producer relationships by focusing on customer service, reliable project execution and by operating our assets safely and reliably over time. We believe that our strong producer relationships will create future opportunities to optimize the utilization of the gathering systems in our Legacy Areas and develop new midstream energy infrastructure in our Core Focus Areas. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 10


 
• | Allocating capital to maximize unitholder value. The Partnership will seek to maximize unitholder value by allocating its available capital and maintaining its commitment to risk-informed stable cash flows. This may include a re-allocation of capital into new areas, existing areas or other obligations of the Partnership, including the Deferred Purchase Price Obligation. We may execute on opportunistic divestitures as part of this strategy, which could include certain assets located in our Core Focus Areas or Legacy Areas. For example, in February 2019, SMLP announced that it had executed definitive agreements with Hess Infrastructure related to the sale of Tioga Midstream for cash consideration of $90 million, subject to adjustment. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Continuing to prioritize safe and reliable operations. We believe that providing safe, reliable and efficient operations is a key component of our business strategy. We place a strong emphasis on employee training, operational procedures, and enterprise technology, and we intend to continue promoting a high standard with respect to the efficiency of our operations and the safety of all of our constituents.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Midstream Assets
 Our midstream assets, including assets in which we have a significant ownership interest, currently operate in the following unconventional resource plays:
 Core Focus Areas
  
• | the Utica Shale, which is served by Summit Utica;
--+--------------------------------------------------


• | Ohio Gathering, which operates in the Appalachian Basin and includes our ownership interests in OGC and OCC;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the Williston Basin, which is served by Polar and Divide, Tioga Midstream and Bison Midstream;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the DJ Basin, which is served by Niobrara G&P; and
--+---------------------------------------------------


• | the Permian Basin, which is served by Summit Permian.
--+------------------------------------------------------

Legacy Areas
  
• | the Piceance Basin, which is served by Grand River;
--+----------------------------------------------------


• | the Barnett Shale, which is served by DFW Midstream; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------


• | the Marcellus Shale, which is served by Mountaineer Midstream.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------

 We compete with other midstream companies, producers and intrastate and interstate pipelines. Competition for volumes is primarily based on reputation, commercial terms, service levels, access to end-use markets, geographic proximity of existing assets to a producer's acreage and available capacity. We may also face competition to gather production outside of our AMIs and attract producer volumes to our gathering systems. Additionally, we could face incremental competition to the extent we make acquisitions.
 We earn revenue by providing gathering, compression, treating and/or processing services pursuant to primarily long-term and fee-based gathering and processing agreements with some of the largest and most active producers in North America. The fee-based nature of these agreements enhances the stability of our cash flows by limiting our direct commodity price exposure.
 The significant features of our gathering and processing agreements and the gathering systems to which they relate are discussed in more detail below. For additional operating and financial performance information, on a consolidated basis and by reportable segment, see the "Results of Operations" section in Item 7. MD&A.
 Areas of Mutual Interest.  The vast majority of our gathering and processing agreements contain AMIs, some of which extend through 2036. The AMIs generally require that any production by our customers within the AMIs will be shipped on and/or processed by our assets. In general, our customers have not leased acreage that cover our entire AMIs but, to the extent that they lease additional acreage within our AMIs in the future, any production from wells drilled by them within that AMI will be dedicated to our systems.
 11


Under certain of our gathering agreements, we have agreed to construct pipeline laterals to connect our gathering systems to producer pad sites located within the AMI. However, in certain circumstances we may choose not to fund a pad connection opportunity presented by a customer or we may choose not to fund capital calls in Ohio Gathering if we believe that the investment would not meet our internal return expectations. Under this scenario, the customer may, in certain circumstances, construct the infrastructure itself and sell it to us at a price equal to their cost plus an applicable profit margin, or, in some cases, we may release the relevant acreage dedication from the AMI. For Ohio Gathering, our joint venture partner may elect to fund 100% of the capital call, which could reduce our ownership interests in OGC and/or OCC.
 Minimum Volume Commitments.  Certain of our gathering and/or processing agreements contain MVCs, which, like AMIs, benefit the development and ongoing operation of a gathering system because they provide a contracted monthly, annual or multi-year minimum revenue stream. As of December 31, 2018, we had remaining MVCs totaling 2.2 Tcfe. Our MVCs had a weighted-average remaining life of 6.4 years (assuming contracted minimum volume commitments for the remainder of the term) and average approximately 1.0 Bcfe/d through 2023. In addition, certain of our customers have an aggregate MVC, which is a total amount of volume throughput that the customer has agreed to ship and/or process on our systems (or an equivalent monetary amount) over the MVC term. In these cases, once a customer achieves its aggregate MVC, any remaining future MVCs will terminate and the customer will then simply pay the applicable gathering or processing rate multiplied by the actual throughput volumes shipped or processed, pursuant to the contract. As a result of this mechanism, in many cases, the weighted-average remaining period for which our MVCs apply is less than the weighted-average of the remaining contract life.
 For additional information on our MVCs, see Notes 2 and 9 to the consolidated financial statements.
 Utica Shale
 The following table provides operating information regarding our Utica Shale reportable segment as of December 31, 2018.

 Summit Utica.  The Summit Utica system is a natural gas gathering system located in Belmont and Monroe counties in southeastern Ohio and serves producers targeting the dry gas window of the Utica and Point Pleasant shale formations. The Summit Utica system gathers and delivers natural gas, primarily under long-term, fee-based gathering agreements, which include acreage dedications. XTO and Ascent are the key customers of Summit Utica.
 We have connected a substantial number of our customers’ pad sites to our gathering system and we expect to benefit in the near-term from incremental volumes arising from drilling and completion activity that is occurring and will continue to occur on previously connected pad sites. Over time, we intend to expand our midstream service offering for the Summit Utica system to connect additional customer pad sites and install centralized compression facilities. Centralized compression services have been dedicated to us in our gathering agreements and will eventually constitute a new revenue stream from our customers; however, to date, this service has not been required given the relatively high downhole pressures exhibited by dry gas wells in the Utica Shale compared to other unconventional shale plays. 
 The Summit Utica system interconnects with the Ohio River System pipeline, which delivers to the Clarington Hub in Clarington, Ohio. 
 The Summit Utica system currently provides natural gas midstream services for the Utica Shale reportable segment.

Ohio Gathering
 Ohio Gathering.  Ohio Gathering comprises a natural gas gathering system and condensate stabilization facility located in the core of the Utica Shale in southeastern Ohio. The gathering system spans the condensate, liquids-rich and dry gas windows of the Utica Shale for multiple producers that are targeting production from the Utica and Point Pleasant shale formations across Belmont, Monroe, Guernsey, Harrison and Noble counties in southeastern Ohio. Substantially all gathering services on the Ohio Gathering system are provided pursuant to long-term, fee-based gathering agreements. Ascent and Gulfport are Ohio Gathering's key customers. AMIs for Ohio Gathering total approximately 825,000 surface acres in the aggregate. 
 Condensate and liquids-rich natural gas production is gathered, compressed, dehydrated and delivered to the Cadiz and Seneca processing complexes, which total approximately 1.3 Bcf/d of processing capacity and are owned by a joint venture between MPLX LP (“MPLX”) and The Energy and Minerals Group. Dry gas production is gathered, dehydrated, compressed, and delivered to third-party pipelines serving the northeast and mid-west markets. 
 Ohio Gathering also operates one of the largest condensate stabilization facilities in Ohio. This facility serves as the origination point for MPLX’s Cornerstone Pipeline which delivers condensate to Marathon Petroleum’s refinery in Canton, Ohio.
 As of December 31, 2018, we owned a 40% ownership interest in Ohio Gathering. For additional information, see Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.

 AMIs for the Williston Basin reportable segment total approximately 1.3 million surface acres in the aggregate. 
 Polar and Divide.  The Polar and Divide system, which is located primarily in Williams and Divide counties in northwestern North Dakota, owns, operates and is currently developing crude oil and produced water gathering systems and transmission pipelines serving multiple customers that are targeting crude oil production from the Bakken and Three Forks shale formations. The Polar and Divide system is underpinned by long-term, fee-based gathering agreements, which include acreage dedications. Whiting and Zavanna are the key customers of the Polar and Divide system.
 Crude oil that is gathered by the Polar and Divide system is delivered to interconnects with (i) the Dakota Access Pipeline, (ii) the COLT Hub rail facility, (iii) Enbridge Inc’s North Dakota Pipeline System, and (iv) Global Partners LP's Basin Transload rail terminal. Produced water is delivered to third-party disposal facilities. 
 The Polar and Divide system currently provides crude oil and produced water midstream services for the Williston Basin reportable segment.
 Tioga Midstream.  The Tioga Midstream system, which currently provides associated natural gas, crude oil and produced water midstream services for the Williston Basin reportable segment, is located in Williams County, North Dakota. Gathering services on the Tioga Midstream system are primarily provided pursuant to long-term, fee-based gathering agreements with Hess, which is primarily targeting crude oil production from the Bakken and Three Forks shale formations. The gathering agreements include an annual rate redetermination mechanism, which effectively 
 13


serves to protect future cash flows by resetting the gathering rate upward from pre-established base gathering rates in the event that Hess under performs from certain pre-established minimum production thresholds. The annual rate redeterminations can also reset the gathering rate lower in the event that Hess exceeds the minimum production threshold. 
 All crude oil, produced water and natural gas gathered on the Tioga Midstream system is delivered to downstream pipelines and disposal wells (for produced water) that are owned and operated by affiliates of Hess Infrastructure Partners LP. In February 2019, SMLP announced that it had executed definitive agreements with Hess Infrastructure related to the sale of Tioga Midstream for cash consideration of $90 million, subject to adjustment.
 Bison Midstream.  The Bison Midstream system is located in Mountrail and Burke counties in northwestern North Dakota. Bison Midstream gathers, compresses and treats associated natural gas that exists in the crude oil stream produced from the Bakken and Three Forks shale formations. Our gathering agreements for the Bison Midstream system include long-term, fee-based or percent-of-proceeds contracts. Volume throughput on the Bison Midstream system is underpinned by acreage dedications and MVCs from its key customers. A large U.S. independent crude oil and natural gas company and Oasis are the key customers of Bison Midstream. 
 Natural gas gathered on the Bison Midstream system is delivered to Aux Sable Midstream LLC's (“Aux Sable”) Palermo Conditioning Plant in Palermo, North Dakota and then delivered to downstream pipelines serving Aux Sable’s 2.1 Bcf/d natural gas processing plant in Channahon, Illinois.
 The Bison Midstream system currently provides associated natural gas midstream services for the Williston Basin reportable segment.

Niobrara G&P.  The Niobrara G&P system is located near Hereford, Colorado, in Weld County, the largest crude oil and natural gas producing county in the state. Gathering and processing services on the Niobrara G&P system are provided pursuant to long-term, fee-based gathering agreements with producers that are primarily targeting crude oil production from the Niobrara and Codell shale formations. HighPoint and a large U.S. independent crude oil and natural gas company are the key customers of the Niobrara G&P system and have underpinned our volume throughput with acreage dedications and MVCs.
 The Niobrara G&P system operates a low-pressure associated natural gas gathering system, and a cryogenic natural gas processing plant with processing capacity of 20 MMcf/d. The Niobrara G&P system also processes liquids-rich natural gas that is produced by a customer in Laramie County, Wyoming and is delivered to the inlet of our processing plant by a third-party gathering system. 
 In November 2017, we announced the expansion of our existing gathering and processing complex with the addition of a new 60 MMcf/d cryogenic processing plant. We expect the new 60 MMcf/d processing plant to become operational in 2019. 
 Residue gas is delivered to the Colorado Interstate Gas pipeline and processed NGLs are delivered to the Overland Pass Pipeline. 
 The Niobrara G&P system currently provides midstream services for the DJ Basin reportable segment.
 Permian Basin
 The following table provides operating information regarding our Permian Basin reportable segment as of December 31, 2018.

 AMIs for the Permian Basin reportable segment total more than 88,000 surface acres in the aggregate. 
 Summit Permian.  The Summit Permian system is a newly-commissioned associated natural gas gathering and processing system located in the northern Delaware Basin in Eddy and Lea counties in New Mexico. Gathering and processing services on the Summit Permian system are provided pursuant to long-term, fee-based gathering agreements with producers that are primarily targeting crude oil production from the Bone Spring and Wolfcamp shale formations. XTO is the key customer of the Summit Permian system.
 Summit Permian commissioned its initial assets, which comprise a low-pressure natural gas gathering system and a 60 MMcf/d cryogenic processing plant, in December 2018. Our processing complex will have the ability to be expanded to over 600 MMcf/d of processing capacity, as warranted, to meet customer needs. Over time, we expect to expand our midstream assets to accommodate ancillary services, including crude oil and produced water gathering.
 Residue natural gas is delivered to the Transwestern Pipeline and processed NGLs are delivered to the Lone Star NGL Pipeline.

 AMIs for the Piceance Basin reportable segment total approximately 650,000 surface acres in the aggregate.
 Grand River.  Grand River is primarily located in Garfield County, one of the largest natural gas producing counties in Colorado. The Grand River system provides gathering services pursuant to primarily long-term and fee-based agreements with multiple producers, including its key customers, Caerus and Terra. Volume throughput on the Grand River system is underpinned with acreage dedications and MVCs. 
 The Grand River system is primarily a low-pressure gathering system that gathers natural gas produced from directional wells targeting the liquids-rich Mesaverde formation. The Grand River system also gathers natural gas from our customers' wells targeting the Mancos and Niobrara shale formations, which underlie the Mesaverde formation, via a medium-pressure gathering system.
 Natural gas gathered and/or processed on the Grand River system is compressed, dehydrated, processed and/or discharged to downstream pipelines serving (i) the Meeker Processing Complex, (ii) the Northwest Pipeline system and (iii) the TransColorado Pipeline system. Processed NGLs from Grand River are injected into the Mid-America Pipeline system or delivered to local markets. In addition, certain of our gathering agreements with our customers on the Grand River system permit us to retain condensate volumes that naturally discharge from the liquids-rich natural gas as it moves across our system.
 The Grand River system currently provides midstream services for the Piceance Basin reportable segment.

 DFW Midstream.  The DFW Midstream system is primarily located in southeastern Tarrant County, in north-central Texas. We consider this area to be the core of the core of the Barnett Shale because of the quality of the geology and the high production profile of the wells drilled to date. For example, the two largest and five of the 10 largest wells drilled in the Barnett Shale are connected to the DFW Midstream system. The DFW Midstream system is underpinned by a long-term, fee-based gathering agreement with Total and additional customers.
 The DFW Midstream system includes natural gas gathering pipelines located under both private and public property and is partially located along existing electric transmission corridors. Compression on the system is powered by electricity. To offset the costs we incur to operate the system's electric-drive compressors, we either retain a fixed percentage of the natural gas that we gather or pass through a portion of the power expense to our customers. 
 16


The DFW Midstream system currently has six primary interconnections with third-party, primarily intrastate pipelines. These interconnections enable us to connect our customers, directly or indirectly, with the major natural gas market hubs in Texas and Louisiana.
 The DFW Midstream system currently provides midstream services for the Barnett Shale reportable segment.

 Mountaineer Midstream.  The Mountaineer Midstream system is located in Doddridge and Harrison counties in West Virginia where it gathers natural gas under a long-term, fee-based contract with Antero, which is targeting liquids-rich natural gas production from the Marcellus Shale formation. Volume throughput on the Mountaineer Midstream system is underpinned by MVCs from Antero.
 The Mountaineer Midstream system, which is underpinned by a minimum revenue commitment from Antero, consists of a high-pressure natural gas gathering system and two compressor stations. This system gathers high-pressure natural gas received from upstream pipeline interconnections with Antero Midstream Partners, LP and Crestwood Equity Partners LP. Mountaineer Midstream serves as a critical inlet to the Sherwood Processing Complex, a primary destination for liquids-rich natural gas in northern West Virginia and one of the largest natural gas processing facilities in the United States.
 The Mountaineer Midstream system currently provides midstream services for the Marcellus Shale reportable segment.

Regulation of the Natural Gas and Crude Oil Industries
 General.  Sales by producers of natural gas, crude oil, condensate and NGLs are currently made at market prices. However, gathering and transportation services are subject to various types of regulation, which may affect certain aspects of our business and the market for our services. FERC regulates the transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce and the interstate transportation of crude oil, petroleum products and NGLs. FERC regulation includes reviewing and accepting or approving rates and other terms and conditions for such transportation services. FERC is also authorized to prevent and sanction market manipulation in natural gas markets while the FTC is authorized to prevent and sanction market manipulation in petroleum markets. State and municipal regulations may apply to the production and gathering of certain natural gas, the construction and operation of natural gas and crude oil facilities and the rates and practices of gathering systems and intrastate pipelines.
 Regulation of Crude Oil and Natural Gas Exploration, Production and Sales.  Sales of crude oil and NGLs are not currently regulated and are transacted at market prices. In 1989, the U.S. Congress enacted the Natural Gas Wellhead Decontrol Act, which removed all remaining price and non-price controls affecting wellhead sales of natural gas. FERC, which has the authority under the NGA to regulate the prices and other terms and conditions of the sale of natural gas for resale in interstate commerce, has issued blanket authorizations for all gas resellers subject to its regulation, except interstate pipelines, to resell natural gas at market prices. Either Congress or FERC (with respect to the resale of gas in interstate commerce), however, could re-impose price controls in the future.
 17


Exploration and production operations are subject to various types of federal, state and local regulation, including, but not limited to, permitting, well location, methods of drilling, well operations and conservation of resources. While these regulations do not directly apply to our business, they may affect our customers' ability to produce natural gas.
 Regulation of the Gathering and Transportation of Natural Gas and Crude Oil.  We believe that the majority of our natural gas pipeline facilities qualify as gathering facilities that are exempt from the jurisdiction of FERC. On February 1, 2016, Epping's FERC tariff for interstate movements of crude oil on its Epping Pipeline in North Dakota became effective. That tariff is subject to FERC jurisdiction and oversight pursuant to FERC's authority under the ICA. Additionally, our proposed Double E Pipeline Project, which is currently in the pre-filing stage at FERC and is anticipated to provide natural gas transmission service from southeastern New Mexico to the Waha Hub in Texas will be subject to FERC jurisdiction once approved. We are also generally subject to FERC's anti-market manipulation regulations. The distinction between federally unregulated natural gas and crude oil pipelines and FERC-regulated natural gas and crude oil pipelines has been the subject of extensive litigation and changes in the policies and interpretations of laws and regulations. In addition, the status of any individual pipeline system may be determined by FERC on a case-by-case basis, although FERC has made no such determinations as to the status of our facilities. Consequently, the classification and regulation of pipeline systems (including some of our pipelines) could change based on future determinations by FERC or the courts.
 Under FERC’s ICA jurisdiction, rates for interstate movements of liquids by pipeline are currently regulated primarily through an annual indexing methodology, under which pipelines increase or decrease their existing rates in accordance with a FERC-specified adjustment. This adjustment is subject to review every five years. For the five-year period beginning on July 1, 2016, FERC established an annual index adjustment equal to the change in the producer price index for finished goods plus 1.23%. FERC is currently considering a policy change that would deny proposed index increases for pipelines under certain circumstances where revenues exceed cost-of-service by a certain percentage or where the proposed index increases exceed certain annual cost changes reported to FERC, although it has not yet made any determinations regarding these proposals.
 Under current FERC regulations, liquids pipelines can request a rate increase that exceeds the rate obtained through the indexing methodology by using a cost-of-service approach, but a pipeline must establish that a substantial divergence exists between its actual costs and the rates resulting from the indexing methodology. The rates charged by Epping may also be affected by an ongoing proceeding before FERC that seeks to address whether FERC’s existing policy of allowing partnership-owned pipelines to claim an income-tax allowance for partners’ tax liability results in an impermissible double-recovery, or whether justification exists to continue the current approach. The potential outcome of this proceeding is currently uncertain.
 The ICA permits interested persons to challenge proposed new or changed rates and authorizes FERC to suspend the effectiveness of such rates for up to seven months and investigate such rates. If, upon completion of an investigation, FERC finds that the new or changed rate is unlawful, it is authorized to require the pipeline to refund revenues collected in excess of the just and reasonable rate during the term of the investigation. FERC may also investigate, upon complaint or on its own motion, rates that are already in effect and may order a carrier to change its rates prospectively. Under certain circumstances, FERC could limit Epping’s ability to set rates based on costs or could order reduced rates and reparations to complaining shippers for up to two years prior to the date of a complaint. FERC also has the authority to change terms and conditions of service if it determines that they are unjust and unreasonable or unduly discriminatory or preferential.
 Intrastate pipelines, which may include some pipelines that perform gathering functions, may be subject to safety regulation by the DOT, although typically state regulatory authorities (operating under a federal certification) perform this function. State regulatory authorities also have jurisdiction over the rates and practices of intrastate pipelines and gathering systems, including requirements for ratable takes or non-discriminatory access to pipeline services. The basis for state regulation and the degree of regulatory oversight of gathering systems and intrastate pipelines varies from state to state. In Texas, we are regulated as a gas utility and have filed tariffs with the Railroad Commission of Texas to establish rates and terms of service for our DFW Midstream system assets. We have not been required to file tariffs in the other states in which we operate, although we are required to submit shape files and other information regarding the location and construction of underground gathering pipelines in North Dakota. The states in which we 
 18


operate have adopted complaint-based regulation that allows natural gas producers and shippers to file complaints with state regulators in an effort to resolve access issues and rate grievances, among other matters. State authorities in the states in which we operate generally have not initiated investigations of the rates or practices of gathering systems or intrastate pipelines in the absence of a complaint. State regulation of intrastate pipelines continues to evolve and may become more stringent in the future. For example, the North Dakota Industrial Commission recently adopted rule changes that resulted in additional construction and monitoring requirements for all pipelines, including, but not limited to, those that transport produced water, and has recently adopted reclamation bonding requirements for certain underground gathering pipelines in North Dakota.
 Natural gas, crude oil and produced water production, gathering and transportation, including the construction of new gathering facilities and expansion of existing gathering facilities may also be subject to local regulation, such as approval and permit requirements.
 Anti-Market Manipulation Rules.  We are subject to the anti-market manipulation provisions in the NGA and the NGPA, as amended by the Energy Policy Act of 2005, which authorize FERC to impose fines of up to $1,238,271 per day per violation of the NGA, the NGPA, or their implementing regulations, subject to future adjustments for inflation. In addition, the FTC holds statutory authority under the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 to prevent market manipulation in petroleum markets, including the authority to request that a court impose fines of up to $1,180,566 per violation, subject to future adjustment for inflation. These agencies have promulgated broad rules and regulations prohibiting fraud and manipulation in oil and gas markets. The CFTC is directed under the CEA to prevent price manipulations in the commodity and futures markets, including the energy futures markets. Pursuant to statutory authority, the CFTC has adopted anti-market manipulation regulations that prohibit fraud and price manipulation in the commodity and futures markets. The CFTC also has statutory authority to seek civil penalties of up to the greater of $1,098,190 per day per violation, subject to future adjustment for inflation, or triple the monetary gain to the violator for violations of the anti-market manipulation sections of the CEA. We are also subject to various reporting requirements that are designed to facilitate transparency and prevent market manipulation.
 Safety and Maintenance.  We are subject to regulation by the DOT, which establishes federal safety standards for the design, construction, operation and maintenance of natural gas and crude oil pipeline facilities. In the Pipeline Safety Act of 1992, Congress expanded the DOT's regulatory authority to include regulated gathering lines that had previously been exempt from federal jurisdiction. The Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002 and the Pipeline Inspection, Protection, Enforcement and Safety Act of 2006 established mandatory inspections for certain U.S. oil and natural gas transmission pipelines in high consequence areas. The Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty and Job Creation Act of 2011 (“2011 Act”) reauthorized funding for federal pipeline safety programs through 2015, increased penalties for safety violations, established additional safety requirements for newly constructed pipelines and required studies of certain safety issues that could result in the adoption of new regulatory requirements for existing pipelines. In 2016, the Protecting Our Infrastructure of Pipelines and Enhancing Safety Act reauthorized pipeline safety programs through 2019 and provided limited new authority, including the ability to issue emergency orders, while increasing transparency into the status of remaining actions required by the 2011 Act.
 The DOT has delegated the implementation of pipeline safety requirements to PHMSA, which has adopted and enforces safety standards and procedures applicable to a limited number of our pipelines. In addition, many states, including the states in which we operate, have adopted regulations that are identical to or more restrictive than existing PHMSA regulations for intrastate pipelines. Among the regulations applicable to us, PHMSA requires pipeline operators to develop integrity management programs for certain pipelines located in high consequence areas, which include high-population areas such as the Dallas-Fort Worth greater metropolitan area where our DFW Midstream system is located. While the majority of our pipelines meet the DOT definition of gathering lines and are thus currently exempt from the integrity management requirements of PHMSA, we also operate a limited number of pipelines that are subject to the integrity management requirements. Those regulations require operators, including us, to:
  
• | perform ongoing assessments of pipeline integrity;
--+---------------------------------------------------


• | identify and characterize applicable threats to pipeline segments that could impact a high consequence area;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | maintain processes for data collection, integration and analysis;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------

 19


 
• | repair and remediate pipelines as necessary;
--+---------------------------------------------


• | adopt and maintain procedures, standards and training programs for control room operations; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | implement preventive and mitigating actions.
--+---------------------------------------------

 In April 2016, PHMSA proposed changes to gas pipeline safety regulations that would impose expanded assessment requirements, expand assessment and repair requirements to pipelines in areas with medium population densities (so-called “Moderate Consequence Areas”), and extend pipeline safety regulation to certain previously unregulated gas gathering pipelines. PHMSA has yet to finalize this rulemaking, however, and the timing and content of any final rule are uncertain. In 2015, PHMSA adopted regulations that impose pipeline incident prevention and response measures on pipeline operators and in 2012, PHMSA issued an Advisory Bulletin providing guidance on verification of records related to pipeline maximum allowable operating pressure. Pipelines that do not meet PHMSA’s record verification standards may be required to perform additional testing or reduce their operating pressures.
 In January 2017, PHMSA issued a final rule amending its pipeline safety regulations for the design, construction, testing, operation, and maintenance of pipelines transporting hazardous liquids. Among other things, the final rule extends certain safety-related condition reporting requirements to all hazardous liquid gathering lines and requires periodic assessments of certain hazardous liquid transmission lines in non-high consequence areas. The status of this rulemaking is currently uncertain due to a regulatory freeze implemented by the Trump administration on January 20, 2017, pursuant to which all regulations that had been sent to the Office of the Federal Register, but not yet published, were withdrawn for further review. Accordingly, the anticipated January 2017 rulemaking was never published in the Federal Register, and the rule is not currently effective. 
 Gathering systems like ours are also subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations, including the Federal Occupational Safety and Health Act and comparable state statutes, the purposes of which are to protect the health and safety of workers, both generally and within the pipeline industry. In addition, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration hazard communication standard, EPA community right-to-know regulations under Title III of the federal Superfund Amendment and Reauthorization Act and comparable state statutes require that information be maintained concerning hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that such information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and the public.
 Environmental Matters
 General.  Our operation of pipelines and other assets for the gathering, treating and/or processing of natural gas and the gathering of crude oil and produced water is subject to stringent and complex federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. As an owner or operator of these assets, we must comply with these laws and regulations at the federal, state and local levels. These laws and regulations can restrict or impact our business activities in many ways, such as:

• | requiring the installation of pollution-control equipment or otherwise restricting the way we operate;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | limiting or prohibiting construction activities in sensitive areas, such as wetlands, coastal regions or areas inhabited by endangered or threatened species;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | delaying system modification or upgrades during permit reviews;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


• | requiring investigatory and remedial actions to mitigate pollution conditions caused by our operations or attributable to former operations; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | enjoining the operations of facilities deemed to be in non-compliance with permits or permit requirements issued pursuant to or imposed by such environmental laws and regulations.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may trigger administrative, civil and criminal enforcement measures, including the assessment of monetary penalties. Certain environmental statutes impose strict joint and several liability for costs required to clean up and restore sites where substances, hydrocarbons or wastes have been disposed or otherwise released. Moreover, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to 
 20


file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances, hydrocarbons or other waste products into the environment.
 The trend in environmental regulation is to place more stringent requirements, resulting in more restrictions and limitations, on activities that may affect the environment. Thus, there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for environmental compliance or remediation and actual future expenditures may be different from the amounts we currently anticipate. We try to anticipate future regulatory requirements that might be imposed and plan accordingly to remain in compliance with changing environmental laws and regulations and to minimize the costs of such compliance. We also actively participate in industry groups that help formulate recommendations for addressing existing and future regulations.
 The following is a discussion of the material environmental laws and regulations that relate to our business.
 Hazardous Substances and Waste.  Our operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations relating to the management and release of solid and hazardous wastes and other substances, including hydrocarbons. These laws generally regulate the generation, storage, treatment, transportation and disposal of solid and hazardous waste and may impose strict joint and several liability for the investigation and remediation of affected areas where hazardous substances may have been released or disposed. Furthermore, the Toxic Substances Control Act and analogous state laws, impose requirements on the use, storage and disposal of various chemicals and chemical substances at our facilities. CERCLA and comparable state laws impose liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons that contributed to the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. We may handle hazardous substances within the meaning of CERCLA, or similar state statutes, in the course of our ordinary operations and, as a result, may be jointly and severally liable under CERCLA for all or part of the costs required to clean up sites at which these hazardous substances have been released into the environment.
 We also generate industrial wastes that are subject to the requirements of the RCRA and comparable state statutes. While the RCRA regulates both solid and hazardous wastes, it imposes strict requirements on the generation, storage, treatment, transportation and disposal of hazardous wastes. Although we generate minimal hazardous waste, it is possible that non-hazardous wastes, which could include wastes currently generated during our operations, will in the future be designated as hazardous wastes and, therefore, be subject to more rigorous and costly disposal requirements. Moreover, from time to time, the EPA and state regulatory agencies have considered the adoption of stricter disposal standards for non-hazardous wastes, including natural gas wastes.
 We currently own or lease properties where hydrocarbons are being or have been handled for many years. Although we believe that the previous operators utilized operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time, hydrocarbons or other wastes may have been disposed of or released on or under the properties owned or leased by us or on or under the other locations where these hydrocarbons and wastes have been transported for treatment or disposal, without our knowledge. These properties and the wastes disposed thereon may be subject to CERCLA, the RCRA and analogous state laws. Under these laws, we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes (including wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators), to clean up contaminated property (including contaminated groundwater) or to perform remedial operations to prevent future contamination. We are not currently aware of any facts, events or conditions relating to such requirements that could materially impact our operations or financial condition.
 Air Emissions.  Our operations are subject to the federal CAA and comparable state and local laws and regulations. These laws and regulations regulate emissions of air pollutants from various industrial sources, including our facilities, and also impose various monitoring, control and reporting requirements. Such laws and regulations may require that we obtain pre-approval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce or significantly increase air emissions, obtain and strictly comply with air permits containing various emissions and operational limitations and utilize specific emission control technologies to limit emissions. Our failure to comply with these requirements could subject us to monetary penalties, injunctions, conditions or restrictions on operations and criminal enforcement actions. Furthermore, we may be required to incur certain capital expenditures in the future to obtain and maintain operating permits and approvals for air pollutant emitting sources.
 21


In October 2015, the EPA issued a new lower NAAQS for ozone. The previous ozone standard was set at 75 parts per billion ("ppb"). The revised standard has been lowered to 70 ppb. The lowered ozone NAAQS could result in a significant expansion of ozone nonattainment areas across the United States, including areas in which we operate, which could subject us to increased regulatory burdens in the form of more stringent emission controls, emission offset requirements and increased permitting delays and costs. Impacts from the new standard have not yet been determined, as states are still in the process of incorporating the new standard into their respective state implementation plans. We will continue to monitor developments to determine if any adverse effects on our operations can be expected.
 On June 3, 2016, the EPA finalized revisions to its 2012 New Source Performance Standard ("NSPS") OOOO for the oil and gas industry, to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases - most notably methane - along with smog-forming VOCs. The revisions, which are published in the Federal Register under Subpart OOOOa, included the addition of methane to the pollutants covered by the rule, along with requirements for detecting and repairing leaks at gathering and boosting stations. The revised rule applies to sources that have been modified, constructed, or reconstructed after September 18, 2015. EPA is currently reconsidering NSPS OOOOa and has proposed to stay its requirements. However, the rule currently remains in effect. While we do not expect this rule to significantly impact our existing operations, future modifications or new construction may be adversely affected by the revised rule.
 On November 16, 2016 the Bureau of Land Management ("BLM") issued a final rule to reduce venting and flaring of natural gas on public and Indian lands. The final rule mirrors many of the requirements found in NSPS OOOOa, with additional natural gas royalty requirements for flared volumes at sites already connected to gas capture infrastructure. In December 2017, the BLM issued a final rule that temporarily suspends or delays these requirements until January 2019, while BLM considers revising or rescinding these requirements. While the rule is expected to have little or no direct impact on our operations, our customers that are primarily upstream wellhead operators may be impacted by the requirements in this rule.
 Water Discharges.  The CWA and analogous state laws impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants into regulated waters, which impacts our ability to conduct construction activities in waters and wetlands. Certain state regulations and the general permits issued under the Federal National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System program prohibit the discharge of pollutants and chemicals. In addition, the CWA and analogous state laws require individual permits or coverage under general permits for discharges of storm water runoff from certain types of facilities. These permits require us to control storm water runoff from some of our facilities. Some states also maintain groundwater protection programs that require permits for discharges or operations that may impact groundwater conditions. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance with discharge permits or other requirements of the CWA and analogous state laws and regulations. Except as otherwise disclosed in this annual report, we believe that we are in substantial compliance with all applicable requirements of the CWA and analogous state laws and regulations relating to water discharges.
 Oil Pollution Act.  The OPA requires the preparation of an SPCC plan for facilities engaged in drilling, producing, gathering, storing, processing, refining, transferring, distributing, using, or consuming oil and oil products, and which due to their location, could reasonably be expected to discharge oil in harmful quantities into or upon the navigable waters of the United States. The owner or operator of an SPCC-regulated facility is required to prepare a written, site-specific spill prevention plan, which details how a facility's operations comply with the requirements. To be in compliance, the facility's SPCC plan must satisfy all of the applicable requirements for drainage, bulk storage tanks, tank car and truck loading and unloading, transfer operations (intrafacility piping), inspections and records, security and training. Certain of our facilities are classified as SPCC-regulated facilities. We believe that they are in substantial compliance with all applicable requirements of OPA.
 Hydraulic Fracturing.  Hydraulic fracturing is an important and increasingly common practice that is used to stimulate production of natural gas and/or crude oil from dense subsurface rock formations and is primarily presently regulated by state agencies. However, Congress has in the past and may in the future consider legislation to regulate hydraulic fracturing by federal agencies. Many states have already adopted laws and/or regulations that require disclosure of the chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing. A number of states have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, legal requirements that could impose more stringent permitting, disclosure and well 
 22


construction requirements on oil and/or natural gas drilling activities. For example, a Colorado ballot initiative, Proposition 112, would have substantially increased setback distances for various upstream activities, thereby substantially restricting new oil and gas development in the state. Although Proposition 112 was defeated in the November 2018 elections, similar efforts in Colorado and elsewhere, if passed, could restrict oil and gas development in the future. States also could elect to prohibit hydraulic fracturing altogether, as New York, Maryland, and Vermont have done. In addition, certain local governments have adopted, and additional local governments may adopt, ordinances within their jurisdictions regulating the time, place and manner of drilling activities in general or hydraulic fracturing activities in particular.
 The EPA has also moved forward with various regulatory actions, including approving new regulations requiring green completions of hydraulically-fractured wells and corresponding reporting requirements that went into effect in 2015. Revisions to the green completion regulations were finalized in June 2016 and include additional requirements to reduce methane and VOCs. The EPA announced in April 2017 that it would review these regulations and has proposed to stay their requirements. However, the regulations currently remain in effect. The BLM has also asserted regulatory authority over aspects of the hydraulic fracturing process, and issued a final rule in March 2015 that established more stringent standards for performing hydraulic fracturing on federal and Indian lands. However, in December 2017, the BLM published a final rule rescinding the 2015 rule. The rescission rule is currently subject to a legal challenge. Further, several federal governmental agencies are conducting reviews and studies on the environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing, including the EPA. The results of such reviews or studies could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing. 
 State and federal regulatory agencies recently have focused on a possible connection between the hydraulic fracturing related activities and the increased occurrence of seismic activity. When caused by human activity, such events are called induced seismicity. Some state regulatory agencies, including those in Colorado, Ohio, and Texas, have modified their regulations or guidance to account for induced seismicity. These developments could result in additional regulation and restrictions on the use of injection disposal wells and hydraulic fracturing. Such regulations and restrictions could cause delays and impose additional costs and restrictions on our customers.
 If new or more stringent federal, state or local legal restrictions relating to drilling activities or to the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted, this could result in a reduction in the supply of natural gas and/or crude oil that our customers produce, and could thereby adversely affect our revenues and results of operations. Compliance with such rules could also generally result in additional costs, including increased capital expenditures and operating costs, for our customers, which could ultimately decrease end-user demand for our services and could have a material adverse effect on our business.
 Endangered Species Act.  The Endangered Species Act restricts activities that may affect endangered or threatened species or their habitats. Some of our pipelines may be located in areas that are designated as habitats for endangered or threatened species.
 National Environmental Policy Act.  The NEPA establishes a national environmental policy and goals for the protection, maintenance and enhancement of the environment and provides a process for implementing these goals within federal agencies. Major projects having the potential to significantly impact the environment require review under NEPA. Many of our activities are covered under categorical exclusions which results in an expedited NEPA review process. Large upstream and downstream projects with significant cumulative impacts may be subject to longer NEPA review processes, which could impact the timing of those projects and our services associated with them.
 Climate Change.  The EPA has adopted regulations under the CAA that, among other things, establish GHG emission limits from motor vehicles as well as establish PSD construction and Title V operating permit reviews for certain large stationary sources that are potential major sources of GHG emissions. Facilities required to obtain PSD permits for their GHG emissions also will be required to meet “best available control technology” standards that will be established by the states or, in some cases, by the EPA on a case-by-case basis.
 EPA rules also require the reporting of GHG emissions from specified large GHG-emitting sources in the United States, including onshore and offshore oil and natural gas systems. We are required to report under these rules for 
 23


our assets that have GHG emissions above the reporting thresholds. In October 2015, the EPA issued revisions to Subpart W of the GHG reporting rule to include reporting requirements for gathering and booster stations, onshore natural gas transmission pipelines, and completions and workovers of oil wells with hydraulic fracturing. This development resulted in increased monitoring and reporting for our operations and for upstream producers for whom we provide midstream services.
 In addition, almost half of the states, either individually or through multi-state regional initiatives, have begun to address GHG emissions, primarily through the planned development of emission inventories or regional GHG cap and trade programs. Most of these cap and trade programs work by requiring either major sources of emissions, such as electric power plants, or major producers of fuels, such as refineries and gas processing plants, to acquire and surrender emission allowances. In general, the number of allowances available for purchase is reduced each year until the overall GHG emission reduction goal is achieved. Depending on the scope of a particular program, we could be required to purchase and surrender allowances for GHG emissions resulting from our operations (e.g., at compressor stations). Although most of the state-level initiatives have to date been focused on large sources of GHG emissions, such as electric power plants, it is possible that certain components of our operations, such as our gas-fired compressors, could become subject to state-level GHG-related regulation.
 Further, in December 2015, over 190 countries, including the United States, reached an agreement to reduce global GHG emissions. The agreement entered into force in November 2016, after over 70 countries, including the United States, ratified or otherwise consented to be bound by the agreement. In August 2017, the United States formally documented to the United Nations its intent to withdraw from the agreement.

 Legislation or regulations that may be adopted to address climate change could also affect the markets for our products by making our products more or less desirable than competing sources of energy. To the extent that our products are competing with higher GHG-emitting energy sources, our products would become more desirable in the market with more stringent limitations on GHG emissions. Conversely, to the extent that our products are competing with lower GHG-emitting energy sources such as solar and wind, our products would become less desirable in the market with more stringent limitations on GHG emissions.
