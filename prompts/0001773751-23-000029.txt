Item 1. Business
Overview
Launched in 2017, Hims & Hers Health, Inc. (and together with its subsidiaries, “Hims & Hers”, the “Company”, “we”, “us” or “our”) has built a consumer-first platform transforming the way customers fulfill their health and wellness needs. We believe that the Company has the technical platform, distributed provider network, and access to clinical capabilities to lead the migration of routine office visits to a digital format. The Hims & Hers platform includes access to a highly-qualified and technologically-capable provider network, a clinically-focused electronic medical record system, digital prescriptions, and cloud pharmacy fulfillment. Our digital platform enables access to treatments for a broad range of conditions, including those related to sexual health, hair loss, dermatology, mental health and primary care. Hims & Hers connects patients to licensed healthcare professionals who can prescribe medications when appropriate. Prescriptions are fulfilled online through licensed pharmacies on a subscription basis. In addition, we also offer access to a range of health and wellness products designed to meet individual needs, which can include curated prescription and non-prescription products. Through the Hims & Hers mobile apps, consumers can access a range of educational programs, wellness content, community support, and other services that promote lifelong health and wellness. Since our founding, we have facilitated more than ten million telehealth consultations, enabling greater access to high-quality, convenient, and affordable care for people in all 50 states and the United Kingdom. Hims & Hers products can also be found in tens of thousands of top retail locations in the United States.
The mission of Hims & Hers is to help the world feel great through the power of better health. 
To fulfill this mission, our business strategy and market differentiation are centered around our trusted brand, leading technology, innovative products and services and clinical excellence.
•We work to build a brand that is trusted by our customers, easy-to-use, and normalizes the practice of seeking and receiving treatment by empowering our customers with personalized care and an omnichannel experience.
•The Hims & Hers platform offers a streamlined patient and clinician experience facilitated by proprietary algorithms and a customizable and integrated technology stack, allowing us to give customers a seamless experience and to follow up programmatically and with precision.
•We can leverage these insights and feedback to offer access to personalized prescription and non-prescription treatments that are designed to meet individual needs.
•At the foundation of our broader platform is the consumer trust we establish through our clinical excellence. Care accessed through the Hims & Hers platform is subject to evidence-based clinical guidelines and delivered by highly-trained healthcare providers to ensure consistency and quality. Our medical advisory board helps ensure the utmost quality of care on our platform. With these measures in place, we are able to deliver access to quality care and treatment that is fast and convenient. 
Business Strategy
We are a consumer-first health and wellness platform focused on providing modern personalized health and wellness experiences to consumers. We offer access to a range of health and wellness products and services available for customers to purchase through our websites and mobile applications. The offerings generally focus on conditions where treatment typically involves use of prescription medication on a recurring basis and ongoing care from healthcare providers. We also offer over-the-counter drug and device products and cosmetics and supplement products, which are primarily focused on general wellness, skincare, sexual health and wellness, and hair care. These curated non-prescription products include melatonin, biotin, probiotics and collagen protein supplements in the wellness category, moisturizer, creams, sunscreen, serum, face oil and face wash in the skincare category, condoms, climax delay spray and wipes, vibrators and lubricants in the sexual health and wellness category, and shampoos, conditioners, scalp scrubs and topical treatments such as minoxidil in the hair care category. We also offer many of these over-the-counter products through retail partnerships, in stores and online. The over-the-counter drug and device products and some of the cosmetics and supplement products we sell are “white-labeled” products, where we sell the manufacturer-developed product under the Hims & Hers brand name or co-branded along with the manufacturer’s brand. Several cosmetics and supplement products have been developed by us in partnership with the applicable manufacturers. For these products, the manufacturer develops the formulation with input from the internal Hims & Hers Product Research & Development team. In all cases, the manufacturer is responsible for obtaining and maintaining authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), if required, and complying with current Good Manufacturing Processes (cGMP) as adopted 
and enforced by the FDA. In addition, the internal Hims & Hers Quality team is responsible for maintaining policies and procedures to ensure non-prescription products comply with quality standards, which include independent laboratory testing of products, supplier and quality and compliance assessments.
Most of the offerings on our websites and mobile applications are sold to customers on a subscription basis. Subscription plans provide an easy and convenient way for customers to get the ongoing treatment they need while simultaneously providing the Company with predictability through a recurring revenue stream.
For subscription plans, customers select a desired cadence to receive products, which can range from every month to every two to twelve months, depending on the product. The customer is billed on a recurring basis based on the selected cadence and a specified quantity of product is shipped at each billing. Customers can cancel subscriptions in accordance with our Terms and Conditions agreed to by customers to stop receiving additional products and can reactivate subscriptions to continue receiving additional products. Our integrated technology platform allows us to serve our customers efficiently from start to finish: initially from customer discovery and purchase of offerings on our websites and mobile application, to connecting customers with medical providers for telehealth consultations, to the fulfillment and delivery of customer orders, and finally through ongoing clinical management by medical providers. Management believes this technology-driven efficiency provides cost advantages that allow us to offer customers affordable prices and to generate robust gross margins.
We acquire new customers and drive brand awareness through various marketing channels, including social media, online search, television, radio, other media channels, presence in brick-and-mortar retail stores, and physical brand advertising campaigns. We intend to continue to invest in growth in our current offerings and additionally in new products and services. The Hims & Hers platform is purpose-built to scale efficiently and to accommodate the seamless addition of new products and services. We plan to launch new subscription-based offerings which we expect will have a similar margin profile and unit economics to current offerings. As we implement our product roadmap, we expect to grow revenue through additional subscription-based recurring revenue offerings. The recent launches of new prescription products in sexual health and dermatology, and launches of hair care and supplement retail products, demonstrate the scalability of the platform.
Growth Opportunities
Continue to acquire more customers
Our brand awareness and innovative, personalized products are core to our ability to attract new customers. Customers serve as ambassadors for the Hims & Hers brand, further driving organic growth through word of mouth and user-generated content. More than 80% of our first time customers to date indicate that they came to Hims & Hers to learn about and find options for their condition and are seeking treatment for their particular conditions for the first time. The convenience of our websites and mobile application allows us to reduce stigma and access-related barriers that frequently prevent consumers from seeking medical care, expanding the Company’s market opportunity. Organic growth is enhanced by sophisticated omnichannel acquisition strategies meant to target future customers with condition-specific on-ramps at profitable returns on investment. In addition, our brand positioning has afforded significant partnerships with leading talent whose promotional efforts drive meaningful awareness of the products and services we make available. As our portfolio of products and services grows across categories, we believe that our market presence and brand recognition will expand, driving more consumers to seek out Hims & Hers for future healthcare needs.
Grow within existing customer base
Our expanded offerings that include more personalized products and clinical experiences across a broader range of conditions provide a large opportunity for us to grow our revenue within our existing customer base. Through more robust customer engagement, we have the ability to deliver longer term subscription adoption and drive more cross sell opportunities.
Category expansion into new conditions
We are pursuing a roadmap of rapid category expansion into new conditions that can be treated safely via telehealth, require ongoing and recurring customer relationships, and for which generic medication has been established as an effective means of treatment. Future care opportunities that show high prevalence within our existing customer base and offer traits similar to our existing categories in terms of business model characteristics include testosterone treatment, menopause, sleep disorders, post-
traumatic stress disorder, weight management, fertility, diabetes, cholesterol, and hypertension, which represent significant opportunities. Given the prevalence of these conditions, we see a large market opportunity for our current and future offerings.
Leverage existing capabilities to penetrate new sales channels and further improve operations
In 2020, we opened an approximately 300,000 square foot facility in New Albany, Ohio. In 2021, this facility began housing a dedicated licensed mail order pharmacy, XeCare, LLC (or “XeCare”), that provides prescription fulfillment services solely to Hims & Hers customers. In July 2021, we completed our acquisition of YoDerm, Inc. (“Apostrophe”), allowing us to expand personalized dermatological offerings to our customers. Apostrophe Pharmacy LLC (“Apostrophe Pharmacy,” and together with XeCare, the “Affiliated Pharmacies”), is an additional dedicated licensed mail order pharmacy located in Arizona that provides prescription fulfillment services solely to Hims & Hers customers as part of our acquisition of Apostrophe in 2021. In 2022, we expanded the Apostrophe Pharmacy facility and opened an approximately 25,000 square foot facility in Phoenix, Arizona. The Affiliated Pharmacies together enable seamless drug delivery, and drive increased operating leverage across the platform by allowing us to further personalize and consolidate shipping of orders as well as expand capabilities quickly for adjacent and other new conditions. The Affiliated Pharmacies allow us to lower our cost structure by reducing some of the costs typically associated with contractual third-party pharmacy relationships. 
Expand into new geographies
Our strong brand and digital-first, cloud-based business model has driven rapid adoption in the U.S. Additionally, our model has been developed to be scalable and applicable across new markets and languages. We expanded into the United Kingdom in early 2021, and in June 2021, we completed our acquisition of U.K.-based Honest Health Limited, which is now Hims & Hers UK Limited (“HHL”), a company that offers health and wellness products and services. The acquisition of HHL has allowed us to expand our operations in the United Kingdom further. We believe our model will afford us further international expansion opportunities in Europe and beyond. We believe the consumer-focused services our model provides are applicable to a range of geographies across the world.
Affiliated Medical Groups, Providers, Health System Partnerships and Partner and Affiliated Pharmacies
Affiliated Medical Groups and Providers
Due to the prohibition on the corporate practice of medicine adopted by a majority of states in the U.S., we have contractual arrangements with Affiliated Medical Groups to enable their provision of clinical services to our customers. “Affiliated Medical Groups” are separate professional corporations or other professional entities owned solely by licensed physicians and that engage licensed healthcare professionals to provide telehealth consultations and related services, including applicable physician supervision of nurse practitioners and physician assistants. We are prohibited from owning a professional entity such as any of the Affiliated Medical Groups under the rules prohibiting the corporate practice of medicine. However, the Affiliated Medical Groups were incorporated and established with our assistance for the specific purpose of providing clinical services to patients through the Hims & Hers platform and have no other operations or activities outside of the provision of services through the Hims & Hers platform.
The Affiliated Medical Groups contract with or employ physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, and behavioral health providers (each, a “Provider”) to provide telehealth consultations and related services on the Hims & Hers platform. We enter into certain contractual agreements with the Affiliated Medical Groups and their physician owners, including administrative services agreements and continuity agreements, under which we serve as an administrative services manager for the Affiliated Medical Groups for the non-clinical aspects of their operations and receive a fixed administrative fee from each Affiliated Medical Group for these services. The administrative services and support we provide include IT products and support, including the Hims & Hers platform and electronic medical record system, billing and collection services, non-clinical personnel, customer service support, administrative support for provider credentialing and quality assurance, and other non-clinical items and services, including access to a line of credit we make available to the Affiliated Medical Groups as necessary to support their operations. The Affiliated Medical Groups retain sole control of clinical decision-making and the practice of medicine. We are the exclusive administrative services provider for the Affiliated Medical Groups, and the Affiliated Medical Groups provide services to patients exclusively through the Hims & Hers platform. Our arrangements with the Affiliated Medical Groups generally have initial ten-year terms with renewal options. These arrangements are reviewed and updated periodically to address changing regulatory or market conditions. 
Health System Partnerships
The strength of the Hims & Hers brand affords us numerous opportunities to partner with and offer new solutions to help transform existing healthcare stakeholders. We have relationships with leading health systems including Ochsner Health, Mount Sinai Health System, Privia, Carbon Health, and ChristianaCare Health System to provide a clinically focused, telehealth-enabled patient care collaboration. These relationships offer our customers access to applicable in-person care within these systems to enhance their overall healthcare experience. These collaborations, which are intended to help Hims & Hers customers obtain in-person care not accessible through the Hims & Hers platform, do not involve any monetary exchange, compensation, or other financial incentives between the parties. For primary care prescriptions, we also allow customers to seamlessly fulfill their prescription for same day delivery through Capsule and Alto in select markets.
Partner and Affiliated Pharmacies
We have entered into contractual arrangements with three licensed pharmacies (sometimes referred to herein as “Partner Pharmacies”), PostMeds, Inc. (d/b/a TruePill), EHT Pharmacy LLC (d/b/a Curexa Pharmacy), and ITC Inc. (d/b/a ITC Compounding Pharmacy) for fulfillment and distribution of certain prescription and non-prescription products available through the Hims & Hers platform. We are not bound by any exclusivity or minimum order requirements with respect to our use of each pharmacy, and have the ability to utilize other pharmacies at our discretion. The contractual arrangements with the pharmacies are typically for one-year terms with automatic renewals, subject to standard termination rights of the parties. The pharmacies’ rates are fixed in the contractual arrangements and changes require the mutual agreement of the parties.
We have also entered into service agreements with each of our Affiliated Pharmacies. 
Regulatory Environment
As a consumer-focused health and wellness company delivering comprehensive telehealth technologies and services and health and wellness products (prescription and over-the-counter), in addition to the typical legal and regulatory considerations faced by a technology-based company, we are required to comply with complex healthcare laws and regulations, and consumer protection laws and regulations, all at both the state and federal level. Our business and operations are subject to extensive regulation, including with respect to the practice of medicine, the use of telehealth, relationships with healthcare providers, privacy and security of personal health information, product safety and pharmacy operations.
Government regulation of healthcare generally
Generally speaking, the healthcare industry is one of the most highly regulated industries in the United States. Healthcare-related businesses are subject to a broad array of governmental regulation at the federal, state, and local levels. While portions of our business are subject to significant regulations, some of the more well-known healthcare regulations do not apply to the Company because of the way our current operations are structured. We currently accept payments only from our customers—not any third-party payors, such as government healthcare programs or health insurers. Because of this approach, we are not subject to many of the laws and regulations that impact other participants in healthcare industry. If we begin accepting reimbursement payments from insurance providers or other third-party payors such as a government program, we will become subject to some of these additional healthcare laws and regulations.
Irrespective of our business model, the healthcare industry is subject to changing political, economic and regulatory influences that may affect health and wellness companies like Hims & Hers. During the past several years, the healthcare industry has been subject to an increase in governmental regulation and subject to potential disruption due to legislative initiatives and government regulation, as well as judicial interpretations thereof. While these regulations may not directly impact us or our offerings in any given case, they will affect the healthcare industry as a whole and may impact customer use of the Company’s solutions. If the government asserts broader regulatory control over companies like us or if we accept payment from and/or participate in third-party payor programs in the future, the complexity of our operations and our compliance obligations will materially increase.
Government regulation of the practice of medicine and telehealth
The practice of medicine is subject to various federal, state, and local certification and licensing laws, regulations, approvals and standards, relating to, among other things, the qualifications of the provider, the practice of medicine (including specific requirements when providing health care utilizing telehealth technologies and the provision of remote care), the continuity and adequacy of medical care, the maintenance of medical records, the supervision of personnel, and the prerequisites for the prescription of medication and ordering of tests. Because the practice of telehealth is relatively new and rapidly developing, regulation of telehealth is evolving and the application, interpretation and enforcement of these laws, regulations and standards can be uncertain or uneven. Similarly, the ability of the Affiliated Pharmacies to fulfill prescriptions and distribute pharmaceutical products, including compounded pharmaceutical products, is dependent upon the laws that govern licensed pharmacies and the fulfillment and distribution of prescription medication and other pharmaceutical products, which include in some cases requirements relating to telehealth. As a result, we must continually monitor legislative, regulatory, and judicial developments regarding the practice of medicine, telehealth and pharmaceutical laws in order to support the Affiliated Medical Groups and the Affiliated Pharmacies.
Physicians, mid-level providers (e.g., physician assistants, nurse practitioners), and behavioral health providers who provide professional clinical services via telehealth must, in most instances, hold a valid license to provide the applicable professional services in the state in which the patient is located. We have established systems to assist the Affiliated Medical Groups in ensuring that their providers are appropriately licensed under applicable state law and that their provision of telehealth to our customers occurs in each instance in compliance with applicable rules governing telehealth.
Additionally, there may be limitations placed on the modality through which telehealth services are delivered. For example, some states specifically require synchronous (or “live”) communications and restrict or exclude the use of asynchronous telehealth modalities, which is also known as “store-and-forward” telehealth. However, other states do not distinguish between synchronous and asynchronous telehealth services. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, some state and federal regulatory authorities lowered certain barriers to the practice of telehealth in order to make remote healthcare services more accessible. Due to our business model, these changes did not dramatically change our operations, but these changes did introduce many people to the practice of telehealth. It is unclear whether these changes will have a long-term impact on the adoption of telehealth services by the general public or legislative and regulatory authorities. 
Corporate practice of medicine laws in the U.S.; Fee splitting
In certain jurisdictions, the corporate practice of medicine doctrine generally prohibits non-physicians from practicing medicine, including by employing physicians to provide clinical services, directing the clinical practice of physicians, or holding an ownership interest in an entity that employs physicians. Some states have similar doctrines with respect to other professional licensure categories, including behavioral health services and providers. Other practices, such as professionals splitting their professional fees with non-professional persons or entities, is also prohibited in some jurisdictions. Many states also limit the extent to which nurse practitioners and physician assistants can practice independently and require that they practice under the supervision of or in collaboration with a supervising physician. These laws are intended to prevent unlicensed persons from interfering with or unduly influencing a physician’s professional judgment. State laws and enforcement activities related to the corporate practice of medicine and fee-splitting vary dramatically. In some states, even activities not directly related to the delivery of clinical services may be considered an element of the practice of medicine. For example, in some states the corporate practice of medicine restrictions may be implicated by non-clinical activities such as scheduling, contracting, setting rates, and the hiring and management of non-clinical personnel.
Because of the restrictions on the corporate practice of medicine doctrine and fee-splitting in various jurisdictions, we do not employ the healthcare providers who provide clinical services on the Hims & Hers platform. Instead, the Affiliated Medical Groups provide services on the platform and we contract with but do not own the Affiliated Medical Groups. The Affiliated Medical Groups and their providers maintain exclusive authority regarding the provision of healthcare services (including consults that may lead to the writing of prescriptions) and remain responsible for retaining and compensating their providers, credentialing decisions regarding their providers, maintaining professional standards, maintaining clinical documentation within medical records, establishing their own fee schedule, and submitting accurate information to us so that we can bill customers. Despite our care in structuring arrangements with the Affiliated Medical Groups, it is possible that a regulatory authority or another party, including providers affiliated with Affiliated Medical Groups, could assert that we (or other organizations with similar business models) are engaged in the corporate practice of medicine or that the contractual arrangements with Affiliated 
Medical Groups violate a state’s fee-splitting prohibition. Failure to comply with these state laws could lead to materially adverse consequences for the Company.
U.S. Federal and State fraud and abuse laws
Participants in the United States healthcare industry are subject to extensive federal and state regulation with respect to kickbacks, physician self-referral arrangements, false claims, and other fraud and abuse issues. For example, the federal anti-kickback law (the “Anti-Kickback Law”) prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, receiving, or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, arranging for, or recommending of an item or service that is reimbursable, in whole or in part, by a federal health care program. The federal False Claims Act imposes liability on any person or entity that, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment to the federal government. The penalties for violating these laws can be severe, including criminal and civil penalties, imprisonment, and possible exclusion from the federal health care programs. In addition, the federal ban on physician self-referrals, commonly known as the “Stark Law,” prohibits, subject to certain exceptions, physician referrals of Medicare patients to an entity providing certain “designated health services” if the physician or an immediate family member of the physician has any financial relationship with the entity. 
Given our current operations, the Anti-Kickback Law, the federal False Claims Act, the Stark Law, and other laws that are tied to federal health care programs or commercial insurer reimbursement should not apply to our business. If the scope of these laws is extended to include a broader spectrum of activities or if we begin to accept reimbursement payments from insurance providers or other third-party payors such as a government program, we could become subject to these laws and need to modify our business model. Additionally, should we begin accepting reimbursement payments from insurance providers or other third-party payors, the Company will be subject to significantly increased compliance obligations and costs.
FDA regulation
Certain of the products available through our platform, and the third-party suppliers and manufacturers of these products, including pharmaceuticals, over-the-counter drugs, over-the-counter devices, cosmetics, and dietary supplements, are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and international, federal, state, and local authorities. These authorities can enforce regulations related to methods and documentation of the testing, production, compounding, control, safety, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, sterilization, storage, and shipping of products. Government regulations specific to pharmaceuticals are wide ranging and govern, among other things: the ability to bring a pharmaceutical to market, the conditions under which it can be sold, the conditions under which it must be manufactured, and permissible claims that may be made for such product. Certain of the products available through the Hims & Hers platform require approval by the FDA and are subject to the limitations placed by the FDA on the approved uses in the product prescribing information. Some of these products are prescribed by Providers on the platform for “off-label” uses (i.e., for a use other than that specifically authorized by the FDA for the medication in question). While Providers are legally permitted to prescribe medications for off-label uses, and although we believe our product promotion is conducted in material compliance with FDA and other regulations, if the FDA determines that our product promotion constitutes promotion of an unapproved use of an approved product or of an unapproved product, the FDA could request that we modify our product promotion or subject us to regulatory and/or legal enforcement actions, including the issuance of a warning letter, injunction, seizure, civil fine, and criminal penalties. It is also possible that other federal, state, or foreign enforcement authorities might take action if they consider the product promotion to constitute promotion of an unapproved use of an approved product or of an unapproved product, which could result in significant fines or penalties under other statutes, such as laws prohibiting false claims for reimbursement.
Certain of the products available through our platform are compounded drug products under Section 503A of the Federal Food, Drug & Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”). While we believe the compounded drug products available through our platform meet the requirements for exemption under Section 503A of the FDCA, if the FDA were to determine that such products do not meet the requirements for exemption, the FDA could subject us, our Affiliated Pharmacies, Partner Pharmacies, Affiliated Medical Groups or Providers to regulatory and/or legal enforcement actions, including the issuance of a warning letter, injunction, seizure, civil fine, and criminal penalties. Other federal, state, or foreign enforcement authorities might also take action against us or the Affiliated Pharmacies, Partner Pharmacies, Affiliated Medical Groups or Providers if they determine that compounded drug products available through our platform do not meet applicable legal or regulatory requirements. Regulatory and/or legal enforcement actions by the FDA or other federal, state, or foreign enforcement authorities could have material adverse consequences on the Company and/or its operations.
Health information privacy and security laws
Numerous U.S. state and federal laws and regulations govern the collection, dissemination, use, privacy, confidentiality, security, availability, integrity, and other processing of health information. We believe that, because of our operating processes, we are not a covered entity or a business associate with respect to our customers or services provided through our platform under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and the implementing regulations (“HIPAA”), which establishes a set of national privacy and security standards for the protection of protected health information by health plans, healthcare clearinghouses, and certain healthcare providers, referred to as covered entities, and the business associates with whom such covered entities contract for services. Notwithstanding that we do not believe that the Company meets the definition of a covered entity or business associate under HIPAA with respect to our customers or services provided through our platform, we have executed business associate agreements with certain other parties and have assumed obligations that are based upon HIPAA-related requirements. Because we need to use and disclose customers’ health and personal information in order to provide our services, we have developed and maintain policies and procedures to protect that information, including administrative, physical and technical safeguards. As our business operations continue to develop, including through the launch of new product offerings or the development of new services, we may collect additional sensitive health and personal information from our customers that could create additional compliance obligations and may increase our exposure to compliance and regulatory risks regarding the protection and dissemination of such information.
In addition to HIPAA, numerous other federal, state, and foreign laws and regulations protect the confidentiality, privacy, availability, integrity and security of health information and other types of personal information, including the California Confidentiality of Medical Information Act. These laws and regulations are often uncertain, contradictory, and subject to changing or differing interpretations. Additionally, these laws may be similar to or even more protective than, and may not be preempted by, HIPAA and other federal privacy laws, particularly with respect to highly sensitive personal information involving behavioral health or sexually transmitted disease. The privacy and data protection laws in many states in which we operate are more restrictive than HIPAA and/or may apply more broadly than HIPAA. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”) protects the personal information of California consumers regardless of the location of the business holding the information. The CCPA went into effect on January 1, 2020. Additionally, the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”), which took effect January 1, 2023, expands upon the rights and requirements implemented through the CCPA. The CPRA significantly modifies the CCPA, requiring the Company to incur additional costs and expenses and modify certain of our privacy practices. Virginia has similarly adopted a comprehensive privacy law, the Consumer Data Protection Act, which also took effect January 1, 2023. Colorado, Connecticut, and Utah have also passed comprehensive privacy laws, each which will take effect either in July or December of 2023. While these new state privacy laws emulate the CCPA/CPRA in many respects, each has requirements that will require particular assessment for compliance.
Where state laws are more protective than HIPAA or apply more broadly than HIPAA, we must comply with the state laws to which we are subject. In certain cases, it may be necessary to modify our planned operations and procedures to comply with these more stringent state laws. Not only may some of these state laws impose fines and penalties upon violators, but also some, unlike HIPAA, may afford private rights of action to individuals who believe their personal information has been misused. We expect new laws, rules and regulations regarding privacy, data protection, and information security to be proposed and enacted in the future; state laws are changing rapidly, numerous states are currently reviewing legislation that is similar to the CCPA and/or CPRA, and there is discussion of a new federal privacy law or federal breach notification law. 
Additionally, we are subject to the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) as implemented in the United Kingdom (the “UK GDPR”). The GDPR became effective in the European Union (“EU”) on May 25, 2018. Under the GDPR, data protection authorities have the power to impose significant administrative fines for violations, which may also lead to damages claims by data controllers and data subjects. The United Kingdom completed its withdrawal from the EU on January 31, 2020 in a process known as “Brexit,” and following the expiry of the Brexit transition period, which ended on December 31, 2020, the UK GDPR has been implemented in the United Kingdom. The UK GDPR sits alongside the UK Data Protection Act 2018 which implements certain derogations in the GDPR into UK law. Under the UK GDPR, companies not established in the UK but who process personal data in relation to the offering of goods or services to individuals in the UK, or to monitor their behavior, are subject to the UK GDPR - the requirements of which are (at this time) largely aligned with those under the GDPR and may lead to significant compliance and operational costs. On October 7, 2022, President Biden executed an Executive Order to implement a new European Union-U.S. Data Privacy Framework to address European concerns over international data transfers. If adopted by the EU, such framework is set to take effect in 2023.
Marketing
We are building a trusted brand focused on empowering consumers to feel great by providing modern personalized health and wellness experiences to consumers to address their health and wellness needs. From our launch, we have used a diverse 
marketing strategy to reach our customers. We advertise on digital media, social media, television, radio, out-of-home media, and various other media channels. We believe advertising in a diversified set of media channels is important to prevent overreliance on any single channel and to maximize the exposure of our brands to our desired customers. We also reach our customers through our own social media accounts, press coverage and public relations, internally developed educational and lifestyle content, presence in brick-and-mortar retail stores, and physical brand advertising campaigns. This overall strategy drives significant customer traffic to our platform, including direct type-in traffic and organic online search traffic.
Our marketing strategy is underpinned by a focus on analytics and data. We have built our team and systems to measure consumer behavior, including which types of consumers generate more revenue in their first purchase, generate more revenue over time, generate more gross profit from their purchases, and which types of consumers are most valuable over their lifetime. We also rigorously measure the effectiveness of our marketing budgets and the rate of return we generate from our marketing campaigns. The marketing team is accountable for driving a sufficient rate of return from their budgets. We view our marketing capabilities as a core strength of the Company and a key differentiator in the market.
Human Capital Management
People and Culture
At Hims & Hers, we are focused on providing an exceptional experience to our employees, while focusing on serving our customers. Our team is central to our mission to transform the health and wellness industry and to help the world feel great through the power of better health. We believe that celebrating multiple approaches and perspectives allows us to better meet the challenge of providing access to people-centered, more personalized health and wellness solutions. We continue to look for intentional ways to expand our programs and initiatives to not only attract, develop, and retain top talent, but also to center the well-being of our people.
We strive to hire the best and brightest talent across the industry with a focus on individuals determined to improve access to health and wellness solutions for millions. As of December 31, 2022, our team was comprised of 651 full-time employees across various functions. 
We took prompt action to protect our employees’ health in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including closing our offices in March 2020 and shifting to an official remote-first policy in June 2020. We have heavily invested in the software, tools, and culture that allow our company to be a leading force in the new remote-work environment. Not only has this allowed us to maintain and enhance our commitment to quality, our management team believes it has also provided a real competitive advantage by attracting diverse talent and garnering new geographic exposure. Because we prioritize hiring team members with a variety of lived experiences, we believe we get the benefit of more multi-faceted and nuanced insight into the customers we serve. This also ensures that our internal community reflects our vision for an equity-centered, inclusive workforce. 
We aim to create an environment of mutual trust, confidence, and inclusion to provide opportunity for growth and recognition, with the ultimate goal of helping more customers feel great through providing access to better health and wellness solutions. We are a company with a growth mindset. To that end, we gauge our employees’ level of engagement and satisfaction through annual engagement surveys. We leverage these surveys to gather information to ensure we hear directly from our employees on their personal work experiences and how we can continue working to manifest our value set. We evaluate the data obtained through employee feedback to architect learning pathways and experiences that are truly valuable to our employees. For example, in 2022 we launched people manager training and labs as well as effective communication training across the organization. We are continually working to improve our process and policies to align with our growing and evolving workforce. 
Further, we have committed to, and formalized, employee development programs that are focused on feedback, coaching and employee development. Programming includes a formalized performance review process that includes a self-evaluation process and a manager self-evaluation process, together with training and resources on how to approach these evaluations.
We also offer our employees a holistic total rewards package with premier benefit and well-being programs intended to fit the needs of our employees and their family members. In addition to standard medical coverage, we offer employees dental and vision coverage, health savings and flexible spending accounts, employee assistance programs, short-term and long-term disability coverage, and life insurance. We also offer a 401(k) Savings Plan and the ability to participate in our Employee Stock Purchase Plan to all U.S. employees. In addition, the majority of our employees are eligible for equity awards, depending on 
function, to align incentives and provide the opportunity to share in the Company’s financial success. Additionally, our paid time off programs enable and encourage our workforce to enjoy personal time away from their job responsibilities. We also offer generous parental leave benefits for eligible employees.
Commitment to highest standards of provider quality
In addition to our employees, as of December 31, 2022, 542 medical providers located throughout all 50 states in the U.S. provided services on the Hims & Hers platform through the Affiliated Medical Groups. These medical professionals adhere to a rigorous set of assessments and all credentials, licenses, and qualifications are cross-checked against federal, state, and other agencies. The Affiliated Medical Groups implement comprehensive processes, including written testing, to ensure adequate clinical skill and quality. Testing results are reviewed by an advisory board of physicians, with only the most qualified applicants approved by the Affiliated Medical Groups to provide consultations on the Hims & Hers platform. This rigor in provider selection ensures a strong culture of high standards focused around improving health and wellness outcomes for our customers.
Competition
Consumers have historically accessed the healthcare system in the U.S. through an antiquated model focused around brick-and-mortar healthcare providers and cost coverage through commercial and government payor programs. At the same time, many consumers are not aware of the relative affordability, convenience, and accessibility of care through the use of telehealth. Much of our marketing efforts since our founding have thus focused on consumer education around these capabilities and the underlying conditions that providers on our platform can help treat. The relatively low (albeit rapidly increasing) penetration of telehealth implies that there is a significant market opportunity as consumers continue to shift their behavior.
While we believe there are currently no direct competitors that offer the full suite of solutions and direct-to-consumer touch points as we do, there are several companies that offer components of telehealth or address conditions that compete with our solutions.
•In direct-to-consumer health and wellness, we compete with traditional healthcare providers, pharmacies, and large retailers that sell non-prescription products, including, for example, nutritional supplements, dermatology products, and hair care treatments.
•In direct-to-consumer healthcare, our competition is largely fragmented and consists of many competitors that are smaller in scale and/or are more niche in focus with respect to the conditions they treat. Within parts of the sexual health and hair loss market, we also compete mostly with private organizations with similar product offerings for consumers and/or similar pharmacological capabilities, including compounding capabilities.
•In telehealth and health and wellness management, we compete with other providers that are larger in scale and generally provide telehealth on behalf of self-insured employers and insurance plans. Within parts of the behavioral health market, we also compete with public and private organizations with similar product offerings for consumers.
Intellectual Property
Our ability to obtain and maintain intellectual property protection for our proprietary technology platform, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets, and operate without violating the intellectual property rights of others is important to our success. We have a number of measures to protect our intellectual property and brand, including trademarks, confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements, and employee non-disclosure and invention assignment agreements, to establish and protect our proprietary rights. Despite these efforts, there can be no assurance that we will adequately protect our intellectual property.
As of December 31, 2022, we held 19 registered trademarks in the U.S. and 135 in non-U.S. jurisdictions, and 27 pending trademarks in the U.S. and 99 in non-U.S. jurisdictions, including pending trademarks for our brand, Hims & Hers. We obtained our first registered trademark in December 2018 with the majority of our trademark registrations obtained between 2019 and 2022. Each trademark registration is due for renewal within ten years from the date of its respective registration date and may be renewed in ten year intervals thereafter.
