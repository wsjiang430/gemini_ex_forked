ITEM 1. BUSINESSOverview
Elanco Animal Health Incorporated and its subsidiaries (collectively, Elanco, the Company, we, us, or our) is committed to helping our customers improve the health of animals in their care, while also making a meaningful impact on the communities we serve. As a global independent animal health leader, we are dedicated to innovating and delivering products and services to prevent and treat disease in pets and farm animals, creating value for pet owners, veterinarians, farmers, stakeholders, and society as a whole. With presence in more than 90 countries, our diverse, durable portfolio serves animals across our core species consisting of: dogs and cats (collectively, pet health) and cattle, poultry, swine, sheep and aqua (collectively, farm animal). Through our One Elanco culture, our commitment to excellence, and ownership of our decisions, we strive to always create positive outcomes for our customers, empowering them to share our vision of Food and Companionship Enriching Life.
Formerly a business unit of Eli Lilly and Company (Lilly), we became independently incorporated on September 18, 2018. After two years of operating as a standalone company, we acquired Bayer Animal Health in August 2020, marking the largest acquisition in industry history. This addition has allowed us to expand our portfolio to provide a more comprehensive set of animal health solutions while expanding our omni-channel presence, allowing our customers to shop where and how they want. As a result, we have increased scale and reach as well as a more balanced portfolio between pet health and farm animal. Refer to “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 6: Acquisitions, Divestitures and Other Arrangements” for additional information. 
We are committed to fulfilling our customer promise: We will rigorously innovate to benefit our customers and improve the health of animals.
We expect to capitalize on growth opportunities by advancing our pipeline of innovation and optimizing existing products, as well as through strategic business development. In 2022 and 2021, we launched nine new products in major geographies and delivered many geographic expansion and life cycle management enhancements of existing products across pet health and farm animal. Additionally, in 2021, we advanced our opportunities to access the fast-growing pet dermatology market through the acquisition of KindredBio, adding three potential pipeline blockbusters with launches beginning as early as 2024. As part of the acquisition, we also secured full ownership of the canine parvovirus therapy that is expected to be conditionally approved by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) in the first quarter of 2023. For further discussion of our recent business development initiatives, see the Overview section within "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 6: Acquisitions, Divestitures and Other Arrangements.”
We have continuously strengthened and expanded our three-pronged strategy: Innovation, Portfolio and Productivity. It remains our foundation for sustained growth and profitability. We expect revenue growth through mid-decade to be led by a number of new launches in key market segments and in areas that balance and strengthen our portfolio. For our existing products, we intend to maximize value by investing in focus brands, those significant pet health, poultry and aqua brands that are accretive to our growth. Elanco’s core brands, the vast portion of our aggregate portfolio, are expected to remain stable and/or grow slightly. This part of our strategy is then balanced with defend brands (e.g., Rumensin™, Trifexis™ and the Advantage Family), which are highly profitable and material brands where we intend to maximize profitability and preserve sales. We expect that launch excellence, price, geographic focus, digital and expanding omni-channel leadership will be key enablers of growth.
 In addition, we continue to enhance our approach to sustainability and environmental, social, and governance (ESG), which is focused on four interconnected pillars, called Elanco's Healthy Purpose™, to create a meaningful impact today and for years to come:
Healthier Enterprise: Growing our business with integrity and excellence with respect to all stakeholders, where all employees feel safe, engaged and accountable as owners.
Healthier Animals: Helping pets and farm animals live healthy, quality lives by continuously expanding our portfolio, while identifying new and innovative animal care products, practices, and services.
Healthier People: Improving people’s lives and livelihoods by promoting animal companionship and enabling sustainable production of meat, milk, fish and eggs. 
Healthier Planet: Minimizing our own environmental footprint, while leveraging product and service innovations to help our stakeholders advance their sustainability efforts.
In 2022 and 2021, our business, operations, financial condition and results have been impacted by worldwide economic conditions. The global economy has been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and the conflict between Russia and Ukraine as well as supply chain disruptions and inflationary pressures. We continue to monitor these factors and have worked with our customers, employees, suppliers and other stakeholders to mitigate their impacts. For additional information, see the Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations section within "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," "Item 1A. Risk Factors – We could experience demand, supply and operational challenges associated with the effects of a human disease outbreak, epidemic, pandemic or other widespread public health concern," and "Item 1A. Risk Factors – Significant portions of our operations are conducted in foreign jurisdictions, including jurisdictions presenting a high risk of bribery and corruption, and are subject to the economic, political, legal and business environments of the countries in which we do business.”
Commercial Operations
We operate our business in a single segment directed at fulfilling our vision of food and companionship enriching life – all to advance the health of animals, people and the planet. For additional information about our business segment, refer to “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 18: Geographic Information.” 
We advance our vision by offering products in these two primary categories:

Pet Health: Our portfolio is focused on parasiticides, vaccines and therapeutics. We have one of the broadest parasiticide portfolios in the pet health sector based on indications, species and formulations, with products that protect pets from worms, fleas and ticks. Our Seresto™ and Advantage™, Advantix™, and Advocate™ (collectively referred to as the Advantage Family) products are over-the-counter treatments for the elimination and prevention, respectively, of fleas and ticks, and complement our prescription parasiticide products, Credelio™, Interceptor Plus™, and Trifexis. Our vaccines portfolio provides differentiated prevention coverage for a number of important pet health risks and is available in the U.S. only. In therapeutics, we have a broad pain and osteoarthritis portfolio across species, modes of action, indications and disease stages. Pet owners are increasingly treating osteoarthritis in their pets, and our Galliprant™ product is one of the fastest growing osteoarthritis treatments in the U.S. Additionally, we have products that offer treatment for otitis (ear infections) with Claro™, as well as treatments for certain cardiovascular and dermatology indications.
Farm Animal: Our farm animal portfolio consists of products designed to prevent, control and treat health challenges, primarily focused on cattle (beef and dairy), swine, poultry, and aquaculture (cold and warm water) production. Our products include medicated feed additives, injectable antibiotics, vaccines, insecticides, and enzymes, among others. We have a wide range of farm animal products, including Rumensin and Baytril™, both of which are used extensively in ruminants (e.g., cattle, sheep and goats). In poultry, our Maxiban™ product is a valuable offering for the control and prevention of intestinal disease. 

Our reported revenue for each product category is as follows:
Contract manufacturing represents revenue from arrangements in which we manufacture products on behalf of a third party, including supply agreements associated with divestitures of products related to the acquisition of Bayer Animal Health.
International Operations
Our operations are conducted globally, and we sell our products in over 90 countries. Emerging market economies are an important component of our growth strategy to advance as a global leader in the animal health industry and will serve as the base upon which we build our commercial and local innovation capabilities. 
Revenues from operations outside the U.S. of $2,446 million accounted for 55% of our total revenues in 2022. By total revenues, China, Brazil, and the U.K. are our largest markets outside the U.S. 
 The following graph illustrates our reported revenue by our key geographic regions:
Products
We have a diverse portfolio of products marketed under approximately 200 brands, including products for both pets and farm animals.
Our pet health products help veterinarians and pet owners better care for pets. We partner with our customers for the purpose of providing a consistent flow of innovative and effective products and support. Our R&D focuses on products that prevent and treat disease, improve and extend quality of life and improve the type of care received by pets. We also partner closely with veterinarians to provide technical support and case management for our products. Pet health products represented approximately 48% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022.
Our farm animal products are designed to enable producers to keep animals healthy and deliver more food while using fewer resources. Our antibacterials, anticoccidials, vaccines and parasiticides aim to make food safer by preventing and controlling disease. We offer products and support to enhance the integrity of the food supply, while our productivity enhancers help make food more affordable and abundant by increasing the amount of meat or milk an animal can supply. Furthermore, our expertise and data analytics help our customers improve production efficiency and business performance. Farm animal products represented approximately 50% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022.
We group our products into two principal categories, Pet Health and Farm Animal. Refer to the "Commercial Operations" section above for additional information.
In 2022, our top selling products as a percentage of total revenue were as follows:

Seasonality
While many of our products are sold consistently throughout the year, we do experience seasonality in our pet health business due to increased demand for certain parasiticide product offerings in the first half of the year. For example, based upon historical results, approximately 75% and 60% of total annual revenue contributed by our higher-margin parasiticide products Seresto and Advantage Family, respectively, has occurred during the first half of the year, which is reflective of the flea and tick season in the Northern Hemisphere. 
Antibiotics
Antimicrobial resistance in humans, or the risk that bacterial pathogens that cause infectious disease in humans evolve or otherwise emerge that are resistant to antibiotics or other antimicrobials, is a significant health concern, and animal agriculture can play a role in mitigating this risk. As a company dedicated to the health and well-being of animals, we seek to help veterinarians and farmers responsibly use antibiotics when treating animals. In our efforts to address antibiotic resistance while protecting animal health, we introduced a global antibiotic stewardship plan focused on increasing responsible antibiotic use; reducing the need for shared-class antibiotics; and replacing antibiotics with alternatives to help livestock producers treat and prevent animal disease. Antibiotics, used responsibly, along with good animal care practices, help enhance food safety and animal well-being.
There are two classes of antibiotics used in animal health:
Animal-only antibiotics and ionophores: Not all pathogens that cause disease in animals are infectious in humans, and accordingly, animal-only antibiotics are not used in human medicine. Ionophores are a special class of animal-only antimicrobials uniquely developed only for use in animals. In Europe and certain other jurisdictions, ionophores are not currently classified as antibiotics. Because of their animal-only designation, mode of action, and spectrum of activity, their use is not considered to create the same risk of resistance in human pathogens.
Shared-class antibiotics: These are used in both humans and animals. Some antibiotics are used to treat infectious disease caused by pathogens that occur in both humans and animals. Of the 18 major antibiotic resistance threats that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention tracks, two are associated with infectious disease in animals. As part of our global antibiotic stewardship plan and in compliance with the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) guidance, shared-class antibiotics are labeled only for the treatment of an established need in animals and only with veterinarian oversight.
We have intentionally shifted away from shared-class antibiotics, and are focusing on animal-only antibiotics, as well as antibiotic-free solutions. In 2022, 8% of our revenue was from products classified as shared-class antibiotics (3% from sales in the U.S. and 5% from international sales), which is down from 9% in 2021. Revenue from animal-only antibiotics and ionophores represented 15% of our total revenue in 2022 (13% from ionophores), which is up from 14% in 2021. Through our policies and efforts in this area, we seek to protect the benefits of antibiotics in human medicine, while responsibly protecting the health of farm animals and the safety of our food supply.
Sales and Marketing
Through our global sales force comprised of approximately 2,010 sales representatives, our veterinary consultants and our key distributors, we seek to build strong customer relationships and fulfill demand for our pet health products primarily with veterinarians and, in some markets, pet owners, and for our farm animal products primarily with farm animal producers, veterinarians and nutritionists. 
In markets where we do not have a direct commercial presence, we generally contract with distributors that provide logistics and sales and marketing support for our products. In certain markets, we sell certain products directly to retailers. Our presence in retail channels has been expanded by our acquisition of Bayer Animal Health. 
Our sales representatives visit our customers, including consultants, veterinarians, farm animal producers, and resellers, to inform, promote and sell our products and to support customers. Our veterinary consultants are available to provide scientific consulting focused on disease management and herd management, training and education on diverse topics, including responsible product use, and generally have advanced degrees in veterinary medicine, veterinary nutrition or other agriculture-related fields. These direct relationships with customers allow us to better understand their needs. Additionally, our sales representatives and veterinary consultants focus on collaborating with our customers to educate and support them on topics such as local disease awareness and to help them adopt new and more sophisticated animal health solutions, including through the use of our products. As a result of these relationships, our sales and consulting visits provide us with access to customer decision makers. In addition, our sales and marketing organization provides enhanced value by supporting farm animal producers to help maximize their yields and reduce costs. Our analytics help customers analyze large amounts of health and production data. 
Customers
We primarily sell our pet health products to third-party distributors and retailers, as well as directly to veterinarians who typically then sell our products to pet owners. We primarily sell our farm animal products to third-party distributors and directly to a diverse set of farm animal producers, including beef and dairy farmers as well as pork, poultry and aquaculture operations. With the acquisition of Bayer Animal Health, we have expanded our presence in retail and e-commerce channels in order to meet pet owners where they want to purchase. Certain top selling pet health products acquired from Bayer Animal Health, including Seresto and the Advantage Family, are offered through these channels. Our largest customer, an affiliate of AmerisourceBergen Corp., is a third-party veterinary distributor and represented approximately 11% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022. Our next two largest customers, which are also third-party distributors, represented approximately 7% and 5%, respectively, of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022. 
Research and Development
Our R&D organization is comprised of internal research, development, regulatory and external innovation collaborations. As of December 31, 2022, we employed approximately 1,080 employees in our global R&D and Regulatory Affairs organizations. Our global R&D sites are comprised of the following:

International | | U.S. 
Kemps Creek, Australia | Shanghai, China | Greenfield, Indiana (R&D headquarters)
Monheim, Germany | Bangalore, India | Fort Dodge, Iowa 
Sao Paulo, Brazil | Basel, Switzerland | 

We incurred R&D expenses of $321 million in 2022, $369 million in 2021 and $329 million in 2020.
New product innovation is a core part of our business strategy. Our approach is a build, buy, or ally strategy to develop compelling innovations that originate from our scientists and innovators, academia, agribusiness, or external partners including human pharmaceutical, agriculture and biotechnology organizations. We focus our R&D investment on projects that target novel product introductions with new active ingredients, as well as products leveraging known active ingredients in new indications, presentations, combinations, and species expansion. 
We seek to concentrate our resources on projects that match our strategy and where we can leverage our broad technical and commercial capabilities. Specifically, our R&D focuses on seven areas across pets and farm animals. We have R&D activities in therapeutics, vaccines, monoclonals and parasiticides for pets. In farm animals, we are pursuing pharmaceuticals, vaccines, and sustainable animal protein projects.
Our R&D efforts are balanced across species, development phases and technology platforms. We apply large and small molecule approaches for both farm animals and pets. Additionally, we employ various delivery strategies for products, including in-feed, injectable, oral and topical formulations developed in conjunction with our manufacturing team to assure production that leverages the capabilities within our internal and external manufacturing network. 
Individuals lead our R&D organization with deep technical knowledge and substantial experience in discovery research, clinical sciences, and technological development across our pet health and farm animal product categories. We execute the R&D pipeline using a fully integrated global network of labs, service centers, and development sites supported by a network of third-party alliances. We also have a significant international regulatory operation that manages new product submissions and ensures ongoing compliance for our existing commercial portfolio. 
Portfolio investment decisions and prioritization are influenced by the probability of technical success, economic value, time to market, and portfolio fit and balance. We have a matrix organizational structure with dedicated and highly experienced project leaders with clinical, technical development and regulatory expertise and support systems. We believe this approach will allow us to consistently progress our multi-year innovation projects toward regulatory approvals, while ensuring clear visibility to the innovation portfolio composition, value, and progress. 
Manufacturing and Supply Chain
Our products are manufactured both at sites operated by us and sites operated by third-party contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs). We have a global manufacturing network of 18 sites comprised of the following:

International | | U.S. 
Barueri, Brazil | Kiel, Germany | Clinton, Indiana 
Prince Edward Island, Canada | Santa Clara, Mexico | Terre Haute, Indiana
Chengdu, China | Manukau, New Zealand | Fort Dodge, Iowa 
Wusi, China | Banwol, South Korea | Elwood, Kansas 
Huningue, France | Chungli, Taiwan | Kansas City, Kansas 
Cuxhaven, Germany | Binh Duong, Vietnam | Winslow, Maine 

Our global manufacturing and supply chain is also supported by a network of CMOs. As of December 31, 2022, this network was comprised of approximately 150 CMOs. Our external manufacturing network centrally governs our global CMO relationships and provides oversight to these CMOs.
We select CMOs based on several factors, including: (i) their ability to reliably supply products or materials that meet our quality standards at an optimized cost; (ii) their access to specialty products and technologies; (iii) capacity; (iv) financial analyses; and (v) local presence. Our external manufacturing network seeks to ensure that all the CMOs we use adhere to our standards of manufacturing quality.
We purchase certain raw materials necessary for the commercial production of our products from a variety of third-party suppliers. We utilize logistics service providers as a part of our global supply chain, primarily for shipping and logistics support.
We intend to continue our efficiency improvement programs in our manufacturing and supply chain organization. We have strong globally managed and coordinated quality control and quality assurance programs in place at all internal manufacturing sites and external manufacturing hubs, and we regularly inspect and audit our internal sites and CMO locations. 
Competition
We face intense competition globally. Competition may vary depending on the particular region, species, product category, or individual product. We compete principally on the basis of product quality, price, cost-effectiveness, promotional effectiveness, new product development and product differentiation. Certain products, both existing and new products that we introduce, may compete with other branded or generic products already on the market or that are later developed by competitors. When competitors introduce new products with ease-of-use, therapeutic or cost advantages, our products may become subject to decreased sales and/or price reductions.
Our primary competitors include animal health medicines and vaccines companies such as Zoetis Inc.; Boehringer Ingelheim Vetmedica, Inc., the animal health division of Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH; and Merck Animal Health, the animal health division of Merck & Co., Inc. We also face competition globally from manufacturers of generic drugs, as well as from producers of nutritional health products, such as DSM Nutritional Products AG and Danisco Animal Nutrition, the animal health division of E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company, a subsidiary of DowDuPont, Inc. There are also several new start-up companies working in the animal health area. In addition, we compete with numerous other producers of animal health products throughout the world.
Intellectual Property
Our technology, brands and other intellectual property are important elements of our business. We rely on patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, as well as regulatory exclusivity periods and non-disclosure agreements to protect our intellectual property rights. Our policy is to vigorously protect, enforce and defend our rights to our intellectual property, as appropriate.
Our product portfolio and certain product candidates enjoy the protection of approximately 6,500 patents and applications, filed in over 90 countries, with concentration in our major markets as well as other markets with strong patent systems, such as Australia, Brazil, Canada, Europe, Japan and the U.S. While many of the patents and patent applications in our portfolio are the result of our own work, others have been developed in collaboration with partners, acquired through business transactions, or licensed to us by third parties. A subset of our current products or product candidates are covered by patents and patent applications in our portfolio.
Patents for individual products expire at different times based on the date of the patent filing (or sometimes the date of patent grant) and the legal term of patents in the countries where such patents are obtained. Below is a summary of our recent and upcoming key patent expirations:
•Galliprant’s active ingredient, grapiprant, is encompassed by both compound and physical form patents in the U.S., Europe, Canada and other key markets, with terms expiring between October 2021 and March 2026. Expirations in 2021 related to compound patents in the U.S., Europe and Japan. Each of these markets have physical form patents that continue beyond 2021. At this time, there is no indication of market entry for a generic version of Galliprant in these regions. 
•Various formulation and method of use patents encompass the spinosad pesticide products, Comfortis and Trifexis. The Comfortis formulation patent extends through August 2025 in Europe but expired in August 2020 in the U.S., Canada and Australia. The Trifexis formulation and method of use patents extend through September 2026 in Europe but expired in September 2021 in the U.S., Canada and Australia. At this time, there are no indications of market entries for generic versions of Comfortis or Trifexis in the U.S., Canada or Australia.
•The Seresto formulation patent will expire in the U.S. in September 2027. In Europe, the formulation patents will expire in June 2025, but in some countries, including Spain and the U.K., supplementary protection certificates (SPCs) have been granted which expire in September 2026.
•The Milbemax formulation patents extend through July 2024 in the U.S., Europe, and other key markets.
•Certain legacy Advantage Family products acquired from Bayer Animal Health, including Advantage, Advantix, Advocate, and Advantage Multi are off patent.
We typically maintain all of our patents and assert our patent rights against third parties as appropriate.
Additionally, many of our vaccine products, including the TruCan family of vaccines, are based on proprietary or patented master seeds and formulations. We actively seek to protect our proprietary information, including our trade secrets and proprietary know-how, through a variety of means, including by seeking to require our employees, consultants, advisors and partners to enter into confidentiality agreements and other arrangements upon the commencement of their employment or engagement.
We seek to file and maintain trademarks around the world based on commercial activities in most regions where we have, or desire to have, a business presence for a particular product. We currently maintain more than 14,500 trademark applications and registrations in major regions, primarily identifying products dedicated to the care of livestock and pets.
Regulatory
The sale of animal health products is governed by the laws and regulations specific to each country in which we sell our products. To maintain compliance with these regulatory requirements, we have established processes, systems, and dedicated resources with end-to-end involvement from product concept to launch and maintenance in the market. Our regulatory function is Elanco's key interface with the relevant authorities. It is responsible for applying for and obtaining the necessary registrations and post-approvals: extending them if appropriate (e.g., developing claims in additional species), updating (e.g., changes to shelf-life or manufacturing site), and ongoing monitoring of safety and efficacy through our global pharmacovigilance system. In this way, the regulatory function ensures registrations remain valid, and the products can continue to be sold. To effectively do this, the regulatory function actively engages in dialogue with the relevant authorities regarding their policies that relate to animal health products. In most of our markets, the relevant authority is separate from those governing human medicinal products.
United States
U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The regulatory body that is responsible for the regulation of animal health pharmaceuticals in the U.S. is the Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM), a division of the FDA. All manufacturers of animal health pharmaceuticals must demonstrate their products to be safe, effective and produced by a consistent method of manufacture as defined under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA). The FDA’s basis for approving a new animal drug application is documented in a Freedom of Information Summary. Post-approval monitoring of products is required by law, with reports being provided to the CVM’s Office of Surveillance and Compliance. Reports of product quality defects, adverse events, or unexpected results are maintained and submitted in accordance with the law. Additionally, as part of the drug experience report, we are required to submit all new information pertaining to the safety or effectiveness of a product, regardless of the source.
U.S. Department of Agriculture. The regulatory body in the U.S. for veterinary biologicals is the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). The Center for Veterinary Biologics within the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service in the USDA is responsible for the regulation of animal health biologicals, which includes but is not limited to vaccines, bacterins, allergens, certain antibodies, antitoxins, toxoids, immunostimulants, certain cytokines, antigenic or immunizing components of live microorganisms, and diagnostic components of natural or synthetic origin, or that are derived from synthesizing or altering various substances or components of substances such as microorganisms, genes or genetic sequences, carbohydrates, proteins, antigens, allergens or antibodies. All manufacturers of animal health biologicals must show their products to be pure, safe, effective and produced by a consistent method of manufacture as defined under the Virus Serum Toxin Act. Post-approval monitoring of products is required. Reports of product quality defects, adverse events or unexpected results are maintained and submitted in accordance with the agency requirements.
Environmental Protection Agency. The main regulatory body in the U.S. for veterinary pesticides is the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The EPA’s Office of Pesticide Programs is responsible for the regulation of most pesticide products applied to animals in accordance with a memorandum of understanding between the FDA and EPA for products that are subject to regulation under both the FFDCA and the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act. All manufacturers of animal health pesticides must show their products will not cause unreasonable adverse effects to humans or the environment as stated in the act. Within the U.S., individual state pesticide authorities must also approve pesticide products that have been approved by the EPA before distribution in that state. Post-approval monitoring of products is required, with reports provided to the EPA and some state regulatory agencies.
Food Safety Inspection Service. The FDA is authorized to determine the safety of substances (including “generally recognized as safe” substances, food additives and color additives), as well as prescribe their safe conditions of use. However, although the FDA has the responsibility for determining the safety of substances, the Food Safety and Inspection Service, the public health agency within the USDA, still retains, under the tenets of the Federal Meat Inspection Act and the Poultry Products Inspection Act and their implementing regulations, the authority to determine whether new substances and new uses of previously approved substances are suitable for use in meat and poultry products.
International
European Union (EU). We are governed by the following EU regulatory bodies in addition to each of the national regulatory bodies in the EU:
The European Medicines Agency (EMA) is a centralized agency of the EU responsible for the scientific evaluation of many of the Veterinary Medicinal Products (VMP) developed by pharmaceutical companies for use in the EU. The agency has a veterinary review section distinct from the medical review section for human products. The Committee for Veterinary Medicinal Products (CVMP) is responsible for scientific review of the submissions for VMP, including immunological products. If the CVMP concludes that all requirements for quality, safety and efficacy are met and the product benefits outweigh the risks, it issues a positive opinion that is forwarded to the European Commission, which takes the final decision following the European comitology procedure. The centralized marketing authorization is valid in all of the EU and in Northern Ireland. All countries that are not part of the EU but belong to the European Economic Area (EEA), i.e., Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, have been part of the scientific assessment done by the CVMP. These countries issue a national marketing approval in accordance with the European Commission's decision. 
If approval is sought for products that either cannot or do not need to follow the centralized procedure, approval can also be achieved by national approval in an EEA country agency. This national authorization can be mutually recognized by other EEA countries/EU member states (Mutual Recognition Procedure). In addition, national and mutual recognition can be done in a combined procedure (Decentralized Procedure).
A series of regulations, directives, guidelines, EU Pharmacopeia Monographs and other legislation provide the requirements for approval in the EU. In general, these requirements are similar to those in the U.S., requiring demonstrated evidence of purity, safety, efficacy and consistency of manufacturing processes.
The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) is the agency of the EU that provides scientific advice and communicates with respect to existing and emerging risks associated with the food chain. Based on EFSA’s mandate, it evaluates applications for feed additives, including coccidiostats, enzymes and several nutritionals for animals.
The European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) is the agency of the EU for the safe use of chemicals. Based on the ECHA’s mandate, it conducts the evaluation of biocides for the EU.
Since the U.K. formally left the EU on January 31, 2020, the Veterinary Medicines Directorate (VMD) became the main regulatory body in the U.K. responsible for regulating and controlling veterinary pharmaceuticals. The U.K. and the EU reached a trade deal in December 2020, which went into effect in May 2021. The agreement includes regulatory and customs cooperation mechanisms, as well as provisions supporting open and fair competition. The Northern Ireland protocol, which is part of the trade deal, requires that VMD follow EU rules in Northern Ireland. Laws applying to the rest of the U.K. could now diverge but currently remain largely aligned.
Brazil. The Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock Production and Supply (MAPA) is the regulatory body in Brazil that is responsible for the regulation and control of pharmaceuticals, biologicals and medicinal feed additives for animal use. MAPA’s regulatory activities are conducted through the Secretary of Agricultural Defense and its Livestock Products Inspection Department. In addition, regulatory activities are conducted at a local level through the Federal Agriculture Superintendence. These activities include the inspection and licensing of both manufacturing and commercial establishments for veterinary products, as well as the submission, review and approval of pharmaceuticals, biologicals and medicinal feed additives. MAPA is one of the most active regulatory agencies in Latin America, having permanent seats at several international animal health forums, such as Codex Alimentarius, World Organization for Animal Health and Committee of Veterinary Medicines for the Americas. 
Japan. The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fishery (MAFF) is the regulatory body in Japan that is responsible for the regulation and control of pharmaceuticals (including biologicals and pesticide/disinfectant) and feed additives/feed for animal use. MAFF’s regulatory activities are conducted through the Livestock & Aquaculture Product Safety Control Division under Consumer Safety Bureau. The animal drug reviews and approvals, reexamination reviews, GxP compliance checks, GxP site inspections and product assay checks (including vaccine national assays) are done by National Veterinary Assay Laboratory (NVAL). MAFF coordinates with other agencies such as Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (MHLW) and Food Safety Commission (FSC) to perform various license compliance checks (e.g., marketing authorization holder, manufacturer and oversea site accreditation) and ensure good promotional activities. Routine inspections, antimicrobial feed additive national assays and manufacturing inspections are done by the Food & Agriculture Material Inspection Center. For farm animal products, animal drug review is done by NVAL but the human food safety review is done by FSC (ADI establishment and antimicrobial risk assessment) and MHLW (MRL establishment). These three agencies (NVAL, FSC and MHLW) work together to approve farm animal products. In addition to those central government agencies, various licenses are delegated to the local municipal government, such as animal drug wholesaler and retailer licenses and feed additive distributor licenses.
China. The Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) is the regulatory body that is responsible for the regulation and control of pharmaceuticals, biologicals, disinfectants, medicinal feed additives, pesticide and feed/feed additives for animal use. There are three organizations under the MOA that regulate animal health:
The Institute of Veterinary Drug Control is responsible for the evaluation of new applications, renewals, variations, manufacturers, quality methods and tissue residue methods for pharmaceuticals, biologicals, disinfectants and medicinal feed additives.
The feed/feed additive office is responsible for the registration and renewal of feed and feed additives.
The pesticide bureau is responsible for the registration and renewal of pesticide products.
Australia. The Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority (APVMA) is an Australian government statutory authority where the registration of all agricultural and veterinary products into the Australian marketplace is centralized. The APVMA assesses applications from companies and individuals seeking registration so they can supply their product to the marketplace. Applications undergo assessment using the expertise of the APVMA’s scientific staff and drawing on the technical knowledge of other relevant scientific organizations, Commonwealth government departments and state agriculture departments. If the product works as intended and the scientific data confirms that when used as directed on the product label it will have no harmful or unintended effects on people, animals, the environment or international trade, the APVMA will register the product. The APVMA is also responsible for post-authorization oversight, which can include reviews of registered products. 
Rest of World. Country-specific regulatory laws typically have provisions that include requirements for certain labeling, safety, efficacy and manufacturers’ quality control procedures (to assure the consistency of the products), manufacturing site standards, as well as company records and reports. Other countries’ regulatory agencies typically either refer to some or all of the requirements of the U.S. or EU, but may have additional specific local requirements. Most authorities also consider the standards set by international animal health entities, including the World Organization for Animal Health, Codex Alimentarius and the International Cooperation on Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Registration of Veterinary Medicinal Products (VICH). 
Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives. The Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives is an international expert scientific committee that is administered jointly by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the World Health Organization (WHO). It provides a risk assessment/safety evaluation of residues of veterinary drugs in animal products, exposure and residue definition and maximum residue limit proposals for veterinary drugs. Similarly, the Joint FAO/WHO Meeting on Pesticide Residues (JMPR) is an international expert scientific group administered jointly by the FAO and WHO. JMPR reviews residues and analytical aspects of the pesticides, estimate the maximum residue levels, review toxicological data and estimate acceptable daily intakes for humans of the pesticides under consideration. Elanco works with this committee to establish acceptably safe levels of residual substances in food-producing animals after treatment with veterinary drugs or pesticides. This in turn enables the calculation of appropriate withdrawal times for our products prior to an animal entering the food chain.
Advertising and Promotion Review. Promotion of ethical animal health products is controlled by regulations in many countries. These rules generally restrict advertising and promotion to those claims and uses that have been reviewed and endorsed by the applicable agency. We conduct a review of promotion material for compliance with the local and regional requirements in the markets where we sell animal health products.
Import and Export of Products. The importation and exportation of animal health products is controlled by regulations in many countries. In some jurisdictions this may include obtaining separate permits or licenses by product or by company or filing notices with applicable regulatory agencies prior to import or export of product. We ensure compliance with local, regional and global regulations in the markets where we import/export our animal health products.
International Cooperation on Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Registration of Veterinary Medicinal Products. VICH is a trilateral (EU-Japan-U.S.) program launched in 1996 aimed at harmonizing technical requirements for veterinary product registration. Several other countries have obtained observer status, for example, Canada, New Zealand, Australia, South Africa, and the U.K., or are linked to VICH on the basis of the VICH Outreach Forum, a VICH initiative with the main objective of providing a basis for wider international harmonization of technical requirements. In addition, the World Organization for Animal Health is an associate member of VICH.
Human Capital 
Employees. As of December 31, 2022, we employed approximately 9,000 full time employees. In addition, we employed approximately 740 fixed-duration employees, which are individuals hired for a pre-defined length of time (one to four years). Together, they total approximately 9,740 employees worldwide. Of the 9,740 global employees, approximately 30% are U.S.-based and approximately 70% are employed in other jurisdictions. Some of these employees are members of unions, works councils, trade associations or are otherwise subject to collective bargaining agreements, including approximately 200 union employees located at our Fort Dodge, Iowa and Santa Clara, Mexico facilities. 
Our Culture. At Elanco, we are committed to fostering an inclusive culture where employees can make a difference, encouraging ownership, growth, and well-being. The following gives an overview of our approach to managing human capital resources.
We commit to create a culture built on the foundation of three values and four behavioral pillars:

Our employees are driven by these values and behavioral pillars. At Elanco, this culture drives employee performance. Leadership and employees are encouraged to evaluate performance with these values and behavioral pillars in mind. 
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion. We are focused on discovering new ways in which healthier animals can solve the world’s greatest health and environmental challenges, and this innovation is only possible through an inclusive culture of employees with diverse backgrounds, strengths, and perspectives. Our efforts to enhance diversity, equity and inclusion are critical to creating and maintaining our purpose-driven culture and strengthening our promises to our employees and customers.
Formed in 2015, our Global Elanco Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Council (EDEIC) serves as a catalyst for a culture where diversity, equity and inclusion are embraced and recognized as a business-result driver. Within this framework, employee development is better supported, opinions and diverse backgrounds are embraced, and we are a stronger company. Current EDEIC focus areas include our Be You! Seminar series to raise awareness and provide a forum for an open discussion on the importance of a diverse and inclusive workplace at Elanco, strong Employee Resource Groups, an annual Multi-Cultural Summit, and actionable goals for representation of women (globally) and people of color (U.S.) in leadership. 
Total Rewards. We invest in our workforce by offering competitive salaries, incentives, and benefits. Our pay for performance philosophy is designed to create ownership and help ensure that we attract and retain talent as well as reward and recognize top-performing employees through merit increases and other rewards. We benchmark our total rewards annually to ensure our compensation and benefit programs remain competitive with our peers. Our benefits are one way we support our employees’ well-being and live up to our employee promise. 
Development. We offer our employees opportunities to advance their careers at Elanco and are passionate about equipping employees with skills and development opportunities to help them thrive and continually meet the ever-changing needs of our customers and other stakeholders in a dynamic and growing industry. 
Beyond professional growth and development, Elanco employees actively engage in initiatives aligned to Elanco's Healthy Purpose, which is our ESG and sustainability framework, to advance the well-being of animals, people, the planet and our enterprise, enabling us to realize our vision of "Food and Companionship Enriching Life." 
Environmental, Health and Safety
We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign environmental, health and safety (EHS) laws and regulations. These laws and regulations govern matters such as: the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the ground, air or water; the generation, use, storage, handling, treatment, packaging, transportation, exposure to, and disposal of hazardous and biological materials, including recordkeeping, reporting and registration requirements; and the health and safety of our employees. Due to our operations, these laws and regulations also require us to obtain, and comply with, permits, registrations or other authorizations issued by governmental authorities. These authorities can modify or revoke our permits, registrations or other authorizations and can enforce compliance through fines and injunctions.
Certain environmental laws impose joint and several liability, without regard to fault, for clean-up costs on persons who have disposed of or released hazardous substances into the environment, including at third-party sites or offsite disposal locations, or that currently own or operate (or formerly owned or operated) sites where such a release occurred. We could be subject to liability for the investigation and remediation of legacy environmental contamination caused by historical industrial activity at sites that we own or on which we operate. In addition to clean-up actions brought by federal, state, local and foreign governmental entities, private parties could raise personal injury or other claims against us due to the presence of, or exposure to, hazardous materials on, from or otherwise relating to such a property.
We have made, and intend to continue to make, necessary expenditures for compliance with applicable EHS laws and regulations. We are also monitoring and investigating environmental contamination from past industrial activity at certain sites. We made no capital expenditures for environmental-related items in 2022. 
In connection with past divestitures, we have undertaken certain indemnification obligations that may require us, in the future, to conduct or finance environmental clean-ups at sites that we no longer own or operate. In connection with certain of our acquisitions, we have also entered into indemnification agreements pursuant to which we are, or may be, indemnified for various environmental clean-ups; however, such indemnities are limited in both time and scope and may be further limited in the presence of new information or may not be available at all.
