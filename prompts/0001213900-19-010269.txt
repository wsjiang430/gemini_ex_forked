History
 
Quantum Computing Inc. (“QCI” or the “Company”), was incorporated in the State of Nevada on July 25, 2001 as Ticketcart, Inc. Ticketcart’s original business plan involved in the sale of ink-jet cartridges online. Ticketcart offered remanufactured and compatible cartridges for Hewlett-Packard, Epson, Lexmark, and Canon inkjet printers. On July 25, 2007, Ticketcart, Inc. acquired Innovative Beverage Group, Inc. and changed its name to Innovative Beverage Group Holdings, Inc. (“IBGH”) to better reflect its business operations at the time which was beverage distribution and product development. In 2013, IBGH ceased operations. On May 22, 2017, one of IBGH’s. shareholders, William Alessi (the “Plaintiff”), filed suit against the Company alleging “(1) fraud; and (2) breach of fiduciary duties of care, loyalty and good faith to the Corporation’s shareholders.”   Mr. Alessi’s complaint alleged that the officers and directors of IBGH had abandoned it and allowed the Company’s assets to be wasted, causing injury to the Company and its shareholders.   Mr. Alessi sought damages of $30,000 for each claim, plus reimbursement of filing costs of $1,000, and the appointment of a Receiver for the Company. 
 
On August 28, 2017, the North Carolina Court, Superior Court Division (the “North Carolina Court”), entered a default judgment for Plaintiff and appointed an exclusive Receiver (the “Receiver”) over the Company. The default judgment provided that Innovative Beverage Group Holdings, Inc. was (i) to issue to the Plaintiff 18,500,000 shares of free-trading stock without registration under Section 3(a)(1) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, (ii) issue 100,000,000 shares of stock to Innovative Beverage Group Holdings, Inc.’s treasury, and (iii) that the receivership be terminated upon any change of control, and that any and all claims against Innovative Beverage Group Holdings, Inc. that were not submitted to the Receiver as of September 16, 2017, were disallowed. On October 4, 2017 the Receiver filed Articles of Incorporation in North Carolina for Innovative Beverage Group Holdings, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, (“IBGH North Carolina”). On October 26, 2017, Innovative Beverage Group, Inc. redomiciled to North Carolina.
 
On January 22, 2018, while the Company was in receivership, the Company sold 500,000 shares (the “CRG Shares”) of its common stock to Convergent Risk Group (“CRG”), an entity owned and operated by the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, Robert Liscouski, for $155,000. On February 21, 2018, by written consent of the majority shareholder (Convergent Risk), Mr. Robert Liscouski (the Chief Executive Officer of Convergent Risk) and Mr. Christopher Roberts were elected as members of the Company’s Board of Directors. Mr. Liscouski was simultaneously elected as Chairman of the Board. The majority shareholder also directed the Company to take the necessary action to change its domicile from North Carolina to Delaware and change its name to Quantum Computing Inc. On February 21, 2018 the Company filed Articles of Conversion in North Carolina to convert the Company to a Delaware corporation with the name changed to Quantum Computing Inc. On February 22, 2018 the Company filed a Certificate of Conversion in Delaware to convert to a Delaware corporation with the name changed to Quantum Computing Inc. and re-domiciled to the state of Delaware on February 23, 2018.
 
Our Company 
 
QCI focuses on quantum computing and artificial intelligence software development. We believe the quantum computer might be one of the most significant technological achievements in history, and may have the capacity to disrupt global industries. QCI intends to develop heterogeneous software that can run on the platforms that are under development by the quantum computer hardware industry. We intend to leverage our collective expertise in finance, computing, mathematics and physics to develop a suite of quantum software applications, and possibly hardware that may enable global industries to utilize quantum computers and simulators to improve their processes, profitability, and security. Our initial focus will be on the financial services sector. Other potential markets for quantum computing include artificial intelligence (“AI”), machine learning, encryption and security, genetics and pharmaceuticals. QCI intends to be a leading provider of software that can run on multiple quantum platforms.

Initially, the Company is focused on two main development efforts. Our first market focus is the development of quantitative financial related products such as financial portfolio optimization. The financial services industry has used quantitative financial software applications for several decades with some success. However, those existing products are limited in their performance due to the lack of computing power to solve these classes of optimization problems. We are developing software to address two sets of financial problems in the short term. The first is Asset Allocation. Our target clients are the Asset Allocation departments of large fund managers, who would use the system to optimally allocate investable cash into the different asset classes that they manage. The calculation is based on the returns and covariances (risk) of the various classes, along with any constraints that are specified. The second development effort involves yield curve trades including steepeners and flatteners. On a regular basis Fund Managers have to solve a problem of choosing one, two or any combination of several Treasury, Corporate or Municipal bonds with different weights, positive (long) or negative (short) which requires choosing a static or a dynamic portfolio of stocks, bonds, commodities, currencies or any other assets which has high probability of being profitable in the future. To bring our first financial software product to market will require completion of what we believe will entail three steps – finalizing the programming and testing of the underlying asset allocation algorithms and calculations (estimated at $200,000), final design, programming and testing of the Graphic User Interface or GUI (estimated at $150,000), and a sales and marketing campaign, including publicity and hiring sales staff (estimated at $150,000).
 
A longer range software development plan involves the optimization problems known as “NP Complete Problems” are a class of mathematical problems that can be solved in polynomial increments of time using a non-deterministic method. These NP Complete Problems require complex calculations, which cannot currently be performed in reasonable amounts of time using conventional, binary computer systems, with the exception of simple cases. These problems are intractable because of the inability of bit-based systems to handle complex non-deterministic problems. The recent developments in quantum annealing and other quantum hardware suggests that these problems will soon be solvable using these new technologies. The Company’s goal is to develop and implement quantum related algorithms to provide solutions to these NP Complete Problems in the area of financial optimization. Optimization algorithms are ideally suited to run on a class of quantum computers, known as “annealers,” that are currently becoming made available in the market by various manufacturers.
 
Our secondary market focus is on big data and Artificial Intelligence. Our team is developing and is partnering with Artificial Intelligence and Big Data firms to develop algorithms to identify behavioral trends and characteristics of people based on commercially available signals and geo-location data. Our focus on AI and Big Data have positioned the company to pursue contract opportunities in the US Government and commercial sector based on our organic experience and expertise in specific areas of terrorism and human behavior analysis. AI and Big Data are adjacent markets to quantum computing, and will soon require the ability to apply quantum computing capabilities as data sets exponentially grow in size and complexity.
 
Another market focus will be the field of cybersecurity, specifically encryption and decryption algorithms. Current encryption algorithms, such as DES (widely used in banking transactions), use codes based on the product of two very large prime numbers. To decrypt the message requires finding the factors of a very large number, which can be done with current computers, but takes unacceptably long amounts of time. The factorization process can be performed much more rapidly using algorithms running on a quantum computer. The other aspect of cybersecurity that we will work on is development of encryption algorithms that are either “quantum resistant”, i.e. difficult for quantum computer to crack, or “quantum based”, i.e., that use principals of quantum physics to create a quantum based code that is difficult for both conventional and quantum computers to break. Information security has a number of components, of which encryption is an important tool. Encryption is vital to e-commerce, banking, cellular communication, and protecting email, websites and online identities because unprotected data can be stolen and misused. The cyber security market, is expected to reach $170 billion by 2020 according to Forbes. The Research and Markets report “Global Quantum Cryptography Market Report 2017” dated March 21, 2018, estimates that the global quantum sector of the cryptography market will grow from $285.7 Million in 2017 to $943.7 Million by 2022. This report states that growing adoption of cloud computing and next generation wireless networks is driving the interest in quantum encryption solutions to data security concerns.
 
To achieve these goals, we have assembled a team with a combined over 100 years of experience in the financial services, quantitative and applied mathematics, quantum physics, AI and machine learning fields. We plan to file patents for new technology we may develop over the coming months based on our current progress, but we cannot guarantee this timeline or that we will be awarded any such patents. While true general-purpose quantum computing is still several years from being practical, special purpose quantum computers, known as annealers, are becoming available, as are some quantum simulators.
 
Our Strategy
 
QCI plans to enter the market for high performance computers and software applications, specifically focusing on what are known as “quantum computers”. The Company has assembled a team of experienced engineers in super computing technology and quantum mathematics, which will focus on both design and development of several quantum software applications that target solutions to problems including non-deterministic polynomial applications.
 
The Company has hired physicists, applied mathematicians (algorithm developers) and software developers to support the technical team in developing and designing quantum software applications. Applied mathematicians develop the algorithms and algorithm/software developers design software solutions utilizing the algorithms provided to them by mathematicians. Software engineers test the algorithm code to ensure reliable and accurate performance of the software product.
 
In addition, the Company has retained outside leading industry experts from well-known institutions from the financial services industry and leading financial institutions and expects to retain additional advisors from cybersecurity firms and government agencies to serve as technical advisors to the Company. We have formed an advisory board of additional subject matter experts, which is expected to assist us to shape our business strategy and direction as well as work with us to establish our market approach. QCI is also pursuing U.S. Government initiatives in quantum computing and AI, including grants and funding, that are fostering U.S. innovation in those domains.

QCI does not currently intend to be a hardware manufacturer. However, due to the cutting-edge nature of quantum computing and the high cost and limited availability of quantum computers, as well as limitations on the capabilities of existing quantum simulators, we may find it necessary over the next two years to develop our own quantum simulators upon which we can develop and test our quantum software products. If such development becomes necessary, our simulators are expected to emulate the characteristics and capabilities of a quantum computer such as superposition and quantum entanglement. Our plan is to license our software as a cloud based service, but we are not ruling out selling turn-key hardware systems that would incorporate and support our own quantum inspired computing solutions.
 
QCI’s technical leadership intends to leverage industry expertise and innovative methods to develop quantum computer application solutions capable of solving increasingly complex problems in a more rapid and thorough manner.  The Company will initially focus on addressing computational problems in the financial services, and cybersecurity quantum-secure encryption markets, followed later by addressing problems in the AI and genetics marketplaces. 
 
Initial Products in Development 
 
Financial Applications 
 
QCI’s initial product currently in design is a financial Portfolio Optimizer. This software will evaluate the potential return, risks, market volatility and transaction costs of different portfolios to help financial advisors and investment managers decide on the optimal investment approach. The planned functionality of this product will include real-time optimized portfolio construction and rebalancing, scenario analysis and stress testing, and “efficient frontier” derivation (calculation of the theoretically optimal balance within a portfolio of the maximum possible return at a given level of risk). Other features such as real-time market and credit risk exposure calculation and machine learning can be added later in a modular fashion. This product is intended to assist asset managers and investment firms balance portfolios, assess the risks of different strategies and plan trades. One of the most significant developments in financial markets in the past several decades has been the introduction of computerized trading based on highly sophisticated algorithms that monitor streams of financial data (primarily the trading prices, ranges and volumes of different stocks, options, bonds and derivatives, and even some commodities, in multiple markets around the world), compute the optimal time and price at which to make a purchase or sale, and instructs the trading desk to execute the trade. Computerized trading is fast, highly accurate, unburdened by human emotion or delays, and nearly instantaneous. Computerized securities trading, known as “algorithmic trading” or “high frequency trading” now comprises the majority of security trades on most exchanges according to CNBC, and the latest financial algorithms enable computers to make decisions and implement trades in microseconds, faster than a person is capable of achieving. A well designed financial algorithm and trading system can provide investors, whether private or institutional, with a competitive advantage enabling them to earn sizable profits. Development of these algorithms has been on-going for the past two quarters and the expectation is that we will have two beta customers for our two financial algorithms in Q3 of 2019. Once client beta testing has been completed we will hire dedicated sales staff to expand into the financial sector in 2020.
 
We believe that implementation of machine learning and AI into financial algorithms, aided by quantum computing, could drive improvements in algorithmic trading, making it less susceptible to herd behavior and dramatic fluctuations in market prices. In addition, quantum computing may be able to solve some of the complex problems of multi-security portfolio optimization and trade optimization that so far have eluded algorithms on conventional computers. We will begin a pilot test of this approach in the Q3/Q4 timeframe based on securing a final agreement with our AI partner.
 
Quantum Computing Inc. has established partnerships with a big data aggregator and Artificial Intelligence Software Development firm to develop an AI analysis prototype. Our AI and Big Data development project has been proposed to the US Government (though there is no guarantee that the government will award us a contract) and to commercial sector clients.
 
Cybersecurity Applications
 
The security or privacy of data on a computer is typically protected by passwords or encryption (codes) or multi-factor authentication or biometrics, or a combination of several of these techniques. Encryption is the process of converting readable data by means of a mathematical formula into a jumble of letters and numbers that can only be converted back to readable data by means of a related mathematical formula or key.
 
The Company intends to develop a proprietary approach to use early analysis of quantum key distribution and quantum encryption to discover advantageous security measures for our products. We intend to research the potential for the development of “data specific” quantum security packages. The goal of this product will be to offer data security solutions optimized for specific data formats and transactions.

Industry Overview
 
Conventional computers, whether they are in laptops, smartphones or large computer networks, all process “bits” of information coded as 1’s and 0’s in sequence, controlled by software. To increase the performance of a conventional computer, computer system designers have largely followed one of two paths, (i) increasing the size, speed and working memory of the central processor (the Cray supercomputer is an example of this approach) or (ii) linking large numbers of servers together through a high-speed, low-latency network and using special software to break the problem into large number of parts, each of which can be assigned to one of the servers for calculation, and then the software combines all the individual server outputs (this architecture is common in large “server farms”). Both architectures enable conventional high performance computers to perform billions of calculations per second. Super computers are used in a wide range of applications, including weather forecasting, pharmaceutical design, financial analysis and encryption/decryption.
 
The difference between a conventional super computer and a quantum computer is that a quantum computer uses quantum bits or “QBITS”, which are not limited in the way that conventional computer circuits are. A QBIT can be in any of three states, 1, 0 or a “superposition state” a quantum physics phenomenon in which the QBIT exists in multiple states simultaneously. Another quantum physics phenomenon, known as “entanglement” links the data in multiple QBITS. The superposition property of QBITS enables a quantum computer to process large amounts of data in a “parallel” fashion because the quantum QBITS are inherently able to exist in multiple states simultaneously, and are therefore able to evaluate multiple outcomes at the same time, instead of one at a time the way a conventional computer would. QBIT structure and quantum superposition allow for parallel processing, however this parallel processing is not what would be replicated by running several bit based computers in parallel. Instead, superposition allows us to assume a piece of data is in both the on and off state simultaneously. Therefore, for each QBIT in superposition in a quantum calculation, the complexity of the problems the calculation can solve increases exponentially by a power of two instead of having a linear progression. The combination of the entanglement and superposition properties theoretically enables a quantum computer to process massive numbers of calculations in parallel and thereby solve problems that are not solvable by conventional high performance computers in any realistic period of time.
 
Building a true quantum computer is not yet feasible with today’s technology because the most advanced QBITS are able to maintain a quantum state only for short periods of time, on the order of milliseconds, before outside interference from thermal vibration or electromagnetic fields causes them to “decohere” and lose the information they are processing. This decoherence process can be controlled in part by keeping the QBITS immersed in liquid helium at close to absolute zero temperature, and enclosing the entire computer in an electromagnetic shield or Faraday Cage, but these dramatically increase the cost of a quantum computer. Thus, improvements are needed in the QBITS themselves before quantum computing can become a reality.
 
Venture investors have placed $241 million into startups developing hardware or software worldwide per CB Insights as reported by WIRED Magazine in August of 2018. In the same article, reporting on the status of quantum development, it was also reported $1.3 billion in proposed new funding for quantum research was introduced to Congress in 2018. QCI is working with advisors to review the quantum research program and determine where the Company can bid on government quantum research and development procurements.
 
Competition
 
There are over 130 companies and research universities who are known to be engaged in research and development relating to quantum computing. In the area of quantum computer hardware systems, competitors include privately funded startups such as D-Wave, ATOS, and Rigetti Computing, as well as large IT firms such as Microsoft, IBM, and Google who have all announced laboratory projects focusing on developing quantum computers. Since 2013 Google has been working with NASA and the Universities Space Research Association to establish the Quantum Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, using quantum computers built by D-Wave. In March 2017 IBM announced a 17 QBIT prototype commercial processor and made accessible (via the IBM cloud) a 16 QBIT quantum computer for use by developers, programmers and researchers. In 2018 Intel announced a superconducting quantum test chip with 49 QBITS. In March 2018, Google announced it had a new quantum processor, codenamed “Bristlecone”. Microsoft has been active in quantum research since 2005 when the company established a research lab to study topological quantum computing. In December 2017 Microsoft released a preview version of its Quantum Development Kit. The National Security Agency has funded some research into quantum computing and encryption algorithms, but much of this work is classified so the nature of the work and the companies performing it are not known. D-Wave has been developing quantum computers since 2004 and has several computer products on the market.

Competition in quantum software applications is likely to come from established IT firms such as Microsoft and Google, but there are also several private companies such as 1Qbit, a startup venture focused on developing quantum computing applications for the finance industry. Rigetti Computing, a US based quantum computing startup, announced in late 2017 that it was working on a hybrid quantum algorithm, one that would use conventional computers to handle much of the computation, and hand off parts of the computation to specialized quantum hardware when that additional power was needed.
 
Competition in quantum encryption is expected from ID Quantique (Switzerland), MagiQ Technologies (US), Nucrypt (US), Infineon Technologies (Germany), Qutools (Germany), Quintessence Labos (Australia), Crypta Labs (UK), PQ Solutions (U), and Qubitekk (US). These companies currently offer quantum cryptography solutions to commercial clients around the world.
 
Companies such as Bra-ket Science (Austin, TX) and BraneCell (Cambridge, MA) are focusing on developing quantum hardware that will allow quantum hardware to operate at room temperature, thus dramatically reducing costs to build and operate quantum computers. However, those technologies are not yet commercially available. To date, the only commercially available quantum computers on the market are those manufactured by D-Wave. However, the D-Wave computer, which is a quantum annealer not a general-purpose quantum computer, is currently only capable of solving one specific class of optimization problems. According to CNBC, D-Wave has sold quantum computers to customers including Temporal Defense Systems, Lockheed Martin, Google and NASA. Temporal Defense was the first customer for D-Wave’s latest model the D-Wave 2000Q, a $15 million quantum annealer capable of computations utilizing 2,048 QBITS. 
 
For those wishing to develop and test quantum algorithms, companies such as D-Wave, Google, Microsoft, IBM, Rigetti, Fujitsu (Japan) and Alibaba (China) offer developers access to their quantum hardware via cloud based development platforms. While the computers at all of the aforementioned firms are relatively limited in their capability due to their low number of operational QBITS, developers can not only test quantum algorithms, but can determine the scope of the speed increase that the quantum systems offer over conventional computers.
 
According to BCC Research, as of October 1, 2017, 63% percent of all quantum computing-related patents filed were hardware related. Software and applications account for nearly 20 percent of the quantum computing related patents. Also according to BCC Research, 599 patents relating to quantum computing have been issued between 2008 and 2017. The top three holders for patents are, in descending order, D-Wave, IBM, and Microsoft. D-Wave has been issued 159 US patents and has filed for an additional 79. IBM holds 83 patents and has filed for an additional 42. Microsoft holds 41 and has filed for 43 more.
 
Government Regulation and Incentives 
 
Encryption
 
The U.S. government has historically tightly regulated the export of cryptographic technologies under the Arms Export Control Act and the associated International Traffic in Arms regulations (ITAR) as a form of munition. The logic behind the export restrictions is that the ability to secure information has great value to the military and intelligence agencies, and the US Government does not want those technologies sold or distributed to foreign adversaries. These regulations were relaxed in 1996 by executive order, but restrictions are still in place under the Export Administration Act that limit the export of some advanced encryption methods and technologies. Export of commercial encryption products to certain designated countries and terrorist groups is restricted, as are exports of military quality encryption technologies. Restrictions on encryption technology are in place in many other countries but the extent of regulation varies widely from country to country. Domestically, encryption technology is largely unregulated but law enforcement, intelligence and investigative agencies work closely with encryption technology developers to enable the US government to access encrypted data under certain conditions. We believe that the quantum encryption and decryption products that QCI plans to develop can be marketed to government agencies seeking to unlock encrypted data or to encrypt and protect sensitive government data from unauthorized exposure.

Financial Algorithms
 
US firms and FINRA members that use financial algorithms to conduct high frequency trading are subject to SEC and FINRA regulations that govern their trading activities under long standing rules governing supervision and control practices to reduce the likelihood of market disruptions and ensure effective communication between the firm’s compliance staff and its trading strategy personnel. Additional regulation on financial algorithms has been proposed by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) aimed at limiting the potential for financial algorithms and high frequency trading to disrupt markets. The proposed regulations would require firms using such algorithms to implement pre-trade risk controls, limit self-trading and make the source code of the software programs available to the government upon request. To the Company’s knowledge, these regulations, especially the mandatory source code disclosure provisions, have been vigorously opposed by the industry and have not yet been implemented.
 
The government agencies charged with regulating financial markets in the US and around the world have so far not closely regulated financial algorithms or algorithmic trading, but that could change in response to future market events. The benefit of algorithmic trading is that it can bring greater liquidity, transparency and accountability to markets, and also reduces price variations between global markets. Financial markets in many developing countries have benefited from implementation of algorithmic trading. There are, of course, limitations to what financial algorithms can accomplish today with conventional super computers, and when multiple algorithms trade in lockstep a single price fluctuation can trigger a cascade of downward trades that can crash a market very quickly, before human intervention can stop the downward spiral. This phenomenon is known as a “Flash Crash” and regulators have imposed some regulations to slow down or suspend trading when a market drops more than a fixed percentage in a short period of time.
 
Incentives
 
In 2018, Congress authorized $1.3 billion to fund quantum related research projects. This funding is being administered by the U.S. Department of Defense which will solicit proposals for research. The Company intends to submit proposals for funding, but there can be no guarantee the Company will be chosen or that the Company will receive any government funding. In addition, in 2018 President Trump announced the formation of a National Quantum Initiative consisting of key technology companies working in the field of quantum computing. The Company has applied to become a member of that Initiative.
 
In December 2018 Congress passed the National Quantum Initiative Act (the “Quantum Act”), the purpose of which is to develop a unified national strategy for researching quantum information science. The Quantum Act proposes to establish a National Quantum Coordination Office inside the White House’s Office of Science and Technology Policy to help coordinate research between agencies, serve as the federal point of contact and promote private commercialization of federal research breakthroughs over the next decade.
 
The Quantum Act would also create:
 

● | A National Quantum Information Science Research Centers within the Department of Energy. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Research and education centers in the National Science Foundation. 
● | A “workshop of stakeholders” administered by the National Institute of Standards and Technology “to discuss the future measurement, standards, cybersecurity, and other appropriate needs for supporting the development of a robust quantum information science and technology industry in the United States.” 
● | A Subcommittee on Quantum Information Science (“QIS”) under the National Science and Technology Council. 
● | A National Quantum Initiative Advisory Committee to advise the President.

The overall goals of the Quantum Act include the eventual creation of industry standards for QIS development, new research grant funding and increased collaboration with the private sector. Quantum technology, including quantum computing, has drawn significant attention from Congress and the White House in 2018 for its theoretical potential to increase computing power and disrupt encryption standards. Rival countries like China and Russia are pushing hard to improve their own QIS capabilities. President Trump is expected to sign the bill into law. We do not know at this time when the Quantum Act will begin soliciting industry proposals and awarding contracts.
 
Employees
 
QCI currently has four employees and six contract staff, seven of whom are focused on product and software development, and five Technical Advisors (one from the National Security Domain, one from the Quantum/AI Domain, and three from the Financial Services Domain). We also have two third party partners providing software development and big data analysis services. The employees are not part of a collective bargaining agreement and labor relationships are good.
