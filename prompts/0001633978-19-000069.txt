ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
General
Overview
Lumentum Holdings Inc. (“we”, “our”, “Lumentum” or the “Company”) is an industry-leading provider of optical and photonic products defined by revenue and market share addressing a range of end market applications including Optical Communications and Commercial Lasers for manufacturing, inspection and life-science applications. We seek to use our core optical and photonic technology and our volume manufacturing capability to expand into attractive emerging markets that benefit from advantages that optical or photonics-based solutions provide, including 3D sensing for consumer electronics and diode light sources for a variety of consumer and industrial applications. The majority of our customers tend to be original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) that incorporate our products into their products which then address end-market applications. For example, we sell fiber optic components that our network equipment manufacturer (“NEM”) customers assemble into communications networking systems, which they sell to network service providers or enterprises with their own networks. Similarly, many of our customers for our Lasers products incorporate our products into tools they produce, which are used for manufacturing processes by their customers. For 3D sensing, we sell diode lasers to manufacturers of consumer electronics products for mobile, personal computing, and gaming who then integrate our devices within their products, for eventual resale to consumers and also into other industrial applications.
We operate in two reportable segments: Optical Communications (“OpComms”) and Commercial Lasers (“Lasers”).
We have a global marketing and sales footprint that enables us to address global market opportunities for our products. We have manufacturing capabilities and facilities in North America, Asia-Pacific, and Europe, with employees engaged in R&D, administration, manufacturing, support and sales and marketing activities. Our headquarters are located in Milpitas, California, and we employed approximately 5,161 full-time employees around the world as of June 29, 2019.
Lumentum was incorporated in Delaware as a wholly owned subsidiary of JDS Uniphase Corporation (“JDSU”) on February 10, 2015, and is comprised of the former communications and commercial optical products (“CCOP”) segment and WaveReady product lines of JDSU. In August 2015, we became an independent publicly-traded company through the distribution by JDSU to its stockholders of 80.1% of our outstanding common stock (the “Separation”). Each JDSU stockholder of record as of the close of business on July 27, 2015, received one share of Lumentum common stock for every five shares of JDSU common stock held on such date. JDSU was renamed Viavi Solutions Inc. (“Viavi”) and at the time of distribution, retained ownership of 19.9% of Lumentum’s outstanding shares. Since the Separation, Viavi has sold its shares and is no longer a shareholder of Lumentum.

Our business traces its origins to Uniphase Corporation, which was formed in 1979, and became publicly traded in 1992. Uniphase was originally a supplier of commercial lasers, and later, a leading supplier of optical transmission products. In 1999, JDS Fitel Inc., a pioneer in products for fiber optic networking which was formed in 1981, merged with Uniphase to become JDSU, a global leader in optical networking. Subsequent acquisitions by JDSU broadened the depth and breadth of the OpComms and Lasers businesses, as well as the intellectual property, technology and product offerings, of what is now Lumentum. Notable amongst these acquisitions in the OpComms business were Agility Communications, Inc. in 2005 and Picolight, Inc. in 2007 which respectively brought widely tunable, long wavelength laser technology for metro and long haul networking applications and short wavelength vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (“VCSELs”) for enterprise, datacenter networking, and 3D sensing applications. The fundamental laser component technologies which we acquired through these acquisitions, form the basis of virtually all optical networks today, and we believe will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. These technologies will enable us to develop highly integrated products to satisfy our communications customers’ ever increasing needs for smaller, lower power and lower cost optical products. Notable acquisitions in the Lasers business were Lightwave Electronics Corporation in 2005 and Time-Bandwidth Products Inc. (“Time-Bandwidth”) in 2014. Both of these Lasers acquisitions brought high power pulsed solid-state laser products and technology to our business, which address the micro laser machining market and expanded our addressable market. On December 10, 2018, we completed a merger with Oclaro, Inc. (“Oclaro”), a provider of optical components and modules for the long-haul, metro and data center markets. Oclaro’s products provide differentiated solutions for optical networks and high-speed interconnects driving the next wave of streaming video, cloud computing, application virtualization and other bandwidth-intensive and high-speed applications. This acquisition has strengthened our product portfolio, including by gaining Oclaro’s indium phosphide laser and photonic integrated circuit and coherent component and module capabilities; broadens our revenue mix; and positions us strongly to meet the future needs of our customers.
Industry Trends and Business Risks
Our business is driven by end-market applications which benefit from the performance advantages that optical solutions enable.
The OpComms markets we serve are experiencing continually increasing needs for higher data transmission speeds, fiber optic network capacity and network agility. This is driven by rapid growth in both the number of higher bandwidth broadband connections, notably those associated with mobile devices, such as high-definition video, online gaming, cloud computing and the number and scale of datacenters that require fiber optic links to enable the higher speeds and increased scale necessary to deliver high bandwidth video and other services. Our technology, which was originally developed for communications applications is also finding use in other emerging market opportunities including 3D sensing applications that employ our laser technology in mobile devices, computers, augmented and virtual reality and other consumer electronics devices. Additionally, our products are used in emerging automotive, industrial, security, safety and surveillance applications.
In the Lasers markets, customer demand is driven by the need to enable faster, higher precision volume manufacturing techniques with lower power consumption, reduced manufacturing footprint and increased productivity. These capabilities are critical as industries develop products that are smaller and lighter, increasing productivity and yield and lowering their energy consumption. 
Our optical and laser solutions, developed in close collaboration with OEM partners, are well-positioned to meet demand resulting from these trends. We do, however, expect to continue to encounter a number of industry and market risks and uncertainties. These risks and uncertainties may limit our visibility, and consequently, our ability to predict future revenue, profitability and general financial performance, and could create quarter over quarter variability in our financial measures. For example, the demand environment in China has fluctuated significantly in recent years, and has created volatility and uncertainty in our future demand. We cannot predict when or to what extent these uncertainties will be resolved. Our revenues, profitability and general financial performance may also be affected by: (i) pricing pressures, particularly within our OpComms markets, due to, among other things, a highly concentrated customer base, increasing competition, particularly from Asia-Pacific-based competitors, and a general commoditization trend for certain products; (ii) high product mix variability which affects revenue and gross margin; (iii) fluctuations in customer buying patterns, which cause volatility in demand, revenue and profitability; and (iv) the current trend of communication industry consolidation, which is expected to continue, that directly affects our customer bases and adds additional risk and uncertainty to our financial and business projections.
Reportable Segments
We have two operating segments, OpComms and Lasers. The two operating segments were primarily determined based on how our Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) views and evaluates our operations. Operating results are regularly reviewed by our CODM to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segments and to assess their performance. Other factors, including market separation and customer specific applications, go-to-market channels, products and manufacturing, are considered 
3

in determining the formation of these operating segments. We do not track our property, plant, and equipment by operating segments. For the geographic identification of these assets, refer to “Note 20. Operating Segments and Geographic Information”.
The table below discloses our total net revenue attributable to each of our two reportable segments. In addition, it discloses the percentage of our total net revenue attributable to our product offerings which serve the Telecom, Datacom, and Consumer and Industrial markets which accounted for 10% or more of our total net revenue during the periods presented (in millions, except percentage data):

For further information regarding our operating segments, please refer to “Note 20. Operating Segments and Geographic Information” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
OpComms
Markets
Our OpComms products address the following markets: telecommunications (“Telecom”), data communications (“Datacom”) and consumer and industrial (“Consumer and Industrial”). 
Our OpComms products include a wide range of components, modules and subsystems to support customers including carrier networks of access (local), metro (intracity), long-haul (city-to-city and worldwide) and submarine (undersea) applications. Additionally, our products address enterprise, cloud, and data center applications, including storage-access networks (“SANs”), local-area networks (“LANs”) and wide-area networks (“WANs”). These products enable the transmission and transport of video, audio and text data over high-capacity fiber-optic cables. We maintain leading positions in these fast growing OpComms markets through our extensive product portfolio, including reconfigurable optical add/drop multiplexers (“ROADMs”), coherent DWDM pluggable transceivers, and tunable small form-factor pluggable transceivers. We also sell laser chips for use in the manufacture of high-speed Datacom transceivers.
In the Consumer and Industrial market, our OpComms products include laser light sources, which are integrated into 3D sensing platforms being used in applications for mobile devices, gaming, computers, and other consumer electronics devices. New emerging applications include virtual and augmented reality, as well as automotive and industrial segments. Our products include vertical cavity surface emitting lasers (“VCSELs”) and edge emitting lasers which are used in 3D sensing depth imaging systems. These systems simplify the way people interact with technology by enabling the use of natural user interfaces. Systems are used for biometric identification, surveillance, and process efficiency, among numerous other application spaces. Emerging applications for this technology include various mobile device applications, autonomous vehicles, self-navigating robotics and drones in industrial applications and 3D capture of objects coupled with 3D printing. In addition, our industrial diode lasers are used primarily as pump sources for pulsed and kilowatt class fiber lasers.
Following the acquisition of Oclaro, during our fiscal 2019, we made several strategic changes to our OpComms business as follows: 
First, for overlapping products as a result of the acquisition, we are transitioning to a common lower cost design and manufacturing platform, which we expect will result in gross margin improvement over time. In addition, we are discontinuing certain Telecom product lines that we believe have muted growth and profitability trends that are inconsistent with our long term model. We expect that these transitions will be completed in our fiscal 2021. For the Telecom product lines we are exiting, we do not expect significant revenue declines until fiscal 2021 as in fiscal 2020 we are continuing to satisfy customers’ product needs with respect to these product lines.
Second, we announced our plan to discontinue development and manufacturing of Lithium Niobate modulators, and we plan to wind down these operations in San Donato, Italy during fiscal year 2020. Development and manufacturing will also be discontinued in our San Jose, California manufacturing locations within the next few quarters in order to facilitate our customer
4

s’ transition to new products. We expect our Indium Phosphide photonic integrated circuits will replace Lithium Niobate modulators over time. 
Third, we announced the sale of many of our Datacom transceiver module products to Cambridge Industries Group (“CIG”). This transaction closed on April 18, 2019. For further information regarding this transaction, refer to “Note 5. Business Combination”. We expect Datacom transceiver sales to ramp down to zero during fiscal year 2020. We are investing in new Datacom chip development and expect sales of these chips to customers serving the Datacom and 5G wireless markets will grow over time. With the exit from the business of selling Datacom transceivers, we recorded an impairment charge of $30.7 million to our Long-lived assets that were not deemed to be useful, as they were retired from active use and classified as held-for-sale. These assets were valued at fair value less cost to sell. We also recorded inventory write down charges of $20.8 million related to the decision to exit the Datacom module and Lithium Niobate product lines in our cost of goods sold of consolidated statements of operations. These actions do not qualify as discontinued operations for disclosure purposes as they do not represent a strategic shift having a major effect on an entity’s operations and financial results. For additional information, refer to “Note 15. Impairment Charges”.
Customers 
Our OpComms customers include Alphabet, Apple, Ciena, Cisco Systems (which recently announced the acquisition of Acacia Communications, another customer of ours), Huawei Technologies (including HiSilicon), Infinera, Innolight, Nokia Networks (including Alcatel-Lucent International), O-Net, and ZTE. During fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017, net revenue generated from a single customer which represented 10% or more of our total net revenue of the applicable fiscal year is summarized in the table below:

 | Years Ended 
 | June 29, 2019 | | June 30, 2018 | | July 1, 2017
Apple | 21.0 | % | | 30.0 | % | * | 
Huawei | 15.2 | % | | 11.0 | % | 16.7 | %
Ciena | 13.7 | % | | 11.0 | % | 18.5 | %
Cisco | * | | | * | | 12.4 | %
*Represents less than 10% of total net revenue | | | | | 

Trends 
We believe the optical communications market has started to expand beyond a small number of very large service providers, and is transitioning to a variety of open and captive networks created for in house use by large video services, search engines and companies offering a variety of cloud computing services. We believe that the trend towards an increase in demand for optical solutions, which increase network capacity, is in response to growing bandwidth demand driven by increased transmission of video, voice and data over optical communications networks. Additionally, service providers also seek to decrease the total cost of ownership of their networks. To remain competitive, network operators worldwide must offer broader suites of digital services at competitive prices. To do this, they are migrating to Internet-protocol (“IP”) networks and expanding long-haul, metro regional and metro access networks, which effectively deliver broadband services while lowering capital and operating costs of dense-wavelength-division multiplexing networks. 
The growing demand for capacity encourages the adoption of OpComms products across the Datacom and Telecom markets. Demand for capacity in the Datacom market is driven by the growing needs of LANs and WANs. Growth in Datacom is also driven by web and cloud services companies that are expanding data center infrastructure, increasing the need for network capacity within and between these data centers. 
Demand in the Telecom market is driven by new bandwidth-intensive applications that can result in sudden and severe changes in demand almost anywhere on the network. Increasing agility in optical networks by employing ROADMs, wavelength selective switches, wavelength tunable transmission products and other agile optical products provides an effective way to respond to unpredictable bandwidth demands and to manage expenses. With more agile optical networks, a network operator can add capacity by using remote management applications rather than dispatching technicians to perform manual operations in the field. 
In addition, the high-end routers, switches and cross-connect equipment that must handle legacy and internet-protocol traffic are becoming increasingly complex in order to meet higher bandwidth, scalability, speed and reliability needs. Products must provide higher levels of functionality and performance in compact designs that must also meet requirements for quality, reliability, and cost. 
5

Deployment of fiber closer to the end user increases the availability of high-bandwidth services and we expect it will result in increased demand on the metro regional and long-haul networks into which these services feed. The dynamically reconfigurable nature of today’s agile networks enables lower operating costs and other competitive advantages, allowing service providers to use and scale network capacity more flexibly, streamline service provisioning, accelerate rerouting around points of failure and modify network topology through simple point-and-click network management systems. 
Our optical products are well positioned to meet these demands. Our innovation has resulted in products that have more functionality, are less than half the size, require less power and are more cost-effective than our historical products, particularly in the area of photonic integrated circuits. Higher levels of integration have also led to development of our Super Transport Blade, which delivers all transport functions (wavelength switching, pre-amplification, post-amplification, optical supervisory channel and monitoring) in a single, integrated platform, essentially replacing three blades with one. 
Offerings
In addition to a full selection of active and passive components, we offer increasing levels of functionality and integration in modules, circuit packs and subsystems for transmission, amplification, wavelength management and more. 
In the Telecom market, we provide transmission and transport solutions for optical networks that make up the backbone of the wireline Telecom infrastructure, thereby enabling the internet. Transmission products, such as our tunable transponder, transceiver and transmitter modules, transmit and receive high-speed data signals at the ingress/egress points of the network. These products use dense wavelength division multiplexing technology to enable high capacity (from 20 to over 40Tb/s in the C-Band) links driven by increasing internet demand. We also offer components including tunable lasers, receivers and modulators to address the higher end of these same network applications. 
Our transport products, such as ROADMs, amplifiers and optical channel monitors provide switching, routing and conditioning of signals. We also make components for transport, including 980nm, multi-mode and Raman pumps for optical amplifiers, and passive components. Passive components include switches, attenuators, photodetectors, gain flattening filters, isolators, wavelength-division multiplexing (“WDM”) filters, arrayed waveguide gratings (“AWGs”), multiplex/de-multiplexers and integrated passive modules. 
Our innovation led to the Super Transport Blade, which integrates all major optical transport functions into a single-slot blade. This all-in-one solution reduces the size, cost and power requirements of optical components, incorporates nano wavelength selective switch technology and enables greater chassis density and a smaller footprint.
In the Datacom market, optical transceivers are used to connect servers, switches, routers and other information technology infrastructure critical for today’s internet applications, web services, video streaming, enterprise networks and service provider solutions. The emerging data center and Web 2.0 markets are two of the fastest growing segments in optical communications, both in terms of capital network equipment investment and growth of high data rate optical transceivers. Additionally, the increased bandwidth needs for 5G wireless applications will drive growth in high speed optical modules. Historically, we have supplied optical transceivers, but have shifted our strategy to supplying underlying optical components, high-speed source lasers and receiver photo diodes used in optical transceivers to address these market segments.
For the 100G and higher data rates, we offer several source laser technologies to balance technical and commercial requirements. For high volume, short distance applications we developed our VCSELs. VCSELs are ideal for short reach applications because they enable low power, low cost optical solutions that are highly scalable. For high-performance, longer distance applications we have our directly modulated laser (“DML”) and electro-absorption modulated laser (“EML”) dies supporting module applications with speeds from 10Gb/s through 800Gb/s. Our individual lasers and compact laser arrays offer an innovative solution for the LANs, SANs, broadband Internet, 5G Wireless and metro-area network as well as hyperscale datacenter applications.
Our 3D sensing technology enables real time depth information to any photo or video image. This represents a fundamental transition for image capture akin to the transition from monochrome to color and gives devices the ability to see the world around them in three dimensions. The immediate applications include full body imaging for gaming, 3D scanning for space mapping and facial recognition for security. Emerging applications for this technology include various mobile device applications, autonomous vehicles, self-navigating robotics and drones in industrial applications and 3D capture of objects coupled with 3D printing. 3D sensing can be applied to any device with a camera. The technologies to achieve accurate and stable 3D sensing are converging to laser based solutions. We are a leading supplier of the critical laser illumination sources for 3D sensing systems being used in applications for gaming, computing, mobile devices, and home entertainment.

We compete against various companies in the markets we serve, including II-VI, Acacia Communications, Accelink, ams AG, Broadcom Inc., Finisar, Furukawa Electric, Mitsubishi Electric, Neophotonics, and Sumitomo Electric Industries as well as private companies and subsidiaries of public companies providing optical communications components such as Fujitsu Optical Components - a subsidiary of Fujitsu, Nistica - a subsidiary of Molex, and O-Net. Additionally, II-VI has announced its plan to acquire Finisar and Cisco has announced its plan to acquire Acacia Communications.
Lasers
Markets
Our Lasers products serve our customers in markets and applications such as sheet metal processing, general manufacturing, biotechnology, graphics and imaging, remote sensing, and precision machining such as drilling in printed circuit boards, wafer singulation, glass cutting and solar cell scribing.
Our Lasers products are used in a variety of OEM applications including diode-pumped solid-state, fiber, diode, direct-diode and gas lasers such as argon-ion and helium-neon lasers. Fiber lasers provide kW-class output powers combined with excellent beam quality and are used in sheet metal processing and metal welding applications. Diode-pumped solid-state lasers provide excellent beam quality, low noise and exceptional reliability and are used in biotechnology, graphics and imaging, remote sensing, materials processing and precision machining applications. Diode and direct-diode lasers address a wide variety of applications, including laser pumping, thermal exposure, illumination, ophthalmology, image recording, printing, plastic welding and selective soldering. Gas lasers such as argon-ion and helium-neon lasers provide a stable, low-cost and reliable solution over a wide range of operating conditions, making them well suited for complex, high-resolution OEM applications such as flow cytometry, DNA sequencing, graphics and imaging and semiconductor inspection.
We also provide high-powered and ultrafast lasers for the industrial and scientific markets. Manufacturers use high-power, ultrafast lasers to create micro parts for consumer electronics and to process semiconductor, LED, and other types of chips. Use of ultrafast lasers for micromachining applications is being driven primarily by the increasing use of consumer electronics and connected devices globally.
Our portfolio of Lasers products includes components and subsystems used in a variety of OEM applications that range in output power from milliwatts to kilowatts and include ultraviolet, visible and infrared wavelengths. We support customer applications in the biotechnology, graphics and imaging, remote sensing, materials processing and other precision machining areas. 
Customers 
Our Lasers customers include Amada, ASML Holding, Beckman Coulter, DISCO, Electro Scientific Industries (recently acquired by MKS Instruments, a competitor of ours), Han’s Laser Technology, KLA-Tencor, Lasertec, Life Technologies, and NR Electric. During fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017, we did not have any single customer attributable to our Lasers segment that generated net revenue of 10% or more of our total net revenue for the applicable fiscal year.
Trends
As technology advances, industries such as consumer electronics manufacturing increasingly turn to lasers when they need more precision, higher productivity and energy efficient, or “green,” alternatives for problems that cannot be solved by mechanical, electronic or other means. For example, these industries are using lasers to develop products that are smaller and lighter to increase productivity and yield and to lower their energy consumption. Lasers have been used for years to help achieve the scale and precision needed in semiconductor processing. In biotech applications, lasers have been instrumental for advances (and new standard procedures) in cytology, hematology, genome sequencing and crime scene investigations, among others. We believe the long-term trends in these industries will likely lead to increased demand for lasers. 
7

Sheet metal processing and metal welding applications are increasingly using kW-class fiber lasers instead of kW-class CO2 lasers. Fiber lasers generate higher productivity at lower cost in such applications because they exhibit lower power consumption, better quality and generally lower user maintenance costs.
In addition, demand continues for electronic products, as well as products and components in other industries, with greater functionality while becoming smaller, lighter and less expensive. Innovative / Next generation product designs require precise micromachining and materials processing, such as micro bending, soldering and welding. At the scale and processing speed needed, lasers are replacing mature mechanical tools such as drills for minute holes, or “vias,” in printed circuit boards and saws and scribes for singulating silicon wafers, resulting in greater precision and productivity. As these trends continue, we believe that manufacturers and other industries will increase their reliance on lasers in order to maintain or increase their competitiveness. 
We believe we are well-positioned with key OEM providers of laser solutions to these industries. We continue to develop our laser portfolio to offer smaller and more cost-effective products designed specifically for the performance, integration, reliability and support needs of our OEM customers. 
Offerings 
Our broad range of Lasers products includes diode-pumped solid-state, fiber, diode, direct-diode and gas lasers such as argon-ion and helium-neon lasers.

We believe we have strengthened our business model by expanding our addressable markets, customer base and expertise, diversifying our product portfolio and fortifying our core businesses from acquisitions as well as through organic initiatives. 
On December 10, 2018, we completed our merger with Oclaro, a provider of optical components and modules for the long-haul, metro and data center markets. Oclaro’s products provide differentiated solutions for optical networks and high-speed interconnects driving the next wave of streaming video, cloud computing, application virtualization and other bandwidth-intensive and high-speed applications. This acquisition strengthened our product portfolio, including gaining Oclaro’s indium phosphide laser and photonic integrated circuit and coherent component and module capabilities; broadens our revenue mix; and positions us strongly to meet the future needs of our customers. Refer to “Note 5. Business Combination” for further discussion of the merger.
In February 2017, we completed the acquisition of a privately held company to enhance our manufacturing and vertical integration capabilities. We acquired all of the outstanding shares of the company for a total purchase consideration of $8.7 million. In connection with the acquisition, we paid upfront cash consideration of $5.1 million, incurred liabilities of $2.7 million contingent upon the achievement of certain production targets being achieved within 36 months following the acquisition date, and retained $0.9 million of the purchase price as security for the seller’s indemnification obligations, which resulted in the cash payment of $1.0 million to the seller during fiscal 2019 (based on the exchange rate at the date of payment).
8

Restructuring Programs
We continue to engage in targeted restructuring plans primarily intended to reduce costs, consolidate our operations, rationalize the manufacturing of our products and align our business in response to market needs and as a result of our acquisition of Oclaro. We have focused on improving efficiencies and reducing costs by consolidating operations where appropriate, while taking into consideration our current investment strategy, product offerings, core competencies, opportunities to enhance cost efficiency and the availability of alternative manufacturers, as appropriate. 
Please refer to “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and “Note 14. Restructuring and Related Charges” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on restructuring charges.
Research and Development
During fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, we incurred R&D expenses of $184.6 million, $156.8 million, and $148.3 million, respectively. The number of employees engaged in R&D was approximately 790 as of June 29, 2019, 587 as of June 30, 2018 and 598 as of July 1, 2017.
We devote substantial resources to R&D for the development of new and enhanced products to serve our markets. Once the design of a product is complete, our engineering efforts shift to enhancing both product performance and our ability to manufacture it in greater volume and at lower cost.
In our OpComms segment, we are maintaining our capability to provide products throughout the network, while focusing on several important sub-segments. We continue to maintain strong investments in Telecom components and modules such as ROADMs and tunable devices needed for long-haul and metro markets, as well as high performance DML, EML, and VCSEL chips for Datacom transceivers. We are also responding to our customers’ requests for higher levels of integration, including the integration of optics, electronics and software in our modules, subsystems and circuit packs. We are providing optical technology for 3D sensing systems that simplify the way that people interact with technology. These solutions are initially being used in computing, mobile, and industrial applications, including automotive applications.
In our Lasers segment, we continue to develop new product offerings in both solid-state and fiber lasers that take advantage of technologies and components we develop. These products are targeted at serving customers engaging in biotechnology, graphics and imaging, remote sensing, and materials processing and precision micromachining markets.
Manufacturing
Our significant manufacturing facilities are located in the United States, Thailand, China, the United Kingdom, Slovenia, Italy, Japan, and Switzerland.
In our fiscal fourth quarter of 2019, we moved into our Slovenia factory, which we expect to be fully operational by the fiscal third quarter of 2020.
In fiscal 2019, we announced our plan to discontinue development and manufacturing of Lithium Niobate modulators, and we plan to wind down these operations in San Donato, Italy during fiscal year 2020. Development and manufacturing will also be discontinued in our San Jose, California manufacturing locations within the next few quarters in order to facilitate our customers’ transition to new products. We expect our Indium Phosphide photonic integrated circuits will replace Lithium Niobate modulators over time. 
In fiscal 2019, we also announced our plan to discontinue the development and manufacturing of future Datacom transceiver products which impacted our Milpitas and Shenzhen Datacom module teams. While we expect strong growth in Datacom volumes in the future, the market at the transceiver level is gross margin challenged due to extreme competition. Following the Oclaro acquisition, we have a differentiated leadership position across a range of photonic chips on which the Datacom, wireless, and access markets critically rely. 
Our significant contract manufacturing partners are located primarily in Thailand, Taiwan and Malaysia. We rely on the capabilities of our contract manufactures to procure components and manage the inventory in these locations.
During fiscal 2018, we entered into a Transition Services Agreement (“TSA”) with one of our contract manufacturers to wind down the production of our products at their facility in China and to facilitate an orderly transition of manufacturing to our manufacturing facility in Thailand, including the purchase of the manufacturing equipment. Under the terms of the TSA, we were required to pay $5.3 million in cash upon completion of certain milestones related to the purchase of equipment. During the year ended June 29, 2019, we paid $1.3 million and accrued $4.0 million for the manufacturing equipment acquired under this TSA. The equipment acquired is included in machinery and equipment within property, plant and equipment in our consolidated balance 
9

sheet as of June 29, 2019. We were also required to share cost of retention and severance, and to reimburse for certain other direct and indirect costs incurred by our contract manufacturer for transition services provided. These costs were expensed as incurred. We have now fully exited from operations with this contract manufacturer. Please refer to “Note 8. Asset Acquisition” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

We use various suppliers and contract manufacturers to supply parts and components for the manufacture and support of multiple product lines. Although our intention is to establish at least two sources of supply for materials whenever possible, for certain components we have sole or limited source supply arrangements. We may not be able to procure these components from alternative sources at acceptable prices and quality within a reasonable time, or at all; therefore, the risk of loss or interruption of such arrangements could impact our ability to deliver certain products on a timely basis.
Intellectual Property
Intellectual property rights that apply to our various products include patents, trade secrets and trademarks. We do not intend to broadly license our intellectual property rights unless we can obtain adequate consideration or enter into acceptable patent cross-license agreements. As of June 29, 2019, we owned 1,063 U.S. patents and 798 foreign patents with expiration dates ranging from July 2019 through June 2038, and had 490 patent applications pending throughout the world.
Seasonality
Our revenue may be influenced on a quarter to quarter basis by customer demand patterns and new product introductions. Some of our products may be incorporated into consumer electronic products, which are subject to seasonality and fluctuations in demand.
Backlog
Backlog consists of purchase orders for products for which we have assigned shipment dates.
As of June 29, 2019 and June 30, 2018, our backlog was $453.1 million and $370.6 million, respectively. Due to possible changes in product delivery schedules and cancellation of product orders, and because our sales often reflect orders shipped in the same quarter in which they are received, our backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of actual revenue or the level of orders for any succeeding period. A portion of our revenue arises from vendor-managed inventory arrangements where the timing and volume of customer utilization is difficult to predict.
Employees
As of June 29, 2019, we employed approximately 5,161 full-time employees, including approximately 3,748 employees in manufacturing, 790 employees in R&D and 623 employees in SG&A. 
Outside of the United States, our business is subject to labor laws that differ from those in the United States. We follow the statutory requirements of those countries where we operate. We consider our employee relations to be good.
Environmental
Our R&D, manufacturing and distribution operations involve the use of hazardous substances and are regulated under international, federal, state and local laws governing health and safety and the environment. We apply strict standards for protection of the environment and occupational health and safety to sites inside and outside the United States, even if not subject to regulation imposed by foreign governments. We believe that our properties and operations at our facilities comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and occupational health and safety laws. However, the risk of environmental liabilities cannot be completely eliminated and there can be no assurance that the application of environmental and health and safety laws will not require us to incur significant expenditures. We are also regulated under a number of international, federal, state and local laws regarding recycling, product packaging and product content requirements. The environmental, product content/disposal and recycling laws are gradually becoming more stringent and may cause us to incur significant expenditures in the future.
In connection with the Separation, we agreed to indemnify Viavi for any liability associated with contamination from past operations at all properties transferred to us from Viavi, to the extent the resulting issues primarily related to our business. We have not been presented with any claims to date.

In certain circumstances customers may request shipment of our products to a contract manufacturer in one country, which may differ from the location of their end customers.

During fiscal 2017, our net revenue from Hong Kong, Mexico, and Japan represented 22.6%, 18.5% and 9.9% of our consolidated net revenue, respectively. Our net revenue is primarily denominated in U.S. dollars, including our net revenue from customers outside the United States based on customer shipment locations as presented above.
As of June 29, 2019 and June 30, 2018, long-lived assets, namely our net property, plant and equipment, located outside of the United States comprised 64.0% and 68.2% of our total property, plant and equipment, net, respectively. As of June 29, 2019, 7.7% and 36.3% of our net property, plant and equipment were located in China and Thailand, respectively.
