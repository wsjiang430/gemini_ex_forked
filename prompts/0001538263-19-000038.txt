Item 1. Business
General
HomeTrust Bancshares, Inc., a Maryland corporation, was formed for the purpose of becoming the holding company for HomeTrust Bank in connection with HomeTrust Bank’s conversion from mutual to stock form, which was completed on July 10, 2012 (the “Conversion”). As a bank holding company and financial holding company, HomeTrust Bancshares, Inc. is regulated by the Federal Reserve. At June 30, 2019, the Company had consolidated total assets of $3.5 billion, total deposits of $2.3 billion and stockholders’ equity of $408.9 million. The Company has not engaged in any significant activity other than holding the stock of the Bank. Accordingly, the information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (“Form 10-K”), including the audited consolidated financial statements and related data, relates primarily to the Bank and its subsidiary. As a North Carolina state-chartered bank, and member of the Federal Reserve System, the Bank's primary regulators are the NCCOB and the Federal Reserve. The Bank's deposits are federally insured up to applicable limits by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC"). The Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta (“FHLB” or “FHLB of Atlanta”), which is one of the 12 regional banks in the Federal Home Loan Bank System (“FHLB System”). Our headquarters is located in Asheville, North Carolina.
The Bank was originally formed in 1926. Between fiscal years 1996 and 2011, HomeTrust Bank's board of directors and executive management expanded the Bank beyond its historical Asheville market and created a unique partnership through mergers between six established banks and one de novo bank located in Tryon, Shelby, Eden, Lexington, Cherryville and Forest City, North Carolina, through which hometown community banks could combine their financial resources to achieve a shared vision. 
Starting in 2013, we entered seven attractive markets through various acquisitions and new office openings, as well as expanded our product lines. These included:

• | BankGreenville Financial Corporation (“BankGreenville”) - one office in Greenville, South Carolina (acquired in July 2013)


• | Jefferson Bancshares, Inc. (“Jefferson”) - nine offices across East Tennessee (acquired in May 2014)


• | Commercial loan production office ("LPO") in Roanoke, Virginia (opened in July 2014)


• | Bank of Commerce - one office in Charlotte, North Carolina (acquired in July 2014)


• | Ten Bank of America Branch Offices - nine in southwest Virginia, one in Eden, North Carolina (acquired in November 2014)


• | Commercial LPO in Raleigh, North Carolina (opened in November 2014) and later converted into full service branch (converted in April 2017)


• | United Financial of North Carolina, Inc. ("United Financial") - municipal lease company headquartered in Fletcher, North Carolina (acquired in December 2016)


• | TriSummit Bancorp, Inc. ("TriSummit") - six offices in East Tennessee (acquired in January 2017)


• | Commercial LPO Greensboro, North Carolina (opened in August 2017)


• | Began origination and sales of U.S. Small Business Administration ("SBA") loans through our new SBA line of business (September 2017)


• | De novo branch in Cary, North Carolina (Opened in March 2018)


• | Began equipment finance line of business (May 2018)

By expanding our geographic footprint and hiring local experienced talent, we have built a foundation that allows us to focus on organic growth, while maintaining "Our Commitment to the Customer Experience" that has differentiated our brand and characterized our success to date.
Our mission is to create stockholder value by building relationships with our employees, customers, and communities. By building a platform that supports growth and profitability, we are continuing our transition toward becoming a high-performing community bank and helping our customers every day to be "Ready For What's Next."
Our principal business consists of attracting deposits from the general public and investing those funds, along with borrowed funds, in loans secured by first and second mortgages on one-to-four family residences including home equity loans, construction and land/lot loans, commercial real estate loans, construction and development loans, commercial and industrial loans, U.S. Small Business Administration ("SBA") loans, equipment finance leases, indirect automobile loans, and municipal leases. We also work with a third party to originate home equity lines of credit ("HELOCs") which are pooled and sold. In addition, we purchase investment securities consisting primarily of securities issued by United States Government agencies and government-sponsored enterprises, as well as, commercial paper and certificates of deposit insured by the FDIC.
We offer a variety of deposit accounts for individuals, businesses, and nonprofit organizations. Deposits and borrowings are our primary source of funds for our lending and investing activities.

The Bank has built a strong foundation in the communities we serve and takes pride in the role we play. The directors and market presidents of each region work with their management team and employees to support local nonprofit and community organizations. Each location helps provide critical services to meet the financial needs of its customers and improve the quality of life for individuals and businesses in its community. Initiatives supporting our communities include affordable housing, education and financial education, and the arts. We support these initiatives through both financial and people resources in all of our communities. Collectively, bank employees volunteer thousands of hours annually in their local communities; from helping to build homes to teaching grade school youth how to start healthy savings habits, bank employees are making a positive difference in the lives of others every day.
Competition
We face strong competition in originating loans and in attracting deposits. Competition in originating real estate loans comes primarily from other commercial banks, savings institutions, credit unions, life insurance companies, and mortgage bankers. Other commercial banks, credit unions, and finance companies provide vigorous competition in consumer lending. In addition, in indirect auto financings, we also compete with specialty consumer finance companies, including automobile manufacturers’ captive finance companies. Commercial and industrial loan competition is primarily from local and regional commercial banks. We believe that we compete effectively because we consistently deliver high-quality, personal service to our customers that results in a high level of customer satisfaction. We also maintain a significant commitment to technological resources, which has expanded our customer service capabilities and increased efficiencies in our lending process.

We attract our deposits through our branch office system. Competition for deposits is principally from other commercial banks, savings institutions, and credit unions located in the same communities, as well as mutual funds and other alternative investments. We believe that we compete for deposits by offering superior service and a variety of deposit accounts at competitive rates. We also have a highly competitive suite of cash management services, online/mobile banking, and internal support expertise specific to the needs of small to mid-sized commercial business customers. Based on the most recent branch deposit data, HomeTrust Bank's deposit market share was:

Location | Rank(1) | Deposit Market Share(1)

Overall, we distinguish ourselves from larger, national banks operating in our market areas by providing local decision-making and competitive customer-driven products with excellent service, responsiveness, and execution. In addition, our larger capital base and product mix enable us to compete effectively against smaller banks. Our bankers believe that strong relationships lead to great things and strive everyday to ensure our customers are "ready for what's next" in their financial future.
In addition, the way we create differentiation from our competition to fuel organic growth is by focusing on “HOW” we deliver our products and services. Many of our employees have been a part of HomeTrust Bank for decades, while a significant number of employees have more recently brought their industry knowledge and expertise to us through internal growth and acquisitions, reflecting their desire to be a part of a high performing team that works well together to make a difference for customers. We strive to create organizational clarity by adhering to our core values of caring and teamwork while continuing to reach for our aspirational values of customer satisfaction, accountability, continuous improvement, and humility. This “culture model” includes four key principles:

• | making a difference for customers every day is both fun and personally rewarding;


• | success is built on relationships;


• | we must continually add value to relationships with our customers and with each other; and


• | we need to grow ourselves and our ability to make a difference.

In implementing these principles, the directors, management team, and employees work together as a team to meet the financial needs of our customers while supporting local nonprofit and community organizations to improve the quality of life for individuals and businesses in our communities. We support affordable housing and education initiatives to help build healthy communities through both financial assistance and employees volunteering thousands of hours annually in their local markets. We believe the opportunity to stay close to our customers gives us a unique position in the banking industry as compared to our larger competitors and we are committed to continuing to build strong relationships with our employees, customers, and communities for generations to come.

(1) | The weighted average rate of municipal loans is adjusted for a 24% combined federal and state tax rate since the interest income from these leases is tax exempt. 

The total amount of loans due after June 30, 2020, which have predetermined interest rates is $1.31 billion, while the total amount of loans which have adjustable interest rates is $1.22 billion.
Lending Authority. Loan credit authority is granted to various officers of the Bank and approved at least annually by the Credit Risk Committee, which is made up of the Chief Operating Officer, Chief Credit Officer, and Chief Risk Officer. Generally, total credit exposure that exceeds the loan credit authority of each officer must be approved by the Senior Credit Officer or Chief Credit Officer. In the absence of the Chief Credit Officer, another Senior Credit Officer not directly involved with the borrower may approve the credit instead of the Chief Credit Officer. 
Loan relationships in excess of $7.5 million in total credit exposure must be approved by our Senior Loan Committee, which is comprised of the Chief Credit Officer, the Commercial Banking Group Executive, and/or the Chief Operating Officer. Any loan submitted for Senior Loan Committee approval must have the prior approval of the Relationship Manager, the Market President and their assigned Senior Credit Officer. Loans in excess of $15.0 million in total credit exposure must be approved by the Executive Loan Committee comprised of the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operating Officer, Commercial Banking Group Executive, Chief Credit Officer and another Senior Credit Officer not involved with the credit. A quorum consists of at least three members, one of whom must be either the Chief Credit Officer or the Senior Credit Officer. A 70% vote is required for approval. Total credit exposure in a single loan or group of loans to related borrowers exceeding 60% of the Bank’s legal lending limit must be approved by the Bank's board of directors.
At June 30, 2019, the maximum amount under federal regulation that we could lend to any one borrower and the borrower’s related entities was approximately $56.6 million. Our five largest lending relationships are with commercial borrowers and totaled $108.1 million in the aggregate, or 4.0% of our $2.7 billion loan portfolio at June 30, 2019. As of June 30, 2019, all loans to these borrowers were performing in accordance with their original repayment terms.
The largest lending relationship at June 30, 2019 consisted of ten loans totaling approximately $24.5 million to nine borrowers based in Florida. The largest loan in this relationship had an outstanding balance of $5.7 million as of June 30, 2019 and was secured by a non-owner-occupied industrial flex space property located in Greensboro, NC. The remaining relationship exposure consisted of eight loans secured by non-owner-occupied industrial, retail, and medical office properties. The properties are located in the Tennessee cities of Bristol, Clarksville, Columbia, and Johnson City, as well as in Rocky Mount, NC, Dublin, VA, and Rome, GA. 
The second largest lending relationship at June 30, 2019 was approximately $24.1 million consisting of three loans to three borrowers in Louisiana, North Carolina, and Georgia. The largest loan in this relationship at June 30, 2019 had an outstanding balance of $11.6 million and was secured by a non-owner occupied medical office property located in Covington, LA. The remaining relationship exposure consisted of two loans secured by non-owner occupied office properties located in Gastonia, NC, and Rome, GA. 
The third largest lending relationship at June 30, 2019 was $20.7 million consisting of five loans to four borrowers in North Carolina. The largest loan in the relationship at June 30, 2019 had an outstanding balance of $6.8 million and was secured by a hotel property located in Greensboro, NC. The remaining exposure consisted of loans secured by hotel properties in Fayetteville, NC, Wake Forest, NC, and Clinton, SC. 
The fourth largest lending relationship at June 30, 2019 was $19.7 million consisting of six loans to two borrowers in Virginia. The largest loan in the relationship at June 30, 2019 had an outstanding balance of approximately $4.8 million and was secured by a non-owner occupied industrial property in Roanoke, VA. The remaining relationship exposure was secured by non-owner-occupied industrial and flex-space properties, as well as self-storage properties, all of which were located throughout southwest Virginia. 
The fifth largest lending relationship at June 30, 2019 was approximately $19.1 million consisting of two loans to two borrowers in Virginia. The largest loan in the relationship at June 30, 2019 had an outstanding balance of $16.4 million and was secured by an assisted living property in Savannah, GA. The other loan was secured by a lien on all business assets of the borrowers.

Retail Consumer Loans
One-to-Four Family Real Estate Lending. We originate loans secured by first mortgages on one-to-four family residences typically for the purchase or refinance of owner-occupied primary or secondary residences located primarily in our market areas. We generally originate one-to-four family residential mortgage loans through referrals from real estate agents, builders, and from existing customers. Walk-in customers are also important sources of loan originations. At June 30, 2019, $660.6 million, or 24.4%, of our loan portfolio consisted of loans secured by one-to-four family residences. Subsequent to June 30, 2019, the Company decided to sell between $200.0 million and $300.0 million of our one-to-four family loans to a third party. Once specifically identified, these loans will be moved from total loans to loans held for sale at the lower of cost or market. The transaction is anticipated to close during the second quarter of fiscal 2020 at a gain. See Note 24 "Subsequent Events" in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.
We originate both fixed-rate loans and adjustable-rate loans. We generally originate mortgage loans in amounts up to 80% of the lesser of the appraised value or purchase price of a mortgaged property, but will also permit loan-to-value ratios of up to 95%. For loans exceeding an 80% loan-to-value ratio we generally require the borrower to obtain private mortgage insurance covering us for any loss on the amount of the loan in excess of 80% in the event of foreclosure.
The majority of our one-to-four family residential loans are originated with fixed rates and have terms of ten to 30 years. At June 30, 2019 our one-to-four family residential loan portfolio included $293.5 million in fixed rate loans. We generally originate fixed rate mortgage loans with terms greater than 15 years for sale to various secondary market investors on a servicing released basis. We also originate adjustable-rate mortgage, or ARM, loans which have interest rates that adjust annually to the yield on U.S. Treasury securities adjusted to a constant one-year maturity plus a margin. Most of our ARM loans are hybrid loans, which after an initial fixed rate period of one, five, seven, or ten years will convert to an annual adjustable interest rate for the remaining term of the loan. Our ARM loans have terms up to 30 years. Our pricing strategy for mortgage loans includes setting interest rates that are competitive with other local financial institutions and consistent with our asset/liability management objectives. Our ARM loans generally have a floor interest rate set at the initial interest rate, and a cap of two percentage points on rate adjustments during any one year and six percentage points over the life of the loan. As a consequence of using caps, the interest rates on these loans may not be as rate sensitive as is our cost of funds.
We generally retain ARM loans that we originate in our loan portfolio rather than selling them in the secondary market. The retention of ARM loans in our loan portfolio helps us reduce our exposure to changes in interest rates. There are, however, unquantifiable credit risks resulting from the potential of increased interest to be paid by the customer as a result of increases in interest rates. It is possible that during periods of rising interest rates the risk of default on ARM loans may increase as a result of repricing and the increased costs to the borrower. We attempt to reduce the potential for delinquencies and defaults on ARM loans by qualifying the borrower based on the borrower’s ability to repay the ARM loan assuming that the maximum interest rate that could be charged at the first adjustment period remains constant during the loan term. Another consideration is that although ARM loans allow us to increase the sensitivity of our asset base due to changes in the interest rates, the extent of this interest sensitivity is limited by the periodic and lifetime interest rate adjustment limits. Because of these considerations, we have no assurance that yield increases on ARM loans will be sufficient to offset increases in our cost of funds.
Most of our loans are written using generally accepted underwriting guidelines, and are readily saleable to Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae, or other private investors. Our real estate loans generally contain a “due on sale” clause allowing us to declare the unpaid principal balance due and payable upon the sale of the security property. The average size of our one-to-four family residential loans was $131,107 at June 30, 2019.
A majority of our loans are “non-conforming” because they are adjustable rate mortgages which contain interest rate floors or do not satisfy credit or other requirements due to personal and financial reasons (i.e. divorce, bankruptcy, length of time employed, etc.), conforming loan limits (i.e. jumbo mortgages), and other requirements, imposed by secondary market purchasers. Some of these borrowers have higher debt-to-income ratios, or the loans are secured by unique properties in rural markets for which there are no sales of comparable properties to support the value according to secondary market requirements. We may require additional collateral or lower loan-to-value ratios to reduce the risk of these loans. We believe that these loans satisfy a need in our local market areas. As a result, subject to market conditions, we intend to continue to originate these types of loans. Total non-conforming loans were $416.6 million at June 30, 2019, including $149.0 million of jumbo one- to four-family residential loans which may also expose us to increased risk because of their larger balances.
Property appraisals on real estate securing our one-to-four family loans in excess of $250,000 that are not originated for sale are made by a state-licensed or state-certified independent appraiser approved by the board of directors. Appraisals are performed in accordance with applicable regulations and policies. For loans that are less than $250,000, we may use the tax assessed value, broker price opinions, and/or a property inspection in lieu of an appraisal. We generally require title insurance policies on all first mortgage real estate loans originated. Homeowners, liability, fire and, if required, flood insurance policies are also required for one-to-four family loans. We do not originate permanent one-to-four family mortgage loans with a negatively amortizing payment schedule, and currently do not offer interest-only mortgage loans. We have not typically originated stated income or low or no documentation one-to-four family loans. At June 30, 2019, $2.9 million of our one-to-four family loans were interest-only of which $2.8 million served as collateral for commercial purpose loans. In connection with the new rules issued by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ("CFPB"), which includes a definition for “qualified mortgage” loans based on the borrower’s ability to repay the loan, we believe that substantially all of the mortgage loans approved by us meet this standard.
At June 30, 2019, $85.3 million of our one-to-four family loan portfolio consisted of loans secured by non-owner occupied residential properties. Loans secured by residential rental properties represent a unique credit risk to us and, as a result, we adhere to specific underwriting guidelines for such loans. Additionally, we have established specific loan portfolio concentration limits for loans secured by residential rental property to prevent excessive credit risk that could result from an elevated concentration of these loans. A primary risk factor in non-owner occupied residential 
12

real estate lending is the consistency of rental income of the property. Payments on loans secured by rental properties often depend on the successful operation and management of the properties, as well as the ability of tenants to pay rent. As a result, repayment of such loans may be subject to adverse economic conditions and unemployment trends, and may be sensitive to changes in the supply and demand for such properties. We consider and review a rental income cash flow analysis of the borrower and consider the net operating income of the property, the borrower’s expertise, credit history and profitability, and the value of the underlying property. We generally require collateral on these loans to be a first mortgage along with an assignment of rents and leases. We periodically monitor the performance and cash flow sufficiency of certain residential rental property borrowers based on a number of factors such as loan performance, loan size, total borrower credit exposure, and risk grade.
Home Equity Lines of Credit.  Our originated home equity lines of credit ("HELOCs") consist primarily of adjustable-rate lines of credit. At June 30, 2019, HELOCs-originated totaled $131.1 million or 4.8% of our loan portfolio of which $67.4 million was secured by a first lien on owner-occupied residential property. The lines of credit may be originated in amounts, together with the amount of the existing first mortgage, typically up to 85% of the value of the property securing the loan (less any prior mortgage loans) with an adjustable-rate of interest based on The Wall Street Journal prime rate plus a margin. Currently, our home equity line of credit floor interest rate is dependent on the overall loan to value, and has a cap of 16% above the floor rate over the life of the loan. Originated HELOCs generally have up to a ten-year draw period and amounts may be reborrowed after payment at any time during the draw period. Once the draw period has lapsed, the payment is amortized over a 15-year period based on the loan balance at that time. At June 30, 2019, unfunded commitments on these lines of credit totaled $201.4 million.
Our underwriting standards for originated HELOCs are similar to our one-to-four family loan underwriting standards and include a determination of the applicant’s credit history and an assessment of the applicant’s ability to meet existing obligations and payments on the proposed loan. The stability of the applicant’s monthly income may be determined by verification of gross monthly income from primary employment, and additionally from any verifiable secondary income.
In December 2014, the Company began purchasing HELOCs originated by other financial institutions. At June 30, 2019, HELOCs-purchased totaled $117.0 million, or 4.3% of our loan portfolio. Unfunded commitments on these lines of credit were $31.6 million at June 30, 2019. The credit risk characteristics are different for these loans since they were not originated by the Company and the collateral is located outside the Company’s market area, primarily in several western states. All of these loans were originated in 2012 or later, had an average FICO score of 740, and loan to values of less than 90% at origination. Loan charge-offs in this portfolio since December 2014 totaled $48,000. The Company will continue to monitor the performance of these loans and adjust the allowance for loan losses as necessary.
HELOCs generally entail greater risk than do one-to-four family residential mortgage loans where we are in the first lien position. For those home equity lines secured by a second mortgage, it is unlikely that we will be successful in recovering all or a portion of our loan proceeds in the event of default unless we are prepared to repay the first mortgage loan and such repayment and the costs associated with a foreclosure are justified by the value of the property.
Construction and Land/Lots. We have been an active originator of construction to permanent loans to homeowners building a residence. In addition, we originate land/lot loans predominately for the purchase or refinance of an improved lot for the construction of a residence to be occupied by the borrower. All of our construction and land/lot loans were made on properties located within our market area.
At June 30, 2019, our construction and land/lot loan portfolio was $80.6 million compared to $65.6 million at June 30, 2018. At June 30, 2019, unfunded loan commitments totaled $65.4 million, compared to $58.9 million at June 30, 2018. Construction-to-permanent loans are made for the construction of a one-to-four family property which is intended to be occupied by the borrower as either a primary or secondary residence. Construction-to-permanent loans are originated to the homeowner rather than the homebuilder and are structured to be converted to a first lien fixed- or adjustable-rate permanent loan at the completion of the construction phase. We do not originate construction phase only or junior lien construction-to-permanent loans. The permanent loan is generally underwritten to the same standards as our one-to-four family residential loans and may be held by us for portfolio investment or sold in the secondary market. At June 30, 2019, our construction-to-permanent loans totaled $70.3 million and the average loan size was $226,650. During the construction phase, which typically lasts for six to 12 months, we make periodic inspections of the construction site and loan proceeds are disbursed directly to the contractors or borrowers as construction progresses. Typically, disbursements are made in monthly draws during the construction period. Loan proceeds are disbursed based on a percentage of completion. Construction-to-permanent loans require payment of interest only during the construction phase. Prior to making a commitment to fund a construction loan, we require an appraisal of the property by an independent appraiser. Construction loans may be originated up to 95% of the cost or of the appraised value upon completion, whichever is less; however, we generally do not originate construction loans which exceed the lower of 80% loan to cost or appraised value without securing adequate private mortgage insurance or other form of credit enhancement such as the Federal Housing Administration or other governmental guarantee. We also require general liability, builder’s risk hazard insurance, title insurance, and flood insurance (as applicable, for properties located or to be built in a designated flood hazard area) on all construction loans. At June 30, 2019, the largest construction to permanent loan had an outstanding balance of $2.6 million and was performing according to the original repayment terms.
Included in our construction and land/lot loan portfolio are land/lot loans, which are typically loans secured by developed lots in residential subdivisions located in our market areas. We originate these loans to individuals intending to construct their primary or secondary residence on the lot within one year from the date of origination. This portfolio may also include loans for the purchase or refinance of unimproved land that is generally less than or equal to five acres, and for which the purpose is to commence the improvement of the land and construction of an owner-occupied primary or secondary residence within one year from the date of loan origination. 
Land/lot loans are typically originated in an amount up to 70% of the lower of the purchase price or appraisal, are secured by a first lien on the property, for up to a 20-year term, require payments of interest only and are structured with an adjustable rate of interest on terms similar to our 
13

one-to-four family residential mortgage loans. At June 30, 2019, our land/lot loans totaled $10.3 million and the average land/lot loan size was $48,000. At June 30, 2019, the largest land/lot loan had an outstanding balance of $401,000 and was performing according to the original repayment terms.
Construction and land/lot lending affords us the opportunity to achieve higher interest rates and fees with shorter terms to maturity than the rates and fees generated by our one-to-four family permanent mortgage lending. Construction/permanent loans, however, generally involve a higher degree of risk than our one-to-four family permanent mortgage lending. If our appraisal of the value of the completed residence proves to be overstated, we may have inadequate security for the repayment of the loan upon completion of construction and may incur a loss. Land/lot loans also pose additional risk because of the lack of income being produced by the property and the potential illiquid nature of the collateral. These risks can also be significantly impacted by supply and demand conditions.
Indirect Auto Finance. As of June 30, 2019, our indirect auto finance installment contracts totaled $153.4 million, or 5.7% of our total loan portfolio. Going forward, the Company expects to maintain the size of this portfolio at approximately the same current percentage of the total loan portfolio. As an indirect lender, we market to automobile dealerships, both manufacturer franchised dealerships and independent dealerships, who utilize our origination platform to provide automotive financing through installment contracts on new and used vehicles. As of June 30, 2019, we worked with 69 auto dealerships located in western North Carolina and upstate South Carolina. Working with strong dealerships within our market area provides us with the opportunity to actively deepen customer relationships through cross-selling opportunities, as 83.0% of our indirect auto finance loans are originated to noncustomers.
The dealers are compensated via an industry standard commission, known as dealer reserve, on marked-up interest rates or from flat rate commission amounts. Our auto finance sales team uses purchased industry data to provide quantitative analysis of dealer sales history to target strong dealerships as the starting point of building long lasting, successful relationships. Local, quick decisions, broad hour coverage, personalized customer service, and prompt contract funding are keys to our success in this competitive line of business. Additionally, our process has been designed to integrate with existing dealership practices, utilizing an industry leading decision engine, which provides our internal underwriters with the tools needed to respond quickly to loans meeting our credit policy criteria. 
Our underwriting guidelines for indirect auto loans allow for financing the entire cost of the vehicle and therefore focuses on the ability of the borrower to repay the loan rather than the value of the underlying collateral. Our underwriting procedures for indirect auto loans include an evaluation of an applicant's credit profile along with certain applicant specific characteristics to arrive at an estimate of the associated credit risk. Additionally, internal underwriters may also verify an applicant's employment income and/or residency or where appropriate, verify an applicant's payment history directly with the applicant's creditors. We will also generally verify receipt of the automobile and other information directly with the borrower.
Indirect auto finance customers receive a fixed rate loan in an amount and at an interest rate that is commensurate to their FICO credit score, consumer payment credit history, loan term, and based on our underwriting procedures. The amount financed by us will generally be up to the full sales price of the vehicle plus sales tax, dealer preparation fees, license fees and title fees, plus the cost of service and warranty contracts and "GAP" insurance coverage obtained in connection with the vehicle or the financing (such amounts in addition to the sales price, collectively the "Additional Vehicle Costs"). Accordingly, the amount financed by us generally may exceed, depending on the credit score and applicant’s profile, in the case of new vehicles, the manufacturer's suggested retail price of the financed vehicle and the Additional Vehicle Costs. In the case of used vehicles, if the applicant meets our creditworthiness criteria, the amount financed may exceed the vehicle's value as assigned by the NADA Official Used Car Guide, our primary reference source of used cars and the Additional Vehicle Costs.
Our indirect auto portfolio at June 30, 2019, consisted of 9,872 installment loan contracts with a weighted-average contract rate of 5.12%, an average FICO credit score of 732, and an average loan to value ratio of 106.4% based on wholesale dealer invoice on new cars and the NADA Official Used Car Guide for used cars. Approximately 85% were originated through manufacturer franchised dealerships and approximately 15% were originated through independent dealerships; 40% were contracts on new vehicles and 60% were contracts on used vehicles. The loan term is averaging 66 months which is comparable to national auto industry data.
Because our primary focus for indirect auto loans is on the credit quality of the customer rather than the value of the collateral, the collectability of an indirect auto loan is more likely than a single-family first mortgage loan to be affected by adverse personal circumstances. We rely on the borrower's continuing financial stability, rather than on the value of the vehicle, for the repayment of an indirect auto loan. Because automobiles usually rapidly depreciate in value, it is unlikely that a repossessed vehicle will cover repayment of the outstanding loan balance. 
Consumer Lending.  Our consumer loans consist of loans secured by deposits accounts or personal property such as automobiles, boats, and motorcycles, as well as unsecured consumer debt. At June 30, 2019, our consumer loans totaled $19.8 million, or 0.7% of our loan portfolio. We originate our consumer loans primarily in our market areas.
Consumer loans generally have shorter terms to maturity, which reduces our exposure to changes in interest rates. In addition, management believes that offering consumer loan products helps to expand and create stronger ties to our existing customer base by increasing the number of customer relationships and providing cross-marketing opportunities.
Our underwriting standards for consumer loans include a determination of the applicant’s credit history and an assessment of the applicant’s ability to meet existing obligations and payments on the proposed loan. The stability of the applicant’s monthly income may be determined by verification of gross monthly income from primary employment, and additionally from any verifiable secondary income.

Consumer loans generally entail greater risk than do one-to-four family residential mortgage loans, particularly in the case of consumer loans that are unsecured or secured by rapidly depreciable assets, such as automobiles. In these cases, any repossessed collateral for a defaulted loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment of the outstanding loan balance. As a result, consumer loan collections are dependent on the borrower’s continuing financial stability and thus are more likely to be adversely affected by job loss, divorce, illness or personal bankruptcy.
Commercial Loans
Commercial Real Estate Lending.  We originate commercial real estate loans, including loans secured by office buildings, retail/wholesale facilities, hotels, industrial facilities, medical and professional buildings, churches, and multifamily residential properties located primarily in our market areas. As of June 30, 2019, $927.3 million or 34.3% of our total loan portfolio was secured by commercial real estate property, including multifamily loans totaling $105.6 million, or 3.91% of our total loan portfolio. Of the remaining amount, $259.6 million was identified as owner occupied commercial real estate, and $562.1 million was secured by income producing, or non-owner-occupied commercial real estate. Commercial real estate loans generally are priced at a higher rate of interest than one-to-four family residential loans. Typically, these loans have higher loan balances, are more difficult to evaluate and monitor, and involve a greater degree of risk than one-to-four family residential loans. Often payments on loans secured by commercial or multi-family properties are dependent on the successful operation and management of the property; therefore, repayment of these loans may be affected by adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy. We generally require and obtain loan guarantees from financially capable parties based upon the review of personal financial statements. If the borrower is a corporation, we generally require and obtain personal guarantees from the corporate principals based upon a review of their personal financial statements and individual credit reports.
The average outstanding loan size in our commercial real estate portfolio was $726,000 as of June 30, 2019. The Bank’s commercial focus is on developing and fostering strong banking relationships with small to mid-size clients within our market area. At June 30, 2019, the largest commercial real estate loan in our portfolio was to a local borrower in Asheville, NC for $12.6 million, secured by a hotel. Our largest multi-family loan as of June 30, 2019 was a 76.74% interest in a 91 unit apartment property in Charlotte, NC with an outstanding balance of $9.7 million. Both of these loans were performing according to their original repayment terms as of June 30, 2019.
We offer both fixed- and adjustable-rate commercial real estate loans. Our commercial real estate mortgage loans generally include a balloon maturity of five years or less. Amortization terms are generally limited to 20 years. Adjustable rate based loans typically include a floor and ceiling interest rate and are indexed to The Wall Street Journal prime rate, or the one-month London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR"), plus or minus an interest rate margin and rates generally adjust daily. The maximum loan to value ratio for commercial real estate loans is generally up to 80% on purchases and refinances. We require appraisals of all non-owner occupied commercial real estate securing loans in excess of $250,000, and all owner-occupied commercial real estate securing loans in excess of $500,000, performed by independent appraisers. For loans less than these amounts, we may use the tax assessed value, broker price opinions, and/or a property inspection in lieu of an appraisal.
If we foreclose on a commercial real estate loan, our holding period for the collateral typically is longer than for one-to-four family residential mortgage loans because there are fewer potential purchasers of the collateral. Further, our commercial real estate loans generally have relatively large balances to single borrowers or related groups of borrowers. Accordingly, if we make any errors in judgment in the collectability of our commercial real estate loans, any resulting charge-offs may be larger on a per loan basis than those incurred with our retail loan portfolios.
Construction and Development Lending. We originate residential construction and development loans for the construction of single-family residences, condominiums, townhouses, and residential developments. Our commercial construction development loans are for the development of business properties, including multi-family, retail, office/warehouse and office buildings. Our land, lots, and development loans are predominately for the purchase or refinance of unimproved land held for future residential development, improved residential lots held for speculative investment purposes and for the future construction of speculative one-to-four family or commercial real estate.
Our expansion into larger metro markets combined with the hiring of experienced commercial real estate relationship managers, credit officers, and the development of a construction risk management group to better manage construction risk, has led to a significant increase in and conscience effort to grow the construction and development portfolio. At June 30, 2019, our construction and development loans totaled $210.9 million, or 7.8% of our total loan portfolio. At June 30, 2019, $69.1 million or 32.8% of our construction and development loans required interest-only payments. A minimal amount of these construction loans provide for interest payments to be paid out of an interest reserve, which is established in connection with the origination of the loan pursuant to which we will fund the borrower's monthly interest payments and add the payments to the outstanding principal balance of the loan. Unfunded commitments at June 30, 2019 totaled $123.1 million compared to $151.6 million at June 30, 2018. Land acquisition and development loans are included in the construction and development loan portfolio, and represent loans made to developers for the purpose of acquiring raw land and/or for the subsequent development and sale of residential lots. Such loans typically finance land purchase and infrastructure development of properties (i.e. roads, utilities, etc.) with the aim of making improved lots ready for subsequent sale to consumers or builders for ultimate construction of residential units. The primary source of repayment is generally the cash flow from developer sale of lots or improved parcels of land, secondary sources and personal guarantees, which may provide an additional measure of security for such loans.
Land acquisition and development loans are generally secured by property in our primary market areas. In addition, these loans are secured by a first lien on the property, are generally limited up to 65% of the lower of the acquisition price or the appraised value of the land and generally have a maximum amortization term of ten years with a balloon maturity of up to three years. We require title insurance and, if applicable, a hazardous waste survey reporting that the land is free of hazardous or toxic waste. At June 30, 2019, our land acquisition and development loans in our commercial construction and development portfolio totaled $67.7 million. The largest land acquisition and development loan had an 
15

outstanding balance at June 30, 2019 of $4.3 million and was performing according to its repayment terms. The subject loan is secured by a residential lot development. At June 30, 2019, 7 land acquisition and development loans totaling $1.4 million were classified as nonaccruing.
Part of our land acquisition and development portfolio consists of speculative construction loans for homes. These homes typically have an average price ranging from $200,000 to $500,000. Speculative construction loans are made to home builders and are termed “speculative” because the home builder does not have, at the time of loan origination, a signed contract with a home buyer who has a commitment for permanent financing with either us or another lender for the finished home. The home buyer may be identified either during or after the construction period, with the risk that the builder will have to fund the debt service on the speculative construction loan and finance real estate taxes and other carrying costs of the completed home for a significant period of time after the completion of construction, until a home buyer is identified. Loans to finance the construction of speculative single-family homes and subdivisions are generally offered to experienced builders with proven track records of performance, are qualified using the same standards as other commercial loan credits and require cash reserves to carry projects through construction completions and sale of the project. These loans require payment of interest-only during the construction phase. At June 30, 2019, loans for the speculative construction of single family properties totaled $46.0 million compared to $48.7 million at June 30, 2018. At June 30, 2019, we had four borrowers each with an aggregate outstanding loan balance over $1.0 million which comprise 10.6% of the total balance for the speculative construction of single family properties and secured by properties located in our market areas. At June 30, 2019, no speculative construction loans were classified as nonaccruing. Unfunded commitments were $31.4 million at June 30, 2019 and $30.1 million at June 30, 2018.
Commercial construction and construction to permanent loans are offered on an adjustable interest rate or fixed interest rate basis. Adjustable interest rate loans typically include a floor and ceiling interest rate and are indexed to The Wall Street Journal prime rate, plus or minus an interest rate margin. The initial construction period is generally limited to 12 to 24 months from the date of origination, and amortization terms are generally limited to 20 years; however, amortization terms of up to 25 years may be available for certain property types based on elevated underwriting and qualification criteria. Construction to permanent loans generally include a balloon maturity of five years or less; however, balloon maturities of greater than five years are allowed on a limited basis depending on factors such as property type, amortization term, lease terms, pricing, or the availability of credit enhancements. Construction loan proceeds are disbursed commensurate with the percentage of completion of work in place, as documented by periodic internal or third-party inspections. The maximum loan-to-value limit applicable to these loans is generally 80% of the appraised post-construction value. Disbursement of funds is at our sole discretion and is based on the progress of construction. At June 30, 2019 we had $97.3 million of non-residential construction loans included in our commercial construction and development loan portfolio.
We require all real estate securing construction and development loans to be appraised by an independent Bank-approved state-licensed or state-certified real estate appraiser. General liability, builder’s risk hazard insurance, title insurance, and flood insurance (as applicable, for properties located or to be built in a designated flood hazard area) are also required on all construction and development loans.
Construction and development lending affords us the opportunity to achieve higher interest rates and fees with shorter terms to maturity than the rates and fees generated by our single-family permanent mortgage lending. 
For the reasons set forth below, construction and development lending involves additional risks when compared with permanent residential lending. Our construction and development loans are based upon estimates of costs in relation to values associated with the completed project. Funds are advanced upon the collateral for the project based on an estimate of costs that will produce a future value at completion. Because of the uncertainties inherent in estimating construction costs, as well as the market value of the completed project and the effects of governmental regulation on real property, it is relatively difficult to evaluate accurately the total funds required to complete a project and the completed project loan-to-value ratio. Changes in the demand, such as for new housing, and higher than anticipated building costs may cause actual results to vary significantly from those estimated. This type of lending also typically involves higher loan principal amounts and is often concentrated with a small number of builders. These loans often involve the disbursement of funds with repayment substantially dependent on the success of the ultimate project and the ability of the borrower to sell or lease the property or obtain permanent take-out financing, rather than the ability of the borrower or guarantor to repay principal and interest. If our appraisal of the value of a completed project proves to be overstated, we may have inadequate security for the repayment of the loan upon completion of construction of the project and may incur a loss. Because construction loans require active monitoring of the building process, including cost comparisons and on-site inspections, these loans are more difficult and costly to monitor. Increases in market rates of interest may have a more pronounced effect on construction loans by rapidly increasing the end-purchasers' borrowing costs, thereby reducing the overall demand for the project. Properties under construction are often difficult to sell and typically must be completed in order to be successfully sold which also complicates the process of working out problem construction loans. This may require us to advance additional funds and/or contract with another builder to complete construction and assume the market risk of selling the project at a future market price, which may or may not enable us to fully recover unpaid loan funds and associated construction and liquidation costs. Furthermore, in the case of speculative construction loans, there is the added risk associated with identifying an end-purchaser for the finished project. Land acquisition and development loans also pose additional risk because of the lack of income being produced by the property and the potential illiquid nature of the collateral. These risks can also be significantly influenced by supply and demand conditions.
Commercial and Industrial Loans.  We typically offer commercial and industrial loans to small businesses located in our primary market areas. These loans are primarily originated as conventional loans to business borrowers, which include lines of credit, term loans, and letters of credit. These loans are typically secured by collateral and are used for general business purposes, including working capital financing, equipment financing, capital investment, and general investments. Loan terms vary from typically one to five years. The interest rates on such loans are either fixed rate or adjustable rate indexed to The Wall Street Journal prime rate plus a margin. Inherent with our extension of business credit is the business deposit relationship which frequently includes multiple accounts and related services from which we realize low cost deposits plus service and ancillary fee income.
16

Commercial and industrial loans typically have shorter maturity terms and higher interest rates than real estate loans, but generally involve more credit risk because of the type and nature of the collateral. We are focusing our efforts on small- to medium-sized, privately-held companies with local or regional businesses that operate in our market areas. At June 30, 2019, commercial and industrial loans totaled $160.5 million, which represented 5.9% of our total loan portfolio. Our commercial and industrial lending policy includes credit file documentation and analysis of the borrower’s background, capacity to repay the loan, the adequacy of the borrower’s capital and collateral, as well as an evaluation of other conditions affecting the borrower. Analysis of the borrower’s past, present and future cash flows is also an important aspect of our credit analysis. We generally obtain personal guarantees on our commercial business loans.
During fiscal 2018, we began commercial business loan originations made under the U.S. Small Business Administration ("SBA") 7(a) and United States Department of Agriculture Business & Industry (“USDA B&I”) programs to small businesses located throughout the Southeast. We originate these loans and utilize a third party service provider that assists with processing and closing services based on the Bank’s underwriting and credit approval criteria. Loans made by the Bank under the SBA 7(a) and USDA B&I programs generally are made to small businesses to provide working capital needs, to refinance existing debt or to provide funding for the purchase of businesses, real estate, machinery, and equipment. These loans generally are secured by a combination of assets that may include receivables, inventory, furniture, fixtures, equipment, business real property, commercial real estate and sometimes additional collateral such as an assignment of life insurance and a lien on personal real estate owned by the guarantor(s). The terms of these loans vary by use of funds. The loans are primarily underwritten on the basis of the borrower’s ability to service the loan from qualifying business income. Under the SBA 7(a) and USDA B&I loan program the loans carry a government guaranty up to 90% of the loan in some cases. Typical maturities for this type of loan vary up to twenty-five years and can be thirty years in some circumstances. SBA 7(a) and USDA B&I loans will normally be adjustable rate loans based upon the Wall Street Journal prime lending rate. Under the loan programs, we will typically sell in the secondary market the guaranteed portion of these loans to generate noninterest income and retain the related unguaranteed portion of these loans; loan servicing is handled by a third party loan sub-service provider for a fee paid for by the purchaser of the guaranteed loan portion. We generally offer SBA 7(a) loans up to $5.0 million and USDA B&I loans up to $10.0 million. During the year ended June 30, 2019, we originated $61.7 million and sold participating interests of $48.1 million in SBA 7(a) and USDA B&I loans.
Repayment of our commercial and industrial loans is often dependent on the cash flows of the borrower, which may be unpredictable, and the collateral securing these loans may fluctuate in value. Our commercial and industrial loans are originated primarily based on the identified cash flow of the borrower and secondarily on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower. Most often, this collateral consists of equipment, inventory or accounts receivable. Credit support provided by the borrower for most of these loans and the probability of repayment is based on the liquidation of the pledged collateral and enforcement of a personal guarantee, if any. As a result, in the case of loans secured by accounts receivable, the availability of funds for the repayment of these loans may be substantially dependent on the ability of the borrower to collect amounts due from its customers. The collateral securing other loans may depreciate over time, may be difficult to appraise and may fluctuate in value based on the success of the business.
Equipment Finance. Our Equipment Finance line of business first began operations in May 2018 and offers companies that are purchasing equipment for their business various products to help manage tax and accounting issues, while offering flexible and customizable repayment terms. These products are primarily made up of commercial finance agreements and commercial loans for transportation equipment, construction equipment, and manufacturing. The loans have terms ranging from 24 to 84 months, with an average of five years and are secured by the financed equipment. Typical transaction sizes range from $25,000 to $1.0 million, with an average size of approximately $200,000. At June 30, 2019, equipment finance loans totaled $132.1 million, which represented 4.9% of our total loan portfolio. 
Municipal Leases.  We offer ground and equipment lease financing to fire departments located primarily throughout North Carolina and, to a lesser extent, South Carolina. Municipal leases are secured primarily by a ground lease in our name with a sublease to the borrower for a fire station or an equipment lease for fire trucks and firefighting equipment. Prior to December 31, 2016, we originated these loans primarily through a third party that assigned the lease to us after we funded the loan. On December 31, 2016, we acquired the third party originator, United Financial of North Carolina, Inc., and now all originations and underwriting is performed directly by us prior to funding. These leases are at a fixed rate of interest and may have a term to maturity of up to 20 years.
At June 30, 2019, municipal leases totaled $112.0 million, which represented 4.1% of our total loan portfolio. At that date, $38.5 million, or 34.4% of our municipal leases were secured by fire trucks, $30.5 million, or 27.3%, were secured by fire stations, $39.4 million or 35.1%, were secured by both, with the remaining $3.6 million or 3.2% secured by miscellaneous firefighting equipment. At June 30, 2019, the average outstanding municipal lease size was $371,000.
Repayment of our municipal leases is often dependent on the tax revenues collected by the county/municipality on behalf of the fire department. Although a municipal lease does not constitute a general obligation of the county/municipality for which the county/municipality's taxing power is pledged, a municipal lease is ordinarily backed by the county/municipality's covenant to budget for, appropriate and pay the tax revenues to the fire department. However, certain municipal leases contain "non-appropriation" clauses which provide that the municipality has no obligation to make lease or installment purchase payments in future years unless money is appropriated for such purpose on a yearly basis. In the case of a "non-appropriation" lease, our ability to recover under the lease in the event of non-appropriation or default will be limited solely to the repossession of the leased property, without recourse to the general credit of the lessee, and disposition or releasing of the property might prove difficult. At June 30, 2019, $11.8 million of our municipal leases contained a non-appropriation clause.

Loan Originations, Purchases, Sales, Repayments and Servicing
We originate both fixed-rate and adjustable-rate loans. Our ability to originate loans, however, is dependent upon customer demand for loans in our market area. Demand is affected by competition and the interest rate environment. During the past few years, we, like many other financial institutions, have experienced significant prepayments on loans due to the low interest rate environment prevailing in the United States. In periods of economic uncertainty, the ability of financial institutions, including us, to originate large dollar volumes of real estate loans may be substantially reduced or restricted, with a resultant decrease in interest income. We do not generally purchase loans or loan participations except for certain HELOCs. We actively sell the majority of our long-term fixed-rate residential first mortgage loans to the secondary market at the time of origination and retain our adjustable-rate residential mortgages and certain fixed-rate mortgages with terms to maturity less than or equal to 15 years and other consumer and commercial loans. In addition, we began selling the guaranteed portion of SBA 7(a) and USDA B&I loans during fiscal 2018. During the years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 we sold $168.0 million and $139.2 million, respectively, of predominantly one-to-four family loans and SBA 7(a) loans to the secondary market. We generally release the servicing of one-to-four family loans we sell into the secondary market, and retain the servicing on SBA 7(a) loans sold. Loans are generally sold on a non-recourse basis. 
In addition to interest earned on loans and loan origination fees, we receive fees for loan commitments, late payments and other miscellaneous services. The fees vary from time to time, generally depending on the supply of funds and other competitive conditions in the market.

Asset Quality
Loan Delinquencies and Collection Procedure.  When a borrower fails to make a required payment on a residential real estate loan, we attempt to cure the delinquency by contacting the borrower. A late notice is sent 15 days after the due date, and the borrower may also be contacted by phone at this time. If the delinquency continues, subsequent efforts are made to contact the delinquent borrower and additional collection notices and letters are sent. When a loan is 90 days delinquent, we may commence repossession or a foreclosure action. Reasonable attempts are made to collect from borrowers prior to referral to an attorney for collection. In certain instances, we may modify the loan or grant a limited moratorium on loan payments to enable the borrower to reorganize their financial affairs, and we attempt to work with the borrower to establish a repayment schedule to cure the delinquency.
19

Delinquent consumer loans are handled in a similar manner, except that late notices are sent within 30 days after the due date. Our procedures for repossession and sale of consumer collateral are subject to various requirements under the applicable consumer protection laws, as well as other applicable laws, and the determination by us that it would be beneficial from a cost basis.
Delinquent commercial loans are initially handled by the relationship manager of the loan, who is responsible for contacting the borrower. Larger problem commercial loans are transferred to the Bank's Special Assets Department for resolution or collection activities. The Special Assets Department may work with the commercial relationship managers to see that the necessary steps are taken to collect delinquent loans, while ensuring that standard default notices and letters are mailed to the borrower. If a commercial loan becomes more problematic, or goes 90 days past the due date, a Special Assets officer will take over the loan for further collection activities including any legal action that may be necessary. If an acceptable workout or disposition plan of a delinquent commercial loan cannot be reached, we generally initiate foreclosure or repossession proceedings on any collateral securing the loan. 
The following table sets forth our loan delinquencies by type, by amount and by percentage of type at June 30, 2019.

Nonperforming Assets.  Nonperforming assets were $13.3 million, or 0.38% of total assets at June 30, 2019, compared to $14.6 million, or 0.44%, at June 30, 2018. 
Over the past several years we have significantly improved our risk profile by aggressively managing and reducing our problem assets. We continue to believe our level of nonperforming assets is manageable, and we believe that we have sufficient capital and human resources to manage the collection of our nonperforming assets in an orderly fashion. However, our operating results could be adversely impacted if we are unable to effectively manage our nonperforming assets.
Loans are placed on nonaccrual status when the collection of principal and/or interest becomes doubtful or other factors involving the loan warrant placing the loan on nonaccrual status. Troubled debt restructurings are loans which have renegotiated loan terms to assist borrowers who are unable to meet the original terms of their loans. Such modifications to loan terms may include a lower interest rate, a reduction in principal, or a longer term to maturity. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, 29 loans for $7.3 million were modified from their original terms and were classified as a troubled debt restructuring. This compares to 31 loans for $4.2 million that were modified in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018. As of June 30, 2019, the outstanding balance of troubled debt restructured loans was $27.9 million, comprised of 303 loans as compared to $26.2 million comprised of 329 loans at June 30, 2018. 
Once a nonaccruing troubled debt restructuring has performed according to its modified terms for six months and the collection of principal and interest under the revised terms is deemed probable, the troubled debt restructuring is removed from nonaccrual status. At June 30, 2019, $4.5 million of troubled debt restructurings were classified as nonaccrual, including $1.2 million of construction and development loans. As of June 30, 2019, $23.1 million, or 82.8% of the restructured loans have a current payment status as compared to $21.2 million, or 81.3% at June 30, 2018. Performing troubled debt restructurings increased $1.9 million, or 8.8%, from June 30, 2018 to June 30, 2019. The table below sets forth the amounts and categories of nonperforming assets.

_______________________________________

(1) | Purchased-credit impaired ("PCI") loans totaling $1,344 at June 30, 2019, $3,353 at June 30, 2018, $6,664 at June 30, 2017, $6,607 at June 30, 2016, and $8,158 at June 30, 2015 are excluded from nonaccruing loans due to the accretion of discounts established in accordance with the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations.

For the years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, gross interest income which would have been recorded had the nonaccruing loans been current in accordance with their original terms amounted to $578,000 and $668,000, respectively. The amount that was included in interest income on such loans was $679,000 and $702,000, respectively. At June 30, 2019, $15.7 million in impaired loans were individually evaluated for impairment; $120,000 of the allowance for loan losses was allocated to these individually impaired loans at period-end. A loan is impaired when it is probable, based on current information and events, that we will be unable to collect all contractual principal and interest payments due in accordance with the terms of the loan agreements. Troubled debt restructurings are also considered impaired. Impaired loans are measured on an individual basis for individually significant loans based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate or, as a practical expedient, at the loan’s observable market price or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. The amount of impairment, if any, and any subsequent changes are included in the allowance for loan losses.
We record real estate owned ("REO") (property acquired through a lending relationship) at fair value less cost to sell on a non-recurring basis. All REO properties are recorded at amounts which are equal to the fair value of the properties based on independent appraisals (reduced by estimated selling costs) upon transfer of the loans to REO. From time to time, non-recurring fair value adjustments to REO are recorded to reflect partial write-downs based on an observable market price or current appraised value of property. The individual carrying values of these assets are reviewed for impairment at least annually and any additional impairment charges are expensed to operations. For the years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, we recognized $295,000 and $539,000, respectively, of REO impairment charges.
Within our nonaccruing loans, as of June 30, 2019 we had one nonaccrual lending relationship with aggregate loan exposure in excess of $1.0 million, or 20.6% of our total nonaccruing loans. This lending relationship consists of two loans totaling $2.1 million as of June 30, 2019. These two loans are secured by commercial land and a stand alone retail property under a long-term lease with a national tenant. The collateral for both loans is located in Buncombe County, NC. At June 30, 2019, we had $2.9 million of REO, the largest of which had a book value of $477,500 and is related to commercial real estate located in Boiling Springs, NC. The second and third largest REO properties at June 30, 2019 consist of multifamily properties located in Bristol, VA with book values of $390,000 and $312,000, respectively. At June 30, 2019 all other REO properties 
21

have individual book values of less than $228,000.
REO decreased $755,000, to $2.9 million at June 30, 2019 primarily due to the $903,000 in sales of REO and $439,000 in writedowns and losses on the sale of REO, which were partially offset by $731,000 in transfers from loans. The total balance of REO included $655,000 in land, construction and development projects (both residential and commercial), $1.2 million in commercial real estate, and $1.0 in single-family homes at June 30, 2019.
In fiscal 2019, we liquidated $1.6 million in REO based on contractual loan values at the time of foreclosure, realizing $1.0 million in net proceeds, or 64.2%, of the foreclosed contractual loan balances. As of June 30, 2019, the book value of our REO, expressed as a percentage of the related contractual loan balances at the time the properties were transferred to REO was 37.8%. 
Other Loans of Concern.  In addition to the nonperforming assets set forth in the table above, as of June 30, 2019, there were 355 accruing loans totaling $33.3 million with respect to which known information about the possible credit problems of the borrowers have caused management to have concerns as to the ability of the borrowers to comply with present loan repayment terms and which may result in the future inclusion of such items in the nonperforming asset categories. These loans have been considered in management’s determination of our allowance for loan losses.
Classified Assets.  Loans and other assets, such as debt and equity securities considered to be of lesser quality, are classified as “substandard,” “doubtful” or “loss.” An asset is considered “substandard” if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. “Substandard” assets include those characterized by the “distinct possibility” that the insured institution will sustain “some loss” if the deficiencies are not corrected. Assets classified as “doubtful” have all of the weaknesses in those classified “substandard,” with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make “collection or liquidation in full,” on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions and values, “highly questionable and improbable.” Assets classified as “loss” are those considered “uncollectible” and of such little value that their continuance as assets without the establishment of a specific loss reserve is not warranted.
When we classify a problem asset as either substandard or doubtful, we may establish a specific allowance for loan losses in an amount deemed prudent by management. When we classify problem assets as “loss,” we either establish a specific allowance for losses equal to 100% of that portion of the asset so classified or charge off such amount. Our determination as to the classification of our assets and the amount of our valuation allowances is subject to review by our bank regulators, which may order the establishment of additional general or specific loss allowances. Assets which do not currently expose us to sufficient risk to warrant classification in one of the aforementioned categories but possess weakness are designated by us as “special mention.”
We regularly review the problem assets in our portfolio to determine whether any assets require classification in accordance with applicable regulations. On the basis of management's review of our assets, at June 30, 2019, our classified assets (consisting of $28.0 million of loans and $2.9 million of REO) totaled $30.9 million, or 1.00%, of our assets, of which $10.4 million was included in nonaccruing loans. The aggregate amounts of our classified assets and special mention loans at the dates indicated (as determined by management), were as follows:

Allowance for Loan Losses.  The allowance for loan losses is a valuation account that reflects our estimation of the losses in our loan portfolio to the extent they are reasonable to estimate. The allowance is maintained through provisions for loan losses that are charged to earnings in the period they are established. We charge losses on loans against the allowance for loan losses when we believe the collection of loan principal is unlikely. Recoveries on loans previously charged off are added back to the allowance.
In recent years, home and lot sales activity and real estate values have improved along with general economic conditions in our market areas resulting in materially lower loan charge-offs and nonaccruing loans than in prior fiscal years. Proactively managing our loan portfolio and aggressively resolving troubled assets has been and will continue to be a primary focus for us. As a result, our nonperforming assets continue to decline. At June 30, 2019, our nonaccruing loans decreased to $10.4 million as compared to $10.9 million at June 30, 2018, and $13.7 million at June 30, 2017. At June 30, 2019, $4.1 million, or 39.6%, of our total nonaccruing loans were current on their loan payments as compared to $5.6 million, or 51.6%, of total nonaccruing loans at June 30, 2018. During fiscal 2019 classified assets decreased $2.1 million, or 6.5%, to $30.9 
22

million and delinquent loans (loans delinquent 30 days or more) increased $254,000, or 2.6%, to $10.1 million at June 30, 2019. There were $5.3 million and $91,000 in net loan charge-offs during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. There was a $5.7 million provision for loan losses during fiscal 2019 compared to no provision in 2018. The provision and increase in charge-offs was primarily related to a $6.0 million commercial lending relationship, which was fully charged off in the third and fourth quarters this fiscal year, as a result of the Company becoming aware at the end of March 2019, that a commercial borrower operating as a heavy equipment contractor with $6.0 million of outstanding borrowings from the Bank had unexpectedly ceased operations. For more information on this loan relationship, see Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Allowance for loan losses."
At June 30, 2019, our allowance for loan losses was $21.4 million, or 0.79%, of our total loan portfolio, and 206.9% of total nonaccruing loans. Excluding loans acquired, which have been recorded at fair value with an appropriate credit discount, the allowance for loan losses was 0.85% of total loans at June 30, 2019. Management’s estimation of an appropriate allowance for loan losses is inherently subjective as it requires estimates and assumptions that are susceptible to significant revisions as more information becomes available or as future events change. The level of allowance is based on estimates and the ultimate losses may vary from these estimates. Large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans, such as residential real estate, small commercial real estate, home equity and consumer loans, are evaluated in the aggregate using historical loss factors adjusted for current economic conditions. Assessing the allowance for loan losses is inherently subjective as it requires making material estimates, including the amount and timing of future cash flows expected to be received. In the opinion of management, the allowance, when taken as a whole, reflects estimated loan losses in our loan portfolio.
A loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due. Factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status, collateral value, and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due. Loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired. Management determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower, including the length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, the borrower's prior payment record, and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed.
Future additions to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary if economic and other conditions in the future differ substantially from the current operating environment. In addition, the Federal Reserve and the NCCOB as an integral part of their examination process periodically review our loan and REO portfolios and the related allowance for loan losses and valuation allowance for foreclosed real estate. The regulators may require the allowance for loan losses or the valuation allowance for foreclosed real estate to be increased based on their review of information available at the time of the examination, which would negatively affect our earnings.

Investment Activities
The Bank invests in various securities based on investment policies that have been approved by our board of directors and adhere to bank regulations. These securities include: United States Treasury obligations, securities of various federal agencies, including mortgage-backed securities, callable agency securities, certain certificates of deposit of insured banks and savings institutions, municipal bonds, investment grade corporate bonds and commercial paper, and federal funds. See “How We Are Regulated - HomeTrust Bank” for a discussion of additional restrictions on our investment activities.
Our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have the basic responsibility for the management of our investment portfolio, subject to the direction and guidance of the board of directors. These officers consider various factors when making decisions, including the marketability, maturity, and tax consequences of the proposed investment. The maturity structure of investments will be affected by various market conditions, including the current and anticipated slope of the yield curve, the level of interest rates, the trend of new deposit inflows, and the anticipated demand for funds via deposit withdrawals and loan originations and purchases.
The general objectives of our investment portfolio are to provide liquidity when loan demand is high, to assist in maintaining earnings when loan demand is low and to optimize earnings while satisfactorily managing risk, including credit risk, reinvestment risk, liquidity risk, and interest rate risk. At June 30, 2019, our $121.8 million securities portfolio consisted primarily of U.S. government agency securities and mortgage-backed securities, all held as available for sale. We currently do not have any investments held to maturity or for trading.
These securities are of high quality, possess minimal credit risk, and have an aggregate market value which is $952,000 more than total amortized cost as of June 30, 2019. For more information, please see Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Asset/Liability Management” and Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 in this report.
The Company also purchases commercial paper to take advantage of higher short-term returns with relatively low credit risk, yet remaining highly liquid. The commercial paper balance at June 30, 2019 was $241.4 million. For more information, please see Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Comparison of Financial Condition at June 30, 2019 and June 30, 2018.”
We do not currently participate in hedging programs, stand-alone contracts for interest rate caps, floors or swaps, or other activities involving the use of off-balance sheet derivative financial instruments and have no present intention to do so. Further, we do not invest in securities which are not rated investment grade.
As a member of the FHLB of Atlanta, we had $32.0 million in stock of the FHLB of Atlanta at June 30, 2019.

Sources of Funds
General.  Our sources of funds are primarily deposits, borrowings, payments of principal and interest on loans, and funds provided from operations. Deposits increased $131.0 million, or 6.0%, to $2.3 billion at June 30, 2019 as compared to $2.2 billion at June 30, 2018. 
Deposits.  We offer a variety of deposit accounts with a wide range of interest rates and terms to both consumers and businesses. Our deposits consist of savings, money market and demand accounts, and certificates of deposit ("CDs"). We solicit deposits primarily in our market areas. At June 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017, we had $176.8 million, $108.9 million, and $16.8 million in brokered deposits, respectively. As of June 30, 2019, core deposits, which we define as our non-certificate or non-time deposit accounts, represented approximately 69.4% of total deposits.
We primarily rely on competitive pricing policies, marketing, and customer service to attract and retain deposits. The flow of deposits is influenced significantly by general economic conditions, changes in money market and prevailing interest rates and competition. The variety of deposit accounts we offer has allowed us to be competitive in obtaining funds and to respond with flexibility to changes in consumer demand. We have become more susceptible to short-term fluctuations in deposit flows as customers have become more interest rate conscious. We try to manage the pricing of our deposits in keeping with our asset/liability management, liquidity and profitability objectives, subject to competitive factors. Based on our experience, we believe that our deposits are relatively stable sources of funds. Despite this stability, our ability to attract and maintain these deposits and the rates paid on them has been and will continue to be significantly affected by market conditions.
Approximately 30.6% of our total deposits are comprised of CDs. Our liquidity could be reduced if a significant amount of CDs, maturing within a short period of time, were not renewed. Historically, a significant portion of our CDs remain with us after they mature and we believe that this will continue. However, the need to retain these time deposits could result in an increase in our cost of funds.

Borrowings.  Although deposits are our primary source of funds, we may utilize borrowings to manage interest rate risk or as a cost-effective source of funds when they can be invested at a positive interest rate spread for additional capacity to fund loan demand according to our asset/liability management goals. Our borrowings consist of advances from the FHLB of Atlanta. 
We may obtain advances from the FHLB of Atlanta upon the security of certain of our mortgage loans and mortgage-backed and other securities. These advances may be made pursuant to several different credit programs, each of which has its own interest rate, range of maturities and call features, and all long-term advances are required to provide funds for residential home financing. As of June 30, 2019, we had $680.0 million in FHLB advances outstanding and the ability to borrow an additional $84.5 million. In addition to FHLB advances, at June 30, 2019 we had a $130.0 million line of credit with the FRB, subject to qualifying collateral, and $70.0 million available through lines of credit with three unaffiliated banks, none of which was outstanding at June 30, 2019. See Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for more information about our borrowings.

Subsidiary and Other Activities
HomeTrust Bank has one operating subsidiary, Western North Carolina Service Corporation (“WNCSC”), whose primary purpose is to own several office buildings in Asheville, North Carolina which are leased to HomeTrust Bank. Our capital investment in WNCSC as of June 30, 2019 was $895,000.
Employees
At June 30, 2019, we had a total of 505 full-time employees and 77 part-time employees. Our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining group. Management considers its employee relations to be good. Management also considers our employees to be a great team of highly engaged, competent and caring people who ensure every day that our customers are "Ready For What's Next" in their financial life. Their performance creates word-of-mouth referrals that result in the growth of new customers and expanded customer relationships.
Internet Website
We maintain a website with the address www.htb.com. The information contained on our website is not included as a part of, or incorporated by reference into, this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Other than an investor’s own Internet access charges, we make available free of charge through our website our Annual Report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to these reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after we have electronically filed such material with, or furnished such material to, the SEC.
HOW WE ARE REGULATED
General. HomeTrust Bancshares, Inc. is subject to examination and supervision by, and is required to file certain reports with, the Federal Reserve. HomeTrust Bancshares, Inc. is also subject to the rules and regulations of the SEC under the federal securities laws.
The Bank is subject to examination and regulation primarily by the NCCOB and the Federal Reserve. This system of regulation and supervision establishes a comprehensive framework of activities in which the Bank may engage and is intended primarily for the protection of depositors and the FDIC deposit insurance fund. The Bank is periodically examined by the NCCOB and the Federal Reserve to ensure that it satisfies applicable standards with respect to its capital adequacy, assets, management, earnings, liquidity and sensitivity to market interest rates. The NCCOB and the Federal Reserve also regulate the branching authority of the Bank. The Bank’s relationship with its depositors and borrowers is regulated by federal consumer protection laws. The CFPB issues regulations under those laws that the Bank must comply with. The Bank’s relationship with its depositors and borrowers is also regulated by state laws with respect to certain matters, including the enforceability of loan documents.
On August 25, 2014, the Bank converted from a federal savings bank to a national bank. In connection with this conversion of the Bank, HomeTrust Bancshares, Inc. changed from a savings and loan holding company to a bank holding company, regulated under the Bank Holding Company Act ("BHCA"). On December 31, 2015, the Bank converted from a national bank to a North Carolina state-chartered bank and remained a member of the Federal Reserve System. Prior to December 31, 2015, the Bank was regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. In connection with the charter change, the Company elected to be treated as a financial holding company by the Federal Reserve.

The following is a brief description of certain laws and regulations applicable to HomeTrust Bancshares, Inc. and the Bank. Descriptions of laws and regulations here and elsewhere in this report do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the actual laws and regulations. Legislation is introduced from time to time in the United States Congress and the North Carolina legislature that may affect the operations of HomeTrust Bancshares and the Bank. In addition, the regulations that govern us may be amended from time to time. Any such legislation or regulatory changes in the future could adversely affect our operations and financial condition.
Financial Regulatory Reform. The Dodd-Frank Act, which was enacted in July 2010, imposed various restrictions and an expanded framework of regulatory oversight for financial entities, including depository institutions and their holding companies.
In May 2018, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act (the “Regulatory Relief Act”), was enacted to modify or remove certain financial reform rules and regulations, including some of those implemented under the Dodd-Frank Act. While the Act maintains most of the regulatory structure established by the Dodd-Frank Act, it amends certain aspects of the regulatory framework for small depository institutions with assets of less than $10 billion and for large banks with assets of more than $50 billion. Many of these changes could result in meaningful regulatory changes for community banks such as HomeTrust Bank, and their holding companies.
The Regulatory Relief Act, among other matters, expands the definition of qualified mortgages which may be held by a financial institution and simplifies the regulatory capital rules for financial institutions and their holding companies with total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion by instructing the federal banking regulators to establish a single “Community Bank Leverage Ratio” of between 8 and 10 percent. Any qualifying depository institution or its holding company that exceeds the “community bank leverage ratio” will be considered to have met generally applicable leverage and risk-based regulatory capital requirements and any qualifying depository institution that exceeds the new ratio will be considered to be “well capitalized” under the prompt corrective action rules. Regulations to implement the Community Bank Leverage Ratio have been proposed, but not yet adopted in final form. In addition, the Regulatory Relief Act includes certain regulatory relief regarding such matters as call reports, the Volcker Rule (proprietary trading prohibitions), mortgage disclosures and risk weights for certain high-risk commercial real estate loans.
It is difficult at this time to predict when or how any new standards under the Regulatory Relief Act will ultimately be applied to us or what specific impact the Act and the yet-to-be-written implementing rules and regulations will have on community banks.
Regulation of HomeTrust Bank
The Bank is subject to regulation and oversight by the NCCOB and the Federal Reserve extending to all aspects of its operations, including but not limited to requirements concerning an allowance for loan losses, lending and mortgage operations, interest rates received on loans and paid on deposits, the payment of dividends to the Company, loans to officers and directors, mergers and acquisitions, capital, and the opening and closing of branches. See "- Current Capital Requirements for HomeTrust Bank," "-Limitations on Dividends and Other Capital Distributions" and “-New Capital Rules” for additional details. 
As a state-chartered institution, the Bank is subject to periodic examinations by the NCCOB and the Federal Reserve. During these examinations, the examiners assess compliance with state and federal banking regulations and the safety and soundness standards on such matters as loan underwriting and documentation, asset quality, earnings standards, internal controls and audit systems, interest rate risk exposure, and employee compensation and benefits. Any institution that fails to comply with these standards must submit a compliance plan.
The Bank is subject to a statutory lending limit on aggregate loans to one person or a group of persons combined because of certain relationships and common interests. That limit is generally equal to 15% of unimpaired capital and surplus, which was $56.6 million as of June 30, 2019. The limit is increased to 25% for loans fully secured by readily marketable collateral. The Bank has no lending relationships in excess of its lending limit.
The NCCOB and the Federal Reserve have enforcement responsibility over the Bank and the authority to bring actions against the Bank and certain institution-affiliated parties, including officers, directors, and employees, for violations of laws or regulations and for engaging in unsafe and unsound practices. Formal enforcement actions include the issuance of a capital directive or cease and desist order, civil money penalties, removal of officers and/or directors, and receivership or conservatorship of the institution. 
Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, federal banking and securities regulators issued final rules to implement Section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Act (the “Volcker Rule”). These rules became effective April 15, 2014, but the Federal Reserve extended the conformance period for certain features to July 21, 2017. Generally, subject to a transition period and certain exceptions, the Volcker Rule restricts insured depository institutions and their affiliates from engaging in short-term proprietary trading of certain securities, investing in funds not registered with the SEC with collateral not entirely comprised of loans, and from engaging in hedging activities that do not hedge a specific identified risk. Banks with total consolidated assets of $10 billion or less and total consolidated trading assets and liabilities equal to 5% or less of total consolidated assets are not subject to the Volcker Rule.
Insurance of Accounts and Regulation by the FDIC.  The deposit insurance fund of the FDIC insures deposit accounts in HomeTrust Bank up to $250,000 per separately insured deposit ownership right or category. 
Under the FDIC’s risk-based assessment system, insured institutions are assessed based on supervisory ratings and in general, stronger institutions pay lower rates while riskier institutions pay higher rates. Currently, assessment rates (inclusive of certain possible adjustments) range from 1.5 to 40.0 basis points of each institution’s total average consolidated assets less average tangible equity (subject to upward adjustment for certain

debt). The FDIC has authority to increase insurance assessments, and any significant increases would have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and results of operations of the Company. Management cannot predict what assessment rates will be in the future.
Insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that an institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC. We do not currently know of any practice, condition, or violation that may lead to termination of our deposit insurance. 
Transactions with Related Parties.  Federal laws strictly limit the ability of banks to engage in certain transactions with their affiliates, including their bank holding companies. Transactions between the Bank and its affiliates are required to be on terms as favorable to the Bank as transactions with non-affiliates. Certain of these transactions, such as loans to an affiliate, are restricted to a percentage of the Bank's capital, and loans to affiliates require eligible collateral in specified amounts. HomeTrust Bancshares, Inc. is an affiliate of the Bank. 
Federal law generally prohibits loans by HomeTrust Bancshares to its executive officers and directors, but there is a specific exception for loans made by HomeTrust Bank to its executive officers and directors in compliance with federal banking laws. However, HomeTrust Bank’s authority to extend credit to its executive officers, directors and 10% shareholders (“insiders”), as well as entities those insiders control, is limited. The individual and aggregate amounts of loans that HomeTrust Bank may make to insiders are based, in part, on HomeTrust Bank’s capital level and require that certain board approval procedures be followed. Such loans are required to be made on terms substantially the same as those offered to unaffiliated individuals and not involve more than the normal risk of repayment. There is an exception for loans made pursuant to a benefit or compensation program that is widely available to all employees of the institution and does not give preference to insiders over other employees. Loans to executive officers are subject to additional limitations based on the type of loan involved.
Current Capital Requirements for HomeTrust Bank.  The Bank is required to maintain specified levels of regulatory capital under federal banking regulations. The capital adequacy requirements are quantitative measures established by regulation that require the Bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of capital. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by bank regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Company's financial statements.
Effective January 1, 2015 (with some changes transitioned into full effectiveness on January 1, 2019), the Bank became subject to capital regulations, which created a new required ratio for common equity Tier 1 (“CET1”) capital, increased the minimum leverage and Tier 1 capital ratios, changed the risk-weightings of certain assets for purposes of the risk-based capital ratios, mandated an additional capital conservation buffer over the minimum capital ratios, and changed what qualifies as capital for purposes of meeting the capital requirements. These regulations implement the regulatory capital reforms required by the Dodd Frank Act and the “Basel III” requirements.
Under the capital regulations, the minimum required capital ratios for the Company and the Bank are (i) a CETI capital ratio of 4.5%; (ii) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0%; (iii) a total capital ratio of 8.0%; and (iv) a leverage ratio (the ratio of Tier 1 capital to average total consolidated assets) of 4.0% for all financial institutions. CET1 generally consists of common stock and retained earnings. Tier 1 capital generally consists of CET1 and noncumulative perpetual preferred stock. Tier 2 capital generally consists of other preferred stock and subordinated debt meeting certain conditions plus an amount of the allowance for loan and lease losses up to 1.25% of assets. Total capital is the sum of Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital. The CET1 capital ratio, the Tier 1 capital ratio and the total capital ratio are sometimes referred to as the risk-based capital ratios and are determined based on risk-weightings of assets and certain off-balance sheet items that range from 0% to 1,250%.
In addition to the capital requirements, there were a number of changes in what constitutes regulatory capital, subject to a certain transition period. These changes include the phasing-out of certain instruments as qualifying capital. At June 30, 2019 the Bank did not have any of these instruments. Mortgage servicing and deferred tax assets over designated percentages of CET1 are deducted from capital, subject to a transition period ending December 31, 2017. Because of our asset size, we were eligible to elect and have elected to permanently opt-out of the inclusion of unrealized gains and losses on available for sale debt and equity securities in our capital calculations.
As noted above, in addition to the risk-based capital ratios, the Bank must maintain a capital conservation buffer consisting of additional CET1 capital greater than 2.5% of risk-weighted assets above the minimum levels for such ratios in order to avoid limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying discretionary bonuses based on percentages of eligible retained income that could be utilized for such actions. The capital conservation buffer requirement began to be phased in starting in January 2016 at an amount more than 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and increased each year until fully implemented to an amount more than 2.5% of risk-weighted assets on January 1, 2019. To meet the minimum capital ratios and the capital conservation buffer requirements, the capital ratios applicable to the Company and the Bank are (i) a CETI capital ratio greater than 7.0%; (ii) a Tier 1 capital ratio greater than 8.5%; (iii) a total capital ratio greater than 10.5%; and (iv) a Tier 1 leverage ratio greater than 4.0%. As of June 30, 2019, the conservation buffer for HomeTrust Bank was 4.3%.
To be consider “well capitalized,” a depository institution must have a Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 8%, a total capital ratio of at least 10%, a CET1 capital ratio of at least 6.5% and a leverage ratio of at least 5% and not be subject to an individualized order, directive or agreement under which its primary federal banking regulator requires it to maintain a specific capital level. Institutions that are not well capitalized are subject to certain restrictions on brokered deposits and interest rates on deposits. Under certain circumstances, regulators are required to take certain actions against banks that fail to meet the minimum required capital ratios. Any such institution must submit a capital restoration plan and, until such plan is approved may not increase its assets, acquire another depository institution, establish a branch or engage in any new activities, or make capital distributions. As of June 30, 2019, HomeTrust Bank met the requirements to be “well capitalized” and met the fully phased-in capital conservation buffer requirement. For additional information regarding the Bank’s required and actual capital levels at June 30, 2019, see Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 in this report.

Federal Home Loan Bank System. HomeTrust Bank is a member of the FHLB of Atlanta, one of 11 regional Federal Home Loan Banks that administer the home financing credit function of financial institutions. The Federal Home Loan Banks are subject to the oversight of the Federal Housing Finance Agency (“FHFA”) and each FHLB serves as a reserve or central bank for its members within its assigned region. The Federal Home Loan Banks are funded primarily from proceeds derived from the sale of consolidated obligations of the Federal Home Loan Bank System and makes loans or advances to members in accordance with policies and procedures established by the Board of Directors of the FHLB, which are subject to the oversight of the FHFA. All advances from the FHLB are required to be fully secured by sufficient collateral as determined by the FHLB. In addition, all long-term advances are required to provide funds for residential home financing. See “Business -Sources of Funds - Borrowings.”
At June 30, 2019, the Bank held $32.0 million in FHLB stock that was in compliance with the holding requirements. The FHLB pays dividends quarterly, and HomeTrust Bank received $2.0 million in dividends during the year ended June 30, 2019.
The FHLBs continue to contribute to low- and moderately-priced housing programs through direct loans or interest subsidies on advances targeted for community investment and low- and moderate-income housing projects. These contributions have adversely affected the level of FHLB dividends paid and could continue to do so in the future. These contributions could also have an adverse effect on the value of FHLB stock in the future. A reduction in value of the Bank’s FHLB stock may result in a decrease in net income and possibly capital.
Commercial Real Estate Lending Concentrations. The federal banking agencies have issued guidance on sound risk management practices for concentrations in commercial real estate lending. The particular focus is on exposure to commercial real estate loans that are dependent on the cash flow from the real estate held as collateral and that are likely to be sensitive to conditions in the commercial real estate market (as opposed to real estate collateral held as a secondary source of repayment or as an abundance of caution). The purpose of the guidance is not to limit a bank’s commercial real estate lending but to guide banks in developing risk management practices and capital levels commensurate with the level and nature of real estate concentrations. The guidance directs the Federal Reserve and other bank regulatory agencies to focus their supervisory resources on institutions that may have significant commercial real estate loan concentration risk. A bank that has experienced rapid growth in commercial real estate lending, has notable exposure to a specific type of commercial real estate loan, or is approaching or exceeding the following supervisory criteria may be identified for further supervisory analysis with respect to real estate concentration risk:

• | Total reported loans for construction, land development and other land represent 100% or more of the bank’s total regulatory capital; or


• | Total commercial real estate loans (as defined in the guidance) represent 300% or more of the bank’s total regulatory capital and the outstanding balance of the bank’s commercial real estate loan portfolio has increased 50% or more during the prior 36 months.

The guidance provides that the strength of an institution’s lending and risk management practices with respect to such concentrations will be taken into account in supervisory guidance on evaluation of capital adequacy. As of June 30, 2019, HomeTrust Bank’s aggregate recorded loan balances for construction, land development and land loans were 58.7% of regulatory capital. In addition, at June 30, 2019, HomeTrust Bank’s commercial real estate loans, as defined by the guidance, were 252.6% of regulatory capital.
Community Reinvestment and Consumer Protection Laws.  In connection with its deposit-taking, lending and other activities, the Bank is subject to a number of federal laws designed to protect consumers and promote lending for various purposes. The CFPB issues regulations and standards under these federal consumer protection laws, which include the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Truth-in-Lending Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act and others. The CFPB has promulgated a number of proposed and final regulations under these laws that will affect our consumer businesses. Among these regulatory initiatives, are final regulations setting “ability to repay” and “qualified mortgage” standards for residential mortgage loans and establishing new mortgage loan servicing and loan originator compensation standards. In addition, customer privacy regulations limit the ability of the Bank to disclose nonpublic consumer information to non-affiliated third parties. These regulations require disclosure of privacy policies and allow consumers to prevent certain personal information from being shared with non-affiliated parties.
The Community Reinvestment Act ("CRA") requires that the Federal Reserve assess the Bank's record in meeting the credit needs of the communities it serves, especially low and moderate income neighborhoods. Under the CRA, institutions are assigned a rating of "outstanding," "satisfactory," "needs to improve," or "substantial non-compliance." The Bank received a "satisfactory" rating in its most recent CRA evaluation.
Bank Secrecy Act / Anti-Money Laundering Laws.  The Bank is subject to the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering laws and regulations, including the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001. These laws and regulations require the Bank to implement policies, procedures, and controls to detect, prevent, and report money laundering and terrorist financing and to verify the identity of their customers. Violations of these requirements can result in substantial civil and criminal sanctions. In addition, provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act require the federal financial institution regulatory agencies to consider the effectiveness of a financial institution's anti-money laundering activities when reviewing mergers and acquisitions.
Limitations on Dividends.  NCCOB and Federal Reserve regulations impose various restrictions on the ability of the Bank to pay dividends. The Bank generally may pay dividends during any calendar year in an amount up to 100% of net income for the year-to-date plus retained net income for the two preceding years, without the approval of the Federal Reserve. If the Bank proposes to pay a dividend that will exceed this limitation, it must obtain the Federal Reserve's prior approval. The Federal Reserve may object to a proposed dividend based on safety and soundness concerns. No insured depository institution may pay a dividend if, after paying the dividend, the institution would be undercapitalized. In addition, as noted above, if the Bank does not have the required capital conservation buffer, its ability to pay dividends to HomeTrust Bancshares, Inc. will be limited.

Holding Company Regulation
As a bank holding company under the BHCA, HomeTrust Bancshares, Inc. is subject to regulation, supervision, and examination by the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve has enforcement authority with respect to HomeTrust Bancshares, Inc. similar to its enforcement authority over the Bank. We are required to file quarterly reports with the Federal Reserve and provide additional information as the Federal Reserve may require. The Federal Reserve may examine us, and any of our subsidiaries, and charge us for the cost of the examination. The Federal Reserve also has extensive enforcement authority over bank holding companies, including, among other things, the ability to assess civil money penalties, to issue cease and desist or removal orders and to require that a holding company divest subsidiaries (including its bank subsidiaries). In general, enforcement actions may be initiated for violations of law and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices. HomeTrust Bancshares, Inc. is also required to file certain reports with, and otherwise comply with the rules and regulations of the SEC.
The Bank Holding Company Act. Under the BHCA, we are supervised by the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve has a policy that a bank holding company is required to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary banks and may not conduct its operations in an unsafe or unsound manner. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act and earlier Federal Reserve policy provide that a bank holding company should serve as a source of strength to its subsidiary banks by having the ability to provide financial assistance to its subsidiary banks during periods of financial distress to the banks. A bank holding company's failure to meet its obligation to serve as a source of strength to its subsidiary banks will generally be considered by the Federal Reserve to be an unsafe and unsound banking practice or a violation of the Federal Reserve's regulations or both. No regulations have yet been proposed by the Federal Reserve to implement the source of strength doctrine required by the Dodd-Frank Act. HomeTrust Bancshares, Inc. and any subsidiaries that it may control are considered “affiliates” within the meaning of the Federal Reserve Act, and transactions between HomeTrust Bancshares, Inc. and affiliates are subject to numerous restrictions. With some exceptions, HomeTrust Bancshares, Inc. and its subsidiaries are prohibited from tying the provision of various services, such as extensions of credit, to other services offered by HomeTrust Bancshares, Inc. or by its affiliates.
Permissible Activities.  The business activities of HomeTrust Bancshares, Inc. are generally limited to those activities permissible for bank holding companies under Section 4(c)(8) of the BHCA, those permitted for a financial holding company under Section 4(f) of the BHCA, and certain additional activities authorized by regulation. The BHCA generally prohibits a financial holding company from acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares of any company which is not a bank or bank holding company. A bank holding company must obtain Federal Reserve approval before acquiring directly or indirectly, ownership or control of any voting shares of another bank or bank holding company if, after such acquisition, it would own or control more than 5% of such shares (unless it already owns or controls the majority of such shares).
Capital Requirements for HomeTrust Bancshares.  As a bank holding company, HomeTrust Bancshares, Inc. is subject to the minimum regulatory capital requirements established by the Federal Reserve regulation, which generally are the same as the capital requirements for the Bank. These capital requirements include provisions that might impact the ability of the Company to pay dividends to its stockholders or repurchase its shares. For a description of the capital regulations, see " Regulation of HomeTrust Bank-Current Capital Requirements for HomeTrust Bank" and Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 in this report.
At June 30, 2019, the HomeTrust Bancshares, Inc. exceeded its minimum regulatory capital requirements under Federal Reserve regulations.
Federal Securities Law.  The stock of HomeTrust Bancshares, Inc. is registered with the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). HomeTrust Bancshares, Inc. is subject to the information, proxy solicitation, insider trading restrictions, and other requirements of the SEC under the Exchange Act.
The SEC has adopted regulations and policies applicable to a registered company under the Exchange Act that seek to increase corporate responsibility, provide for enhanced penalties for accounting and auditing improprieties and protect investors by improving the accuracy and reliability of corporate disclosures in SEC filings. These regulations and policies include very specific additional disclosure requirements and mandate corporate governance practices.
On October 28, 2015, the Auditing Standards Board of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants ("AICPA") issued Statement on Auditing Standards ("SAS") No. 130 - An Audit of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting That Is Integrated With an Audit of Financial Statement. Under SAS 130, our auditors are required to opine on the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting for the current fiscal year. 
Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act (“SOX Act”) of 2002 addresses a broad range of corporate governance, auditing and accounting, executive compensation, and disclosure requirements for public companies and their directors and officers. The SOX Act requires our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer to certify the accuracy of certain information included in our quarterly and annual reports. The rules require these officers to certify that they are responsible for establishing, maintaining, and regularly evaluating the effectiveness of our financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures; that they have made certain disclosures to the auditors and to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors about our controls and procedures; and that they have included information in their quarterly and annual filings about their evaluation and whether there have been significant changes to the controls and procedures or other factors which would significantly impact these controls subsequent to their evaluation. Section 404 of the SOX Act requires management to undertake an assessment of the adequacy and effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting and requires our auditors to attest to and report on the effectiveness of these controls.
Dividends. The Federal Reserve has issued a policy statement on the payment of cash dividends by bank holding companies, which expresses its view that although there are no specific regulations restricting dividend payments by bank holding companies other than state corporate laws, a bank holding company must maintain an adequate capital position and generally should not pay cash dividends unless the company's net income 
34

for the past year is sufficient to fully fund the cash dividends and that the prospective rate of earnings appears consistent with the company's capital needs, asset quality, and overall financial condition. The Federal Reserve policy statement also indicates that it would be inappropriate for a company experiencing serious financial problems to borrow funds to pay dividends. As described above under “Regulation of HomeTrust Bank-Current Capital Requirements for HomeTrust Bank," the capital conservation buffer requirement can also restrict the ability of HomeTrust Bancshares, Inc. and the Bank to pay dividends.
Stock Repurchases. A bank holding company, except for certain “well-capitalized” and highly rated bank holding companies, is required to give the Federal Reserve prior written notice of any purchase or redemption of its outstanding equity securities if the gross consideration for the purchase or redemption, when combined with the net consideration paid for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding twelve months, is equal to 10% or more of its consolidated net worth. The Federal Reserve may disapprove such a purchase or redemption if it determines that the proposal would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice or would violate any law, regulation, Federal Reserve order or any condition imposed by, or written agreement with, the Federal Reserve. 
Legislative and Regulatory Proposals. Any changes in the extensive regulatory scheme to which HomeTrust Bancshares, Inc. or the Bank is and will be subject, whether by any of the federal banking agencies or Congress, or the North Carolina legislature or NCCOB, could have a material effect on the Company or HomeTrust Bank, and HomeTrust Bancshares, Inc. and the Bank cannot predict what, if any, future actions may be taken by legislative or regulatory authorities or what impact such actions may have.
Federal Taxation
General.  HomeTrust Bancshares Inc. and the Bank are subject to federal income taxation in the same general manner as other corporations, with some exceptions discussed below. The following discussion of federal taxation is intended only to summarize material federal income tax matters and is not a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to HomeTrust Bancshares and HomeTrust.
On December 22, 2017, the U.S. Government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”). The Tax Act amends the Internal Revenue Code to reduce tax rates and modify policies, credits, and deductions for individuals and businesses. For businesses, the Tax Act reduced the corporate federal income tax rate from a maximum of 35% to a flat 21%. The corporate federal income tax rate reduction was effective January 1, 2018. Since the Company has a fiscal year end of June 30th, the reduced federal corporate income tax rate for fiscal year 2018 was the result of the application of a blended federal statutory tax rate of 27.5%, which was based on the applicable tax rates before and after the Tax Act and corresponding number of days in the fiscal year before and after enactment, and then became a flat 21% corporate income tax rate for fiscal 2019 and thereafter. The Tax Act also required a revaluation the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities to account for the future impact of lower corporate income tax rates and other provisions of the legislation. As a result of the Company’s revaluation in fiscal 2018, the net deferred tax asset (“DTA”) was reduced through an increase to the provision for income tax. The revaluation of our DTA balance resulted in a one-time increase for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 to federal income tax of $17.6 million. See Note 13 "Income Taxes" in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.
Method of Accounting.  For federal income tax purposes, the Company currently reports its income and expenses on the accrual method of accounting and uses a fiscal year ending on June 30th for filing its federal income tax return. 
Minimum Tax. Prior to the enactment of the Tax Act, the Internal Revenue Code ("IRC") imposed an alternative minimum tax at a rate of 20% on a base of regular taxable income plus certain tax preferences, called alternative minimum taxable income. The alternative minimum tax was payable to the extent such alternative minimum taxable income was in excess of the regular tax. Net operating losses could offset no more than 90% of alternative minimum taxable income. Certain payments of alternative minimum tax could be used as credits against regular tax liabilities in future years. Upon enactment of the Tax Act, the alternative minimum tax was repealed. 
Net Operating Loss Carryovers.  A financial institution may carryback net operating losses to the preceding two taxable years and forward to the succeeding 20 taxable years. This provision applies to losses incurred in taxable years beginning after August 6, 1997. In 2009, IRC 172 (b) (1) was amended to allow businesses to carry back losses incurred in 2008 and 2009 for up to five years to offset 50% of the available income from the fifth year and 100% of the available income for the other four years. At June 30, 2019, we had $24.2 million of net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes.
Corporate Dividends-Received Deduction.  HomeTrust Bancshares, Inc. files a consolidated return with the Bank. As a result, any dividends HomeTrust Bancshares, Inc. receives from the Bank will not be included as income to HomeTrust Bancshares, Inc. The corporate dividends-received deduction is 100%, or 80% in the case of dividends received from corporations with which a corporate recipient does not file a consolidated tax return, depending on the level of stock ownership of the payer of the dividend.
State Taxation
North Carolina.  On July 24, 2013, The Tax Simplification and Reduction Act of 2013 was signed into law. With this act, corporate income tax rates in North Carolina were reduced as net General Fund tax collection revenues goals were met. For tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2017, 2016, and 2015 the tax rate was 3%, 4%, and 5%, respectively. In June 2017, the state announced an additional reduction in the tax rate to 2.5% beginning on January 1, 2019. This rate reduction is not contingent on any revenue goals. The decrease in the North Carolina corporate tax rate will continue to decrease the deferred tax assets currently recorded on our balance sheet with a corresponding increase to our income tax provision, as temporary tax differences are reversed at lower state tax rates.
35

If a corporation in North Carolina does business in North Carolina and in one or more other states, North Carolina taxes a fraction of the corporation’s income based on the amount of sales, payroll, and property it maintains within North Carolina. North Carolina franchise tax is levied on business corporations at the rate of $1.50 per $1,000 of the largest of the following three alternate bases: (i) the amount of the corporation’s capital stock, surplus, and undivided profits apportionable to the state; (ii) 55% of the appraised value of the corporation’s property in the state subject to local taxation; or (iii) the book value of the corporation’s real and tangible personal property in the state less any outstanding debt that was created to acquire or improve real property in the state.
Any cash dividends, in excess of a certain exempt amount, that would be paid with respect to HomeTrust Bancshares common stock to a shareholder (including a partnership and certain other entities) who is a resident of North Carolina will be subject to the North Carolina income tax. Any distribution by a corporation from earnings according to percentage ownership is considered a dividend, and the definition of a dividend for North Carolina income tax purposes may not be the same as the definition of a dividend for federal income tax purposes. A corporate distribution may be treated as a dividend for North Carolina income tax purposes if it is paid from funds that exceed the corporation’s earned surplus and profits under certain circumstances.
South Carolina. The state of South Carolina requires banks to file a bank tax return. As a multi-state bank, we pay taxes on the portion of revenue generated within the state. In 2019 and 2018 the tax rate was 5.0%.
Tennessee. The state of Tennessee requires banks to file a franchise and excise tax form for financial institutions. The franchise tax is based on the portion of revenue generated in the state, the net worth of the Bank, and the applicable franchise tax, which was $0.25 per $100 in 2019 and 2018. The excise tax is based on the taxable income (as defined by the state), the portion of revenue generated in the state, and the applicable excise tax, which was 6.5% in 2019 and 2018.
Virginia. The state of Virginia requires banks to file a bank franchise tax. The tax is based on the portion of capital deployed within the state and county level (as defined by the state) and taxed at $1 per $100 of taxable value.
