Item 1. Business 
General 
 Nicholas Financial, Inc. (“Nicholas Financial-Canada”) is a Canadian holding company incorporated under the laws of British Columbia in 1986. The business activities of Nicholas Financial-Canada are currently conducted exclusively through its wholly-owned indirect subsidiary, Nicholas Financial, Inc., a Florida corporation (“Nicholas Financial”). Nicholas Financial is a specialized consumer finance company engaged primarily in acquiring and servicing automobile finance installment contracts (“Contracts”) for purchases of used and new automobiles and light trucks. To a lesser extent, Nicholas Financial also originates direct consumer loans (“Direct Loans”) and sells consumer-finance related products. A second Florida subsidiary, Nicholas Data Services, Inc. (“NDS”), serves as the intermediate holding company for Nicholas Financial. In addition, NF Funding I, LLC (“NF Funding I”), is a newly formed, wholly-owned, special purpose financing subsidiary of Nicholas Financial.  
 Nicholas Financial-Canada, Nicholas Financial, NDS, and NF Funding I are hereafter collectively referred to as the “Company”.   Nicholas Financial’s operations accounted for approximately 100% of the Company’s consolidated revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, as NF Funding I accounted for less than 1% of consolidated revenue for fiscal 2019.  Nicholas Financial’s operations accounted for 100% of the Company’s consolidated revenue for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018.

Operating Strategy 
 The Company remains committed to its branch-based model and its core product of financing primary transportation to and from work for the subprime borrower. The Company will strategically employ the use of centralized servicing departments to supplement the branch operations and improve operational efficiencies, but its focus will be on its core business model of decentralized operations. The Company’s strategy will also include pricing based on risk (rate, yield, advance, etc.) and a commitment to the underwriting discipline required for optimal portfolio performance.  The Company’s principal goals are to increase its profitability and its long-term shareholder value.  During fiscal 2019, the Company focused on the following items:

• | recommitted to branch model;
--+-----------------------------


• | restored accountability to branch managers;
--+--------------------------------------------


• | focused on return on assets;
--+-----------------------------


• | returned to core products;
--+---------------------------


• | focused on profitability over volume;
--+--------------------------------------

• | focused on independent dealers;
--+--------------------------------


• | stopped chasing the competition;
--+---------------------------------


• | focused more on pricing;
--+-------------------------


• | focused on growing the Direct Loan portfolio.
--+----------------------------------------------

 The Company also focused on selecting the right markets to have branch locations.  As of March 31, 2019, the Company operated in 15 states — Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan, Missouri, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Wisconsin (with the Wisconsin operations being conducted out the Charlotte, NC office). 
 During fiscal 2018, the Company consolidated branch offices located in Dayton, Ohio, Doral, Florida, and Villa Park, Illinois with other branches in those markets. During fiscal 2019, the Company exited the Maryland market by closing its branch office located in Baltimore. The Company also consolidated offices in Florida (the Sunrise branch was consolidated with the Pompano branch) and in North Carolina (the Winston-Salem branch consolidated with the Greensboro branch). In addition, the Company announced that it was exiting the Texas and Virginia markets.  During the first quarter of fiscal 2020, the Company also consolidated two branches in North Carolina and two branches in Georgia. The Company will continue to evaluate underperforming markets and underperforming branches, as needed.  
 During fiscal 2019, the Company expanded into Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and once receivables reach an acceptable level, the Company intends to open a physical brick-and-mortar location there.  The Company also continues to look for other expansion opportunities. Although the Company cannot assert how many new markets it will enter (if any) in the foreseeable future, it does remain focused on growing the branch network where conditions are favorable.
 On April 30, 2019 the Company acquired substantially all of the assets of ML Credit Group, LLC (d/b/a Metrolina Credit Company) (“Metrolina”).  Metrolina provides automobile financing to consumers by direct loans and through purchases of retail installment sales contracts originated by automobile dealers in the states of North Carolina and South Carolina. This acquisition represents the first bulk purchase of Contracts in over two decades.  If other opportunities arise, the Company may consider possible acquisitions of portfolios of seasoned Contracts from dealers or lenders in bulk transactions as a means of further penetrating its existing markets or expanding its presence in targeted geographic locations.
 The Company is currently licensed to provide Direct Loans in Florida, North Carolina, Ohio, and has also started writing deregulated direct loans over $3,000 in Georgia. The Company solicits current and former customers in these states for the purpose of selling Direct Loans to such customers.   In addition, the Company is focused on the expansion of its Direct Loan capabilities to the other states in which it acquires Contracts. Even with this targeted expansion, the Company expects its total Direct Loans portfolio to remain between 3% and 10% of its total portfolio for the foreseeable future.  
 The Company cannot provide any assurances that it will be able to expand in either its current markets or any targeted new markets. 
 Automobile Finance Business – Contracts 
 The Company is engaged in the business of providing financing programs, primarily to purchasers of used cars and light trucks who meet the Company’s credit standards but who do not meet the credit standards of traditional lenders, such as banks and credit unions, because of the customer’s credit history, job instability, the age of the vehicle being financed, or some other factor(s). Unlike traditional lenders, which look primarily to the credit history of the borrower in making lending decisions and typically finance new automobiles, the Company is willing to purchase Contracts for purchases made by borrowers who do not have a good credit history and for older model and high-mileage automobiles. In making decisions regarding the purchase of a particular Contract, the Company considers the following factors related to the borrower: current income; credit history; history in making installment payments for automobiles; current and prior job status; and place and length of residence. In addition, the Company examines its prior experience with Contracts purchased from the dealer from which the Company is purchasing the Contract, and the value of the automobile in relation to the purchase price and the term of the Contract.

As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company’s automobile finance programs are conducted in 15 states through a total of 50 branch offices located in the states of  Florida, Georgia, Ohio, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Missouri, North Carolina, Alabama, South Carolina, Tennessee, Michigan, Kansas, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. The Company acquires Contracts in Wisconsin using the underwriting staff of the Charlotte, North Carolina branch location. As of March 31, 2019, the Company had non-exclusive agreements with approximately 4,500 dealers, of which approximately 1,400 were active, for the purchase of individual Contracts that meet the Company’s financing criteria. The Company considers a dealer agreement to be active if the Company has purchased a Contract thereunder in the last six months. Each dealer agreement requires the dealer to originate Contracts in accordance with the Company’s guidelines. Once a Contract is purchased by the Company, the dealer is no longer involved in the relationship between the Company and the borrower, other than through the existence of limited representations and warranties of the dealer in favor of the Company. 
 A customer under a Contract typically makes a down payment, in the form of cash and/or trade-in, ranging from 5% to 35% of the sale price of the vehicle financed. The balance of the purchase price of the vehicle plus taxes, title fees and, if applicable, premiums for extended service contracts, gap insurance, roadside assistance plans, credit disability insurance and/or credit life insurance are generally financed over a period of 12 to 60 months. At approximately the time of origination, the Company purchases a Contract from an automobile dealer at a negotiated price that is less than the original principal amount being financed by the purchaser of the automobile. The Company refers to the difference between the negotiated price and the original principal amount being financed as the dealer discount. The amount of the dealer discount depends upon factors such as the age and value of the automobile and the creditworthiness of the customer. The Company has recommitted to maintaining pricing discipline and therefore places less emphasis on competition when pricing the discount.  Generally, the Company will pay more (i.e., purchase the Contract at a smaller discount from the original principal amount) for Contracts as the credit risk of the customer improves. To date, the Contracts purchased by the Company have been purchased at discounts that range from 1% to 15% of the original principal amount of each Contract. As of March 31, 2019, the Company’s loan portfolio consisted exclusively of Contracts purchased without recourse to the dealer, however each dealer remains potentially liable to the Company for breaches of certain representations and warranties made by the dealer with respect to compliance with applicable federal and state laws and valid title to the vehicle. The Company’s policy is to only purchase a Contract after the dealer has provided the Company with the requisite proof that (a) the Company has a first priority lien on the financed vehicle (or the Company has, in fact, perfected such first priority lien), (b) the customer has obtained the required collision insurance naming the Company as loss payee with a deductible of not more than $1,000 and (c) the Contract has been fully and accurately completed and validly executed. Once the Company has received and approved all required documents, it pays the dealer for the Contract and commences servicing the Contract.

Direct Loans 
 The Company currently originates Direct Loans in Florida, North Carolina, Georgia, and Ohio. Direct Loans are loans originated directly between the Company and the consumer. These loans are typically for amounts ranging from $1,000 to $15,000 and are generally secured by a lien on an automobile, watercraft or other permissible tangible personal property. The average loan made during fiscal 2019 by the Company had an initial principal balance of approximately $4,000. The Company does not expect the average loan size to increase significantly within the foreseeable future. Most of the Direct Loans are originated with current or former customers under the Company’s automobile financing program. The typical Direct Loan represents a better credit risk than our typical Contract due to the customer’s historical payment history with the Company. The Company does not have a Direct Loan license in Alabama, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, Missouri, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia or Wisconsin, and none is presently required in Georgia provided that the original principal balance of the loan is greater than $3,000. The Company obtained  a Direct Loan license in Ohio during the fiscal year ended 2019 and expects to pursue licenses in one or more states in the foreseeable future.  The size of the loan and maximum interest rate that may be (and is) charged varies from state to state. The Company considers the individual’s income, credit history, job stability, and the value of the collateral offered by the borrower to secure the loan as the primary factors in determining whether an applicant will receive an approval for such loan. Additionally, because most of the Direct Loans made by the Company to date have been made to borrowers under Contracts previously purchased by the Company, the payment history of the borrower under the Contract is a significant factor in making the loan decision. The Company’s Direct Loan program was implemented in April 1995 and accounted for approximately 3% of the Company’s annual consolidated revenues during the year ended March 31, 2019. 
 In connection with its Direct Loan program, the Company also makes available credit disability insurance, credit life insurance, and involuntary unemployment insurance coverage to customers through unaffiliated third-party insurance carriers. Approximately 65% of the Direct Loans outstanding as of March 31, 2019 elected to purchase third-party insurance coverage made available by the Company. The cost of this insurance to the customer, which includes a commission for the Company, is included in the amount financed by the customer.

Underwriting Guidelines 
 The Company’s typical customer has a credit history that fails to meet the lending standards of most traditional banks and credit unions. Among the credit problems experienced by the Company’s customers that resulted in a poor credit history are: prior automobile account repossessions, unpaid revolving credit card obligations, unpaid medical bill, unpaid student loans, prior bankruptcy, and evictions for nonpayment of rent. The Company believes that its customer profile is similar to that of its direct competitors. 
 Prior to its approval of the purchase of a Contract, the Company is provided with a standardized credit application completed by the consumer which contains information relating to the consumer’s background, employment, and credit history. The Company also obtains credit reports from Equifax and/or TransUnion, which are independent credit reporting services. The Company verifies the consumer’s employment history, income, and residence. In most cases, consumers are interviewed via telephone by a Company application processor (usually the Branch Manager or Assistant Branch Manager). The Company also considers the customer’s prior payment history with the Company, if any, as well as the collateral value of the vehicle being financed.

The Company has established internal underwriting guidelines to be used by its Branch Managers and internal underwriters when purchasing Contracts. Any Contract that does not meet these guidelines must be approved by the District Managers or senior management of the Company. The Company currently has District Managers charged with managing the specific branches in a defined geographic area. In addition to a variety of administrative duties, the District Managers are responsible for monitoring their assigned branches’ compliance with the Company’s underwriting guidelines as well as approving underwriting exceptions. 
 The Company uses essentially the same criteria in analyzing a Direct Loan as it does in analyzing the purchase of a Contract. Lending decisions regarding Direct Loans are made based upon a review of the customer’s loan application, income, credit history, job stability, and the value of the collateral offered by the borrower to secure the loan. To date, since the majority of the Company’s Direct Loans have been made to individuals whose automobiles have been financed by the Company, the customer’s payment history under his or her existing or past Contract is a significant factor in the lending decision. 
 After reviewing the information included in the Contract or Direct Loan application and taking the other factors into account, the Company’s loan origination system categorizes the customer using internally developed credit classifications of “1,” indicating higher creditworthiness, through “4,” indicating lower creditworthiness. Contracts are financed for individuals who fall within all four acceptable rating categories utilized, “1” through “4”. Usually a customer who falls within the two highest categories (i.e., “1” or “2”) is purchasing a two to five-year old, lower mileage used automobile, while a customer in any of the two lowest categories (i.e., “3,” or “4”) usually is purchasing an older, higher mileage automobile from an independent used automobile dealer. 
 The Company utilizes internal audit (“IA”) to perform audits of its branches’ compliance with Company underwriting guidelines. IA audits Company branches on a schedule that is variable depending on the size of the branch, length of time a branch has been open, current tenure of the Branch Manager, previous branch audit score, and current and historical branch profitability. 
 Monitoring and Enforcement of Contracts 
 The Company requires each customer under a Contract to obtain and maintain collision insurance covering damage to the vehicle. Failure to maintain such insurance constitutes a default under the Contract, and the Company may, at its discretion, repossess the vehicle. To reduce potential loss due to insurance lapse, the Company has the contractual right to obtain collateral protection insurance through a third-party, which covers loss due to physical damage to a vehicle not covered by any insurance policy of the customer. 
 The Company’s Management Information Services personnel maintain a number of reports to monitor compliance by customers with their obligations under Contracts and Direct Loans made by the Company. These reports may be accessed on a real-time basis or at the end of the day throughout the Company by management personnel, including Branch Managers and staff, at computer terminals located in the main office and each branch office. These reports include delinquency reports, customer promise reports, vehicle information reports, purchase reports, dealer analysis reports, static pool reports, and repossession reports. 
 A delinquency report is an aging report that provides basic information regarding each customer account and indicates accounts that are past due. The report includes information such as the account number, address of the customer, phone numbers of the customer, original term of the Contract, number of remaining payments, outstanding balance, due dates, date of last payment, number of days past due, scheduled payment amount, amount of last payment, total past due, and special payment arrangements or agreements. 
 When an account becomes delinquent, the Company immediately contacts the customer to determine the reason for the delinquency and to determine if appropriate arrangements for payment can be made. If payment arrangements acceptable to the Company can be made, the information is entered in its database and is used to generate a customer promises report, which is utilized by the Company’s collection staff for account follow up.

The Company prepares a repossession report that provides information regarding repossessed vehicles and aids the Company in disposing of repossessed vehicles. In addition to information regarding the customer, this report provides information regarding the date of repossession, date the vehicle was sold, number of days it was held in inventory prior to sale, year, make and model of the vehicle, mileage, payoff amount on the Contract, NADA book value, Black Book value, suggested sale price, location of the vehicle, original dealer and condition of the vehicle, as well as notes other information that may be helpful to the Company. 
 If an account is 121 days delinquent and the related vehicle has not yet been repossessed, the account is charged-off and transferred to the Loss Prevention and Recovery Department. Once a vehicle has been repossessed, the related loan balance no longer appears on the delinquency report. Instead, the vehicle appears on the Company’s repossession report and is generally sold at auction. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company changed its charge-off policy from 181 days past due to 121 days past due.  Please see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report for further discussion.
 The Company also prepares a dealer analysis report that provides information regarding each dealer from which it purchases Contracts. This report allows the Company to analyze the volume of business done with each dealer, the terms on which it has purchased Contracts from such dealer, as well as the overall portfolio performance of Contracts purchased from the dealer. 
 The Company is subject to seasonal variations within the subprime marketplace. While the APR, discount, and term remain consistent across quarters, write offs and delinquencies tend to be lower while purchases tend to be higher in the fourth and first quarter of the fiscal year. The second and third quarter of the fiscal year tend to have higher write offs and delinquencies, and a lower level of purchases.    
 Marketing and Advertising 
 The Company’s Contract marketing efforts currently are directed primarily toward automobile dealers. The Company attempts to meet dealers’ needs by offering highly responsive, cost-competitive, and service-oriented financing programs. The Company relies on its District and Branch Managers to solicit agreements for the purchase of Contracts with automobile dealers located within a 60-mile radius of each branch office. The Branch Manager provides dealers with information regarding the Company and the general terms upon which the Company is willing to purchase Contracts. The Company is evaluating and assessing other forms of advertising, such as radio or newspaper advertisements, for the purchase of Contracts. 
 The Company solicits customers under its Direct Loan program primarily through direct mailings, followed by telephone calls to individuals who have a good credit history with the Company in connection with Contracts purchased by the Company. 
 Computerized Information System 
 Until February 1, 2019, the Company used an internally developed loan servicing system to assist in responding to customer inquiries and to monitor the performance of its Contract and Direct Loan portfolio and the performance of individual customers under Contracts. On February 1, 2019, the Company converted to a third-party loan servicing system to assist in responding to customer inquiries and to monitor the performance of its Contract and Direct Loan portfolio and the performance of individual customers under Contracts.
 All Company personnel are provided with real-time access to information. The Company has created specialized programs to automate the tracking of Contracts and Direct Loans from inception. The Company’s computer network encompasses both its corporate headquarters and its branch office locations. See “Monitoring and Enforcement of Contracts” above for a summary of the different reports prepared by the Company.

Competition 
 The consumer finance industry is highly fragmented and highly competitive. Due to various factors, including the existing low interest rate environment, the competitiveness of the industry continues to increase as new competitors continue to enter the market and certain existing competitors continue to expand their operations. There are numerous financial service companies that provide consumer credit in the markets served by the Company, including banks, credit unions, other consumer finance companies, and captive finance companies owned by automobile manufacturers and retailers. Increased competition for the purchase of Contracts enabled automobile dealers to shop for the best price, resulting in an erosion in the dealer discounts from the initial principal amounts at which the Company was willing to purchase Contracts and higher advance rates. Further, increased competition resulted in the purchase of lower credit quality Contracts. However, with the Company’s change in management during the end of fiscal 2018 and beginning of fiscal 2019, it has placed less emphasis on competition when pricing the dealer discount. The Company instead focuses on purchasing Contracts that are priced to reflect the inherent risk level of the contract, and intends to sacrifice loan volume, if necessary, to maintain that pricing discipline. Primarily as a result of this shift in focus for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, the Company’s average dealer discount on Contracts purchased increased to 8.2%, compared to 7.4% for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018. The following table shows number and principal amount of Contracts purchased, average amount financed, average term, and average APR and discount for the periods presented:
Fiscal Year /Quarter | Number of Contracts Purchased | | Principal Amount Purchased | | | Average Financed | | Average APR | Average Discount Percentage | | | Average Term

The Company’s target market consists of persons who are generally unable to obtain traditional used car financing because of their credit history or the vehicle’s mileage or age. Historically, the Company was able to expand its automobile finance business in the non-prime credit market by offering to purchase Contracts on terms that are competitive with those of other companies. Throughout most of fiscal 2018, the Company attempted to expand its product mix to include larger loans with lower APRs and reduced discounts.  Beginning in January 2018, the Company rededicated itself to its core product of financing primary transportation to and from work for the subprime borrower and refocused on pricing integrity on those Contracts acquired.  The Company is committed to the branch-based model and believes that model allows it maintain pricing integrity through solid dealer relationships and a knowledge of the local market.  
 The Company’s ability to compete effectively with other companies offering similar financing arrangements depends in part upon the Company maintaining close business relationships with dealers of used and new vehicles. No single dealer out of the approximately 4,500 dealers with which the Company currently has active contractual relationships represents a significant amount of the Company’s business volume for any of the fiscal years ended March 31, 2019 or 2018.

Regulation 
 The Company’s financing operations are subject to regulation, supervision and licensing under many federal, state and local statutes, regulations and ordinances. Additionally, the procedures that the Company must follow regarding the repossession of vehicles securing Contracts are regulated by each of the states in which the Company does business. To date, the Company’s operations have been conducted exclusively in the states of Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, Missouri, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia and Wisconsin (as of March 31, 2019, the Company has exited Maryland, Texas and Virginia).  Accordingly, the laws of such states, as well as applicable federal law, govern the Company’s operations.

• | Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (“Dodd-Frank Act”). Title X of the Dodd-Frank Act created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”), which, effective as of July 21, 2011, has the authority to issue and enforce regulations under the federal “enumerated consumer laws,” including (subject to certain statutory limitations) FDCPA, TILA, ECOA, FCRA, GLBA and EFTA. The CFPB has rulemaking and enforcement authority over certain non-depository institutions, including us. The CFPB is specifically authorized, among other things, to take actions to prevent companies providing consumer financial products or services and their service providers from engaging in unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices in connection with consumer financial products and services, and to issue rules requiring enhanced disclosures for consumer financial products or services. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the CFPB also may restrict the use of pre-dispute mandatory arbitration clauses in contracts between covered persons and consumers for a consumer financial product or service. The CFPB also has authority to interpret, enforce, and issue regulations implementing enumerated consumer laws, including certain laws that apply to the Company’s business. The CFPB issued rules regarding the supervision and examination of non-depository “larger participants” in the automobile finance business. At this time, the Company is not deemed a larger participant.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Failure to comply with these laws or regulations could have a material adverse effect on the Company by, among other things, limiting the jurisdictions in which the Company  may operate, restricting the Company’s ability to realize the value of the collateral securing the Contracts, and making it more costly or burdensome to do business or resulting in potential liability. The volume of new or modified laws and regulations and the activity of agencies enforcing such law have increased in recent years in response to issues arising with respect to consumer lending. From time to time, legislation and regulations are enacted which increase the cost of doing business, limit or expand permissible activities or affect the competitive balance among financial services providers. Proposals to change the laws and regulations governing the operations and taxation of financial institutions and financial services providers are frequently made in the U.S. Congress, in the state legislatures and by various regulatory agencies. This legislation may change the Company’s  operating environment in substantial and unpredictable ways and may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s  business. 
 In particular, the Dodd-Frank Act and regulations promulgated thereunder, including the rules regarding supervision and examination issued by the CFPB, are likely to affect the Company’s  cost of doing business, may limit or expand the Company’s  permissible activities, may affect the competitive balance within the Company’s  industry and market areas and could have a material adverse effect on the Company. The Company’s  management continues to assess the Dodd-Frank Act’s probable impact on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations, and to monitor developments involving the entities charged with promulgating regulations thereunder. However, the ultimate effect of the Dodd-Frank Act on the financial services industry in general, and on the Company in particular, is uncertain at this time.

In addition to the CFPB, other state and federal agencies have the ability to regulate aspects of the Company’s business. For example, the Dodd-Frank Act provides a mechanism for state Attorneys General to investigate the Company. In addition, the Federal Trade Commission has jurisdiction to investigate aspects of the Company’s  business. The Company expects that regulatory investigation by both state and federal agencies will continue and that the results of these investigations could have a material adverse impact on the Company. 
 Dealers with which the Company does business must also comply with credit and trade practice statutes and regulations. Failure of these dealers to comply with such statutes and regulations could result in customers having rights of rescission and other remedies that could have a material adverse effect on the Company. 
 The sale of vehicle service contracts and other ancillary products by dealers in connection with Contracts assigned to the Company from dealers is also subject to state laws and regulations. As the Company is the holder of the Contracts that may, in part, finance these products, some of these state laws and regulations may apply to the Company’s servicing and collection of the Contracts. Although these laws and regulations may not significantly affect the Company’s business, there can be no assurance that insurance or other regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions in which these products are offered by dealers will not seek to regulate or restrict the operation of the Company’s business in these jurisdictions. Any regulation or restriction of the Company’s business in these jurisdictions could materially adversely affect the income received from these products. 
 The Company’s management believes that the Company maintains all requisite licenses and permits and is in material compliance with applicable local, state and federal laws and regulations. The Company periodically reviews its branch office practices in an effort to ensure such compliance. Although compliance with existing laws and regulations has not had a material adverse effect on the Company’s operations to date, given the increasingly complex regulatory environment, the increasing costs of complying with such laws and regulations, and the increasing risk of penalties, fines or other liabilities associated therewith, no assurances can be given that the Company is in material compliance with all of such laws or regulations or that the costs of such compliance, or the failure to be in such compliance, will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition or results of operations. 
 Employees 
 The Company’s management and various support functions are centralized at the Company’s corporate headquarters in Clearwater, Florida. As of March 31, 2019, the Company employed a total of 279 persons, of which 52 persons were employed at the Company’s corporate headquarters. None of the Company’s employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement, and the Company considers its relations with its employees generally to be good.
