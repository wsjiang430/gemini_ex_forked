Item 1. Business
Overview
We are a leading precision oncology company focused on helping conquer cancer globally through use of our proprietary blood-based tests, vast data sets and advanced analytics. We believe that the key to conquering cancer is unprecedented access to its molecular information throughout all stages of the disease, which we intend to enable by a routine blood draw, or liquid biopsy. Our Guardant Health Oncology Platform is designed to leverage our capabilities in technology, clinical development, regulatory and reimbursement to drive commercial adoption, improve patient clinical outcomes and lower healthcare costs. In pursuit of our goal to manage cancer across all stages of the disease, we have launched our Guardant360 and GuardantOMNI tests for advanced stage cancer. These tests fuel our LUNAR programs, which include our recently launched our LUNAR assay for research use only, or RUO, by biopharmaceutical and academic researchers, and the tests we are developing for minimal residual disease and recurrence as well as for early detection and screening. Our Guardant360 test launched in 2014, as a laboratory-developed test, has been used by more than 6,000 oncologists, over 50 biopharmaceutical companies and all 28 National Comprehensive Cancer Network, or NCCN, Centers in the United States, and we believe it is the world’s market leading comprehensive liquid biopsy test based on public disclosure of the number of comprehensive liquid biopsy tests sold in 2018.
Precision oncology, as it is practiced today, is primarily focused on matching cancer patients to personalized treatments based on the underlying molecular profile of their tumors. There is a critical need to expand the scope of precision oncology to enable precise detection, monitoring and selection of the appropriate intervention as early in the disease state as possible. We believe a major challenge to achieving this is the limited access to cancer’s molecular information. Traditionally, tissue tests that require physical access to tumor tissue through a biopsy or surgery have been used to gain access to this information. A tissue biopsy or surgery procedure, however, is often invasive, time-consuming and costly, which limits the utility of tissue tests. Tissue tests are also not feasible for certain applications such as screening for early detection of cancer.
Our liquid biopsy tests address many of the challenges of tissue biopsies. We believe our tests can expand the scope of precision oncology to earlier stages of the disease, improve patient outcomes and lower healthcare costs. We estimate the market opportunity for our current commercial and pipeline products is over $35 billion in the United States, comprising applications for clinicians and biopharmaceutical customers to address early to late-stage disease, including: 
Therapy selection in advanced stage cancer patients - We are pioneering the clinical comprehensive liquid biopsy market with our Guardant360 and GuardantOMNI tests. Based on SEER Cancer Registry statistics we estimate the total number of metastatic cancer patients in the United States to be approximately 700,000. Using publicly available pricing for tissue-based therapy selection tests, and assuming patients are tested an average of two times over their course of their disease, we estimate the potential market opportunity for therapy selection among these patients to be approximately $4 billion. Additionally, based on the number of targeted therapy and immuno-oncology therapy programs in the current clinical pipeline, prevalence data, and typical pricing for our tests when used by our biopharmaceutical 
1

company customers in connection with their clinical trials, we estimate that the potential market opportunity for our products in use by biopharmaceutical companies is approximately $2 billion. By combining these two, we estimate the aggregate market opportunity for therapy selection in late-stage cancer patients to be approximately $6 billion. Our Guardant360 test is a molecular diagnostic test measuring 73 cancer-related genes and our GuardantOMNI test has a broader 500-gene panel, both of which analyze circulating tumor DNA in blood. Our Guardant360 test has been used over 80,000 times by clinicians to help inform which therapy may be effective for advanced stage cancer patients with solid tumors. It is also used by biopharmaceutical companies for a range of applications, including identifying target patient populations to accelerate translational science research, clinical trial enrollment, and drug development, and post-approval commercialization. Our GuardantOMNI test, launched in 2017 for RUO, is specifically built for our biopharmaceutical customers as a comprehensive genomic profiling tool to help accelerate clinical development programs in both immuno-oncology and targeted therapy.
Recurrence detection in cancer survivors - We are developing tests from our LUNAR-1 program for minimal residual disease and recurrence detection in cancer survivors. The American Cancer Society estimated that in 2016 there were approximately 15 million solid tumor cancer survivors. We believe that these individuals are candidates for screening tests for minimal residual disease and recurrence of their cancer and that this reflects a potential market opportunity of approximately $15 billion. Our LUNAR-1 program leverages data and learnings from Guardant360 and GuardantOMNI tests and is designed to develop tests that enable clinicians to detect minimal residual disease for adjuvant treatment and detect cancer recurrence at a stage when intervention may have a higher chance of success. We believe minimal residual disease and cancer recurrence detection may help biopharmaceutical companies identify new drug development opportunities in adjuvant and early stage settings. In return, these relationships could help us establish clinical utility for our tests and create new testing opportunities related to emerging therapies. In the last quarter of 2018, we successfully launched our LUNAR assay for RUO by biopharmaceutical customers and academic researchers.
Early detection of cancer in higher risk individuals - We are also developing screening tests from our LUNAR-2 program intended for early detection of cancer. We are initially focused on developing tests for asymptomatic individuals at a higher risk of developing cancer due to multiple factors, including moderate to heavy smoking, hereditary risk and pre-existing infections and/or inflammatory conditions. Based on various industry sources, we estimate there are approximately 35 million individuals that satisfy one of three criteria for being susceptible to high risk cancer. These include individuals with moderate to high familial risk of developing cancer, smokers over the age of 50 and individuals with hepatitis C. Given the significantly larger potential patient population, we estimate an average selling price below that of tests for recurrence, and we believe this represents a potential market opportunity of approximately $18 billion. We believe that developing a blood test for early detection of cancer requires a vast amount of molecular and clinical data across all stages of the disease in order to better understand the biology and clinical relevance of tumor-specific biomarkers in blood. We further believe that we can accelerate the collection of this data pool and the development of our LUNAR-2 program for an early detection test in a capital-efficient manner by commercializing Guardant360, GuardantOMNI and LUNAR-1 tests. Specifically, we are using the recently launched LUNAR assay in exploratory studies for our development-stage LUNAR-2 program. While we believe the benefits of early detection on clinical outcomes are widely known, early cancer or precancerous detection may also benefit biopharmaceutical companies by identifying a much larger at-risk population who may benefit from early therapeutic intervention or from preventative medicines.
We believe that best-in-class technology is required to address these market opportunities, but is only one of many strengths required to create a market leading liquid biopsy platform. We believe our Guardant Health Oncology Platform has developed strengths across five critical layers, each of which facilitates success in the adjacent layers, and together the five layers form a barrier to entry and provide us a competitive advantage and a platform we can efficiently leverage across multiple products. These five layers include:
Technology - Our proprietary Guardant Health Digital Sequencing Technology combines cutting edge capabilities from 
2

multiple disciplines including biochemistry, next-generation sequencing, signal processing, bioinformatics, machine learning and process engineering to enable what we believe to be the world's market leading comprehensive liquid biopsy test with a typical turnaround time of less than seven days after we receive the sample and enable our high performing liquid biopsy tests intended for different market segments. Furthermore, our machine learning capability enables performance improvement as we incorporate additional data. We currently seek to protect our growing technology with more than 60 issued patents and more than 140 pending patent applications in different jurisdictions. 
Clinical utility - We believe that success in the clinical utility layer requires both independent investments in clinical research and strategic relationships with market-leading biopharmaceutical companies. We have invested heavily in clinical studies, including more than 40 clinical outcomes studies, what we believe to be the largest-ever liquid-to-tissue concordance study and a prospective interventional clinical utility study demonstrating biomarker detection rates in line with standard of care tissue testing. Our clinical research collaborations have resulted in more than 100 peer-reviewed publications. We also have relationships with over 50 biopharmaceutical customers that have provided rigorous clinical validation of our technology and early insights into test opportunities for emerging therapeutics. 
Regulatory approval - We believe Guardant360 test was the first comprehensive liquid biopsy approved by the New York State Department of Health, or NYSDOH. In addition, based on our review of publicly available records, we believe our facility was the first comprehensive liquid biopsy laboratory to be certified pursuant to the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988, or CLIA, accredited by the College of American Pathologists, or CAP, and NYSDOH-permitted. While approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, is currently not required to market our tests in the United States, we intend to submit to the FDA a premarket approval, or PMA, application for each of our Guardant360 and GuardantOMNI tests. The FDA granted our Guardant360 and GuardantOMNI tests breakthrough device designation, in January and December 2018, respectively, which offers potentially faster review for breakthrough medical devices that address unmet medical needs. We believe that FDA approval will become increasingly important for diagnostic tests to gain commercial adoption both in the United States and abroad. We also intend to pursue regulatory approvals in specific markets outside of the United States, including in Japan and China. 
Payer coverage and reimbursement - The analytical and clinical data that we have generated in our efforts to establish clinical utility, combined with the support we have developed with key opinion leaders, or KOLs, in the oncology space have led to positive coverage decisions by a number of commercial payers. Our Guardant360 test is currently covered by Cigna, Priority Health and multiple regional Blue Cross Blue Shield plans, which have adopted reimbursement policies that specifically cover our Guardant360 test for non-small cell lung cancer, or NSCLC, which we believe gives us a competitive advantage with these payers with respect to NSCLC patients. Payment from commercial payers differs depending on whether we have entered into a contract with the payers as a “participating provider.” Payers often reimburse non-participating providers, if at all, at a lower amount than participating providers. When we are not contracted with these payers, they determine the amount they are willing to reimburse us for tests. When we contract with a payer to serve as a participating provider, reimbursements by the payer are generally made pursuant to a negotiated fee schedule and are limited to only covered indications or where prior approval has been obtained. With respect to Medicare, in July 2018, Palmetto GBA, the Medicare Administrative Contractor, or MAC, responsible for administering Medicare’s Molecular Diagnostic Services Program, or MolDx, issued a local coverage determination, or LCD, for our Guardant360 test with respect to NSCLC patients who meet certain clinical criteria. We worked with Palmetto GBA to obtain this positive coverage decision through the submission of a detailed dossier of analytical and clinical data to substantiate that our Guardant360 test meets Medicare’s medical necessity requirements. Noridian Healthcare Solutions, the MAC responsible for adjudicating claims in California, where our laboratory is located, and a participant in the MolDx, recently finalized its LCD for our Guardant360 test. In September 2018, Palmetto GBA notified us that it had set the reimbursement rate for Guardant360 at $3,500 per test and we began to submit claims for reimbursement for Guardant360 clinical testing performed for Medicare beneficiaries covered under the LCDs, and in October 2018, we began to receive payments from Medicare. We anticipate approval by the FDA, if obtained, may support further improvements in coverage and reimbursement for our Guardant360 test.
Commercial adoption - Success in each of the layers above is important for commercial adoption of our tests by clinicians and biopharmaceutical companies. Additionally, for clinicians, endorsement by KOLs, utilization by academic centers and inclusion in national treatment guidelines are important, especially for adoption in the local community setting where 80% of cancer treatment occurs. Our relationships with key stakeholders across the oncology space, clinical data we believe to support use of Guardant360 test ahead of tissue based testing, as well as the inclusion of liquid biopsy as a potential alternative under certain circumstances to tissue biopsy in NCCN guidelines, have helped facilitate the use of our tests by 6,000 oncologists, who have collectively ordered our Guardant360 test over 80,000 times, and over 50 biopharmaceutical companies. We sold 29,592 tests to clinical customers in the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase from 25,626 and 18,663 in the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. We sold 10,370 tests to biopharmaceutical customers in the year ended December 31, 2018, an increase from 6,286 and 1,830 in the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

In the United States, we market our tests to clinical customers through our targeted sales organization, which is engaged in sales efforts and promotional activities primarily to oncologists and cancer centers. Outside the United States, we market our tests to clinical customers through distributors and direct contracts with healthcare institutions. We market our tests to biopharmaceutical customers globally through our business development team, which promotes the broad utility of our tests for drug development and commercialization. Additionally, we have established a joint venture with SoftBank to accelerate commercialization of our products including in Asia, the Middle East and Africa, with our initial focus being on Japan. Our products are currently marketed in approximately 40 countries.
We generated total revenue of $90.6 million in the years ended December 31, 2018, an increase from $49.8 million and $25.2 million in the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. We also incurred net losses of $84.3 million, $83.2 million and $46.1 million in the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
Summary of our product portfolio
Our product portfolio is built upon the same principle as our platform, in that success with each facilitates success for the next. Data and learnings from our Guardant360 test have benefited us in developing our GuardantOMNI test, both of which fuel development of our LUNAR-1 and LUNAR-2 programs. 
The table below illustrates our current products and development programs:

Our industry
Despite enormous investment in research and the introduction of new treatments, cancer remains a critical area of unmet medical need. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC, cancer is the second leading cause of death in the United States, exceeded only by heart disease. The American Cancer Society reported that in 2016 there were more than 15.5 million Americans with a history of cancer and that approximately 1.7 million new cancer cases would be diagnosed in 2018. Furthermore, approximately 610,000 Americans were expected to die of cancer in 2018. The International Agency for Research on Cancer predicted that the annual global burden of cancer would reach 22 million new cases and 13 million cancer deaths by 2030. The World Health Organization estimated that the total annual economic cost of cancer in 2010 was approximately $1.2 trillion.
The promise of precision oncology
Traditionally, cancer has been classified by the specific organ in which it is located and treated independently of its molecular profile. However, cancer treatment is seeing a significant shift towards precision oncology, the practice of which seeks to match patients to personalized, targeted therapies based on the specific molecular profile of their tumors. Major cancer types, including lung, breast, colorectal and melanoma, for example, have become increasingly classified and treated on the basis of molecular profile.
Discovery of new molecular biomarkers continues to result in further sub-classification of cancer patient populations, which increases complexity of diagnosing and treating the disease for clinicians. This has led to increasing clinical utility and adoption of comprehensive genomic profiling, or CGP. Unlike tests that focus on a single or limited set of biomarkers, commonly referred to as hotspot testing, CGP provides a more comprehensive view of the tumor’s molecular 
5

information. Specifically, a comprehensive genomic test must be able to identify all four classes of genetic alterations, namely single nucleotide variants, copy number variants, insertions/deletions and fusions, across multiple genes. The NCCN treatment guidelines now support multi-biomarker testing across several cancer types, which has led to increased adoption of CGP. For example, for NSCLC, NCCN treatment guidelines now include recommendations for testing across eight genes, each associated with FDA-approved targeted therapies. 
While precision oncology is improving clinical outcomes for patients across many cancer types, it is also benefiting oncology drug development. Biopharmaceutical companies are able to increase chances of a drug’s success in clinical trials by identifying and selecting patients whose cancer has the right molecular profile. This enables them to potentially require fewer patients for the trial and shorten the duration of late-stage clinical trials. According to GlobalData, approximately 66% of the solid tumor oncology clinical pipeline in 2016 was for targeted therapies and immuno-oncology therapy agents, many of which are targeting a cancer with a specific molecular profile or biomarker. 
Despite improvements to clinical outcomes and oncology drug development, primarily in the advanced cancer setting, precision oncology has not significantly impacted earlier stage cancer care. For example, precision oncology has yet to fully impact adjuvant treatment management, recurrence detection in cancer survivors or early detection in higher risk asymptomatic individuals. Many early stage cancer patients receive only non-targeted chemotherapy post-surgical resection of the tumor in the adjuvant setting and ad-hoc, symptomatic monitoring for recurrence. For early detection of cancer in asymptomatic individuals, the current standard of care is comprised of single protein biomarker tests or radiographic imaging, which can have challenges with high false positive rates when used for screening. For example, according to the results from the national lung screening trial reported in The New England Journal of Medicine, low-dose CT, or LDCT, imaging may identify lung nodules in heavy smokers, out of which 95% are benign. Furthermore, these tests are generally only applicable to specific cancers and incapable of broad screening for multi-cancer detection. 
Limitations of tissue biopsies
We believe that precision oncology, as it is practiced currently, suffers from the major challenge of limited access to molecular information, largely resulting from a reliance on tissue biopsies. This has impeded progress on both early disease diagnosis and effective treatment selection. For a tissue biopsy to be performed, the patient typically must undergo an imaging procedure to locate the tumor, following which a biopsy of the tumor is taken using interventional procedures, such as a core needle biopsy or fine needle aspiration. As part of this procedure, the needle is placed into the tumor and cells are aspirated into a syringe. The cells are placed on a microscope slide, stained and examined by a pathologist to determine the diagnosis and classification of the disease. If genotyping is required, which could include testing with next-generation sequencing, additional slides with tumor tissue would need to be prepared for this analysis.
 The tissue biopsy process holds significant challenges, including:
Adverse event risks - Tissue biopsies require use of an invasive tool to access the tumor within the body and are frequently associated with morbidity and mortality. For instance, a study published in The Journal of Oncology Practice / Clinical Lung Cancer reported that, according to Medicare claims data from 2009 to 2011, a lung biopsy was associated with a 19.3% complication rate. Complications included pneumothorax, respiratory failure and hemorrhage. 
Delay in care - Collection of tissue biopsy often requires a medical imaging procedure to locate the cancer and coordination amongst an interventional radiologist, surgical oncologist and pathologist to interpret the imaging and collect and analyze the tissue. A traditional tissue biopsy can take several weeks to schedule and additional time to process the sample, which can be burdensome on the patient and delay the collection of critical molecular information. 
Cost - According to a study published in The Journal of Oncology Practice / Clinical Lung Cancer, the average total cost of a lung biopsy is $14,670, due largely to the required imaging, biopsy or surgical procedure to obtain the tissue, and associated morbidity. 
Limited tissue availability - Tissue sampling has variable but significant failure rates due to procedural or sampling failure and may be exhausted by pathology tests for cancer diagnosis. In NSCLC, this has been documented across many institutions and happens as often as 60% of the time. In addition, tissue sampling is unavailable for a minority of patients due to medical contraindication, patient unwillingness or logistical concerns. 
Limited to a small portion of a single tumor - A tissue biopsy is often limited to a small portion of a single tumor site, which may not accurately represent the entire tumor or all clinically relevant biomarkers due to tumor heterogeneity. This could lead to a tissue biopsy missing mutations targetable by therapy for patients with advanced solid tumors. This limitation has been demonstrated in many tumor types, including lung, breast, gastric, renal and cholangiocarcinoma. 
6

Inability to address applications for early stage cancer patients - For disease recurrence detection or screening for early detection of cancer, tissue tests are impractical or not feasible.
The potential for our liquid biopsy technology
We believe that our liquid biopsy technology can liberate molecular information across all stages of cancer and broaden the scope of precision oncology to earlier stages of the disease. Furthermore, we believe our liquid biopsy can potentially lead to dramatically greater rates of data generation and shorten cycles of learning, thereby accelerating progress in improving clinical outcomes. Relative to a tissue biopsy, a routine blood draw is:

• | minimally invasive;


• | rapidly administered;


• | cost effective; and


• | readily available.

In addition, we believe our liquid biopsy technology is: 
Able to provide timely insight into tumor genomic alterations - Our liquid biopsy tests are convenient and fast. With a routine blood draw, and for example, typically less than seven days turn-around-time with our Guardant360 test, we believe our Guardant Health Oncology Platform can comprehensively genotype cancer patients and other populations to enable rapid initiation of effective treatment and potential clinical trial enrollment. 
More representative of the molecular profile of the tumor in its entirety - Our test results could represent an overall summary of the entire molecular profile of the tumor or tumors and not just a subset of a single tumor that may be represented in a tissue sample. This may enable insight into potentially more targetable mutations than tissue testing. 
Able to monitor response to therapy – We believe recent data suggests that changes in tumor burden can be monitored through the use of our liquid biopsy technology and successive blood draws to potentially provide quicker information as to the effectiveness of a chosen treatment than current approaches using radiographic imaging. 
Able to address all stages of the disease – We believe ready access to molecular information and the ability to potentially detect cancer at early stages in blood enable our liquid biopsy technology to be used for applications, such as for minimal residual disease and recurrence detection or screening higher risk asymptomatic individuals. 
Able to match standard-of-care tissue testing – In a recent head-to-head comparison of Guardant360 test to standard-of-care tissue testing for biomarker identification in first-line advanced NSCLC patients, our liquid biopsy technology produced biomarker detection rates in line with standard of care tissue testing.
History of liquid biopsy and challenges
The concept of a liquid biopsy is not new, and we believe that a minimally invasive tool, such as a liquid biopsy, has been an aspiration of the oncology field for many decades. Multiple modalities have been pursued to access a patient’s molecular information through blood, including ctDNA, circulating tumor cells, or CTCs, and exosomes. It has been shown that modalities using ctDNA may have distinct advantages over other known modalities. For example, ctDNA has a concentration in blood that may be over 100 times higher than CTCs, which can enable increased test sensitivity and accuracy. 
However, despite this promise of higher concentration and, therefore, higher theoretical sensitivity of a ctDNA test, these fragments are still found at very low concentrations which can make their analysis challenging by conventional methods. For example, circulating cell-free fetal DNA, which is the target for a variety of non-invasive prenatal testing applications for women during pregnancy, makes up a median of 10% of the total cell-free DNA in maternal blood. By contrast, the median concentration of ctDNA genomic alterations detected in blood of advanced cancer patients is 0.46% and can be present at levels below 0.01% in early stage cancer patients.
Although the sensitivity and specificity of conventional next-generation sequencing is sufficient for tissue biopsy based tumor profiling, this performance is inadequate for liquid biopsies due to the low concentrations of ctDNA in blood. Moreover, comprehensive genomic profiling for precision oncology requires detection across all four classes of genomic alterations below, which can be especially challenging with ctDNA: 
Single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) - variation(s) in a single nucleotide in a DNA molecule 
Insertions/deletions (Indels) - short nucleotide section(s) of a DNA molecule inserted or deleted 
7

Copy number amplifications (CNVs) - regions(s), typically spanning one or more genes of the genome that are repeated 
Genomic rearrangements - involve gross alterations of chromosomes or large chromosomal regions and can take the form of deletions, duplications, insertions, inversions or translocations
The market opportunity and our vision for the standard of cancer care
We believe that liquid biopsy tests can solve critical challenges of tissue-based tests, expand the scope of precision oncology across the cancer care continuum to earlier stage disease, and empower clinicians to make better decisions to improve clinical outcomes, lower healthcare costs and enable biopharmaceutical companies to advance new therapies. We believe liquid biopsy has application in the following areas, representing a market opportunity we estimate to be more than $35 billion in the United States: 
Therapy selection in advanced cancers. Clinicians require genomic information in order to properly match advanced cancer patients with the appropriate treatment across multiple lines of therapy. Given the limitations of tissue biopsies, we believe a blood test that is capable of accessing the comprehensive genomic profile of the patient’s cancer represents a significant breakthrough, especially in the local community setting, where 80% of cancer patients are treated, infrastructure and expertise to access tissue may be especially limited. We also believe a comprehensive liquid biopsy test for therapy selection can benefit biopharmaceutical companies across a range of applications, including patient selection and recruitment for clinical trials and commercialization once the drug is approved, as well as identification of new molecular targets for drug development. For example, better access to molecular information can speed clinical trial enrollment and increase the probability of success of drug development in a target patient population. 
We estimate this is an up to $6 billion total market opportunity in the clinical and biopharmaceutical markets. This includes a near-term clinical opportunity of $2 billion, based on an estimated 700,000 metastatic patients in the United States and an assumed average reimbursement rate of $3,000, a similar amount covered by Medicare for a comprehensive genomic profiling test. We estimate the number of metastatic patients in the United States based on the number of deaths attributable to cancer annually in the United States as reported in A Cancer Journal for Clinicians and the number of patients who are diagnosed with advanced cancer in the United States and are alive a year after diagnosis as reported in the SEER Cancer Registry. We believe this opportunity may expand by up to an additional $2 billion, as metastatic patients may require multiple tests to inform subsequent lines of therapy.
We estimate that the market opportunity with biopharmaceutical companies in the United States is over $2 billion including an opportunity of over 400,000 tests based on the industry’s current clinical pipeline of over 900 immuno-oncology and over 300 targeted therapy programs, involving more than 130,000 patients. These programs represent two distinct testing opportunities: (1) prospective screening to identify candidate patients for clinical trial enrollment and (2) retrospective analysis of patient samples. In addition, we estimate there is a market opportunity of $500 million in companion diagnostics development and other commercial opportunities. 
The chart below represents the breakdown of the total estimated market opportunity across both the targeted therapy and immuno-oncology opportunities for the therapy selection markets:
8

Minimal residual disease and recurrence detection in cancer survivors. We believe cancer survivors would benefit from tests that could improve minimal residual disease and recurrence detection. Follow-up testing for surveillance in cancer survivors is often ad-hoc, leaving patients guessing as to if and when their cancer may recur. A portion of this market is currently served by prognostic and predictive molecular tests that can classify whether a patient may be at low-risk or high-risk of recurrence. We believe that a definitive diagnostic test for cancer would benefit this patient population both immediately following surgical resection of the tumor and as a monitoring tool in subsequent years. Furthermore, a liquid biopsy test in this setting could help biopharmaceutical companies identify new opportunities in adjuvant drug development and therapies targeting earlier stage cancers. 
We estimate this is an approximately $15 billion market opportunity, consisting of an estimated 15 million solid tumor cancer survivors, excluding survivors of blood cancers, including leukemia and Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, in the United States as reported by the American Cancer Society, and assuming an average price of $1,000 per test for each solid tumor cancer survivor, which is consistent with the cost to screen a patient for lung cancer as reported in the New England Journal of Medicine.
Early detection of cancer in higher risk individuals. Earlier detection of cancer is generally correlated with better clinical outcomes and a higher cure rate for many cancer types. We believe that a test that can accurately detect cancer at its earliest stages or even pre-cancer in a largely asymptomatic population will need to overcome high technological, clinical and regulatory challenges. However, such a test can have significant benefits on mortality and perhaps eventually reduce incidence rates of cancer, if the information provided can be effectively paired with the right preventative medicine or curative intervention.
We estimate this is an approximately $18 billion market opportunity, based on an estimated 35 million individuals at higher risk for cancer in the United States and assuming an average price of $500 per test. The estimated 35 million individuals at higher risk for cancer in the United States consist of approximately 17 million individuals at moderate to high hereditary risk of developing breast, ovarian, colorectal, endometrial or prostate cancer, based on prevalence statistics reported in Genetics in Medicine and U.S. Census Data; approximately 14.5 million people over the age of 50 who are moderate to heavy smokers, as reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; and approximately 3.5 million individuals in the United States at high risk of developing liver cancer due to Hepatitis C infection, based on data reported in Hepatology.

The Guardant Health Oncology Platform
The Guardant Health Oncology Platform is comprised of strengths across five critical layers, each of which is tightly coupled with the others, and we believe success in each facilitates success in adjacent layers. We believe our platform and our position as a pioneer of comprehensive liquid biopsy provide us with a competitive advantage and form a barrier to entry. The following diagram depicts the five layers of our oncology platform:
Technology – Guardant Health Digital Sequencing
Guardant Health Digital Sequencing combines state-of-the-art technology from multiple disciplines and is enabled by robust, high-efficiency biochemistry at the front-end, next-generation sequencing and a machine learning augmented bioinformatics pipeline. The combination of all of these technologies onto one platform has enabled our programs in liquid biopsy and what we believe is the highest performing clinical comprehensive liquid biopsy, with a turnaround time of typically less than seven days after we receive the sample. We believe our platform is able to detect all four classes of genomic alterations and microsatellite instability, or MSI, at sensitivity levels beyond comparable platforms. 
Two specific enhancements we employ throughout the workflow include:
High-efficiency chemistry - Our proprietary ctDNA sample preparation biochemistry is able to convert the vast majority of extracted ctDNA molecules into a sequencing library. This enables enhanced sensitivity to detect mutations present at ultra-low variant frequency and the ability to work with limited sample volumes. 
Error suppression via proprietary bioinformatics engine - Our bioinformatics pipeline reduces the sequencing error rate by 1000-fold over conventional next-generation sequencing and by 30-fold over other sequencing assays relying on molecular barcoding alone. Furthermore, the machine learning capability enables performance improvement as we incorporate data from additional blood samples.
Clinical utility 
We believe that the measure of the clinical utility provided by a given diagnostic test or technology lies in the ability to enable the physician to match intervention with the patient to select the treatment likely to produce a more favorable outcome for the patient. We also believe that success in the clinical utility layer requires both independent, systematic investments in clinical research, and strategic relationships with market-leading biopharmaceutical companies. We aim to generate publications in independently peer-reviewed scientific journals to demonstrate clinical utility of our technology. For this reason, we have invested in directly sponsoring or participating in prospective, interventional clinical trials with leading academic cancer centers and biopharmaceutical companies, including over three dozen published clinical outcomes studies, including what we believe to be the largest-ever liquid-to-tissue concordance study and prospective interventional clinical utility studies demonstrating clinical overall detection rates of our non-invasive blood testing in line with tissue testing. We have built an internal clinical development team that can efficiently run

clinical utility studies and continue to invest in such studies spanning many indications within the advanced cancer setting, including completed outcomes studies (20 in lung cancer, 10 in gastrointestinal cancers and several in other cancer types). We are also investing heavily in studies involving earlier stage disease. 
The strength of our technology facilitates strategic relationships with academia and over 50 biopharmaceutical customers, to help them advance the development of their drug pipelines and expand the utilization of currently commercialized treatments. In return, these relationships provide rigorous clinical validation of our technology and early insights into emerging therapeutically relevant test targets. 
Regulatory
We believe that Guardant360 test was the first comprehensive liquid biopsy approved by the NYSDOH. In addition, based on our review of publicly available records, we believe our facility was the first comprehensive liquid biopsy laboratory to become CLIA-certified, CAP-accredited and NYSDOH-permitted. While FDA approval is currently not required to market our tests in the United States, we intend to seek a PMA for Guardant360 test. In January 2018, the FDA granted Guardant360 Expedited Access Pathway, or EAP, designation, which offers potentially faster review for breakthrough medical devices. The FDA has indicated that medical devices that received EAP designation automatically receive Breakthrough Device designation, which, among other things, provides for priority review and more interactive communication with the FDA during the development process. FDA approval therefore provides a path to reimbursement by Medicare through CMS. In March 2018, CMS published a Decision Memorandum for next-generation sequencing, or NGS, tests, or the NGS Decision Memorandum, for patients with advanced cancer who meet certain clinical criteria. The NGS Decision Memorandum states, among other things, that coverage would be available for next-generation sequencing FDA-approved tests offered within the FDA-approved companion in vitro diagnostic test labeling. We believe that this establishes a competitive advantage for tests receiving FDA approval and that FDA approval will be increasingly necessary for diagnostic tests to gain adoption, both in the United States and abroad, by clinicians, payers and biopharmaceutical companies. In December 2018, we announced our partnership with AstraZeneca to develop Guardant360 as a companion diagnostic for Tagrisso and GuardantOMNI as a companion diagnostic for Imfinzi. 
Payer coverage
Coverage from public and commercial payers is primarily influenced by clinical evidence, endorsement by KOLs and treatment guidelines. The analytical and clinical data that we have generated, combined with our support from KOLs, has led to a number of positive coverage decisions from commercial payers. Guardant360 test is currently covered by Cigna, Priority Health and multiple regional Blue Cross Blue Shield plans, which have adopted reimbursement policies that specifically cover Guardant360 test for NSCLC, which we believe gives us a competitive advantage with these payers. With respect to Medicare, in July 2018, Palmetto GBA, the MAC responsible for administering the MolDx, issued an LCD for our Guardant360 test with respect to NSCLC patients who meet certain clinical criteria. We worked with Palmetto GBA to obtain this positive coverage decision through the submission of a detailed dossier of analytical and clinical data to substantiate that the test meets Medicare’s medical necessity requirements. Noridian Healthcare Solutions, the MAC responsible for adjudicating claims in California, where our laboratory is located, and a participant in the MolDx, recently finalized its LCD for our Guardant360 test. We anticipate FDA approval of our Guardant360 test, if obtained, may support improvements in coverage and reimbursement, including Medicare according to the NGS Decision Memorandum. 
Commercial adoption 
Success in each of the layers above is important for commercial adoption by clinicians and biopharmaceutical companies. Additionally, for clinicians, endorsement by KOLs traction at academic centers and inclusion in national treatment guidelines is important, especially for clinical adoption in the local community setting where 80% of cancer treatment occurs. Our relationships with key stakeholders across the oncology space, as well as the recent inclusion of liquid biopsy under certain circumstances as a potential alternative to tissue biopsy in NCCN treatment guidelines has helped facilitate adoption of our tests by 6,000 oncologists, who have collectively ordered our Guardant360 test over 80,000 times, and by over 50 biopharmaceutical companies.
Our products and development programs
We have launched our Guardant360 and GuardantOMNI tests and are developing additional tests under our LUNAR programs, including having launched our LUNAR assay for RUO. We believe our product portfolio, once completed, will address the full continuum of care and has utility in both the clinical and biopharmaceutical markets.

Therapy Selection
The increasing diversity of targeted therapies and associated molecular biomarkers has given rise to comprehensive genomic profiling, particularly in tumor types where multiple genomic targets can be found and treated effectively. For example, NSCLC, like other tumors, has multiple effective treatment options targeting different genomic mutations. There are eight targetable genomic mutations in NSCLC, which are comprised of alterations across all four genomic variant classes (SNVs, indels, CNVs, and fusions). Five of these targets are on-label approved biomarkers for FDA-approved therapies. The NCCN treatment guidelines recently recommended testing for all of the eight genomic mutations or alterations across different cancer types, which demonstrates the requirement for broader genomic profiling.
Despite NCCN guidelines, a recent 800 patient study of NSCLC patients reported that only a minority of patients actually were tested for the guideline-recommended targetable genomic mutations, and only 8% of patients were comprehensively genotyped. Such “undergenotyping” had multiple causes in the study, and primary reasons for not testing were lack of sufficient tissue, poor patient performance status or infeasibility to undergo a repeat biopsy for additional tissue.
Guardant360 Test
We believe Guardant360 test is the market leading comprehensive liquid biopsy test, based on the number of tests ordered. Guardant360 test is a 73 gene test that supports treatment selection for advanced stage cancer patients with solid tumors. The testing process requires two 10 milliliter blood samples that are sent to our laboratory in Redwood City, California, where we process and analyze the samples using proprietary, next-generation sequencing-based Guardant Health Digital Sequencing Technology. Results are typically delivered in seven days following receipt of sample and delivered by a clinical report through fax, portal or mobile device. 
Since we launched our Guardant360 test in 2014, it has been ordered over 80,000 times by more than 6,000 oncologists across dozens of cancer types, by more than 50 biopharmaceutical companies and by all 28 NCCN centers. Guardant360 test is also currently being developed as a companion diagnostic for Tagrisso, a treatment for metastatic NSCLC patients, under a collaboration with AstraZeneca.
Guardant360 clinical report
A typical Guardant360 clinical report contains somatic mutations detected in patient blood samples, associated treatment options and available clinical trials in the vicinity of the patient’s location. Additionally, the report depicts a proprietary visual representation that shows the evolution of somatic mutations in longitudinal blood samples. 
Analytical validation
We believe there are two key performance characteristics that are critical for a liquid biopsy test. The first is sensitivity, which refers to the level of ctDNA in circulation at which the technology reliably detects variants for a given input sample amount. The second is specificity, which is the probability that a given test result is accurate. These metrics are critical for effective treatment selection based on the results of liquid biopsy testing. It can be especially challenging to maintain high specificity at detection levels below 0.25% due to the high error rates of standard next-generation sequencing protocols at these levels and the broad genomic footprint tested simultaneously in a comprehensive liquid biopsy test. In order to assess these key performance characteristics for Guardant360 test, we conducted analytical validation studies against orthogonally validated methods. The results, as published in Clinical Cancer Research, demonstrated that Guardant360 test has a detection threshold of one to two molecules across multiple alteration types, including all four classes of genomic alterations and MSI, with very high specificity which results in accurate and sensitive detection of somatic mutations in patient samples.
Clinical trials and publications
The goal of our clinical development with Guardant360 test is to support its use for comprehensive genomic profiling across multiple tumor types, including as a preferred alternative to tissue testing to inform first line treatment right after diagnosis and at time of disease progression. We publish peer-reviewed studies in order to influence treatment guidelines, to educate clinicians and other oncology stakeholders about the value proposition of our test and to set the stage for reimbursement with private and public payers. We have over 40 approved, completed or active clinical outcomes studies, more than 100 peer-reviewed publications and more than 300 scientific abstracts. 
The following summarizes the results of our key clinical studies:
Genotyping concordance with matched tumor tissue - Results of a blinded retrospective study comprising 6,948 consecutive NSCLC samples to assess the concordance between Guardant360 test and tissue genotyping of samples received for clinical testing at our laboratory showed high positive predictive value, which is the probability that a 
13

variant detected by Guardant360 test in blood was in fact present in the corresponding tissue sample.
Detection rate of ctDNA in patient samples - We observed a test success rate of 99.6% in a study comprising 10,593 consecutive samples to provide insights into Guardant360 test performance in real-world clinical specimens. Overall detection rates of ctDNA were consistently high (85.9%), predominantly driven by NSCLC (87.7%), colorectal (85.0%) and breast (86.8%). We believe this cohort demonstrates the need for a highly sensitive liquid biopsy as the median variant allele frequency, or VAF, found was only 0.46%.
Prospective clinical response rate - A prospective, interventional, multi-cancer clinical utility study of Guardant360 test across 193 patients with no tissue genotyping options showed an objective response rate of 87% (95% CI, 58%-98%) with disease control rate of 100% (95% CI, 75%-100%). In the NSCLC cohort, 73 patients were tested, 34 were matched with pre-specified therapy, of which 17 patients were treated with matched therapy, of which 15 patients were evaluable. Importantly, the response rate was independent the VAF of mutations found in the blood. 
Clinical relevance of actionable mutations detected at ultra-low concentrations - We analyzed the clinical response of a multi-center case series of Guardant360 test-detected targetable driver alterations in advanced NSCLC with VAFs of less than 0.2%. Twelve patients were selected who had targetable driver alterations in EGFR (n=7, VAF range 0.045%-0.14%), MET exon 14 skipping mutation (n=1, VAF = 0.06%), BRAF V600E (n=1, VAF = 0.1%), EML-ALK fusions (n=3, VAF range 0.07-0.16%). All patients responded to targeted therapy with median progression-free survival of 52 weeks. Of particular significance, 7 out of 12 patients were undergenotyped, largely due to tissue insufficiency.
Biomarker discovery rate. We are proactively pursuing studies to support the use of our Guardant360 test as a preferred alternative to tissue testing to inform first line treatment right after diagnosis, with the goal to provide evidence that our Guardant360 test detects genomic alterations at a similar rate compared to standard of care tissue testing in the United States, Europe and Asia. Such a strategy is predicated on the Guardant360 test’s ability to offer accurate, reliable and fast guideline-directed comprehensive genotyping for all adult solid tumors without exposing patients to invasive biopsy procedures’ risks, delays or chance of failure. For example, the MedSIR-sponsored SLLIP study was the first prospective study comparing our Guardant360 test to unspecified tissue-testing modalities. The primary endpoint for the study was the non-inferiority of our Guardant360 test, as compared to standard tissue testing, in detecting eight NCCN (EGFR, ALK, ROS, BRAF, MET, RET, ERBB2 and NTRK) biomarkers in first-line advanced, non-squamous NSCLC. Among more than 180 total samples, investigators found that tissue-based testing identified biomarkers in 48 subjects, while the Guardant360 test identified biomarkers in 47 subjects, meeting the study’s primary endpoint (P<0.002). We expect a final analysis on the treatment plans and outcomes for these patients to be completed by the middle of 2019. Additionally, in the first quarter of 2019, we announced results from our NILE study after it met its primary endpoint of demonstrating that Guardant360 test detected targetable genomic biomarkers in advanced, non-squamous NSCLC at a similar rate to standard of care tissue testing. Our Guardant360 test identified guideline-recommended biomarkers in 77 of the 282 patients enrolled in the study, while tissue testing identified such biomarkers in 60 of those patients. In the study, the median time to results for Guardant360 testing was much shorter than for tissue testing, as Guardant360 test results were reported in an average of 9 days, while tissue testing results were reported in an average of 15 days. We believe these data support the use of our testing ahead of tissue testing for all newly diagnosed advanced NSCLC patients.
GuardantConnect
Because metastatic cancer patients often exhaust standard of care treatment options as the disease progresses and guidelines recommend clinical trials for advanced cancer patients, clinical trial matching is an acute need in oncology. At the same time, biopharmaceutical companies need to fill clinical trials that require screening hundreds of thousands of patients. Despite these needs, clinical trial enrollment in oncology has severely lagged, with only 3-6% of cancer patients enrolling in clinical trials. GuardantConnect is our integrated software solution designed for our clinical and biopharmaceutical customers, seeking to connect patients in need tested with Guardant360 test with clinical trials. 
GuardantOMNI Test
Our GuardantOMNI test is built on Guardant Health Digital Sequencing Technology and learnings from our Guardant360 test. The GuardantOMNI test, launched in 2017 for RUO, has a significantly larger genomic panel footprint than the Guardant360 test and has achieved comparable analytical performance in clinical studies, including for translational science applications in collaboration with several biopharmaceutical companies, including Merck MSD, Merck KGaA, Pfizer, AstraZeneca and Bristol-Myers Squibb. It covers 500 genes, including genes associated with homologous recombination repair deficiency and biomarkers for immuno-oncology applications, such as tumor mutational burden and microsatellite instability.
In order to preserve performance characteristics of our Guardant360 test across a broader gene panel, we implemented additional enhancements to the assay efficiency and bioinformatics analysis to improve the sensitivity of our 
14

GuardantOMNI test. These enhancements are critical in the context of using the GuardantOMNI test in the retrospective testing of clinical trial samples for translational science applications in collaboration with biopharmaceutical customers, as those samples are often available with only a limited volume of plasma. 
Validation data indicates that the GuardantOMNI test exceeds the Guardant360 test’s sensitivity for detecting clinically actionable biomarkers. At the same time, broader panel-wide performance of small variants is roughly similar to that of Guardant360 test. The broad genomic footprint of our GuardantOMNI test enables accurate measurement of tumor mutational burden. The GuardantOMNI test received breakthrough device designation from the FDA in December 2018 and is currently being developed, including as a potential companion diagnostic, to identify patients who may benefit from immuno-oncology therapeutics. Our GuardantOMNI test is also currently being developed as a potential companion diagnostic for Imfinzi, an immuno-oncology therapy, under our collaboration with AstraZeneca, where the GuardantOMNI test is expected to be used to identify patients that may more likely respond to immuno-oncology agents based on tumor mutational burden or TMB. At the European Society for Medical Oncology’s Immuno Oncology 2018 Congress, AstraZeneca presented data from the Phase III MYSTIC trial showing that our GuardantOMNI test was able to identify TMB from blood for more patients than tissue-based approaches, which contributed to improved overall survival over standard-of-care chemotherapy for high TMB patients treated with immuno-oncology agents.
LUNAR Programs
We believe that there is a critical need to develop products to expand precision oncology to post-cancer monitoring and earlier stage settings. Such products would enable clinicians to precisely detect, monitor and select the appropriate intervention at the right times in the disease’s evolution, key to significantly improving patient clinical outcomes. In order to systematically address this need, we launched our LUNAR programs to pursue two opportunities. The first, our LUNAR-1 program, is related to minimal residual disease and recurrence detection for cancer survivors. The second, our LUNAR-2 program, is related to early-stage cancer detection in higher risk asymptomatic patients. 
We believe that detection of minimal residual disease in the blood of cancer patients after surgery and surveillance of patients who have completed curative cancer treatment to potentially detect recurrence at an earlier stage may identify a population of patients with minimal residual disease who are likely to benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy treatment.
Early cancer detection in higher-risk individuals is challenging, especially with respect to clinical specificity. There is a minimal amount of ctDNA in patients with low-disease burden. Additionally, naturally-occurring genomic aberrations in blood as well as signals from non-cancer related diseases can add biological noise obfuscating detection of circulating tumor-related biomarkers. We believe we have the unique capability to overcome these challenges by leveraging our:

• | Vast data sets and deep insights: We have targeted deep sequencing data in combination with low-coverage sequencing of whole genome from tens of thousands of cancer patients. This data has enabled discovery of novel epigenomic variations across multiple cancer types. We believe augmenting genomic with epigenomic signatures can enhance the clinical sensitivity and specificity of our tests significantly. Moreover, we developed a database of biological noise sources such as clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential, which enables us to further enhance the sensitivity and specificity of our tests.


• | Extensive blood biobank: We have a biobank of tens of thousands of cancer samples that we use for discovery and, more importantly, biomarker verification and validation. For example, we are analyzing these samples with whole genome sequencing to identify and confirm tumor associated signatures. Also, we have been collecting additional samples through multiple on-going research collaborations.

Our LUNAR assay is currently available for research use by academic and biopharmaceutical researchers.
LUNAR-1 Program: Minimal residual disease and recurrence detection in cancer survivors
Tests from our LUNAR-1 program could provide cancer survivors with quantitative peace of mind through a test for recurrence. We also believe it could help physicians determine those patients that may still have minimal residual disease and be candidates for adjuvant treatment. Though we believe that our technology is extensible to a broad array of cancer types, our LUNAR-1 program will initially focus on 4 cancer types: lung, colorectal, breast and ovarian cancers. These potential markets are significant, from an estimate of up to $1 billion for adjuvant treatment selection and up to $5 billion for surveillance in the four cancers of our initial focus. We estimate the broader total potential market opportunity for our LUNAR-1 program to be approximately $15 billion as we expand to other indications. 
Clinical studies have demonstrated the added value of adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery to kill residual disease and prevent recurrence when cancer is present and at low burden. However, studies have shown that adjuvant chemotherapy given empirically to operated stage II colon cancer patients will only benefit the 15% of patients likely to have a cancer recurrence. Thus, many more patients endure cytotoxic chemotherapy who do not need it, so that the few may benefit. 
15

Additionally, an adjuvant drug development study can cost significantly more, typically require more patients, last longer and have a lower probability of success relative to a trial in a metastatic setting. Identification of those most likely to benefit from adjuvant therapy is therefore an important clinical challenge. We believe a near-term opportunity for our LUNAR-1 program is in partnering with biopharmaceutical companies to identify these patients for adjuvant trial enrollment and also monitor treatment effectiveness.
LUNAR-2 Program: Early detection in higher risk individuals
Although cancer is the second leading cause of death in the United States, it can be cured if detected and treated at its earliest stages. For example, the introduction of the Pap smear reduced cervical cancer mortality by more than 80% from 1950 to 2005. However, despite the benefit of screening, which is recommended by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force for cervical, breast, lung and colorectal cancers, a significant number of people do not receive screening today. For example, greater than 30% of eligible Americans are not up-to-date on screening for colorectal cancer. 
We believe some of the major challenges lie in the limited efficacy of existing screening modalities: 
Protein testing - Current screening tests using protein biomarkers for various cancers, including prostate (PSA), pancreatic (CA19-9) and ovarian (CA125), lack sensitivity and specificity. 
Imaging - While radiographic imaging is sensitive, it lacks clinical specificity. For lung cancer screening, as an example, the landmark National Lung Cancer Screening Trial reported that low-dose computed tomography, or LDCT, lung cancer screening of heavy smokers significantly increased cancer diagnosis rate and decreased overall mortality. However, a recent practice survey reported that only 3.9% of the estimated 6.8 million eligible patients had received LDCT screening. An important barrier to adoption of LDCT screening has been its greater than 95% false positive rate, which results in many unnecessary biopsies or inaction on positive findings. 
The goal for our LUNAR-2 program is to develop an accurate, affordable test with potential for high compliance for use in higher risk asymptomatic individuals. To support this development, we have collaborated with multiple institutions, including the University of San Francisco, the University of Colorado and the University of Pennsylvania. We have other clinical research collaborations studying similar applications of our LUNAR-2 program for different cancer types. Our research and development results to date indicate that somatic signatures alone may be insufficient for detection of early stage cancers with high sensitivity. For this reason, our LUNAR-2 program is exploring the incorporation of epigenomic and other signatures to enhance the performance of our LUNAR assay in this setting.
Commercialization 
U.S. clinical commercial efforts
We commercialize our products in the United States to clinicians through our targeted sales organization. As of December 31, 2018, our clinician-focused sales organization in the United States is engaged in sales efforts and promotional activities primarily targeting oncologists and cancer centers. Our sales representatives typically have extensive backgrounds in laboratory testing, therapeutics and oncology. We have supplemented the team with clinical oncology specialists with extensive medical affairs experience for molecular information support in the field.   
Our clinical commercial efforts are focused on driving adoption with academic research institutions and with community oncology practices, including through leading physician networks. As we continue to grow our sales organization, we are also expanding our reach to include large community practices, community oncology networks, integrated delivery/ payer-owned systems and government medical facilities that are looking for a reliable partner for comprehensive molecular information testing. 
International clinical commercial efforts
We currently offer our tests in countries outside the United States primarily through distributor relationships or direct contracts with hospitals. 
Currently, all customer samples are shipped globally to our laboratory in Redwood City, California. We are conducting studies in various jurisdictions in an effort to secure reimbursement. As these studies progress and we near commercial opportunities there, we may seek to establish an in-country laboratory and direct sales organization. Specifically, we have already demonstrated the ability to deploy our technology to partner laboratories such as cancer centers, for the development of liquid biopsy assays based on our technology platform. We believe that this capability will be important in accelerating adoption of our platform and the performance of liquid biopsy testing in certain countries.
Together with SoftBank, we formed a joint venture, Guardant Health AMEA, Inc., which we refer to as the Joint Venture, relating to the sale, marketing and distribution of our tests in all areas worldwide outside of North America, Central 
16

America, South America, the United Kingdom, all other member states of the European Union as of May 2017, Iceland, Norway, Switzerland and Turkey, or the JV Territory. Depending on the market opportunity in a country, the Joint Venture may create direct operations or conduct its operations through either a distribution model or a licensing model. Direct operations would entail full operations including a laboratory, sales and marketing and regulatory among other functions. Under the distribution model, our tests would be marketed and sold by the Joint Venture or third-party distributors in relevant countries within the JV Territory, and the tests would be performed by or on behalf of us or our affiliates outside of such countries on samples obtained by the Joint Venture or third-party distributors in such countries. Under the license model, the Joint Venture, or an entity designated by the Joint Venture, would be licensed to market and sell the tests in relevant countries within the JV Territory, and the Joint Venture, or an entity designated by the Joint Venture, would perform the tests on samples obtained in such countries. Following a determination by the board of directors of the Joint Venture on the appropriate model for an individual country, we will enter into an agreement with the Joint Venture with respect to the individual country that is based on either the distribution or license model. We expect to rely on the Joint Venture to accelerate commercialization of our products in Asia, the Middle East, and Africa.
Currently, we and the Joint Venture are primarily focused on expanding our commercial capabilities in Asia, with an initial focus on Japan. There are over 350,000 deaths from solid tumor cancers annually in Japan with a significant portion relating to lung and gastric cancers. We are involved in several nationwide clinical programs that help establish clinical utility of our Guardant360 test in the Japanese population with the first patient tested in late 2018.
Biopharmaceutical commercial efforts
Our business development team is focused on enterprise selling to biopharmaceutical companies in the United States and internationally. Our strategy with each biopharmaceutical customer is to demonstrate the value proposition of the Guardant Health Oncology Platform and expand its utilization across the organization from early stage research through clinical development to commercialization. Given the broad and differentiated utility of our platform, we believe we can support our biopharmaceutical customers across many applications, including: 

• | discovery of new targets and mechanisms of acquired resistance;


• | retrospective sample analysis to rapidly identify biomarkers associated with response and lack of response;


• | prospective screening and referral services to accelerate clinical trial enrollment; and


• | companion diagnostic development to support the approval and commercialization of therapeutics.

We also expect to be able to capture other commercial opportunities from our genomic data, which can be used in combination with clinical outcomes or claims data for multiple applications, including novel target identification.
Payer coverage and reimbursement 
We believe our tests and services provide solutions that enhance the safety, efficacy and guide cost-effective treatment selection of cancer therapeutics, as evidenced by the adoption from key stakeholders in the healthcare ecosystem. Evidence-based analytical validity, clinical validity and clinical utility studies are key drivers of both clinical adoption and reimbursement from commercial and government payers. Peer-reviewed evidence of our products and services will continue to be a center piece of our reimbursement strategy.
We believe our products offer significant health economic value to payers in the following ways: 
•reduce undergenotyping, thereby matching health plan members to targeted therapies that are both less costly and more effective than potential alternatives such as immunotherapy; and 
•reduce the need for a repeat invasive biopsy, thereby avoiding the associated high costs and risks of tissue biopsy complications. 
In sum, we believe our tests help payers reduce both diagnostic and treatment costs, while simultaneously and most importantly improving clinical outcomes.
Commercial third-party payers and patient billing
Payment from third-party payers differs depending on whether we have entered into a contract with the payers as a “participating provider” or do not have a contract and are considered a “non-participating provider.” Payers will often reimburse non-participating providers at a lower amount than participating providers or not at all. Where we are not reimbursed in full or at all, we may elect to appeal the insurer’s underpayment or denial of payment or seek payment from the patient. However, insurer appeal and patient collection efforts take a substantial amount of time and resources and are often unsuccessful. Additionally, there are several national third-party commercial payers that have adopted 
17

non-coverage policies that treat both tissue and liquid comprehensive genomic profiling, or CGP, testing, including our Guardant360 test, as experimental or investigational at this time.
We have provided testing services to patients with many cancer types and indications, most of the time as a non-participating provider through 2018. We received reimbursement for tests across the spectrum of these patients, though for amounts that on average were significantly lower than for participating providers. 
When we contract to serve as a participating provider, reimbursements are made pursuant to a negotiated fee schedule and are limited to only covered indications. Becoming a participating provider generally results in higher reimbursement for covered indications and lack of reimbursement for non-covered indications. The impact of becoming a participating provider with a specific payer will vary based on historical reimbursement as a non-participating provider for that payer, and in some situations, the benefit of increased reimbursement for covered testing could be offset by the loss of reimbursement on tests for non-covered indications previously received when we served as a non-participating provider. In addition, we have experienced situations where commercial payers proactively reduced the amounts they were willing to reimburse for our tests, and where commercial payers have determined that the amounts previously paid were too high and sought to recover those perceived excess payments by deducting such amounts from payments owed to us.
Coverage from commercial payers has been focused on NSCLC, which represented approximately 46% of our U.S. clinical testing volume in both 2018 and 2017. To date, the benefit of increased reimbursement for covered NSCLC Guardant360 testing as a participating provider has been approximately offset by the loss of reimbursement on tests for non-covered indications previously received when we served as a non-participating provider. Therefore, the net result of receiving coverage for a particular indication, including NSCLC, may be little to no change in our average revenue per test for all our patients served by these insurance payers.
We are actively engaged to expand coverage among existing contracted providers and to achieve coverage with the remaining key commercial payers, laboratory benefit managers and evidence review organizations. This includes addressing variable coverage requirements and evidence required, and the need for enhanced guideline support. Our existing contracted payers, which include Cigna, Priority Health and multiple Blue Cross Blue Shield regional plans, have determined that the analytical validity, clinical validity and clinical utility evidence requirements for medical policy inclusion of our Guardant360 test in NSCLC have been met. In total, along with Medicare, we estimate these payers currently cover more than 120 million lives.
As we broaden our coverage amongst existing providers to include additional tests, we may begin to experience increases in average revenue per test performed; however, we cannot make any assurances that we will be successful in broadening our coverage on a timely basis or at all. Similarly, as we have experienced with our existing contracted payers, we cannot assure you that the addition of new contracted payers will increase our average selling price or revenue.
In addition to our existing contracted payers, various laboratory benefit managers and national expert opinion organizations who work with these plans have endorsed coverage of our Guardant360 test. The analytical validity, clinical validity and clinical utility evidence requirements for medical policy inclusion of our Guardant360 test in NSCLC have been met by multiple commercial payers and laboratory benefit managers.
Government payers
Medicare coverage is limited to items and services that are within the scope of a Medicare benefit category that are reasonable and necessary for the diagnosis or treatment of an illness or injury. National coverage determinations are made through an evidence-based process by CMS, with opportunities for public participation. Medicare released an NGS Decision Memorandum (CAG-00450N) for advanced cancer patients in the first quarter of 2018 that provides, among other things, that coverage is available for FDA-approved companion in vitro diagnostic NGS, tests offered within their FDA-approved labeling. The NGS Decision Memorandum covers molecular diagnostic tests similar to our Guardant360 test if the product has a companion diagnostic, or CDx, label and is FDA approved for that disease state. We believe an expedient path to obtain pan-cancer Medicare coverage is to obtain FDA approval for the Guardant360 test as a CDx with a pan-cancer tumor profiling label. 
In July 2018, Palmetto GBA, the MAC responsible for administering the MolDx, issued an LCD for the Guardant360 test for NSCLC patients who meet certain clinical criteria. We worked with Palmetto GBA to obtain this positive coverage decision through the submission of a detailed dossier of analytical and clinical data to substantiate that the test meets Medicare’s medical necessity requirements. The LCD was made effective for patients with a date of service on or after August 27, 2018 and accordingly Palmetto released claims edits for all MolDx participating MACs. Noridian Healthcare Solutions, or Noridian, the MAC responsible for adjudicating claims in California, where our laboratory is located, is a participant in the MolDx. Noridian published an LCD that adopts the positive coverage decision from Palmetto in the Noridian jurisdiction, effective as of October 20, 2018. 
18

Under Medicare, payment for laboratory tests like ours is generally made under the Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule, or CLFS, with payment amounts assigned to specific procedure billing codes. In April 2014, Congress passed the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014, or PAMA, which included substantial changes to the way in which clinical laboratory services are paid under Medicare. On June 23, 2016, CMS published the final rule implementing the reporting and rate-setting requirements under PAMA. Under PAMA, laboratories that receive the majority of their Medicare revenue from payments made under the CLFS were required to report to CMS, beginning in 2017 and every three years thereafter (or annually for “advanced diagnostic laboratory tests”), commercial payer payment rates and volumes for each test they perform. CMS uses this data to calculate a weighted median payment rate for each test, which is used to establish revised Medicare CLFS reimbursement rates for the test. As we have begun billing Medicare for our tests, we are subject to reporting requirements under PAMA and the Medicare rate for our tests will be calculated in the future based on our private payer rates. For tests furnished on or after January 1, 2018, Medicare payments for clinical diagnostic laboratory tests are based upon these reported commercial payer rates. 
State Medicaid programs make individual coverage decisions for diagnostic tests and have taken steps to control the cost, utilization and delivery of healthcare services.
We believe that additional state and federal health care reform measures may be adopted in the future, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the clinical laboratory industry and our ability to successfully commercialize our tests. Any of these or other changes could substantially impact our revenues and increase costs. We cannot predict how future healthcare policy changes, if any, will affect our business and financial success. 
Operations
We perform the Guardant360 and GuardantOMNI tests in our clinical laboratory located in Redwood City, California. Our laboratory is CAP-accredited, CLIA-certified, NYSDOH-permitted and also licensed in California, Florida, Maryland, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island.

Guardant Health Digital Sequencing Technology combines state-of-the-art technology from multiple disciplines and is enabled by robust, high-efficiency biochemistry at the front-end, next-generation sequencing and a machine learning augmented bioinformatics pipeline. The technology, through machine learning, has accrued performance improvements by incorporating learnings generated from the data collected from additional samples.
Two specific enhancements achieved by Guardant Health Digital Sequencing Technology are:

• | High-efficiency chemistry: Overall efficiency of Guardant Health Digital Sequencing in recovery of ctDNA molecules from starting input amount of ctDNA to the post-sequencing analysis of reconstructed molecules indicates the vast majority of extracted ctDNA molecules are converted into a sequencing library, which exceeds most other next-generation sequencing preparations by more than 100%;


• | Error suppression via proprietary bioinformatics engine: Error suppression through Guardant Health Digital Sequencing corresponds to a typical error rate of approximately one error per 3,000,000 reconstructed molecule nucleotides of high quality. This should be compared to the simplest single-end sequencing error rate of approximately one error per 1,000 sequenced nucleotides and approximately one error per 100,000 nucleotides that could be achieved by other assays relying on molecular barcoding alone.

Supply chain
We utilize industry leading vendors for our supply chain. Most reagents and materials are sourced from a single vendor and would require qualification to transition to a different vendor. To mitigate risk, we employ a multi-month, multi-lot safety stock strategy to ensure an uninterrupted supply of reagent and material to our laboratory. In the event that a latent defect is identified, the lot of material in use is expected to be timely quarantined and changed for a new vendor lot that has been previously qualified for use. The experience with our vendors during last five years has provided us confidence in their ability to produce consistent and quality instrumentation, reagents and materials.
19

In September 2014, we entered into a supply agreement with Illumina, Inc., or Illumina, for Illumina to provide products and services that can be used for certain research and clinical activities, including certain sequencers, equipment and other materials that we use in our laboratory operations. Subsequently, we and Illumina amended the supply agreement to, among other things, update the specific products and services to be provided, and pricing terms therefor, and to extend the initial term of the supply agreement. During the term of the supply agreement, as amended, Illumina will supply us with sequencers, reagents, and other consumables for use with the Illumina sequencers, as well as service contracts for the maintenance and repair of the sequencers. 
During the term of the supply agreement, as amended, we are required to make a rolling, non-binding forecast of our expected needs for reagents and other consumables, and place purchase orders for reagents and other consumables, and Illumina may not unreasonably reject conforming purchase orders. Subject to discounts that vary depending on the volume of hardware and reagents and other consumables ordered, the price for sequencers and for service contracts is based on Illumina list prices, and the price for reagents and other consumables is based on contract prices that are fixed for a set period of time and may increase thereafter subject to limitations. The supply agreement does not require us to order minimum amounts of hardware, or to use exclusively the Illumina platform for conducting our sequencing. 
The supply agreement contains negotiated use limitations, representations and warranties, indemnification, limitations of liability, and other provisions. The initial term of the supply agreement, as amended, continues until December 2021, and the supply agreement automatically renews for additional one-year terms thereafter unless either we or Illumina provide the other with notice of termination one year in advance of the date when such termination is to take effect. Either we or Illumina may terminate the supply agreement for the other’s uncured material breach, bankruptcy or insolvency-related events, or in the event a regulatory authority notifies such party that continued performance under the supply agreement would violate applicable laws or regulations. 
Competition
Growing understanding of the importance of biomarkers linked with therapy selection and response is leading to more companies offering services in genomic profiling. The promise of liquid biopsy is also leading to more companies attempting to enter the space and compete with us. Our main competition is from diagnostic companies with products and services to profile genes in cancers based on either single-marker or comprehensive genomic profile testing, based on next-generation sequencing in either blood or tissue. 
Our competitors within the liquid biopsy space include Foundation Medicine, Inc., which was acquired by Roche Holdings, Inc. in July 2018, Roche Molecular Systems, Inc., Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., Illumina, Inc., Personal Genome Diagnostics, Inc., Qiagen N.V. and Sysmex Inostics. In addition, GRAIL, Inc. and Natera, Inc., among others, are developing early detection tests.
Competitors within the broader genomics profiling space based on tissue include laboratory companies such as Bio-Reference Laboratories, Inc., Laboratory Corporation of America and Quest Diagnostics, Inc., as well as companies such as Foundation Medicine, Inc., Caris Life Science and Myriad Genetics, Inc. that sell molecular diagnostic tests for cancer to physicians and have or may develop tests that compete with Guardant360 and GuardantOMNI tests. In addition, we aware that certain of our customers are also developing their own tests and may decide to enter our market or otherwise stop using our tests.
In addition to developing kits, certain diagnostic companies also provide next-generation sequencing platforms that could be used for liquid biopsy testing. These include Illumina, Inc., Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. and other companies developing next-generation sequencing platforms that are sold directly to biopharmaceutical companies, clinical laboratories and research centers. While many of the applications for these platforms are focused on research and development applications, each of these companies has launched and could continue to commercialize products focused on the clinical oncology market. These tests could include FDA-approved diagnostic kits, which can be sold to the clients who have purchased their platforms. 
Furthermore, many companies are developing information technology-based tools to support the integration of next-generation sequencing testing into the clinical setting. These companies may also use their own tests or others to develop an integrated system which could limit our access to certain networks.
We believe key competitive factors affecting our success are the price and performance of our products, evidence of clinical differentiation, support by KOLs, commercial competitiveness, turnaround time and scope and quality of payer contracts. Our Guardant Health Oncology Platform has developed strengths across five layers, which we believe form a barrier to entry and a competitive advantage. However, we cannot assure you that we will continue to compete effectively on each of those layers.

Intellectual property
Protection of our intellectual property is fundamental to the long-term success of our business. We seek to ensure that investments made into the development of our technology are protected by relying on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets (such as know-how), license agreements, confidentiality agreements and procedures, non-disclosure agreements, invention disclosure and assignment agreements and other contractual rights.
Our patent strategy is focused on seeking coverage for our core technology, our digital sequencing platform, and specific follow-on applications and implementations for detecting and monitoring cancer or other diseases by determining genetic variations in patient samples. In addition, we file for patent protection on our on-going research and development particularly into early stage cancer detection, including on pattern recognition based, for example, on analyzing our extensive patient blood sample database. 
Our patent portfolio includes owned and licensed patents and patent applications, generally falling into three broad categories:

• | applications and patents relating to our digital sequencing platform, including claims directed to methods for sequencing cell-free DNA, identifying CNVs, SNVs, indels and fusions in cell-free DNA and techniques for enriching nucleic acid samples;


• | applications and patents relating to detecting and monitoring cancer and other diseases by determining genetic variations in biological samples; and


• | applications and patents relating to early-stage cancer detection.

Issued U.S. patents and their international counterparts currently in our patent portfolio that relate to various aspects of our technology and products are expected to expire between 2026 and 2037.
Our proprietary technology is also bolstered by our acquisition of, and procurement of licenses to, technologies developed by third parties. While we developed our digital sequencing platform internally, we believe the technologies underlying our licenses from third parties, which typically relate to improvements to next-generation sequencing technologies, are potentially valuable and of possible strategic importance to us or our competitors. Under some of these agreements, we are obligated to pay low single-digit percentage running royalties on net sales where the licensed technology is used in the product or service sold, subject to minimum annual royalties or fees in certain agreements.
Our customers and partners recognize us as being a leader in the liquid biopsy field. Thus, just as patent and trade secret protection is essential to protecting our technology, we believe that it is equally as important for us to protect our brand and identity. We have filed for trademark protection in our name, logo and initial products in the United States, including Guardant Health, Guardant360 and GuardantOMNI.
We intend to pursue additional intellectual property protection to the extent we believe it would advance our business objectives. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights, they may not be respected in the future or may be invalidated, circumvented or challenged. In addition, laws of various foreign countries where our products are or expected to be sold may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as laws in the United States.
We also rely on trade secrets, including know-how, unpatented technology and other proprietary information, to maintain and strengthen our competitive position. We have determined that certain technologies, such as aspects of our sample preparation methods and some bioinformatic analysis techniques, are better kept as trade secrets. To mitigate the chance of trade secret misappropriation, it is our policy to enter into nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to our trade secrets, such as our employees, collaborators, outside scientific collaborators, consultants, advisors and other third parties. We also enter into invention disclosure and assignment agreements with our employees and consultants that obligate them to assign to us any inventions they have developed while working for us.
License agreement
In January 2017, we obtained a field exclusive, worldwide, license from KeyGene N.V., or KeyGene, under certain patent rights related to, among other things, next-generation sequencing technologies, to perform activities covered by the issued claims of the licensed patents. The license is sublicensable only with the written approval of KeyGene.
We paid KeyGene a signing fee and issued KeyGene shares of our Series D convertible preferred stock in connection with the execution of the license agreement. In October 2017, we paid KeyGene a success fee upon the achievement of a specified milestone. Additionally, we are obligated to pay to KeyGene a low single-digit percentage running royalty on net sales of licensed activities, provided that each year we are subject to a staggered minimum annual royalty. If the royalty paid by us on net sales is less than the applicable minimum annual royalty for a contract year, we must pay 
21

KeyGene the difference between the minimum annual royalty and the net sales royalty we paid. Such minimum annual royalty increases each year, subject to a cap of €1,750,000. The license agreement specifies that if we challenge the validity or enforceability of a licensed patent right and elect not to terminate the license agreement, we will become obligated to pay an increased royalty to KeyGene, and our minimum annual royalty will also increase. Additionally, we are obligated to pay KeyGene a percentage of all sublicensing revenue, which percentage is in the mid-twenties.
The term of the license agreement continues until the expiration of the last to expire licensed patent. KeyGene may terminate the license agreement if we challenge the validity or enforceability of a licensed patent. KeyGene may terminate the license agreement for our bankruptcy or insolvency-related events. We may terminate the license agreement for convenience, subject to a termination fee. Either we or KeyGene may terminate the license agreement for a material breach by the other party that remains uncured 90 days or more after notice of the breach.
Government regulations
Federal and state laboratory licensing requirements
Under CLIA, a laboratory is any facility that performs laboratory testing on specimens derived from humans for the purpose of providing information for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of disease, or the impairment of or assessment of health. CLIA requires that a laboratory hold a certificate applicable to the type of laboratory examinations it performs and that it complies with, among other things, standards covering operations, personnel, facilities administration, quality systems and proficiency testing, which are intended to ensure, among other things, that clinical laboratory testing services are accurate, reliable and timely. 
To renew our CLIA certificate, we are subject to survey and inspection every two years to assess compliance with program standards. Because we are a CAP accredited laboratory, CMS does not perform this survey and inspection and relies on our CAP survey and inspection. We also may be subject to additional unannounced inspections. Laboratories performing high complexity testing are required to meet more stringent requirements than laboratories performing less complex tests. In addition, a laboratory that is certified as “high complexity” under CLIA may develop, manufacture, validate and use proprietary tests referred to as laboratory developed tests, or LDTs. CLIA requires analytical validation including accuracy, precision, specificity, sensitivity and establishment of a reference range for any LDT used in clinical testing. The regulatory and compliance standards applicable to any testing we perform may change over time and any such changes could have a material effect on our business. 
CLIA provides that a state may adopt laboratory regulations that are more stringent than those under federal law, and a number of states have implemented their own more stringent laboratory regulatory requirements. For example, state laws may require that nonresident laboratories, or out-of-state laboratories, maintain an in-state laboratory license to perform tests on samples from patients who reside in that state. As a condition of state licensure, these state laws may require that laboratory personnel meet certain qualifications, specify certain quality control procedures or facility requirements or prescribe record maintenance requirements. Because our laboratory is located in the State of California, we are required to and do maintain a California state laboratory license. We maintain a current license with NYSDOH for our laboratory. In addition, our laboratory is licensed in a few states where nonresident laboratories are required to obtain state laboratory licenses under certain circumstances, including Florida, Maryland, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island. Other states may currently have or adopt similar licensure requirements in the future, which may require us to modify, delay or stop its operations in those states. 
Failure to comply with CLIA certification and state clinical laboratory licensure requirements may result in a range of enforcement actions, including certificate or license suspension, limitation, or revocation, directed plan of action, onsite monitoring, civil monetary penalties, criminal sanctions, and revocation of the laboratory’s approval to receive Medicare and Medicaid payment for its services, as well as significant adverse publicity.
CLIA and state laws and regulations, operating together, sometimes limit the ability of laboratories to offer consumer-initiated testing (also known as “direct access testing”). CLIA certified laboratories are permitted to perform testing only upon the order of an “authorized person,” defined as an individual authorized under state law to order tests or receive test results, or both. Many states do not permit persons other than licensed healthcare providers to order tests. Thus, in such states, we are not able to offer direct access testing.
Regulatory framework for medical devices in the United States
Pursuant to its authority under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or the FDCA, the FDA has jurisdiction over medical devices, which are defined to include, among other things, in vitro diagnostic devices, or IVDs. The FDA regulates, among other things, the research, design, development, pre-clinical and clinical testing, manufacturing, safety, effectiveness, packaging, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, pre-market clearance or approval, adverse event reporting, marketing, promotion, sales, distribution and import and export of medical devices. Unless an exemption applies, each 
22

new or significantly modified medical device we seek to commercially distribute in the United States will require either a premarket notification to the FDA requesting permission for commercial distribution under Section 510(k) of the FDCA, also referred to as a 510(k) clearance, or approval from the FDA of a PMA. Both the 510(k) clearance and PMA processes can be resource intensive, expensive, and lengthy, and require payment of significant user fees.
Device classification
Under the FDCA, medical devices are classified into one of three classes-Class I, Class II or Class III-depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of control needed to provide reasonable assurances with respect to safety and effectiveness.
Class I includes devices with the lowest risk to the patient and are those for which safety and effectiveness can be reasonably assured by adherence to a set of FDA regulations, referred to as the General Controls for Medical Devices, which require compliance with the applicable portions of the FDA’s quality system regulation, or QSR, facility registration and product listing, reporting of adverse events and malfunctions, and appropriate, truthful and non-misleading labeling and promotional materials. Some Class I devices also require premarket clearance by the FDA through the 510(k) premarket notification process described below. Most Class I products are exempt from the premarket notification requirements.
Class II devices are those that are subject to the General Controls, as well as special controls as deemed necessary by the FDA to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device. These special controls can include performance standards, patient registries, FDA guidance documents and post-market surveillance. Most Class II devices are subject to premarket review and clearance by the FDA. Premarket review and clearance by the FDA for Class II devices is accomplished through the 510(k) premarket notification process.
Class III devices include devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk such as life-supporting or life-sustaining devices, or implantable devices, in addition to those deemed novel and not substantially equivalent following the 510(k) process. The safety and effectiveness of Class III devices cannot be reasonably assured solely by the General Controls and special controls described above. Therefore, these devices are subject to the PMA process, which is generally more costly and time-consuming than the 510(k) process. As part of the PMA process, the applicant must submit data and information demonstrating reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use to the FDA’s satisfaction. Accordingly, a PMA application typically includes, but is not limited to, extensive technical information regarding device design and development, pre-clinical and clinical trial data, manufacturing information, labeling and financial disclosure information for the clinical investigators in device studies. A PMA application must also provide valid scientific evidence that demonstrates to the FDA’s satisfaction a reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use.
The investigational device exemption (IDE) process
In the United States, absent certain limited exceptions, human clinical trials intended to support medical device clearance or approval require an IDE application. Some types of studies deemed to present “non-significant risk” are deemed to have an approved IDE once certain requirements are addressed and institutional review board, or IRB, approval is obtained. If the device presents a “significant risk” to human health, as defined by the FDA, the sponsor must submit an IDE application to the FDA and obtain IDE approval prior to commencing the human clinical trials. The IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory testing results, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. Generally, clinical trials for a significant risk device may begin only after the IDE application is approved by the FDA and the study protocol and informed consent are approved by appropriate IRBs at the clinical trial sites. There can be no assurance that submission of an IDE will result in the ability to commence clinical trials, and although the FDA’s approval of an IDE allows clinical testing to go forward for a specified number of subjects, it does not bind the FDA to accept the results of the trial as sufficient to prove the product’s safety and efficacy, even if the trial meets its intended success criteria.
Such clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with the FDA’s IDE regulations that govern investigational device labeling, prohibit promotion and specify an array of recordkeeping, reporting and monitoring responsibilities of study sponsors and study investigators. Such clinical trials must also comply with the FDA’s good clinical practice regulations for IRB approval and for informed consent and other human subject protections. Required records and reports are subject to inspection by the FDA. The results of clinical testing may be unfavorable, or, even if the intended safety and efficacy success criteria are achieved, may not be considered sufficient for the FDA to grant marketing approval or clearance of a product. The commencement or completion of any clinical trial may be delayed or halted, or be inadequate to support approval of a PMA application, for numerous reasons, including, but not limited to, the following:

• | the FDA or other regulatory authorities do not approve a clinical trial protocol or a clinical trial, or place a clinical trial on hold;

23


• | patients do not enroll in clinical trials at the rate expected;


• | patients do not comply with trial protocols;


• | patient follow-up is not at the rate expected;


• | patients experience adverse events;


• | patients die during a clinical trial, even though their death may not be related to the products that are part of the trial;


• | device malfunctions occur with unexpected frequency or potential adverse consequences;


• | side effects or device malfunctions of similar products already in the market that change the FDA’s view toward approval of new or similar PMAs or result in the imposition of new requirements or testing;


• | institutional review boards and third-party clinical investigators may delay or reject the trial protocol;


• | third-party clinical investigators decline to participate in a trial or do not perform a trial on the anticipated schedule or consistent with the clinical trial protocol, investigator agreement, investigational plan, good clinical practices, the IDE regulations or other FDA or IRB requirements;


• | third-party investigators are disqualified by the FDA;


• | we or third-party organizations do not perform data collection, monitoring and analysis in a timely or accurate manner or consistent with the clinical trial protocol or investigational or statistical plans, or otherwise fail to comply with the IDE regulations governing responsibilities, records and reports of sponsors of clinical investigations;


• | third-party clinical investigators have significant financial interests related to us or our study such that the FDA deems the study results unreliable, or the company or investigators fail to disclose such interests;


• | regulatory inspections of our clinical trials or manufacturing facilities, which may, among other things, require us to undertake corrective action or suspend or terminate our clinical trials;


• | changes in government regulations or administrative actions;


• | the interim or final results of the clinical trial are inconclusive or unfavorable as to safety or efficacy; or


• | the FDA concludes that our trial designs are unreliable or inadequate to demonstrate safety and efficacy.

The 510(k) clearance process
Under the 510(k) clearance process, the manufacturer must submit to the FDA a premarket notification, demonstrating that the device is “substantially equivalent” to a legally marketed predicate device. A predicate device is a legally marketed device that is not subject to a PMA, i.e., a device that was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976 (pre-amendments device) and for which a PMA is not required, a device that has been reclassified from Class III to Class II or I, or a device that was previously found substantially equivalent through the 510(k) process. To be “substantially equivalent,” the proposed device must have the same intended use as the predicate device, and either have the same technological characteristics as the predicate device or have different technological characteristics and not raise different questions of safety or effectiveness than the predicate device. Clinical data is sometimes required to support substantial equivalence.
In addition, in November 2018, FDA officials announced forthcoming steps that the FDA intends to take to modernize the premarket notification pathway under Section 510(k) of the FDCA. Among other things, the FDA announced that it plans to develop proposals to drive manufacturers utilizing the 510(k) pathway toward the use of newer predicate devices. These proposals include plans to potentially sunset certain older devices that were previously used as predicates under the 510(k) clearance pathway, and to potentially publish a list of devices that have been cleared on the basis of demonstrated substantial equivalence to predicate devices that are more than 10 years old. The FDA also announced that it intends to finalize guidance to establish a premarket review pathway for “manufacturers of certain well-understood device types” as an alternative to the 510(k) clearance pathway and that such premarket review pathway would allow manufacturers to rely on objective safety and performance criteria recognized by the FDA to demonstrate substantial equivalence, obviating the need for manufacturers to compare the safety and performance of their medical devices to specific predicate devices in the clearance process. These proposals have not yet been finalized or adopted, and the FDA announced that it would seek public feedback prior to publication of any such proposals, and may work with Congress to implement such proposals through legislation.
24

After a 510(k) premarket notification is submitted, the FDA determines whether to accept it for substantive review. If it lacks necessary information for substantive review, the FDA will refuse to accept the 510(k) notification. If it is accepted for filing, the FDA begins a substantive review. By statute, the FDA is required to complete its review of a 510(k) notification within 90 days of receiving the 510(k) notification. As a practical matter, clearance often takes longer, and clearance is never assured. Although many 510(k) premarket notifications are cleared without clinical data, the FDA may require further information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence, which may significantly prolong the review process. If the FDA agrees that the device is substantially equivalent, it will grant clearance to commercially market the device.
If the FDA determines that the device is not “substantially equivalent” to a predicate device, or if the device is automatically classified into Class III, the device sponsor must then fulfill the much more rigorous pre-marketing requirements of the PMA approval process, or seek reclassification of the device through the de novo process. The de novo classification process is an alternate pathway to classify medical devices that are automatically classified into Class III but which are low to moderate risk. A manufacturer can submit a petition for direct de novo review if the manufacturer is unable to identify an appropriate predicate device and the new device or new use of the device presents a moderate or low risk. De novo classification may also be available after receipt of a “not substantially equivalent” letter following submission of a 510(k) to FDA. 
After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a new or major change in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) clearance or, depending on the modification, could require a PMA application. The FDA requires each manufacturer to determine whether the proposed change requires a new submission in the first instance, but the FDA can review any such decision and disagree with a manufacturer’s determination. Many minor modifications are accomplished by a letter-to-file in which the manufacture documents the change in an internal letter-to-file. The letter-to-file is in lieu of submitting a new 510(k) to obtain clearance for such change. The FDA can always review these letters to file in an inspection. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer’s determination regarding whether a new premarket submission is required for the modification of an existing 510(k)-cleared device, the FDA can require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or approval of a PMA application is obtained. In addition, in these circumstances, the FDA can impose significant regulatory fines or penalties for failure to submit the requisite application(s).
The PMA process
Following receipt of a PMA application, the FDA conducts an administrative review to determine whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review. If it is not, the agency will refuse to file the PMA. If it is, the FDA will accept the application for filing and begin the review. The FDA has 180 days to review a filed PMA application, although the review of an application more often occurs over a significantly longer period of time. During this review period, the FDA may request additional information or clarification of information already provided and may issue a major deficiency letter to the applicant, requesting the applicant’s response to deficiencies communicated by the FDA. 
Before approving or denying a PMA, an FDA advisory committee may review the PMA at a public meeting and provide the FDA with the committee’s recommendation on whether the FDA should approve the submission, approve it with specific conditions, or not approve it. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
Prior to approval of a PMA, the FDA may conduct inspections of the clinical trial data and clinical trial sites, as well as inspections of the manufacturing facility and processes. Overall, the FDA review of a PMA application generally takes between one and three years, but may take significantly longer. The FDA can delay, limit or deny approval of a PMA application for many reasons, including:

• | the device may not be shown safe or effective to the FDA’s satisfaction;


• | the data from pre-clinical studies and/or clinical trials may be found unreliable or insufficient to support approval;


• | the manufacturing process or facilities may not meet applicable requirements; and


• | changes in FDA approval policies or adoption of new regulations may require additional data.

If the FDA evaluation of a PMA is favorable, the FDA will issue either an approval letter, or an approvable letter, the latter of which usually contains a number of conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the PMA. When and if those conditions have been fulfilled to the satisfaction of the FDA, the agency will issue a PMA approval letter authorizing commercial marketing of the device, subject to the conditions of approval and the limitations established in the approval letter. If the FDA’s evaluation of a PMA application or manufacturing facilities is not 
25

favorable, the FDA will deny approval of the PMA or issue a not approvable letter. The FDA may also determine that additional tests or clinical trials are necessary, in which case the PMA approval may be delayed for several months or years while the trials are conducted and data is submitted in an amendment to the PMA, or the PMA is withdrawn and resubmitted when the data are available. The PMA process can be expensive, uncertain and lengthy and a number of devices for which the FDA approval has been sought by other companies have never been approved for marketing.
New PMA applications or PMA supplements are required for modification to the manufacturing process, equipment or facility, quality control procedures, sterilization, packaging, expiration date, labeling, device specifications, ingredients, materials or design of a device that has been approved through the PMA process. PMA supplements often require submission of the same type of information as an initial PMA application, except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support changes from the device covered by a PMA and may or may not require as extensive technical or clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel, depending on the nature of the proposed change.
In approving a PMA application, as a condition of approval, the FDA may require some form of post-approval study or post-market surveillance, whereby the applicant conducts a follow-up study or follows certain patient groups for a number of years and makes periodic reports to the FDA on the clinical status of those patients when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional or longer term safety and effectiveness data for the device. The FDA may also approve a PMA application with other post-approval conditions intended to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device, such as restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale, distribution and use. New PMA applications or PMA supplements may also be required for modifications to approved diagnostic tests, including modifications to manufacturing processes, device labeling and device design, based on the findings of post-approval studies.
FDA regulation of laboratory developed tests
Although the FDA regulates medical devices, including IVDs, the FDA has historically exercised its enforcement discretion and not enforced applicable provisions of the FDCA and FDA regulations with respect to LDTs, which are a subset of IVDs that are intended for clinical use and are developed, validated and offered within a single laboratory for use only in that laboratory. We currently market our Guardant360 test as an LDT and therefore currently do not expect the FDA to enforce its medical device regulations and the applicable FDCA provisions on Guardant360 testing. 
Legislative and administrative proposals addressing oversight of LDTs were introduced in recent years and we expect that new legislative and administrative proposals will be introduced from time to time. It is possible that legislation could be enacted into law or regulations or guidance could be issued by the FDA which may result in new or increased regulatory requirements for us to continue to offer our LDTs or to develop and introduce new tests as LDTs. For example, in 2014 the FDA issued two draft guidance documents proposing a risk-based framework with respect to applying the FDA’s oversight over LDTs. The Framework Guidance stated that the FDA intended to modify its policy of enforcement discretion with respect to LDTs in a risk-based manner consistent with the existing classification of medical devices. Thus, we believe the FDA planned to begin to enforce its medical device requirements, including premarket submission requirements, on LDTs that have historically been marketed without FDA premarket review and oversight. In November 2016, the FDA announced its intention not to finalize the 2014 draft guidance to allow for further public discussion on an appropriate oversight approach to LDTs and to give congressional authorizing committees the opportunity to develop a legislative solution. In January 2017, the FDA issued a discussion paper on possible approaches to LDT regulation.
Although the FDA halted finalization of the guidance in November 2016 to allow for further public discussion on an appropriate oversight approach to LDTs and to give congressional authorizing committees the opportunity to develop a legislative solution, the FDA could ultimately modify its current approach to LDTs in a way that would subject our products marketed as LDTs to the enforcement of regulatory requirements. Moreover, legislative measures have recently been proposed in Congress that, if ultimately enacted, could provide the FDA with additional authority to require premarket review of and regulate LDTs.
Research use only devices
Our GuardantOMNI test and LUNAR assay are currently marketed as research use only, or RUO, devices. A RUO device is one that is not intended for use in a clinical investigation or for clinical diagnostic use outside an investigation and must be labeled “For Research Use Only. Not for use in diagnostic procedures.” Products that are intended for RUO and are properly labeled as RUO are exempt from compliance with the FDA requirements discussed above, including the approval or clearance and QSR requirements. A product labeled RUO but intended to be used diagnostically may be viewed by the FDA as adulterated and misbranded under the FDCA and is subject to FDA enforcement activities. The FDA may consider the totality of the circumstances surrounding distribution and use of an RUO product, including how the product is marketed, when determining its intended use. 
26

EAP (Expedited Access Program)/Breakthrough Devices Program
The EAP was a voluntary program for certain medical devices that demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for life threatening or irreversibly debilitating diseases or conditions that are subject to premarket submissions. Under the EAP, the FDA worked with device sponsors to try to reduce the time and cost from development to marketing decision without changing the FDA’s PMA standard of reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness or any other standards of valid scientific evidence. Components of the EAP include priority review, more interactive review, senior management involvement, and assignment of a case manager. 
Pursuant to the 21st Century Cures Act, the Breakthrough Devices provisions were added to the FDCA. The Breakthrough Devices Program is a voluntary program intended to expedite the review, development, assessment and review of certain medical devices that provide for more effective treatment or diagnosis of life-threatening or irreversibly debilitating human diseases or conditions for which no approved or cleared treatment exists or that offer significant advantages over existing approved or cleared alternatives. For Breakthrough Devices, the FDA intends to provide interactive and timely communication with the sponsor during device development and throughout the review process. FDA also intends to assign staff to be available within a reasonable time to address questions by institutional review committees concerning the conditions and clinical testing expectations applicable to the investigational use of a Breakthrough Device. In addition, all submissions for devices designated as Breakthrough Devices will receive priority review, meaning that the review of the submission is placed at the top of the appropriate review queue and receives additional review resources, as needed. The Breakthrough Devices Program superseded the EAP and the previous priority review program for medical device submissions. The FDA has indicated that all participants previously granted EAP designation will have designation as breakthrough devices, and that no separate action will necessary for sponsors of EAP-designated devices to receive breakthrough device designation for such devices. 
In January 2018, we received EAP designation from the FDA for our Guardant360 test. In December 2018, we received breakthrough device designation from the FDA for our GuardantOMNI test.
Companion Diagnostics
For certain of our tests, we are pursuing development as in vitro companion diagnostics for use in selecting the patients that may respond to our partners’ pharmaceutical products. Companion diagnostics are regulated by the FDA as medical devices. The FDA issued a final guidance document in July 2014 addressing agency policy in relation to in vitro companion diagnostic tests. The guidance explains that for some drugs and therapeutic biologics, the use of a companion diagnostic test is essential for the safe and effective use of the product, such as when the use of a product is limited to a specific patient subpopulation that can be identified by using the test. According to the guidance, the FDA generally requires the therapeutic product and the companion diagnostic to be developed and approved or cleared contemporaneously. In July 2016, the FDA issued a draft guidance intended to assist sponsors of the drug therapeutic and in vitro companion diagnostic device on issues related to co-development of the products, and in December 2018, FDA issued a draft guidance describing considerations for the development and labeling of in vitro companion diagnostic devices to support the indicated uses of multiple drug or biological oncology products.
Pervasive and continuing FDA regulation
After a device enters commercial distribution, numerous regulatory requirements continue to apply. These include:

• | the FDA’s QSR, which requires manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, production, control, supplier/contractor selection, complaint handling, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the manufacturing process;


• | labeling regulations, unique device identification requirements and FDA prohibitions against the promotion of products for uncleared, unapproved or off-label uses;


• | advertising and promotion requirements;


• | restrictions on sale, distribution or use of a device;


• | PMA annual reporting requirements;


• | PMA approval of product modifications, or the potential for new 510(k) clearances for certain modifications to 510(k)-cleared devices;


• | medical device reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur;

27


• | medical device correction and removal reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA that may present a risk to health;


• | recall requirements, including a mandatory recall if there is a reasonable probability that the device would cause serious adverse health consequences or death;


• | an order of repair, replacement or refund;


• | device tracking requirements; and


• | post-market surveillance regulations, which apply when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device.

The FDA has broad post-market and regulatory enforcement powers. Medical device manufacturers are subject to unannounced inspections by the FDA and other state, local and foreign regulatory authorities to assess compliance with the QSR and other applicable regulations, and these inspections may include the manufacturing facilities of any suppliers. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA, which may include sanctions such as: warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties; unanticipated expenditures, repair, replacement, refunds, recall or seizure of our products; operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production; the FDA’s refusal of our requests for 510(k) clearance or premarket approval of new products, new intended uses or modifications to existing products; the FDA’s refusal to issue certificates to foreign governments needed to export products for sale in other countries; and withdrawing 510(k) clearance or premarket approvals that have already been granted and criminal prosecution.
Federal and state fraud and abuse laws
We are subject to federal fraud and abuse laws such as the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, or AKS, the federal prohibition against physician self-referral, or Stark Law, and the federal false claims law, or the False Claims Act, or FCA. We are also subject to similar state and foreign fraud and abuse laws.
The AKS prohibits knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, or receiving remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, in return for or to induce such person to refer an individual, or to purchase, lease, order, arrange for, or recommend purchasing, leasing or ordering, any good, facility, item or service that is reimbursable, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program. 
The Stark Law and similar state laws, including California’s Physician Ownership and Referral Act, generally prohibit, among other things, clinical laboratories and other entities from billing a patient or any governmental or commercial payer for any diagnostic services when the physician ordering the service, or any member of such physician’s immediate family, has a direct or indirect investment interest in or compensation arrangement with us, unless the arrangement meets an exception to the prohibition. 
Other federal fraud and abuse laws to which we are subject include but are not limited to the federal civil and criminal false claims laws including the FCA, which imposes liability on any person or entity that, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment to the federal government, and the federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law, which prohibits, among other things, the offering or transfer of remuneration to a Medicare or state healthcare program beneficiary if the person knows or should know it is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular provider, practitioner, or supplier of services reimbursable by Medicare or a state healthcare program, unless an exception applies. Under the FCA, private citizens can bring claims on behalf of the government through qui tam actions. We must also operate within the bounds of the fraud and abuse laws of the states in which we do business which may apply to items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payers, including private insurers.
Efforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable laws and regulations will involve substantial costs. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, exclusion from government-funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, disgorgement, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, additional reporting or oversight obligations if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with the law and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. If any physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we do business is found to be not in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government-funded healthcare programs.

Privacy and Security
Under the administrative simplification provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, issued regulations that establish uniform standards governing the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and requirements for protecting the privacy and security of protected health information, or PHI, used or disclosed by covered entities. Covered entities and their business associates are subject to HIPAA and HITECH. Because we are a health care provider that electronically transmits health care information to payers, we are a covered entity under HIPAA. Our subcontractors that create, receive, maintain or transmit or otherwise process PHI on our behalf must also comply with HIPAA as business associates thereunder. 
HIPAA and HITECH include the privacy and security rules, breach notification requirements and electronic transaction standards. The privacy rule covers the use and disclosure of PHI by covered entities and business associates. The privacy rule generally prohibits the use or disclosure of PHI except as permitted under the rule. The rule also sets forth individual patient rights, such as the right to access or amend certain records containing his or her PHI, or to request restrictions on the use or disclosure of his or her PHI. The security rule requires covered entities and business associates to safeguard the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of electronically transmitted or stored PHI by implementing administrative, physical and technical safeguards. Under HITECH’s breach notification rule, a covered entity must notify individuals, the Secretary of the HHS, and in some circumstances, the media of breaches of unsecured PHI. 
Entities, which are found to be in violation of HIPAA as the result of a breach of unsecured PHI, a complaint about their privacy practices or an audit by HHS, may be subject to significant civil and criminal fines and penalties and/or additional reporting and oversight obligations if such entities are required to enter into a resolution agreement and corrective action plan with HHS to settle allegations of HIPAA non-compliance.
In addition, we may be subject to state health information privacy, security and data breach notification laws, which may govern the collection, use, disclosure and protection of health-related and other personal information. State laws may be more stringent, broader in scope or offer greater individual rights with respect to PHI than HIPAA. California, for example, has enacted the Confidentiality of Medical Information Act, which sets forth standards in addition to HIPAA and HITECH with which all California health care providers like us must abide. In addition, the California Consumer Privacy Act, or the CCPA, was signed into law on June 28, 2018, and largely takes effect January 1, 2020. The CCPA contains new disclosure obligations for businesses that collect personal information about California residents and affords those individuals new rights relating to their personal information that may affect our ability to use personal information. The CCPA has substantial penalties for non-compliance and we continue to assess its impact on our business. Complying with these various state laws and regulations, which may differ from state to state, requires significant resources and may complicate our compliance efforts. Penalties for violation of any of these laws and regulations may include sanctions against a laboratory's licensure, as well as civil and/or criminal penalties.
U.S. healthcare reform 
In the United States, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes at the federal and state levels which seek to reduce healthcare costs and improve the quality of healthcare. For example, in March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act, or the ACA, became law. The ACA substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both commercial and government payers and contains a number of provisions expected to impact our business and operations, some of which in ways we cannot currently predict, including those governing enrollment in federal and state healthcare programs, reimbursement changes and fraud and abuse. For instance, the ACA requires each medical device manufacturer to pay a sales tax equal to 2.3% of the price for which the medical device is sold, and began to apply to sales of taxable medical devices after December 31, 2012. Through a series of legislative amendments, the tax was suspended for 2016 through 2019. Absent further legislative action, the device excise tax will be reinstated on medical device sales starting January 1, 2020. 
Since 2016 there have been efforts to repeal all or part of the ACA, and the current Presidential Administration and U.S. Congress have taken action to roll certain provisions of the ACA. For example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, among other things, removes penalties for not complying with the ACA’s individual mandate to carry health insurance. The current Presidential Administration and the U.S. Congress may take further action regarding the ACA, including, but not limited to, repeal or replacement. Additionally, all or a portion of the ACA and related subsequent legislation may be modified, repealed or otherwise invalidated through judicial challenge, which could result in lower numbers of insured individuals, reduced coverage for insured individuals and adversely affect our business and results of operations. 
The device excise tax imposed by the ACA and the expansion in the government’s role in the U.S. healthcare industry may result in decreased profits to us and lower reimbursement by payers for our tests, any of which may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
29

In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. On August 2, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011 was signed into law, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to providers by 2% per fiscal year, effective on April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will remain in effect through 2027 unless additional Congressional action is taken. 
We anticipate there will continue to be proposals by legislators at both the federal and state levels, regulators and commercial payers to reduce costs while expanding individual healthcare benefits. Certain of these changes could impose additional limitations on the prices we will be able to charge for our tests, the coverage of or the amounts of reimbursement available for our tests from payers, including commercial and government payers.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had 454 full-time employees, with 345 in technology, research and development, business development and laboratory and commercial operations, and 109 in general and administrative functions. Of these full-time employees, 93 work remotely and the remainder work in our headquarters in Redwood City, California. None of our employees is represented by a labor union with respect to his or her employment with us. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
