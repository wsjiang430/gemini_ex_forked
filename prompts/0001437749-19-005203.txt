A description of each of the Company’s hand pieces, and the aesthetic conditions they are designed to treat, is contained in the section below entitled “Products” and a summary of the features of our primary platforms is as follows:
 
● truSculpt iD –In July 2018 the Company introduced a hands-free version of our truSculpt platform, the truSculpt iD, for the non-surgical body sculpting market. It includes consumable cycles that need to be ordered by the practitioner after a set number of treatments are performed, resulting in recurring revenue. This product is a high-powered RF system designed for body contouring, lipolysis and deep tissue heating, and is able to treat all body and skin types. The truSculpt iD delivers targeted energy at 2 MHz, causing lipolysis of the subcutaneous adipose tissue. The Company received 510(k) clearance from the United States (“U.S.”) Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) for lipolysis of abdominal fat in 2018. It was primarily sold in the U.S. and Canada in 2018 and is planned to be sold to a broader international customer base in 2019. Prior truSculpt platforms include the truSculpt 3D, a 2 MHZ device for tissue heating and temporary reduction in the abdomen, and the original truSculpt platform which was launched in August 2012 and delivered treatments at 1 MHz. In December 2016, the Company received 510(k) clearance from the FDA to market the truSculpt platform for the temporary reduction in circumference of the abdomen. The truSculpt 3D includes a consumable hand piece that needs to be "refilled" after a set number of treatments are performed, resulting in recurring revenue.
 
● Juliet – In December 2017, the Company introduced the Juliet laser for women’s intimate health. Juliet is a versatile multi-application platform utilizing an Er:YAG laser with the 2940 nm wavelength. This Erbium wavelength produces noticeable results due to its high peak absorption in water. Additionally, Juliet’s Erbium technology allows for a controlled thermal delivery to tissue, keeping the procedure safe for patients while minimizing downtime. Juliet delivers two passes of energy to the target area during treatment. The first pass uses ablation to vaporize the tissue and create micro-channels of injury. The second pass uses coagulation to deliver a thermal injury to the area, which further stimulates the body's normal wound healing process, revitalizing, and remodeling damaged tissue and introducing the formation of new blood vessels. Juliet also  has a disposable tip, which must be changed for every procedure. As a result, the replacements of the tips results in recurring revenue.
 
● Secret RF – In January 2018, the Company introduced a new fractional radio frequency (“RF”) microneedling device that delivers heat into the deeper layers of the skin using controlled RF energy. The targeted energy revitalizes, rebuilds and firms up tissue, effectively remodeling collagen, improving mild wrinkles and diminishing scars while leaving the outer layer of skin intact, minimizing downtime. Each time a procedure is performed, it requires the physician to use a new hand piece tip. The sale of the replacement tip results in recurring revenue.
 
● enlighten – In December 2014, the Company introduced the enlighten laser platform with a dual wavelength (1064 nanometer, or “nm” + 532 nm) and in December 2016, we introduced a three wavelength model (1064 nm + 532 nm + 670 nm), enlighten III. The enlighten system is a dual pulse duration (750 picosecond, or “ps,” and 2 nanosecond, or “ns”) laser system and is cleared for multi-colored tattoo removal and for the treatment of benign pigmented lesions and acne scars. In 2018, the Company introduced an expanded performance enlighten III and in April 2018, the Company introduced enlighten SR, which is a lighter version of enlighten with reduced optical performance. Clinical studies were conducted to support an FDA clearance in October 2018 for treatment of acne scars on patients with Fitzpatrick skin types II-V when used with the Micro Lens Array (MLA) hand piece attachment.
 
● excel HR – In June 2014, the Company introduced the excel HR platform, a premium hair removal solution for all skin types, combining Cutera’s proven long-pulse 1064 nm Nd:YAG laser and a high-power 755 nm Alexandrite laser with sapphire contact cooling.
 
● excel V+ – In March 2019, the Company introduced the excel V+, a new iteration of the excel V vascular platform originally introduced in 2011. The excel V+, a high-performance, vascular and benign pigmented lesion treatment platform designed specifically for the core-market of dermatologists and plastic surgeons. The excel V+ has 50% higher power than its predecessor and provides greater range of parameters for faster more customizable treatments. The excel V and excel V+ are solid-state laser platforms providing a combination of the 532 nm green laser with 1064 nm Nd:YAG technology, to provide a single, compact and efficient system that treats the entire range of cosmetic vascular and benign pigmented lesion conditions.
 
● xeo – In 2003, the Company introduced the xeo platform, which combines intense pulsed light technology with laser applications in a single system. The xeo is a multi-application platform on which a customer can purchase hand piece applications for the removal of unwanted hair, treatment of vascular lesions, and skin revitalization by treating discoloration, fine lines and laxity.
 
In addition to the above mentioned seven primary systems, the Company continues to generate revenue from its legacy products such as GenesisPlus, CoolGlide, and the distribution of ZO’s skincare products, a third-party product sold in the Japanese market. The Company also generates revenue from the sale of post-warranty services, as well as the sales of Titan hand piece refills.
 
The Company offers its customers the ability to select the systems and applications that best fit their practice and to subsequently upgrade their systems to add new applications. This upgrade path allows our customers to cost-effectively build their aesthetic practices and provides us with a source of incremental revenue.
 
The Market for Non-Surgical Aesthetic Procedures
 
The market for non-surgical aesthetic procedures has grown significantly over the past several years. According to data presented at the IMCAS Global Market Summit in February 2019, the medical aesthetic global market has doubled from $6.3 billion to $11 billion from 2014 to 2018, and is projected to reach $15 billion by 2022. The market growth rate for 2018 was 5.1% and a 6.3% growth is estimated in 2019. Body sculpting is expected to grow at a CAGR of 9.7%.

The Company believes there are several factors contributing to the global growth of aesthetic treatment procedures and aesthetic laser equipment sales, including:
 
● Improved Economic Environment and Expanded Physician Base – The improvements in overall global economic conditions since the last recession have created increased demand for aesthetic procedures, which in turn has resulted in an expanding practitioner base to satisfy the demand.
 ● Aging Demographics of Industrialized Countries – The aging population of industrialized countries, the amount of discretionary income available to the “baby boomer” demographic segment ─ ages 54 to 72 in 2018 ─ and their desire to retain a youthful appearance, contribute to the increased demand for aesthetic procedures.
 ● Broader Range of Safe and Effective Treatments – Technical developments, as well as an increase in treatable conditions due to new product introductions, lead to safe, effective, easy-to-use and low-cost treatments with fewer side effects, resulting in broader adoption of aesthetic procedures by practitioners. In addition, technical advancements enable practitioners to offer a broader range of treatments. These technical developments reduce treatment and recovery times, which in turn lead to greater patient demand.
 ● Broader Base of Customers – Managed care and government payor reimbursement restrictions motivate physicians to establish, or seek to expand, their elective aesthetic practices with procedures that are paid for directly by patients. As a result, in addition to core practitioners such as dermatologists and plastic surgeons, many other practitioners, such as gynecologists, family practitioners, primary care physicians, physicians performing aesthetic treatments in non-medical offices, and other qualified practitioners (“non-core practitioners”) expand their practices and offer aesthetic procedures.
 ● Reductions in Cost per Procedure – Due in part to increased competition in the aesthetic market, the cost per procedure has been reduced in the past few years. This attracts a broader base of customers and patients seeking aesthetic procedures.
 ● Wide Acceptance of Aesthetic Procedures and Increased Focus on Body Image and Appearance – According to the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery survey in 2016, both surgical and non-surgical procedures increased compared to 1997. Surgical procedures increased by 99%, while non-surgical procedures increased by 650% over this 20-year period.
Non-Surgical Aesthetic Procedures for Improving the Body and/or Skin’s Appearance and Their Limitations
 
Many alternative therapies are available for improving a person’s appearance by treating specific structures within the skin. These procedures utilize injections or abrasive agents to reach different depths of the dermis and the epidermis. In addition, non-invasive and minimally invasive treatments have been developed that employ laser and other energy-based technologies to achieve similar therapeutic results. Some of these common aesthetic procedures and their limitations are described below.
Non-Invasive Body Contouring – Treatments for non-invasive body sculpting can be done utilizing a variety of technologies including radio frequency, laser, cooling and ultrasound. Procedures address reduction of unwanted fat on the abdomen, flanks, arms, thighs, submentum and back, and can require one or more treatments. Systems with the ability to induce non-invasive lipolysis (breakdown of fat) offer a more permanent solution with an average fat reduction of greater than 20%. Side effects to this approach may include nodules that typically resolve over time, and the risk of burning the treatment area.
 
Tattoo removal – The most effective way to remove tattoos on the body is to utilize laser systems that deliver very short pulse durations with high peak power in order to break up the ink particles that comprise tattoos. According to a Tattoo Incidence Study published in ORC International in June 2015, up to 27% of Americans have one or more tattoos, and 1 in 4 tattoo bearing American adults have “tattoo regret”. Despite the effectiveness of lasers for tattoo removal, common complaints concerning laser tattoo removal include a low rate of complete clearance (sometimes no better than 50% after several treatments) as well as the high number of treatments for satisfactory clearance (often 10 or more treatments spaced four to eight weeks apart). However, the latest generation of tattoo removal lasers produce picosecond pulse durations, (a trillionth of a second) and thereby, can meaningfully improve tattoo clearance and reduce the total number of treatments.
 
Hair Removal – Techniques for hair removal include waxing, depilatories, tweezing, shaving, electrolysis, laser as well as other energy-based hair removal modalities. The only techniques that provide a long-lasting solution are electrolysis, laser, and other energy-based technology such as an Intense Pulsed Light (“IPL”). Electrolysis is usually painful, time-consuming and expensive for large areas, but is the most common method for removing light-colored hair. During electrolysis, an electrologist inserts a needle directly into a hair follicle and activates an electric current in the needle. Since electrolysis only treats one hair follicle at a time, the treatment of an area as small as an upper lip may require numerous visits and many hours of treatment. In addition, electrolysis can cause blemishes and infection related to needle use. In comparison, lasers can quickly treat large areas with a high degree of safety and efficacy.
Skin Revitalization – Skin revitalization treatments include a broad range of popular alternatives, including Botox and collagen injections, chemical peel, microdermabrasion, radio frequency treatment and laser and other energy-based treatments. With these treatments, patients hope to improve overall skin tone and texture, reduce pore size, tighten skin and remove other signs of aging, including mottled pigmentation, diffuse redness and wrinkles. All of these procedures are temporary solutions and must be repeated within several weeks or months to sustain their effect, thereby increasing the cost and inconvenience to patients. For example, the body absorbs Botox and collagen, and patients require supplemental injections every three to six months to maintain the benefits of these treatments.

Other skin revitalization treatments, such as chemical peels and microdermabrasion, can have undesirable side effects. Chemical peels use acidic or caustic solutions to peel away the epidermis, and microdermabrasion generally utilizes sand crystals to resurface the skin. These techniques can lead to stinging, redness, irritation and scabbing. In addition, more serious complications, such as changes in skin color, can result from deeper chemical peels.
 
Microneedling – (also known as collagen induction therapy) is a minimally invasive revitalization treatment that involves using fine needles to create hundreds of tiny, invisible puncture wounds in the top layer of the skin, which stimulates the body's natural wound healing processes, resulting in cell turnover and increased collagen and elastin production. Our recently introduced Secret RF product is a RF fractional microneedling system that helps deliver tailored energy to improve fine lines, wrinkles, and scars from the inside out.
 
Women’s Intimate Health – Lasers and RF technology have emerged as a treatment for issues unique to women's health such as vulvar vaginal atrophy and genitourinary symptoms of menopause. The condition causes vaginal dryness, inflammation and irritation, which can lead to painful or frequent urination. Traditional treatments use estrogen therapy to combat vulvar vaginal atrophy and genitourinary symptoms of menopause to restore vaginal health, but not all women suffering from the symptoms are candidates. Lasers have been shown to ablate the vaginal tissue generating a healing response that may lead to system improvement.
Leg and Facial Veins – Current aesthetic treatment methods for leg and facial veins include sclerotherapy, as well as laser and other energy-based treatments. With these treatments, patients seek to eliminate visible veins, and improve overall skin appearance. Sclerotherapy requires a skilled practitioner to inject a saline or detergent-based solution into the target vein, which breaks down the vessel causing it to collapse and be absorbed into the body. The need to correctly position the needle on the inside of the vein makes it difficult to treat smaller veins, which limits the treatment of facial vessels and small leg veins.
 
Laser and other energy-based non-surgical treatments for hair removal, veins, skin revitalization and body contouring are discussed in the following section and in the section entitled “Our Applications and Procedures” below.’
 
Laser and Other Energy-Based Aesthetic Treatments
 Laser and other energy-based aesthetic treatments can achieve therapeutic results by affecting structures within the skin. The development of safe and effective aesthetic treatments has resulted in a well-established market for these procedures.
 
Practitioners can use laser and other energy-based technologies to selectively target hair follicles, veins or collagen in the dermis, as well as cells responsible for pigmentation in the epidermis, without damaging surrounding tissue. Practitioners can also use these technologies to safely remove portions of the epidermis and deliver heat to the dermis as a means of generating new collagen growth. Ablative skin resurfacing improves the appearance of the skin by removing the outer layers of the skin. Ablative skin resurfacing procedures are considered invasive or minimally invasive, depending on how much of the epidermis is removed during a treatment. Non-ablative skin resurfacing improves the appearance of the skin by treating the underlying structure of the skin.
 
Safe and effective laser and energy-based treatments require an appropriate combination of the four parameters:
 
● Energy Level – the amount of light or radio frequency emitted to heat a target;
 ● Pulse Duration – the time interval over which the energy is delivered;
 ● Spot Size or Electrode Size – the diameter of the energy beam, which affects treatment depth and area; and
 ● Wavelength or Frequency – the position in the electromagnetic spectrum which impacts the absorption and the effective depth of the energy delivered.
 
For example, in the case of hair removal, by utilizing the correct combination of these parameters, a practitioner can use a laser or other light source to selectively target melanin within the hair follicle to absorb the laser energy and destroy the follicle, without damaging other delicate structures in the surrounding tissue.
 
Technology and Design of the Company’s Systems
 
The Company’s enlighten, excel HR, excel V, Juliet, Secret RF, truSculpt, and xeo platforms provide the long-lasting benefits of laser and other energy-based aesthetic treatments. Our technology allows for a wide variety of applications in a single system. Key features of our solutions include:
 
● Multiple Applications Available in a Single System – Many of our platforms feature multiple-applications that enable practitioners to perform a variety of aesthetic procedures using a single device. These procedures include hair removal, vascular treatments and skin revitalization ─ including the treatment of discoloration, fine lines, and uneven texture. Because practitioners can use our systems for multiple indications, the investment in a unit is spread across a greater number of patients and procedures, and the acquisition cost may be more rapidly recovered.

The Company believes that product upgradeability allows our customers to take advantage of our latest product offerings and provide additional treatment options to their patients, thereby expanding the opportunities for their aesthetic practices.
● Treatments for Broad Range of Skin Types and Conditions – For hair removal, our products are safe and effective on patients of all skin types, including harder-to-treat patients with dark or tanned skin. In addition, the wide parameter range of our systems allows practitioners to effectively treat patients with both fine and coarse hair. Practitioners may use our products to treat spider veins on the leg; to treat facial veins; and perform skin revitalization procedures for discoloration, texture, fine lines, and wrinkles on any type of skin. The ability to customize treatment parameters based on skin type enables practitioners to offer safe and effective therapies to a broad base of their patients.
 
● Ease of Use – The Company designs its products to be easy to use. Our proprietary hand pieces are lightweight and ergonomic, minimize user fatigue, and facilitate clear views of the treatment area, reducing the possibility of unintended damage and increasing the speed of application. Our control console contains an intuitive user interface with simple, independently adjustable controls from which to select a wide range of treatment parameters to suit each patient’s profile. For instance, the clinical navigation user interface on the xeo platform provides recommended clinical treatment parameter ranges based on patient criteria entered. Our Pearl and Pearl Fractional hand pieces include a scanner with multiple scan patterns to allow simple and fast treatments of the face. Finally, our truSculpt iD embodies the best of many of the above features. Unlike other body sculpting treatments on the market that require certain body types, or pinchable fat, truSculpt iD is "body agnostic" with the ability to customize treatments to the patient's needs and body type. In addition, our proprietary algorithms and navigation enable the practitioner to treat a 300cm2 area in only 15 minutes.

Applications and Procedures
 
Our products are designed to allow the practitioner to select an appropriate combination of energy level, spot size and pulse duration for each treatment. The ability to manipulate the combinations of these parameters allows our customers to treat the broadest range of conditions available with a single energy-based system.
 
Non-Invasive Body Contouring – Our truSculpt technology allows practitioners to apply a hand piece directly to the skin and deliver high-powered RF energy that results in the deep and uniform heating of the subcutaneous fat tissue at sustained therapeutic temperatures. This heating can cause selective destruction of fat cells, which are eliminated from the treatment area through the body’s natural wound healing processes. The treatment takes approximately 15 minutes and two or more treatments may be required to obtain the desired aesthetic results. Our CE Mark allows us to market truSculpt in the European Union (“EU”), Australia and certain other countries outside the U.S. for fat reduction, body shaping, body contouring and circumferential reduction. In the U.S., truSculpt has 510(k) clearance for topical heating for the purpose of elevating tissue temperature for the treatment of selected medical conditions, such as relief of pain and muscle spasms and increase in local circulation. Additionally, the 2 MHz setting for the 40 cm2 hand piece is indicated for reduction in circumference of the abdomen and non-invasive lipolysis (breakdown of fat) of the abdomen. The truSculpt massage device is intended to provide a temporary reduction in the appearance of cellulite.
 
Tattoo Removal – Our enlighten systems, delivering picosecond and nanosecond pulse duration, and our myQ Q-switched laser are used for tattoo removal, the treatment of benign pigmented lesions, and a laser skin toning procedure that the Company refers to as PicoGenesis.
 
Hair Removal – We have two platforms, excel HR and xeo, which address hair removal for all skin types as well as hair thicknesses. Our xeo platform allows practitioners to select between the 1064 nm mode for darker, course hair, and the ProWave LX hand piece designed to address finer, vellus hair.  Contact cooling is present on both hand pieces for epidermal protection. excel HR employs both a 1064 nm Nd:YAG as well as a 755 nm Alexandrite for hair removal. Like the xeo, the 1064 nm wavelength addresses darker, course hair while the 755 nm wavelength is used for finer, lighter hair. Both wavelengths are transmitted through the same CoolView hand piece with spot sizes up to 20 mm for the 755 nm wavelength and up to 18 mm for the 1064 nm wavelength. The CoolView hand piece employs sapphire as a means of contact cooling – epidermal protection. Both platforms are cleared for treating all skin types.
 
Vascular Lesions – Both our xeo as well as excel V platforms are capable of treating a wide range of aesthetic vein conditions, including spider and reticular veins, and small facial veins. xeo employs the LimeLight hand piece for addressing small veins as well as vascular lesions while the Nd:YAG is appropriate for deeper, larger vessels. LimeLight is a fixed spot size IPL while the Nd:YAG has adjustable spot sizes up to 10mm. excel V is a dual wavelength laser - 1064 nm and 532 nm – with adjustable spot sizes ranging from 2 mm to 12 mm. The 532 nm wavelength can be used to treat over 20 conditions ranging from small veins and vessels to a variety of vascular lesions while the Nd:YAG is appropriate for deeper, larger vessels. For both of these devices, patients receive on average between one and six treatments, with six weeks or longer between treatments.

Skin Revitalization – Our xeo, excel V, excel HR and enlighten platforms, utilizing an Nd:YAG laser, allow our customers to perform non-invasive and minimally-invasive treatments that reduce redness, dyschromia, fine lines, improve skin texture, and treat other aesthetic conditions. When using a 1064 nm Nd:YAG laser to improve skin texture and treat fine lines, cooling is not applied and the hand piece is held directly above the skin. A large number of pulses are directed at the treatment site, repeatedly covering an area, such as the cheek. By delivering many pulses of laser light to a treatment area, a gentle heating of the dermis occurs and collagen growth is stimulated to rejuvenate the skin and reduce wrinkles. Patients typically receive four to six treatments for this procedure. The treatment typically takes less than a half hour with a spacing of two to four weeks between treatments.
 
Texture, Lines and Wrinkles – The xeo platform can address fine lines and wrinkles using the Pearl and Pearl Fractional hand pieces.  When treating fine lines, texture and wrinkles with a Pearl hand piece, the hand piece is held at a controlled distance from the skin and the scanner delivers a preset pattern of spots to the treatment area. Cooling is not applied to the epidermis during the treatment. The energy delivered by the hand piece ablates a portion of the epidermis while leaving a coagulated portion that will gently peel off over the course of a few days. Heat is also delivered into the dermis, which can result in the production of new collagen. Treatment of the full face can usually be performed in 15 to 30 minutes. Patients receive on average between one and three treatments at monthly intervals.
 
Our recently launched Juliet laser is a versatile multi-application platform utilizing an Er:YAG laser with the 2940 nm wavelength. This Erbium wavelength produces noticeable results with fewer side effects, due to its high peak absorption in water. Additionally, Juliet’s Erbium technology allows for a controlled thermal delivery to tissue. The Microspot hand piece delivers fractionated energy to induce skin resurfacing and improved skin quality, tone and texture. 
 
Additionally, our recently launched Secret RF platform is a Radio Frequency microneedling device that employs fractionated RF energy (2 MHz) delivered at different pre-programmed depths in the dermis to produce new collagen. The Secret RF comes with four treatment tips: a 25-pin tip, both insulated and semi-insulated, and a 64-pin tip, both insulated and semi-insulated. The treatment has minimal side effects, negligible downtime and results in improved skin tone and texture as well as improvement in acne scars.
 
Dyschromia – Our pulsed-light technologies allow our customers to safely and effectively treat red and brown dyschromia (skin discoloration), benign pigmented lesions, and rosacea. The practitioner delivers a narrow spectrum of light to the surface of the skin through our LimeLight hand pieces. These hand pieces include one of our proprietary wavelength filters, which reduce the energy level required for therapeutic effect and minimize the risk of skin injury.
 
The 532 nm wavelength green laser option of the excel V and enlighten systems, as well as the 755 nm infrared wavelength of the excel HR, can be used to treat benign pigmented lesions in substantially the same way.
 
In treating benign pigmented lesions, the hand piece is placed directly on the skin and then the pulse is triggered. The cells forming the pigmented lesion absorb the light energy, darken and then flake off over the course of two to three weeks. Several treatments may be required to completely remove the lesion. The treatment takes a few minutes per area treated and there are typically three to four weeks between treatments.
 
Practitioners can also treat dyschromia and other skin conditions with our Pearl hand piece. During these treatments, the heat delivered by the Pearl hand piece will remove the outer layer of the epidermis while coagulating a portion of the epidermis. That coagulated portion will gently peel off over the course of a few days, revealing a new layer of skin underneath. Treatment of the full face can usually be performed in 15 to 30 minutes. Patients receive on average between one and three treatments at monthly intervals.
 
Skin Quality – Our Titan technology allows our customers to use deep dermal heating to tighten lax skin. The practitioner delivers a spectrum of light to the skin through our Titan hand piece. This hand piece includes our proprietary light source and wavelength filter which tailors the delivered spectrum of light to provide heating at the desired depth in the skin.
 
In treating compromised skin, the hand piece is placed directly on the skin and then the light pulse is triggered. A sustained pulse causes significant heating in the dermis. This heating can cause immediate collagen contraction while also stimulating long-term collagen regrowth. Several treatments may be required to obtain the desired degree of tightening of the skin. The treatment of a full face can take over an hour and there are typically four weeks between treatments.

Our CE Mark allows us to market the Titan in the EU, Australia and certain other countries outside the U.S. for the treatment of wrinkles through skin tightening. However, in the U.S. we have a 510(k) clearance for only deep dermal heating.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
In the U.S. the Company markets and sells its products through a direct sales organization. The Company internally manages its U.S. and Canadian sales organization as one North American sales region. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had 68 territories and a direct sales force of 68 employees. In addition, the Company created a new commercial organization in 2018 dedicated to supporting consumable products for procedures performed in physicians’ practices. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had nine employees related to consumable sales support.
 
International sales are made both through a worldwide distributor network in over 40 countries, as well as a direct international sales force. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had a direct sales force in Australia, Belgium, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, Spain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom with a total of 41 direct sales employees.
 
The Company also sells certain items like hand piece refills, cycle refills, consumable tips and marketing brochures through our web site www.cutera.com.
 
Customers generally demand quality, performance, ease of use, and high productivity in relation to the cost of ownership. The Company responds to these customer demands by introducing new products focused on these requirements in the markets it serves. Specifically, the Company believes it introduces new products and applications that are innovative, address the specific aesthetic procedures in demand, and are upgradeable on its customers’ existing systems. In addition, the Company provides attractive upgrade pricing to new product families. To increase market penetration, the Company also markets to non-core practitioners in addition to our core specialties of plastic surgeons and dermatologists.
 
The Company seeks to establish strong ongoing relationships with its customers through the upgradeability of the Company’s products, sales of extended service contracts, the refilling of hand pieces and replacement of disposable tips, ongoing training and support, and distributing skincare products in Japan. The Company primarily targets its marketing efforts to practitioners through office visits, workshops, trade shows, webinars and trade journals. The Company also markets to potential patients through brochures, workshops and its website. In addition, the Company offers clinical forums with recognized expert panelists to promote advanced treatment techniques using our products to further enhance customer loyalty and uncover new sales opportunities.
 
Competition
 
The industry the Company operates in is subject to intense competition. The Company’s products compete against conventional non-energy-based treatments, such as electrolysis, Botox and collagen injections, chemical peels, microdermabrasion and sclerotherapy. The products also compete against laser and other energy-based products offered by other public companies, such as Hologic (acquired Cynosure in March 2017), El.En S.p.A, XIO Group (acquired Lumenis in September 2015), Allergan (acquired Zeltiq in April 2017), Bausch Health (Valeant), Vieve, as well as private companies, including Sisram, Syneron Candela (acquired in 2017 by an affiliate of private equity funds advised by Apax Partners), Sciton, InMode, BTL Industries and several others.
 
Competition among providers of laser and other energy-based devices for the aesthetic market is characterized by extensive research and development efforts, and innovative technology. While the Company attempts to protect its products through patents and other intellectual property rights, there are few barriers to entry that would prevent new entrants or existing competitors from developing products that would compete directly with ours. There are many companies, both public and private, that are developing innovative devices that use both energy-based and alternative technologies. Some of these competitors have greater resources than the Company does or product applications for certain sub-markets in which the Company does not participate. Additional competitors may enter the market, and the Company is likely to compete with new companies in the future. To compete effectively, the Company has to demonstrate that our products are attractive alternatives to other devices and treatments by differentiating our products on the basis of performance, brand name, service and price. The Company has encountered, and expects to continue to encounter, potential customers who, due to existing relationships with our competitors, are committed to, or prefer, the products offered by these competitors. Competitive pressures may result in price reductions and reduced margins for our products.
 
Research and Development
 
The Company focuses its research and development efforts on innovation and improvement for products and services that align with its mission: the Company consistently strives to understand its customers’ expectations for total excellence. The Company accomplishes this by its commitment to continuous improvement in design, manufacturing and service, which the Company believes provides for superior products and services to ensure on going customer satisfaction, trust and loyalty. The Company seeks to comply with all applicable domestic and international regulations to maintain the highest quality.
 
 12


As of December 31, 2018, the Company’s research and development activities were conducted by a staff of 38 employees with a broad base of experience in lasers, optoelectronics, software, and other related disciplines. The Company develops working relationships with outside contract engineering and design consultants, giving our team additional technical and creative breadth. The Company works closely with thought leaders and customers, to understand unmet needs and emerging applications in aesthetic medicine.
 
Acquisitions, Investments, and Distribution Agreements
 
The Company’s strategy of providing a broad range of therapeutic capabilities requires a wide variety of technologies, products and capabilities. The rapid pace of technological development in the aesthetic device industry and the specialized expertise required in different areas make it difficult for the Company to develop a broad portfolio of technological solutions. In addition to internally generated growth through research and development efforts, the Company has considered, and expects to continue to consider, acquisitions, investments and distribution agreements to provide access to new products and technologies in both new and existing markets.
 
The Company expects to further our strategic objectives and strengthen its existing businesses by making future acquisitions, investments, or entering into new distribution agreements in areas that the Company believes it can acquire or stimulate the development of new technologies and products. Mergers and acquisitions of medical technology companies, as well as distribution relationships are inherently risky and no assurance can be given that any acquisition will be successful or will not materially adversely affect the Company’s consolidated operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.
 
Service and Support
 
The Company’s products are engineered to enable quick and efficient service and support. There are several separate components of our products, each of which can easily be removed and replaced. The Company believes that quick and effective delivery of service is important to its customers. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had 65 people in our global service department. Internationally, the Company provides direct service support in Australia, Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, Spain, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. Services and support outside of these direct markets are made through a worldwide distributor network in over 40 countries.
 
The Company offers post-warranty services to its customers through extended service contracts that cover replacement parts and labor for a term of one, two, or three years. The Company also offers services on a time-and-materials basis for detachable hand piece replacements, parts and labor. Customers are notified before their initial warranty expires and are able to purchase extended service plans covering replacement parts and labor.
 
In countries where the Company is represented by distributor partners, customers are serviced through the distributor. Distributors are generally provided 14 to 16 months warranty coverage for parts only, with labor customarily provided to the end customer by the distributor. The Company’s Titan, truSculpt 3D and truSculpt iD hand pieces generally include a warranty for a set number of shots, instead of for a period of time.
 
Manufacturing
 
The Company manufactures its products with components and subassemblies supplied by vendors, and assembles and tests each of its products at the Brisbane, California facility. Quality control, cost reduction and inventory management are top priorities of the manufacturing operations.
 
The Company purchases certain components, subassemblies and assembled systems from a limited number of suppliers. The Company has flexibility with its suppliers to adjust the number of components and subassemblies as well as the delivery schedules. The forecasts are based on historical demands and sales projections. Lead times for components and subassemblies may vary significantly depending on the size of the order, time required to fabricate and test the components or subassemblies, specific supplier requirements and current market demand for the components and subassemblies. The potential for disruption of supply is reduced by maintaining sufficient inventories and identifying additional suppliers. The time required to qualify new suppliers for some components, or to redesign them, could cause delays in our manufacturing. To date, the Company has not experienced significant delays in obtaining any of its components or subassemblies. The Company uses small quantities of common cleaning products in its manufacturing operations, which are lawfully disposed of through a normal waste management program. The Company does not forecast any material costs due to compliance with environmental laws or regulations.
 
The Company is required to manufacture our products in compliance with the FDA’s Quality System Regulation (“QSR”). The QSR covers the methods and documentation of the design, testing, control, manufacturing, labeling, quality assurance, packaging, storage and shipping of our products. The FDA enforces the QSR through periodic unannounced inspections. The Company had an FDA full quality system audit in March 2017. There were no significant findings or observations as a result of this audit, however our failure to maintain compliance with the QSR requirements could result in the shutdown of our manufacturing operations and the recall of our products, which would have a material adverse effect on our business. In the event that one of our suppliers fails to maintain compliance with specified quality requirements, the Company may have to qualify a new supplier and could experience manufacturing delays as a result. The Company has opted to maintain quality assurance and quality management certifications to enable us to market our products in the U.S., the member states of the EU, the European Free Trade Association and countries which have entered into Mutual Recognition Agreements with the EU. In January 2018, the Company conducted our recertification audit to the requirements of ISO 13485:2003 under the Medical Device Single Audit Program (“MDSAP”) for the 5 regulatory jurisdictions signatory to MDSAP (FDA - US, Health Canada - Canada, Therapeutic Goods Administration (“TGA”) - Australia, Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (“PMDA”) - Japan, and Agência Nacional de Vigilancia Sanitária (“ANVISA”) - Brazil); and for the EU under Europäische Norm (“EN”) International Standards Organization (“ISO”) 13485:2012 and Medical Device Directive (MDD”) 93/42/EEC. The Company passed the recertification audit establishing compliance with ISO 13485:2003 under MDSAP; EN ISO 13458:2012; and MDD 93/42/EEC. The MDSAP and EU certification can be used to establish compliance with Good Manufacturing Practices (“GMP”), QSR, and Quality Management System (“QMS”) requirements for all six regulatory jurisdictions, replacing routine audits from each regulatory jurisdiction. Our manufacturing facility is ISO 13485 certified.

Patents and Proprietary Technology
 
The Company relies on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, and non-disclosure, confidentiality and invention assignment agreements to protect our intellectual property rights. As of February 28, 2019, the Company had 32 issued U.S. patents and 5 pending U.S. patent applications. The Company intends to file for additional patents and trademarks to continue to strengthen our intellectual property rights. Patents typically have a 20-year term from the application filing date. There can be no assurance that pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents, that patents issued to or licensed by the Company will not be challenged or circumvented by competitors, or that these patents will be found to be valid or sufficiently broad to protect our technology or to provide the Company with a competitive advantage.
 
The Company has also obtained certain trademarks and trade names for our products and maintain certain details about our processes, products and strategies as trade secrets. In the U.S. and several foreign countries, the Company registers its Company name and several of its product names as trademarks, including Cutera, AcuTip, CoolGlide, CoolGlide excel, excel, enlighten, Juliet, LimeLight, myQ, Pearl, ProWave 770 , ProWave LX, Secret RF, Solera (discontinued as of January 2018), Titan, truSculpt and xeo. The Company may have common law rights in other product names, including excel V, Pearl Fractional, Solera, Titan and excel HR. The Company intends to file for additional patents and trademarks to continue to strengthen our intellectual property rights.
 
The Company relies on non-disclosure and non-competition agreements with employees, technical consultants and other parties to protect, in part, trade secrets and other proprietary technology. The Company also requires them to agree to disclose and assign to us all inventions conceived in connection with the relationship. There can be no assurance that these agreements will not be breached, that the Company will have adequate remedies for any breach, that others will not independently develop equivalent proprietary information or that third parties will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets and proprietary knowledge.
 
For additional information, please refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, under the section entitled “Risk Factors - Intellectual property rights may not provide adequate protection for some or all of our products, which may permit third parties to compete against us more effectively, and we may be involved in future costly intellectual property litigation, which could impact our future business and financial performance.”
 
Government Regulation
 
United States
 
The Company’s products are medical devices subject to regulation by numerous government agencies, including the FDA and counterpart agencies outside the U.S. To varying degrees, each of these agencies require us to comply with laws and regulations governing the research, development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, pre-market clearance or approval, marketing, distribution, advertising, promotion, record keeping, reporting, tracking, and importing and exporting of medical devices. In the U.S., FDA regulations govern the following activities that the Company performs and will continue to perform to ensure that medical products distributed domestically or exported internationally are safe and effective for their intended uses:
 
● product design and development;
 ● product testing;
 ● product manufacturing;
 ● product safety;
 ● product labeling;
 ● product storage;
 ● record keeping;
 ● pre-market clearance or approval;
 ● advertising and promotion;
 ● production;
 ● product sales and distribution; and
 ● complaint handling.

FDA’s Pre-market Clearance and Approval Requirements
 
Unless an exemption applies, each medical device the Company wishes to commercially distribute in the U.S. will require either prior 510(k) clearance, de novo or pre-market approval from the FDA. The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes. Devices deemed to pose lower risks are placed in either class I or II, which requires the manufacturer to submit to the FDA a pre-market notification requesting permission to commercially distribute the device. This process is generally known as 510(k) clearance. Some low risk devices are exempted from this requirement. Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices, or devices deemed not substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510(k) device, are placed in class III, requiring more rigorous pre-market approval. All of our current products are class II devices.
510(k) Clearance Pathway
 
When 510(k) clearance is required, the Company must submit a pre-market notification demonstrating that our proposed device is substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510(k) device or a device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976 for which the FDA has not yet called for the submission of Pre-Market Approval, or "PMA", applications. By regulation, the FDA is required to clear or deny 510(k), pre-market notification within 90 days of submission of the application. As a practical matter, clearance often takes significantly longer. The FDA may require further information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence. Laser devices used for aesthetic procedures, such as hair removal, have generally qualified for clearance under 510(k) procedures.
 
The following table details the indications for which the Company received a 510(k) clearance for our products and when these clearances were received.

Pre-Market Approval (“PMA”) Pathway
 
A PMA must be submitted to the FDA if the device cannot be cleared through the 510(k) process. A PMA must be supported by extensive data, including but not limited to, technical, preclinical, clinical trials, manufacturing and labeling to demonstrate to the FDA’s satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the device. No device that the Company developed to date requires pre-market approval, although development of future devices or clearances may require pre-market approval.
 
Product Modifications
 
Pursuant to FDA regulations, after a device receives 510(k) clearance or a PMA, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, requires a new clearance or approval. The FDA requires manufacturers to make this determination initially, but the FDA can review any such decision and may disagree with a manufacturer’s determination. To date, the Company has modified aspects of our products after receiving regulatory clearance, and determined that new 510(k) clearances are not required for these modifications. If the FDA disagrees with our determination not to seek a new 510(k) clearance or PMA, the FDA may retroactively require the Company to seek 510(k) clearance or pre-market approval. The FDA could also require the Company to cease marketing and distribution and/or recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or pre-market approval is obtained. Also, in these circumstances, the Company may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties.
Clinical Trials
 
When FDA approval of a class I, class II or class III device requires human clinical trials, and if the device presents a “significant risk,” as defined by the FDA, to human health, the device sponsor is required to file an Investigational Device Exemption, or IDE, application with the FDA and obtain IDE approval prior to commencing the human clinical trial. If the device is considered a “non-significant” risk, IDE submission to the FDA is not required. Instead, only approval from the Institutional Review Board (“IRB”), overseeing the clinical trial is required. Human clinical studies are generally required in connection with approval of class III devices and may be required for class I and II devices. The IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory testing results, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. The IDE must be approved in advance by the FDA for a specified number of patients. Clinical trials for a significant risk device may begin once the application is reviewed and cleared by the FDA and the appropriate institutional review boards at the clinical trial sites. Future clinical trials of our products may require that the Company submits and obtains clearance of an IDE from the FDA prior to commencing clinical trials. The FDA, and the IRB at each institution at which a clinical trial is being performed, may suspend a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk.
Pervasive and Continuing Regulation
 
After a device is placed on the market, numerous regulatory requirements apply. These include:
 
● Quality system regulations, which require manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the manufacturing process;
 ● Labeling regulations and FDA prohibitions against the promotion of products for un-cleared, unapproved or “off-label” uses;
 ● Medical device reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur; and
 ● Post-market surveillance regulations, which apply when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device.
 
 16


The FDA has broad post-market and regulatory enforcement powers. The Company is subject to unannounced inspections by the FDA and the Food and Drug Branch of the California Department of Health Services (or “CDHS”), to determine our compliance with the QSR and other regulations, and these inspections may include the manufacturing facilities of our subcontractors. In the past, our prior facility has been inspected, and observations were noted. There were no findings that involved a material violation of regulatory requirements. Our responses to these observations have been accepted by the FDA and CDHS, and the Company believes that it is in substantial compliance with the QSR. Our current manufacturing facility has been inspected by the FDA and the CDHS. The FDA and the CDHS noted observations, but there were no findings that involved a material violation of regulatory requirements. Our responses to those observations have been accepted by the FDA and CDHS.
 
The Company is also regulated under the Radiation Control for Health and Safety Act, which requires laser products to comply with performance standards, including design and operation requirements, and manufacturers to certify in product labeling and in reports to the FDA that their products comply with all such standards. The law also requires laser manufacturers to file new product and annual reports, maintain manufacturing, testing and sales records, and report product defects. Various warning labels must be affixed and certain protective devices installed, depending on the class of the product.
 
Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA, which may include any of the following sanctions:
 
● Warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties;
 ● Repair, replacement, recall or seizure of our products;
 ● Operating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production;
 ● Refusing our requests for 510(k) clearance or pre-market approval of new products, new intended uses, or modifications to existing products;
 ● Withdrawing 510(k) clearance or pre-market approvals that have already been granted; and
 ● Criminal prosecution and penalties.
 
The FDA also has the authority to require the Company to repair, replace or refund the cost of any medical device that it has manufactured or distributed. If any of these events were to occur, they could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business.
 
The Company is also subject to a wide range of federal, state and local laws and regulations, including those related to the environment, health and safety, land use and quality assurance. The Company believes that compliance with these laws and regulations as currently in effect will not have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, earnings and competitive and financial position.
 
International
 
International sales of medical devices are subject to foreign governmental regulations, which vary substantially from country to country. The time required to obtain clearance or approval by a foreign country may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA clearance or approval, and the clearance or approval requirements may be different from those in the U.S.
 
In Japan, the Company is actively seeking approvals for products to supplement our existing approvals for enlighten, excel V, excel HR, LimeLight, ProWave, Solera, Titan, truSculpt iD and xeo.
 
In the European Economic Area, or EEA, (which is composed of the 28 Member States of the EU plus Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland), a single regulatory approval process exists, and conformity with the legal requirements is represented by the CE mark. While it remains somewhat unresolved, the cabinet of the United Kingdom agrees that the UK should maintain conformity with the CE mark process following Brexit. Other countries, such as Switzerland, have entered into Mutual Recognition Agreements and allow the marketing of medical devices that meet EU requirements. The EU has adopted numerous directives and European Standardization Committees have promulgated voluntary standards regulating the design, manufacture, clinical trials, labeling and adverse event reporting for medical devices. Devices that comply with the requirements of a relevant directive will be entitled to bear CE conformity marking, indicating that the device conforms to the essential requirements of the applicable directives and, accordingly, can be commercially distributed throughout the EEA and countries which have entered into a Mutual Recognition Agreement. The method of assessing conformity varies depending on the type and class of the product, but normally involves a combination of self-assessment by the manufacturer and a third-party assessment by a Notified Body, an independent and neutral institution appointed by a country to conduct the conformity assessment. This third-party assessment may consist of an audit of the manufacturer’s quality system and specific testing of the manufacturer’s device. An assessment by a Notified Body in one member state of the EEA, or one country which has entered into a Mutual Recognition Agreement is required in order for a manufacturer to commercially distribute the product throughout these countries. ISO 9001 and ISO 13845 certification are voluntary harmonized standards. Compliance establishes the presumption of conformity with the essential requirements for a CE Marking. In February 2000, our facility was awarded the ISO 9001 and EN 46001 certification. In March 2003, the Company received our ISO 9001 updated certification (ISO 9001:2000) as well as our certification for ISO 13485:1996 which replaced our EN 46001 certification. In March 2004, the Company received our ISO 13485:2003 certification and in March 2006, March 2009, and January 2012 we passed ISO 13485 recertification audits. In January 2015, the Company passed a recertification audit establishing compliance with the requirements of EN ISO 13485:2012, CAN/CSA ISO 13485:2003, and MDD 93/42/EEC. In January 2018, the Company conducted our recertification audit to the requirements of ISO 13485:2003 under the Medical Device Single Audit Program (MDSAP) for the 5 regulatory jurisdictions signatory to MDSAP (FDA - US, Health Canada - Canada, TGA - Australia, PMDA - Japan, and ANVISA - Brazil); and for the EU under EN ISO 13485:2012 and MDD 93/42/EEC. The Company passed the recertification audit establishing compliance with ISO 13485:2003 under MDSAP; EN ISO 13458:2012; and MDD 93/42/EEC. In January 2019, the Company passed the upgrade audit establishing compliance with ISO 13485:2016 and the surveillance audit under MDSAP. The MDSAP and EU certification can be used to establish compliance with GMP/QSR/QMS requirements for all six regulatory jurisdictions, replacing routine audits from each regulatory jurisdiction. For cause audits can still occur.

Applicability of Anti-Corruption Laws and Regulations
 
The Company’s worldwide business is subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (the “FCPA”), the United Kingdom Bribery Act of 2010 (the “UK Bribery Act”) and other anti-corruption laws and regulations applicable in the jurisdictions where the Company operates. The FCPA can be used to prosecute companies in the U.S. for arrangements with physicians, or other parties outside the U.S., if the physician or party is a government official of another country and the arrangement violates the law of that country. The UK Bribery Act prohibits both domestic and international bribery, as well as bribery across both public and private sectors. There are similar laws and regulations applicable to Cutera outside the U.S., all of which are subject to evolving interpretations. For additional information, please refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, under the sections entitled “Risk Factors – the Company’s failure to comply with rules relating to bribery, foreign corrupt practices, and privacy and security laws may subject the Company to penalties and adversely impact our reputation and business operations.”
 
Patient Privacy and Security Laws
 
Various laws worldwide protect the confidentiality of certain patient health and other consumer information, including patient medical records, and restrict the use and disclosure of patient health information by healthcare providers. Privacy standards in Europe and Asia are becoming increasingly strict, enforcement action and financial penalties related to privacy in the EU are growing, and new laws and restrictions are being passed. The management of cross-border transfers of information among and outside of EU member countries is becoming more complex, which may complicate our clinical research and commercial activities, as well as product offerings that involve transmission or use of data. The Company will continue its efforts to comply with those requirements and to adapt our business processes to those standards.
 
In the U.S., the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), as amended by the Health Information Technology and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”) and their respective implementing regulations, including the final omnibus rule published on January 25, 2013, imposes specified requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to “business associates,” defined as independent contractors or agents of covered entities that create, receive, maintain or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys new general authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways, thus complicating compliance efforts. The Company potentially operates as a business associate to covered entities in a limited number of instances. In those cases, the patient data that the Company receives may include protected health information, as defined under HIPAA. Enforcement actions can be costly and interrupt regular operations of its business. While the Company has not been named in any such actions, if a substantial breach or loss of data from our records were to occur, the Company could become a target of such litigation.
 
In the EU, Regulation 2016/679 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (“General Data Protection Regulation” or “GDPR”) came into effect on May 25, 2018. The GDPR replaces Directive 95/46/EC (“Data Protection Directive”). While many of the principles of the GDPR reflect those of the Data Protection Directive, for example in relation to the requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information, there are a number of changes. In particular: (1) pro-active compliance measures are introduced, such as the requirement to carry out a Privacy Impact Assessment and to appoint a Data Protection Officer where health data is processed on a “large scale;” and (2) the administrative fines that can be levied are significantly increased, the maximum being the higher of €20 million, or 4%, of the total worldwide annual turnover of the group in the previous financial year. While we believe we are compliant with GDPR, the recent implementation of regulation, coupled with the early limited enforcement action make it difficult to assess.
 
Environmental Health and Safety Laws
 
The Company is also subject to various environmental health and safety laws and regulations worldwide. Like other medical device companies, our manufacturing and other operations involve the use and transportation of substances regulated under environmental health and safety laws including those related to the transportation of hazardous materials. To the best of our knowledge at this time, the Company does not expect that compliance with environmental protection laws will have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

Employees
 
As of December 31, 2018, the Company had 402 employees, compared to 367 employees as of December 31, 2017. Of the 402 employees at December 31, 2018, 161 were in sales and marketing, 89 in manufacturing operations, 77 in technical service, 38 in research and development and 37 in general and administrative. The Company believes that its future success will depend in part on our continued ability to attract, hire and retain qualified personnel. None of our employees are represented by a labor union, and the Company believes its employee relations are good.
