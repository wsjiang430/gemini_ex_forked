Organization Structure and Description of Services
WAL is a bank holding company headquartered in Phoenix, Arizona, incorporated under the laws of the state of Delaware. WAL provides a full spectrum of deposit, lending, treasury management, international banking, and online banking products and services through its wholly-owned banking subsidiary, WAB.
WAB operates the following full-service banking divisions: ABA, BON, Bridge, FIB, and TPB. The Company also serves business customers through a national platform of specialized financial services. In addition, the Company has two non-bank subsidiaries, LVSP, which holds and manages certain OREO properties and a captive insurance company formed and licensed under the laws of the State of Arizona, CSI. CSI was established as part of the Company's overall enterprise risk management strategy. 
WAL also has eight unconsolidated subsidiaries used as business trusts in connection with issuance of trust-preferred securities as described in "Note 9. Qualifying Debt" in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
Bank Subsidiary
At December 31, 2018, WAL has the following bank subsidiary: 

Bank Name | Headquarters | | Number ofLocations | Location Cities | TotalAssets | | NetLoans | Deposits
 | | | | | (in millions)
Western Alliance Bank | Phoenix, Arizona | | 47 | Arizona: Chandler, Flagstaff, Gilbert, Mesa, Phoenix, Scottsdale, and Tucson | $ | 23,138.4 | | $ | 17,557.9 | $ | 19,496.3
Nevada: Carson City, Fallon, Reno, Sparks, Henderson, Las Vegas, Mesquite, and North Las Vegas 
California: Beverly Hills, Carlsbad, Costa Mesa, La Mesa, Los Angeles, Menlo Park, Oakland, Palo Alto, Pleasanton, San Diego, San Francisco, and San Jose
 | | Other: Atlanta, Georgia; Boston, Massachusetts; and Reston, Virginia | | 

WAB also has the following significant wholly-owned subsidiaries: 

• | Western Alliance Business Trust holds certain investment securities, municipal and non-profit loans, and leases.


• | WA PWI, LLC holds certain limited partnerships invested primarily in low income housing tax credits and small business investment corporations.


• | BW Real Estate, Inc. operates as a real estate investment trust and holds certain real estate loans and related securities.


• | Helios Prime, Inc. holds certain equity interests in solar tax credit transactions.

Market Segments
The Company’s reportable segments are aggregated based primarily on geographic location, services offered, and markets served. The Company's regional segments, which include Arizona, Nevada, Southern California, and Northern California, provide full service banking and related services to their respective markets. The Company's NBL segments provide specialized banking services to niche markets. These NBLs are managed centrally and are broader in geographic scope than the Company's other segments, though still predominately within the Company's core market areas. The Corporate & Other segment consists of the Company's investment portfolio, corporate borrowings and other related items, income and expense items not allocated to other reportable segments, and inter-segment eliminations. 
The accounting policies of the reported segments are the same as those of the Company as described in "Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" in Item 8. All intercompany transactions are eliminated for reporting consolidated results of operations. Loan and deposit accounts are assigned directly to the segments where these products are originated and/or serviced. Equity capital is assigned to each segment based on the risk profile of their assets and liabilities with a funds credit provided for the use of this equity as a funding source. Any excess equity not allocated to segments based on risk is assigned to the Corporate & Other segment. 
5

Net interest income, provision for credit losses, and non-interest expense amounts are recorded in their respective segments to the extent that the amounts are directly attributable to those segments. Net interest income of a reportable segment includes a funds transfer pricing process that matches assets and liabilities with similar interest rate sensitivity and maturity characteristics. Using this funds transfer pricing methodology, liquidity is transferred between users and providers. Net income amounts for each reportable segment are further derived by the use of expense allocations. Certain expenses not directly attributable to a specific segment are allocated across all segments based on key metrics, such as number of employees, average loan balances, and average deposit balances. Income taxes are applied to each segment based on the effective tax rate for the geographic location of the segment. Any difference in the corporate tax rate and the aggregate effective tax rates in the segments are adjusted in the Corporate & Other segment. 
Lending Activities
General
Through WAB and its banking divisions and operating subsidiaries, the Company provides a variety of financial services to customers, including CRE loans, construction and land development loans, commercial loans, and consumer loans. The Company’s lending has focused primarily on meeting the needs of business customers.
Commercial and Industrial: Commercial and industrial loans include working capital lines of credit, inventory and accounts receivable lines, mortgage warehouse lines, equipment loans and leases, and other commercial loans. Loans to technology companies, tax-exempt municipalities, and not-for-profit organizations are also categorized as commercial and industrial loans. 
CRE: Loans to fund the purchase or refinancing of CRE for investors (non-owner occupied) or owner-occupants a significant portion of the Company's loan portfolio. These CRE loans are secured by multi-family residential properties, professional offices, industrial facilities, retail centers, hotels, and other commercial properties. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, 36% of the Company's CRE loans were owner occupied. Owner occupied CRE loans are loans secured by owner occupied non-farm nonresidential properties for which the primary source of repayment (more than 50%) is the cash flow from the ongoing operations and activities conducted by the borrower who owns the property. Non-owner occupied CRE loans are CRE loans for which the primary source of repayment is rental income generated from the collateral property.
Construction and Land Development: Construction and land development loans include single family and multi-family residential projects, industrial/warehouse properties, office buildings, retail centers, medical office facilities, and residential lot developments. These loans are primarily originated to experienced local developers with whom the Company has a satisfactory lending history. An analysis of each construction project is performed as part of the underwriting process to determine whether the type of property, location, construction costs, and contingency funds are appropriate and adequate. Loans to finance commercial raw land are primarily to borrowers who plan to initiate active development of the property within two years.
Residential: The Company purchases residential mortgage loans originated by unaffiliated third parties, including related servicing rights and responsibilities. 
Consumer: Limited types of consumer loans are offered to meet customer demand and to respond to community needs. Examples of these consumer loans include: home equity loans and lines of credit, home improvement loans, personal lines of credit, and loans to individuals for investment purposes.

For additional information concerning loans, see "Note 3. Loans, Leases and Allowance for Credit Losses" of the Consolidated Financial Statements contained herein or "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Financial Condition – Loans discussions" in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
The Company adheres to a specific set of credit standards within its banking subsidiary that are intended to ensure the proper management of credit risk. Furthermore, the Bank's senior management team plays an active role in monitoring compliance with such standards.
Loan originations are subject to a process that includes the credit evaluation of borrowers, utilizing established lending limits, analysis of collateral, and procedures for continual monitoring and identification of credit deterioration. Loan officers actively monitor their individual credit relationships in order to report suspected risks and potential downgrades as early as possible. The BOD approves all material changes to loan policy, as well as lending limit authorities. The Bank's lending policies generally incorporate consistent underwriting standards across all geographic regions in which the Bank operates, customized as necessary to conform to state law and local market conditions. The Bank's credit culture emphasizes timely identification of troubled credits to allow management to take prompt corrective action, when necessary.
Loan Approval Procedures and Authority
The Company's loan approval procedures are executed through a tiered loan limit authorization process, which is structured as follows:

• | Individual Credit Authorities. The credit approval levels for individual divisional and senior credit officers are set by policy and certain credit administration officers' approval authorities are established on a delegated basis.


• | Management Loan Committees. Credits in excess of individual divisional or senior credit officer approval authority are submitted to the appropriate divisional or NBL loan committee. The divisional committees consist of members of the Bank's senior management team of each division and the NBL loan committees consist of the Bank's divisional or senior credit officers. These loan committees have approval authority up to $10.0 million.


• | Credit Administration. Credits in excess of $10.0 million but less than $15.0 million require the additional approval of the Bank's CCO. Credits in excess of $15.0 million are submitted to the WAB SLC. The SLC reviews all other loan approvals to any one new borrower of $5.0 million or greater. The SLC is chaired by the WAB CCO and includes the Company’s CEO.

Loans to One Borrower. In addition to the limits set forth above, subject to certain exceptions, state banking laws generally limit the amount of funds that a bank may lend to a single borrower. Under Arizona law, the obligations of one borrower to a bank generally may not exceed 20% of the bank’s capital, plus an additional 10% of its capital if the additional amounts are fully secured by readily marketable collateral. Arizona law does not specifically require aggregation of loans to affiliated entities in determining compliance with the lending limit. As a matter of longstanding practice, the Arizona Department of Financial Institutions uses the same aggregation analysis as applied to national banks by the OCC. 
7

Concentrations of Credit Risk. The Company's lending policies also establish customer and product concentration limits, which are based on commitment amounts, to control single customer and product exposures. The Company's lending policies have several different measures to limit concentration exposures. Set forth below are the primary segmentation limits and actual measures as of December 31, 2018:

 | Percent of Total Capital
 | Policy Limit | | Actual
CRE | 435 | % | | 226 | %
Commercial and industrial | 400 | | | 268 | 
Construction and land development | 85 | | | 74 | 
Residential real estate | 100 | | | 42 | 
Consumer | 5 | | | 2 | 

Asset Quality
General
To measure asset quality, the Company has instituted a loan grading system consisting of nine different categories. The first five are considered satisfactory "pass" ratings. The other four "non-pass" grades range from a “Special mention” category to a “Loss” category and are consistent with the grading systems used by federal banking regulators. All loans are assigned a credit risk grade at the time they are made, and each assigned loan officer reviews the credit with his or her immediate supervisor on a quarterly basis to determine whether a change in the credit risk grade is warranted. In addition, the grading of the Company's loan portfolio is reviewed on a regular basis by its internal Loan Review Department.
Collection Procedure
If a borrower fails to make a scheduled payment on a loan, Bank personnel attempt to remedy the deficiency by contacting the borrower and seeking payment. Contacts generally are made within 15 business days after the payment becomes past due. The Bank maintains regional Special Assets Departments, which generally service and collect loans rated Substandard or worse. Each division is responsible for monitoring activity that may indicate an increased risk rating, including, but not limited to, past-dues, overdrafts, and loan agreement covenant defaults. Loans deemed uncollectible are proposed for charge-off.
Nonperforming Assets
Nonperforming assets include loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest, non-accrual loans, TDR loans, and repossessed assets, including OREO. In general, loans are placed on non-accrual status when the Company determines that ultimate collection of principal and interest is in doubt due to the borrower’s financial condition, collateral value, and collection efforts. A TDR loan is a loan on which the Company, for reasons related to a borrower’s financial difficulties, grants a concession to the borrower that the Company would not otherwise consider. Other repossessed assets result from loans where the Company has received title or physical possession of the borrower’s assets. The Company generally re-appraises OREO and collateral dependent impaired loans every twelve months. The total net realized and unrealized gains and losses of repossessed and other assets was not significant during each of the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016. However, losses may be experienced in future periods.
Criticized Assets
Federal bank regulators require banks to classify its assets on a regular basis. In addition, in connection with their examinations of the Bank, examiners have authority to identify problem assets and, if appropriate, re-classify them. A loan grade of "Special Mention" from the Company's internal loan grading system is utilized to identify potential problem assets and loan grades of "Substandard," "Doubtful," and "Loss" are utilized to identify actual problem assets.
8

The following describes the potential and actual problem assets using the Company's internal loan grading system definitions:

• | "Special Mention" (Grade 6): Generally these are assets that possess potential weaknesses that warrant management's close attention. These loans may involve borrowers with adverse financial trends, higher debt to equity ratios, or weaker liquidity positions, but not to the degree of being considered a “problem loan” where risk of loss may be apparent. Loans in this category are usually performing as agreed, although there may be non-compliance with financial covenants.


• | “Substandard” (Grade 7): These assets are characterized by well-defined credit weaknesses and carry the distinct possibility that the Company will sustain some loss if such weakness or deficiency is not corrected. All loans 90 days or more past due and all loans on non-accrual status are considered at least "Substandard," unless extraordinary circumstances would suggest otherwise.


• | “Doubtful” (Grade 8): These assets have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as "Substandard" with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions and values, highly questionable and improbable, but because of certain known factors which may work to the advantage and strengthening of the asset (for example, capital injection, perfecting liens on additional collateral and refinancing plans), classification as an estimated loss is deferred until a more precise status may be determined.


• | “Loss” (Grade 9): These assets are considered uncollectible and having such little recoverable value that it is not practical to defer writing off the asset. This classification does not mean that the loan has absolutely no recovery or salvage value, but rather that it is not practicable or desirable to defer writing off the asset, even though partial recovery may be achieved in the future.

Allowance for Credit Losses
The Company must maintain an adequate allowance for credit losses. The allowance for credit losses is established through a provision for credit losses and is reflected as a reduction in earnings. Loans are charged against the allowance for credit losses when management believes that collectability of the contractual principal or interest is unlikely. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. The allowance is reported at an amount believed adequate to absorb probable losses on existing loans that may become uncollectable, based on evaluation of the collectability of loans and prior credit loss experience, together with other factors. For a detailed discussion of the Company’s methodology see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis and Financial Condition – Critical Accounting Policies – Allowance for Credit Losses” in Item 7 of this Form 10-K.
Investment Activities
The Company has an investment policy, which was approved by the BOD. This policy dictates that investment decisions be made based on the safety of the investment, liquidity requirements of the Bank and holding company, potential returns, cash flow targets, and consistency with the Company's interest rate risk management. The Bank’s ALCO is responsible for making securities portfolio decisions in accordance with established policies. The CFO and Treasurer have the authority to purchase and sell securities within specified guidelines. All investment transactions for the Bank and for the holding company were reviewed by the ALCO and BOD. 
Generally, the Company's investment policy limits new securities investments to the following: securities backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, including U.S. treasury bills, notes, and bonds, direct obligations of Ginnie Mae, USDA and SBA loans; MBS or CMO issued by a GSE, such as Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac; debt securities issued by a GSE, such as Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the FHLB; tax-exempt securities with a rating of “Single-A” or higher; preferred stock where the issuing company is rated “BBB” or higher; corporate debt with a rating of “Single-A” or better; investment grade corporate bond mutual funds; private label collateralized mortgage obligations with a single rating of “AA” or higher; commercial mortgage-backed securities with a rating of “AAA;” low income housing development bonds; and mandatory purchases of equity securities of the FRB and FHLB. 
9

Investment securities are further subject to the following quantitative limits of the Bank: 

Securities Category | Basis Limit | Percentage or Dollar Limit 
Preferred stock | Common equity tier 1 | 10.0 | %
Tax-exempt municipal securities | Total assets | 5.0 | %
Tax-exempt low income housing development bonds | Total capital | 30.0 | %
Investment grade corporate bond mutual funds | Tier 1 capital | 5.0 | %
Corporate debt holdings | Total assets | 2.5 | %
Commercial mortgage-backed securities | Aggregate purchases | $50.0 million | 

The Company no longer purchases (although it may continue to hold previously acquired) CDOs. The Company's policies also govern the use of derivatives, and provide that the Company prudently use derivatives in accordance with applicable regulations as a risk management tool to reduce the overall exposure to interest rate risk, and not for speculative purposes.
As of December 31, 2018, the Company's investment securities portfolio includes debt and equity securities. Debt securities are classified as AFS or HTM pursuant to ASC Topic 320, Investments and ASC Topic 825, Financial Instruments. Equity securities are reported at fair value in accordance with Topic 321, Equity Securities. For further discussion of significant accounting policies related to the Company's investment securities portfolio refer to "Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
As of December 31, 2018, the Company's investment securities portfolio totals $3.69 billion, representing approximately 16.0% of the Company's total assets, with the majority of the portfolio invested in AAA/AA+ rated securities. The average duration of the Company's investment securities is 5.03 years as of December 31, 2018.
The following table summarizes the carrying value of investment securities as of December 31, 2018 and 2017:

As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company had investments in BOLI of $170.1 million and $167.8 million, respectively. BOLI is used to help offset employee benefit costs. For additional information concerning investments, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Financial Condition – Investments” in Item 7 of this Form 10-K. 
Deposit Products
The Company offers a variety of deposit products, including checking accounts, savings accounts, money market accounts, and other types of deposit accounts, including fixed-rate, fixed maturity certificates of deposit. The Company has historically focused on growing its lower cost core customer deposits. As of December 31, 2018, the deposit portfolio was comprised of 39% non-interest-bearing deposits and 61% interest-bearing deposits.
10

The competition for deposits in the Company's markets is strong. The Company has historically been successful in attracting and retaining deposits due to several factors, including its:

• | knowledgeable and empowered bankers committed to providing personalized and responsive service that translates into long-lasting relationships;


• | broad selection of cash management services offered; and


• | incentives to employees for business development and retention.

Deposit balances are generally influenced by national and local economic conditions, changes in prevailing interest rates, internal pricing decisions, perceived stability of financial institutions and competition. In order to attract and retain deposits, the Company relies on providing quality service and introducing new products and services that meet the needs of its customers.
The Bank's deposit rates are determined through an internal oversight process under the direction of its ALCO. The Bank considers a number of factors when determining deposit rates, including:

• | current and projected national and local economic conditions and the outlook for interest rates;


• | local competition;


• | loan and deposit positions and forecasts, including any concentrations in either; and


• | rates charged on FHLB advances and other funding sources.

The following table shows the Company's deposit composition: 

 | December 31, 
 | 2018 | | 2017 
 | Amount | | Percent | | Amount | | Percent 
 | (in thousands)
Non-interest-bearing demand deposits | $ | 7,456,141 | | | 38.9 | % | | $ | 7,433,962 | | 43.9 | %
Interest-bearing transaction accounts | 2,555,609 | | | 13.3 | | | 1,586,209 | | | 9.3 
Savings and money market accounts | 7,330,709 | | | 38.2 | | | 6,330,977 | | | 37.3
Time certificates of deposit ($250,000 or more) | 1,009,900 | | | 5.3 | | | 713,654 | | | 4.2 
Other time deposits | 825,088 | | | 4.3 | | | 907,730 | | | 5.3 
Total deposits | $ | 19,177,447 | | | 100.0 | % | | $ | 16,972,532 | | 100.0 | %

Although the Company does not pay interest to depositors of non-interest-bearing accounts, earnings credits are awarded to some account holders, which offset charges incurred by account holders for other services. Earnings credits earned in excess of charges incurred by account holders are recorded in deposit costs as part of non-interest expense and fluctuate as a result of deposit balances eligible for earnings credits, along with the earnings credit rates on these deposit balances. 
In addition to the Company's deposit base, it has access to other sources of funding, including FHLB and FRB advances, Federal funds purchased, repurchase agreements, and unsecured lines of credit with other financial institutions. Previously, the Company has also accessed the capital markets through trust preferred, subordinated debt, and Senior Note offerings. For additional information concerning the Company's deposits, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Balance Sheet Analysis – Deposits” in Item 7 of this Form 10-K. 
Other Financial Products and Services
In addition to traditional commercial banking activities, the Company offers other financial services to its customers, including: internet banking, wire transfers, electronic bill payment and presentment, lock box services, courier, and cash management services.
Customer, Product, and Geographic Concentrations
Approximately 49% and 52% of the Company's loan portfolio at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, was represented by CRE and construction and land development loans. The Company’s business is concentrated primarily in the Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Phoenix, Reno, San Francisco, San Jose, San Diego and Tucson metropolitan areas. Consequently, the Company is dependent on the trends of these regional economies. 
11

The Company's lending activities, including those within its NBLs, are driven in large part by the customers served in the market areas where the Company has offices in the states of Arizona, Nevada, and California. The following table presents a breakout of the in-footprint and out-of-footprint distribution of loans: 

 | December 31, 2018 | | December 31, 2017
 | In-Footprint | | Out-of-Footprint | | Total | In-Footprint | | Out-of-Footprint | | Total
Arizona | 18.1 | % | | 2.5 | % | 20.6 | % | | 19.8 | % | 2.2 | % | 22.0 | %
Nevada | 11.1 | | | 0.2 | | 11.3 | | | 12.1 | | 0.1 | | 12.2 | 
Southern California | 12.2 | | | — | | 12.2 | | | 12.7 | | 0.1 | | 12.8 | 
Northern California | 6.8 | | | 0.5 | | 7.3 | | | 7.8 | | 0.6 | | 8.4 | 
HOA Services | 0.3 | | | 0.9 | | 1.2 | | | 0.2 | | 0.9 | | 1.1 | 
Hotel Franchise Finance | 1.5 | | | 6.9 | | 8.4 | | | 0.8 | | 8.0 | | 8.8 | 
Public & Nonprofit Finance | 7.8 | | | 1.0 | | 8.8 | | | 9.5 | | 1.0 | | 10.5 | 
Technology & Innovation | 2.4 | | | 4.4 | | 6.8 | | | 2.7 | | 4.6 | | 7.3 | 
Other NBLs | 10.3 | | | 13.1 | | 23.4 | | | 6.2 | | 10.7 | | 16.9 | 
Total | 70.5 | % | | 29.5 | % | 100.0 | % | | 71.8 | % | 28.2 | % | 100.0 | %

The Company is not dependent upon any single or limited number of customers, the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on the Company. Neither the Company nor any of its reportable segments have customer relationships that individually account for 10% or more of consolidated or segment revenues. No material portion of the Company’s business is seasonal.
Competition
The financial services industry is highly competitive. Many of the Company's competitors are much larger in total assets and capitalization, have greater access to capital markets, and offer a broader range of financial services than the Company can offer, and may have lower cost structures.
This increasingly competitive environment is primarily a result of long-term changes in regulation that made mergers and geographic expansion easier; changes in technology and product delivery systems and web-based tools; and the accelerating pace of consolidation among financial services providers. The Company competes for loans, deposits, and customers with other banks, credit unions, brokerage companies, mortgage companies, insurance companies, finance companies, financial technology firms, and other non-bank financial services providers. This strong competition for deposit and loan products directly affects the interest rates on those products and the terms on which they are offered to customers.
Technological innovation continues to contribute to greater competition in domestic and international financial services markets.
Mergers between financial institutions have placed additional pressure on banks to consolidate their operations, reduce expenses, and increase revenues to remain competitive. The competitive environment is also significantly impacted by federal and state legislation that makes it easier for non-bank financial institutions to compete with the Company.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, the Company has 1,787 full-time equivalent employees. The Company’s employees are not represented by a union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. Management believes that its employee relations are good.
Supervision and Regulation
The Company and its subsidiaries are extensively regulated and supervised under both federal and state laws. A summary description of the laws and regulations which relate to the Company’s operations are discussed in Item 7 of this Form 10-K.
