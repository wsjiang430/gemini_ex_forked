ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
Our Company 
 Radiant Logistics, Inc. (the “Company”, “we” or “us”), operates as a third-party logistics company, providing multi-modal transportation and logistics services primarily to customers based in the United States and Canada. We service a large and diversified account base which we support from an extensive network of locations across North America as well as an integrated international service partner network located in other key markets around the globe. We provide these services through a multi-brand network which includes over 100 locations operated exclusively on our behalf by independent agents, who we also refer to as our “strategic operating partners”, as well as approximately 20 Company-owned offices. As a third-party logistics company, we have approximately 10,000 asset-based transportation companies, including motor carriers, railroads, airlines and ocean lines in our carrier network. We believe shippers value our services because we are able to objectively arrange the most efficient and cost-effective means, type and provider of transportation service without undue influence caused by the ownership of transportation assets. In addition, our minimal investment in physical assets affords us the opportunity for a higher return on invested capital and net cash flows than our asset-based competitors.
 Through our operating locations across North America, we offer domestic and international air and ocean freight forwarding services and freight brokerage services including truckload services, less than truckload (“LTL”) services, and intermodal services, which is the movement of freight in trailers or containers by combination of truck and rail. Our primary business operations involve arranging the shipment, on behalf of our customers, of materials, products, equipment and other goods that are generally larger than shipments handled by integrated carriers of primarily small parcels, such as FedEx, DHL and UPS. Our services include arranging and monitoring all aspects of material flow act
ivity utilizing advanced information technology systems. We also provide other value-added supply chain services, including order fulfillment, inventory management, warehouse and distribution services (collectively, “Materials Management and Distribution” or “MM&D” services), and customs brokerage services to complement our core transportation service offering. 
 We expect to grow our business organically and by completing acquisitions of other companies with complementary geographical and logistics service offerings. Our organic growth strategy will continue to focus on strengthening existing and expanding new customer relationships leveraging the benefit of our truck brokerage and intermodal service offerings, while continuing our efforts on the organic build-out of our network of strategic operating partner locations. In addition, as we continue to grow and scale the business, we believe that we are creating density in our trade lanes which creates opportunities for us to more efficiently source and manage our transportation capacity. In addition to our focus on organic growth, we will continue to search for acquisition candidates that bring critical mass from a geographic and purchasing power standpoint along with providing complementary service offerings to the current platform. As we continue to grow and scale the business, we also remain focused on leveraging our back-office infrastructure and technology systems to drive productivity improvement across the organization.
 Competitive Strengths 
 As a non-asset based third-party logistics provider, we believe that we are well-positioned to provide cost-effective and efficient solutions to address the demand in the marketplace for transportation and logistics services. We believe that the most important competitive factors in our industry are quality of service, including reliability, responsiveness, expertise and convenience, scope of operations, geographic coverage, information technology and price. We believe our primary competitive advantages are as follows:
 Non-asset based business model
 As a non-asset based logistics provider, we own only a minimal amount of equipment. By not owning the transportation equipment used to transport the freight, which results in relatively minimal fixed operating costs, we are able to leverage our network of locations to offer competitive pricing and flexible solutions to our customers. Moreover, our balanced product offering provides us with revenue streams from multiple sources and enables us to retain customers even as they shift across various modes of transportation. We believe our low capital intensity model allows us to provide low-cost solutions to our customers, operate our business with strong cash flow characteristics, and retain significant flexibility in responding to changing industries and economic conditions. 
 Offer significant advantages to our strategic operating partners
 Our current network is predominantly represented by independent agents, who operate exclusively on our behalf, who we also refer to as our “strategic operating partners”, who rely on us for operating authority, technology, sales and marketing support, access to working capital, our carrier and international partner networks, and collective purchasing power. Through this collaboration, our strategic operating partners have the ability to focus on the operational and sales support aspects of their business without diverting costs or expertise to the structural aspect of their operations, thus, providing our strategic operating partners with the regional, national and global brand recognition that they would not otherwise be able to achieve acting alone.

Lower-risk operation of network of strategic operating partners
 We derive a substantial portion of our revenue pursuant to agreements with our strategic operating partners operating under our various brands. These arrangements afford us with a relatively low risk growth model as each strategic operating partner is responsible for its own sales and costs of operations. Under shared economic arrangements, we are responsible to provide to our strategic operating partners centralized back-office infrastructure, transportation and accounting systems, billing and collection services. 
 Diverse customer base
 We service a large and diversified account base of over 12,000 accounts consisting of consumer goods, food and beverage, manufacturing and retail customers. From the date of this report, no single customer and no strategic operating partner represented more than 10% of our consolidated net revenues, reducing risks associated with any particular industry, geographic or customer concentration.
 Information technology resources
 A primary component of our business strategy is the continued development of advanced information systems to provide accurate and timely information to our management, strategic operating partners and customers. We believe that the ability to provide accurate real-time information on the status of shipments has and will become increasingly important in our industry. Our customer delivery tools enable connectivity with our customers’ and trading partners’ systems, which leads to more accurate and up-to-date information on the status of shipments. Our centralized transportation management system (rating, routing, tender and financial settlement process) drives significant efficiency across our network.
 Global network of transportation providers
 We provide worldwide supply chain services, which include international air and ocean services that complement our domestic service offerings. Our offerings include heavyweight and small package air services, providing same day (next flight out) air charters, next day a.m./p.m., second day a.m./p.m. as well as time definite surface transport moves. Our non-asset based business model allows us to use commercial passenger and cargo flights. Thus, we have thousands of daily flight options to choose from, and our pickup and delivery network provides us with zip code to zip code coverage throughout North America. 
 Sourcing and managing transportation
 As we continue to grow and scale the business, we believe that we are developing density in our trade lanes which creates opportunities for us to more efficiently source and manage our transportation capacity. With our acquisition of Wheels Group, Inc. in 2015, our network has access to truck brokerage and intermodal capabilities. We believe the benefit of our relative purchasing power along with our service line expansion will serve as a competitive differentiator in the marketplace to help us secure new customers and attract additional strategic operating partners to our network.
 Value-added services
 In addition to our core transportation service offerings, we also provide value-added supply chain services including order fulfillment, inventory management, MM&D, and customs brokerage services. We believe that our value-added services allow us to leverage our transportation services to generate additional revenue and provide additional convenience to our customers. 
 Industry Overview
 The logistics industry is highly fragmented with thousands of companies of various sizes competing in the domestic and international markets. As business requirements for efficient and cost-effective logistics services have increased, so has the importance and complexity of effectively managing freight transportation. Businesses increasingly strive to minimize inventory levels, perform manufacturing and assembly operations in the lowest cost locations, and distribute their products in numerous global markets. As a result, companies are increasingly looking to third-party logistics providers to help them execute their supply chain strategies. 
 Shippers typically manage their supply chains using some combination of asset and non-asset based service providers. We operate principally as a non-asset based third-party logistics provider focused on freight forwarding, truck brokerage and intermodal transportation services along with associated value-added services. According to Armstrong and Associates, the market for third-party logistics services in the United States and Canada is estimated at approximately $199.6 billion.

Because non-asset based companies select from various transportation options in routing customer shipments, they are often able to serve customers less expensively and with greater flexibility than their asset based competitors, who are typically focused on maximizing the utilization of their own captive fleets of trucks, aircraft and ships rather than the specific needs of the customer. 
 We believe there are several factors that are increasing demand for global logistics solutions. These factors include: 
  
• | outsourcing of non-core activities;
--+------------------------------------


• | globalization of trade;
--+------------------------


• | increased need for time-definite delivery;
--+-------------------------------------------


• | consolidation of global logistics providers; and
--+-------------------------------------------------


• | increasing influence of e-business and the Internet.
--+-----------------------------------------------------

 We expect to grow our business organically and by completing acquisitions of other companies with complementary geographical and logistics service offerings. We will continue to make enhancements to our back-office infrastructure, transportation management, and accounting systems to support this growth. Our organic growth strategy will continue to focus on strengthening existing and expanding new customer relationships, while continuing our efforts on the organic build-out of our network of strategic operating partner locations. In addition, we will also be working to drive further productivity improvements enabled through our value-added truck brokerage and customs house brokerage service capabilities.
 Our acquisition strategy has been designed to take advantage of shifting market dynamics. The third-party logistics industry continues to grow as an increasing number of businesses outsource their logistics functions to more cost effectively manage and extract value from their supply chains. The industry is positioned for further consolidation as it remains highly fragmented, and as customers are demanding the types of sophisticated and broad reaching service offerings that can more effectively be handled by larger more diverse organizations. We believe the highly fragmented composition of the marketplace, the industry participants’ need for capital, and their owners’ desire for liquidity has and will continue to produce a large number of attractive acquisition candidates. For the most part, our target acquisition candidates are generally smaller than those identified as acquisition targets of larger public companies and have limited ability to conduct their own public offerings or obtain financing that will provide them with capital for liquidity or rapid growth. We believe that many of these “smaller” companies are receptive to our acquisition program as a vehicle for liquidation or growth. We intend to be opportunistic in executing our acquisition strategy with a goal of expanding both our domestic and international capabilities. 
 Our Operating Strategy 
 Leverage the People, Process and Technology Available through a Central Platform. A key element of our operating strategy is to maximize our operational efficiencies by integrating general and administrative functions into our back-office operations and reducing or eliminating redundant functions and facilities at acquired companies. This is designed to enable us to quickly realize potential savings and synergies, efficiently control and monitor operations of acquired companies, and allow acquired companies to focus on growing their sales and operations. 
 Develop and Maintain Strong Customer Relationships. We seek to develop and maintain strong interactive customer relationships by anticipating and focusing on our customers’ needs. We emphasize a relationship-oriented approach to business, rather than the transaction or assignment-oriented approach used by many of our competitors. To develop close customer relationships, we and our network of operating partners regularly meet with both existing and prospective customers to help design solutions for, and identify the resources needed to execute, their supply chain strategies. We believe that this relationship-oriented approach results in greater customer satisfaction and reduced business development expense. 
Operations 
 Through our operating locations across North America, we offer domestic and international air and ocean freight forwarding services and freight brokerage services including truckload services, LTL services, and intermodal services, which is the movement of freight in trailers or containers by combination of truck and rail. As a third-party logistics provider, our primary business operations involve arranging the shipment, on behalf of our customers, of materials, products, equipment and other goods that are generally larger than shipments handled by integrated carriers of primarily small parcels, such as FedEx, DHL and UPS, including arranging and monitoring all aspects of material flow activity utilizing advanced information technology systems. We also provide other value-added supply chain services, including order fulfillment, inventory management, warehousing and distribution services (“MM&D”), and customs brokerage services, to complement our core transportation service offering. 
 As a non-asset based provider we generally do not own the transportation equipment used to transport the freight. We generally expect to neither own nor operate any material transportation assets and, consequently, arrange for transportation of our customers’ shipments via trucking companies, commercial airlines, air cargo carriers, railroads, ocean carriers and other non-asset based third-party providers. We select the carrier for a shipment based on route, departure time, available cargo capacity and cost. We may charter cargo aircraft and/or ocean vessels from time to time depending upon seasonality, freight volumes and other factors. We generate our gross margin on the difference between what we charge to our customers for the services provided to them, and what we pay to the transportation providers to transport the freight. 
 We are organized functionally in two geographic operating segments: U.S. and Canada. Our transportation services for both the U.S. and Canada segments can be broadly placed into the categories of freight forwarding and freight brokerage services:

Freight forwarding. As a freight forwarder, we operate as a non-asset based carrier providing domestic and international air and ocean freight forwarding services. Our freight forwarding operations involve obtaining shipment or material orders from customers, creating and delivering a wide range of logistics solutions to meet customers' specific requirements for transportation and related services, and arranging and monitoring all aspects of material flow activity utilizing advanced information technology systems. We arrange for transportation of our customers’ shipments via trucking companies, commercial airlines, air cargo carriers, ocean carriers and other asset and non-asset based third-party providers. We select the carrier for a shipment based on route, departure time, available cargo capacity and cost. We charter cargo aircraft from time to time depending upon seasonality, freight volumes and other factors. 
 Freight brokerage. We also provide significant bi-modal brokerage capabilities providing truck load, LTL and intermodal services throughout the United States and Canada, which is managed through our centralized service centers in Chicago, Illinois and Toronto, Ontario. We offer temperature-controlled, dry van, intermodal drayage, and flatbed services and specialize in the transport of food and beverage, consumer packaged goods and frozen food and refrigerated products.
 As a truck broker, we match the customers’ needs with carriers’ capacity to provide the most effective combination of service and price. We have contracts with a substantial number of carriers allowing us to meet the varied needs of our customers. As part of the truck brokerage services, we negotiate rates, track shipments in transit and handle claims for freight loss and damage on behalf of our customers. For our LTL service, we employ a point-to-point model that we believe serves as a competitive advantage over the traditional hub and spoke LTL model in terms of faster transit times, lower incidence of damage, and reduced fuel consumption.
 As an intermodal services company, we arrange for the movement of our customers’ freight in containers, trailers and rail boxcars, typically over long distances of at least 750 miles. We contract with railroads to provide transportation for the long-haul portion of the shipment and with local trucking companies, known as “drayage companies,” for pickup and delivery. As part of our intermodal services, we negotiate rail and drayage rates, electronically track shipments in transit, consolidate billing and handle claims for freight loss or damage on behalf of our customers.
 To complement our core transportation service offerings, we also provide a number of value-added services, including customs brokerage and MM&D solutions. 
 Information Services 
 The continued enhancement of our information systems and ultimate migration of acquired companies and additional strategic operating partners to a common set of customer-facing and back-office applications is a key component of our growth strategy. We believe that the ability to provide accurate real-time information on the status of shipments as well as enhanced reporting and visibility tools has become increasingly important and that our efforts in this area will result in competitive service advantages. In addition, we believe that centralizing our operations into a single transportation management system (rating, routing, tender and financial settlement processes) will continue to drive significant productivity improvement across our network. 
 In our forwarding operations, we use third-party transportation management system (Cargowise) and are migrating operations to SAP TM, that are integrated to our third-party accounting system (SAP). These systems combine to form the foundation of our supply-chain technologies, which provides us with a common set of back-office operating, accounting and customer facing applications. In our brokerage operations, we utilize the TEDS system for transportation management and Megatrans for intermodal services. In our warehousing operations, we use Microsoft’s Navision and are migrating to Highjump, which uses SAP for order management services. These systems are connected to Epicor and JD Edwards for accounting and financial reporting. All brokerage systems are integrated with our online customer facing applications. We continue to make gradual progress in migrating these various operating and financial reporting systems to a singular SAP-based platform. We are taking a phased approach to these migrations and are currently working to transition our domestic and international freight forwarding services to our new SAP-based transportation management system. Future phases will include the transition of our international freight forwarding services and our legacy brokerage transportation management and financial reporting systems to SAP.
 Sales and Marketing 
 We principally market our services through our network of Company-owned and strategic operating partner locations across North America. Each office is staffed with operational employees to provide support for the sales team, develop frequent contact with the customer’s traffic department, and maintain customer service. Our current network is predominantly represented by strategic operating partners that rely on us for operating authority, technology, sales and marketing support, access to working capital, our carrier and international partners networks, and collective purchasing power. Through this collaboration, our strategic operating partners have the ability to focus on the operational and sales support aspects of the business without diverting costs or expertise to the structural aspect of their operations, providing our partners with the regional, national and global brand recognition that they would not otherwise be able to achieve by solely serving their local market. We have no customers or strategic operating partners that separately account for more than 10% of our consolidated net revenues, although we do have a number of significant customers and strategic operating partner locations with volume and stature, the loss of one or more of which could negatively impact our ability to retain and service our customers.

Competition and Business Conditions 
 The logistics business is directly impacted by the volume of domestic and international trade. The volume of such trade is influenced by many factors, including economic and political conditions in the United States and abroad, major work stoppages, currency fluctuations, acts of war, terrorism and other armed conflicts, United States and international laws relating to tariffs, trade restrictions, foreign investments and taxation. 
 The global transportation and logistics services industry is intensively competitive and is expected to remain so for the foreseeable future. We will compete against asset based and other non-asset based third-party logistics companies, consultants, information technology vendors and shippers’ transportation departments. This competition is based primarily on rates, quality of service (such as damage-free shipments, on-time delivery and consistent transit times), reliable pickup and delivery and scope of operations. Certain of our competitors have substantially greater financial resources than we do. However, we believe the incremental service offerings enabled through our acquisition strategy (e.g. Wheels’ truck brokerage and intermodal capabilities) will serve as a catalyst for margin expansion in our existing business and a competitive differentiator in the marketplace to help us secure new customers and attract additional strategic operating partners to our network.
 Regulation 
 Interstate and international transportation of freight is highly regulated. Failure to comply with applicable state and federal regulations, or to maintain required permits or licenses, can result in substantial fines or revocation of operating permits or authorities imposed on both transportation intermediaries and their shipper customers. We cannot give assurance as to the degree or cost of future regulations on our business. Some of the regulations affecting our current and prospective operations are described below. 
 Air freight forwarding operations are subject to regulation, as an indirect air cargo carrier, under the Federal Aviation Act as enforced by the Federal Aviation Administration of the U.S. Department of Transportation, and the Transportation Security Administration of the Department of Homeland Security. While air freight forwarders are exempted from most of the Federal Aviation Act’s requirements by the Economic Aviation Regulations, the industry is subject to ongoing regulatory and legislative developments that can impact the economics of the industry by requiring changes to operating practices or influencing the demand for, and the costs of, providing services to customers. 
 Surface freight forwarding operations are subject to various state and federal statutes, and are regulated by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration of the U.S. Department of Transportation and, to a very limited extent, the Surface Transportation Board. These federal agencies have broad investigatory and regulatory powers, including the power to issue a certificate of authority or license to engage in the business, to approve specified mergers, consolidations and acquisitions, and to regulate the delivery of some types of domestic shipments and operations within particular geographic areas. 
 The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration also has the authority to regulate interstate motor carrier operations, including the regulation of certain rates, charges and accounting systems, to require periodic financial reporting, and to regulate insurance, driver qualifications, operation of motor vehicles, parts and accessories for motor vehicle equipment, hours of service of drivers, inspection, repair, maintenance standards and other safety related matters. The federal laws governing interstate motor carriers have both direct and indirect application to the Company. The breadth and scope of the federal regulations may affect our operations and the motor carriers that are used in the provisioning of the transportation services. In certain locations, state or local permits or registrations may also be required to provide or obtain intrastate motor carrier services. 
 The Federal Maritime Commission, or FMC, regulates and licenses ocean forwarding operations. Non-vessel operating common carriers are subject to FMC regulation, under the FMC tariff filing and surety bond requirements, and under the Shipping Act of 1984, particularly those terms proscribing rebating practices. 
 United States customs brokerage operations are subject to the licensing requirements of the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection of the Department of Homeland Security. Likewise, any customs brokerage operations must also be licensed in and subject to the regulations of countries into which freight is imported. 
 Employees
 As of June 30, 2019, we have 708 employees, of which 675 are full time. None of these employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have experienced no work stoppages and consider our relations with our employees to be good.
