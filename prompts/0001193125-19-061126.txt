ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

GENERAL 
 WesBanco, Inc. (WesBanco), a bank holding company incorporated in 1968 and headquartered in Wheeling, West Virginia, offers a full range of financial services including retail banking, corporate banking, personal and corporate trust services, brokerage services, mortgage banking and insurance. WesBanco offers these services through two reportable segments, community banking and trust and investment services. For additional information regarding WesBancos business segments, please refer to Note 24, Business Segments in the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 At December 31, 2018, WesBanco operated one commercial bank, WesBanco Bank, Inc. (WesBanco Bank or the Bank), through 209 branches and 202 ATM machines located in West Virginia, Ohio, western Pennsylvania, Kentucky and southern Indiana. Total assets of WesBanco Bank as of December 31, 2018 approximated $12.5 billion. WesBanco Bank also offers trust and investment services and various alternative investment products including mutual funds and annuities. The market value of assets under management of the trust and investment services segment was approximately $4.3 billion as of December 31, 2018. These assets are held by WesBanco Bank in fiduciary or agency capacities for its customers and therefore are not included as assets on WesBancos Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
 On April 5, 2018, WesBanco completed the acquisition of First Sentry Bancshares, Inc. (FTSB), a bank holding company headquartered in Huntington, West Virginia with approximately $704.8 million in assets excluding goodwill, $590.1 million in total deposits and $447.3 million in total loans, and five branches in West Virginia. The transaction enhanced WesBancos overall market share in the state of West Virginia and added a new metropolitan statistical area (MSA) in the Huntington, WV area, which is west of our existing Charleston, WV MSA. 
 On August 20, 2018, WesBanco completed the acquisition of Farmers Capital Bank Corp. (FFKT), a bank holding company headquartered in Frankfort, Kentucky with approximately $1.6 billion in assets excluding goodwill, $1.3 billion in total deposits and $1.0 billion in total loans, and 34 branches in Kentucky. The transaction expanded WesBancos existing franchise in Kentucky by adding a new MSA in the state capital of Frankfort, while enhancing our present market position in the Louisville, Lexington and Elizabethtown MSAs. We also added locations in northern Kentucky to our Cincinnati, OH MSA. 
 WesBanco offers additional services through its non-banking subsidiaries, WesBanco Insurance Services, Inc. (WesBanco Insurance), a multi-line insurance agency specializing in property, casualty, life and title insurance, with benefit plan sales and administration for personal and commercial clients; and WesBanco Securities, Inc. (WesBanco Securities), a full service broker-dealer, which also offers discount brokerage services. 
 WesBanco Asset Management, Inc., which was incorporated in 2002, holds certain investment securities and loans in a Delaware-based subsidiary. 
 WesBanco Properties, Inc. holds certain commercial real estate properties. The commercial property is leased to WesBanco Bank and to certain non-related third parties. Kentuckiana Real Estate Holdings, LLC, and Southern Indiana Real Estate Holdings, LLC, are Indiana and Kentucky limited liability corporations, and they hold certain real estate properties in those markets. 
 CBIN Insurance Inc. is a captive insurance company, which issues policies to WesBancos banking subsidiaries for certain risks that are not covered by the Companys commercial insurances purchased from third-party carriers. FFKT Insurance Services, Inc. is a captive insurance company, which was acquired from FFKT. It is in the process of winding up its business activities and will be dissolved.

 WesBanco has thirteen capital trusts, which are all wholly-owned trust subsidiaries formed for the purpose of issuing trust preferred securities (Trust Preferred Securities) and lending the proceeds to WesBanco. For more information regarding WesBancos issuance of trust preferred securities, please refer to Note 11, Subordinated Debt and Junior Subordinated Debt in the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 AMSCO, Inc. (AMSCO) is a wholly-owned subsidiary of WesBanco Bank, which formerly engaged in the management of certain real estate development and construction of 1-4 family residential units. It is in the process of winding up its business activities and will be dissolved.     
 WesBanco Banks Investment Department also serves as investment adviser to a family of mutual funds, namely the WesMark Funds. The fund family is comprised of the WesMark Growth Fund, the WesMark Balanced Fund, the WesMark Small Company Growth Fund, the WesMark Government Bond Fund, the WesMark West Virginia Municipal Bond Fund, and the WesMark Tactical Opportunity Fund. 
 As of December 31, 2018, none of WesBancos subsidiaries were engaged in any operations in foreign countries, and only one had any transactions with customers in foreign countries. The Bank provides letters of credit internationally for certain domestic customers and provides international wire services through a third-party correspondent bank. 
 EMPLOYEES 
 There were 2,388 full-time equivalent employees employed by WesBanco and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2018. None of the employees was represented by collective bargaining agreements. WesBanco believes its employee relations to be satisfactory. 
WEB SITE ACCESS TO WESBANCOS FILINGS WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION 
 All of WesBancos electronic filings for 2018 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC), including this Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to these reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, are made available at no cost on WesBancos website, www.wesbanco.com, in the About Us section through the Investor Relations link as soon as reasonably practicable after WesBanco files such material with, or furnishes it to, the SEC. WesBancos SEC filings are also available through the SECs website at www.sec.gov. 
 Upon written request of any shareholder of record on December 31, 2018, WesBanco will provide, without charge, a printed copy of this 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K, including financial statements and schedules, as required to be filed with the SEC. To obtain a copy of this report, contact: John Iannone, WesBanco, Inc., 1 Bank Plaza, Wheeling, WV 26003 (304) 905-7021.COMPETITION 
 Competition in the form of price and service from other banks, including local, regional and national banks and financial companies such as savings and loan companies, internet banks, payday lenders, money services businesses, credit unions, finance companies, brokerage firms and other non-banking companies providing various regulated and non-regulated financial services and products, is intense in most of the markets served by WesBanco and its subsidiaries. WesBancos trust and investment services segment receives competition from commercial banks, trust companies, mutual fund companies, investment advisory firms, law firms, brokerage firms and other financial services companies. As a result of consolidation within the financial services industry, mergers between, and the expansion of, financial institutions both within and outside of WesBancos major markets have provided significant competitive pressure in those markets. Many of WesBancos competitors have 
 
4 


  greater resources and, as such, may have higher lending limits and may offer other products and services that are not provided by WesBanco. WesBanco generally competes on the basis of superior customer service and responsiveness to customer needs, available loan and deposit products, rates of interest charged on loans, rates of interest paid for deposits, and the availability and pricing of trust, brokerage and insurance services. As a result of WesBancos expansion into certain larger metropolitan markets, it has faced entrenched larger bank competitors with an already existing customer base that may far exceed WesBancos initial entry position into those markets. As a result, WesBanco may be forced to compete more aggressively for loans, deposits, trust and insurance products in order to grow its market share, potentially reducing its current and future profit potential from such markets. 
 SUPERVISION AND REGULATION 
 As a bank holding company and a financial holding company under federal law, WesBanco is subject to supervision and examination by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve Board) under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the BHCA), and is required to file with the Federal Reserve Board reports and other information regarding its business operations and the business operations of its subsidiaries. WesBanco also is required to obtain Federal Reserve Board approval prior to acquiring, directly or indirectly, ownership or control of certain voting shares of other banks, as described below, and for certain capital actions. Since WesBanco is both a bank holding company and a financial holding company, WesBanco can offer customers virtually any type of service that is financial in nature or incidental thereto, including banking and activities closely related to banking, securities underwriting, insurance (both underwriting and agency) and merchant banking. As a result of the completed acquisitions of FTSB and FFKT in 2018, WesBanco is now subject to enhanced supervision from the Federal Reserve Board due to its exceeding the $10 billion asset threshold, and it intends to ensure that sufficient resources are allocated to compliance, risk management and internal audit, among other functions, so that the enhanced demands of the Federal Reserve Board are met. 
 As indicated above, WesBanco presently operates one bank subsidiary, WesBanco Bank, which is a West Virginia banking corporation and is not a member bank of the Federal Reserve System. It is subject to examination and supervision by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the FDIC) and the West Virginia Division of Financial Institutions (WVDIF). The deposits of WesBanco Bank are insured by the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) of the FDIC. WesBancos non-bank subsidiaries are subject to examination and supervision by the Federal Reserve Board and specifically, the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, Ohio (Federal Reserve) and examination by other federal and state agencies, including, in the case of certain securities activities, regulation by the SEC, the Financial Institution Regulatory Authority, Inc. (FINRA), the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board and the Securities Investors Protection Corporation. WesBanco Bank maintains one designated financial subsidiary, WesBanco Insurance, which, as indicated above, is a multi-line insurance agency specializing in property, casualty, life and title insurance, with benefit plan sales and administration for personal and commercial clients. As a result of the aforementioned acquisitions in 2018, and exceeding the $10 billion asset threshold, WesBanco is now subject to enhanced prudential supervision from both the FDIC and WVDIF as part of their large bank supervision program. 
 WesBanco is also under the jurisdiction of the SEC and certain state securities commissions for matters relating to the offering and sale of its securities. WesBanco is subject to the disclosure and regulatory requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as administered by the SEC. WesBanco is listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market (the NASDAQ) under the trading symbol WSBC and is subject to the rules of the NASDAQ for listed companies. 
 Under the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994, as amended (the Riegle-Neal Act), a bank holding company may acquire banks in states other than its home state, subject to certain limitations. The Riegle-Neal Act also authorizes banks to merge across state lines, thereby creating interstate banking. Under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act), banks are also permitted to establish de novo branches across state lines to the same extent that a state-chartered bank in each host state would be permitted to open branches. 
 
5 


 Under the BHCA, prior Federal Reserve Board approval is required for WesBanco to acquire more than 5% of the voting stock of any bank. In determining whether to approve a proposed bank acquisition, federal banking regulators will consider, among other factors, the effect of the acquisition on competition, the public benefits expected to be received from the acquisition, the projected capital ratios and levels on a post-acquisition basis, and the acquiring institutions record of addressing the credit needs of the communities it serves, including the needs of low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, consistent with safe and sound operation of the bank under the Community Reinvestment Act, as amended (the CRA). 
 HOLDING COMPANY REGULATIONS 
 As indicated above, WesBanco has one state bank subsidiary, WesBanco Bank, as well as non-bank subsidiaries, which are described further in Item 1. BusinessGeneral section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The subsidiary bank is subject to affiliate transaction restrictions under federal law, which limit covered transactions by the subsidiary bank with the parent and any non-bank subsidiaries of the parent, which are referred to in the aggregate in this paragraph as affiliates of the subsidiary bank. Covered transactions include loans or extensions of credit to an affiliate (including repurchase agreements), purchases of or investments in securities issued by an affiliate, purchases of assets from an affiliate, the acceptance of securities issued by an affiliate as collateral for a loan or extension of credit, the issuance of a guarantee, acceptance or letter of credit on behalf of an affiliate, certain transactions that involve borrowing or lending securities, and certain derivative transactions with an affiliate. Such covered transactions between the subsidiary bank and any single affiliate are limited in amount to 10% of the subsidiary banks capital and surplus, and, with respect to covered transactions with all affiliates in the aggregate, are limited in amount to 20% of the subsidiary banks capital and surplus. Furthermore, such loans or extensions of credit, guarantees, acceptances and letters of credit, and any credit exposure resulting from securities borrowing or lending transactions or derivatives transactions, are required to be secured by collateral at all times in amounts specified by law. In addition, all covered transactions must be conducted on terms and conditions that are consistent with safe and sound banking practices. 
 The Dodd-Frank Act requires a bank holding company to act as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary bank. Under this source of strength requirement, the Federal Reserve Board may require a bank holding company to make capital infusions into a troubled subsidiary bank, and may charge the bank holding company with engaging in unsafe and unsound practices for failure to commit resources to such a subsidiary bank. A capital infusion conceivably could be required at a time when WesBanco may not have the resources to provide it. 
 PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS 
 Dividends from the subsidiary bank are a significant source of funds for payment of dividends to WesBancos shareholders. For the year ended December 31, 2018, WesBanco declared cash dividends to its common shareholders of approximately $58.0 million. 
 As of December 31, 2018, WesBanco Bank was well capitalized under the definition in Section 325.103 of the FDIC Regulations. Therefore, as long as the Bank remains well capitalized or even becomes adequately capitalized, there would be no basis under Section 325.105 to limit the ability of the Bank to pay dividends because it had not become undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized. As of January 1, 2016, WesBanco Bank and WesBanco are subject to capital conservation buffer rules, phased in over a four year period ending in 2019, which require WesBanco and WesBanco Bank to have capital levels above the regulatory minimums in order to pay dividends (discussed below in connection with the Basel III initiative under Item 1. BusinessCapital Requirements).

 All financial institutions are subject to the prompt corrective action provisions set forth in Section 38 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (the FDI Act) and the provisions set forth in Section 325.105 of the FDIC Regulations. Immediately upon a state non-member bank receiving notice, or being deemed to have notice, that the bank is undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, or critically undercapitalized, as defined in Section 325.103 of the FDIC Regulations, the bank is precluded from being able to pay dividends to its shareholders based upon the requirements in Section 38(d) of the FDI Act, 12. U.S.C. § 1831o(d). 
 In addition, with respect to possible dividends by the Bank, under Section 31A-4-25 of the West Virginia Code, the prior approval of the West Virginia Commissioner of Banking would be required if the total of all dividends declared by the Bank in any calendar year would exceed the total of the Banks net profits for that year combined with its retained net profits of the preceding two years. Further, Section 31A-4-25 limits the ability of a West Virginia banking institution to pay dividends until the surplus fund of the banking institution equals the common stock of the banking institution and if certain specified amounts of recent profits of the banking institution have not been carried to the surplus fund. 
 If, in the opinion of the applicable regulatory authority, a bank under its jurisdiction is engaged in or is about to engage in an unsafe or unsound practice which, depending on the financial condition of the bank, could include the payment of dividends, such authority may require, after notice and hearing, that such bank cease and desist from such practice. The Federal Reserve Board has issued policy statements, which provide that insured banks and bank holding companies should generally only pay dividends out of current operating earnings. Under applicable law, bank regulatory agency approval is required if the total of all dividends declared by a bank in any calendar year exceeds the available retained earnings or exceeds the aggregate of the banks net profits (as defined by regulatory agencies) for that year and its retained net profits for the preceding two years. As of December 31, 2018, under FDIC regulations, WesBanco could receive, without prior regulatory approval, a dividend of up to $105.4 million from WesBanco Bank. Additional information regarding dividend restrictions is set forth in Note 22, Regulatory Matters, in the Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 On February 24, 2009, the Federal Reserve Division of Banking Supervision and Regulation issued a letter providing direction to bank holding companies on the payment of dividends, capital repurchases and capital redemptions. Although the letter largely reiterates longstanding Federal Reserve supervisory policies, it emphasizes the need for a bank holding company to review various factors when considering the declaration of a dividend or taking action that would reduce regulatory capital provided by outstanding financial instruments. These factors include the potential need to increase loan loss reserves, write down assets and reflect declines in asset values in equity. In addition, the bank holding company should consider its past and anticipated future earnings, the dividend payout ratio in relation to earnings, and adequacy of regulatory capital before any action is taken. The consideration of capital adequacy should include a review of all known factors that may affect capital in the future.
 In certain circumstances, defined by regulation relating to levels of earnings and capital, advance notification to, and in some circumstances, approval by the regulator could be required to declare a dividend or repurchase or redeem capital instruments.
 FDIC INSURANCE 
 FDIC insurance premiums are assessed by the FDIC using a risk-based approach that places insured institutions into categories based on capital and risk profiles. In 2018, WesBanco Bank paid deposit insurance premiums of $3.0 million, compared to $3.2 million and $3.6 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively. The decrease from 2016 to 2017 was due to the FDIC reducing its assessment rate for banks with less than $10 billion in assets as of July 1, 2016. Certain risk factors as well as capital, net income and loan quality-related financial ratios also influenced the decreases year-over-year and particularly from 2017 to 2018, despite adding assets from the two acquisitions to the calculation. However, as a large bank with assets above $10 billion beginning March 31, 2018 and after four consecutive quarters with assets above $10 billion, the Bank expects to pay a higher assessment rate for quarters after March 31, 2019 utilizing a more complex calculation with additional loan and other risk factors. 
 
7 


 Effective July 1, 2016, the FDIC issued a final rule in order to implement section 334 of the Dodd-Frank Act, which requires the FDIC to (1) raise the minimum reserve ratio for the FDIC Deposit Insurance Fund to 1.35 percent, from 1.15 percent, (2) assess premiums on banks to reach the 1.35 percent goal by September 30, 2020, and (3) offset the effect of the increase in the minimum reserve ratio on insured depository institutions with assets of less than $10 billion. The final rule imposes a quarterly surcharge on insured depository institutions with $10 billion or more in assets of 4.5 basis points applied to their assessment base (after making certain adjustments), to be assessed over a period of eight quarters. Since the required reserve ratio was achieved in mid-2018, no additional surcharges will be assessed to banks with total consolidated assets greater than $10 billion beginning in the fourth quarter of 2018, and WesBanco will not experience such surcharge as it didnt exceed $10 billion in assets for four consecutive quarters prior to the surcharges elimination. Since WesBanco was a small bank during the initial surcharge, the Bank will receive an assessment credit for the portion of WesBancos assessment that contributed to the growth in the reserve ratio from 1.15 to 1.35 percent. The assessed credit will be applied when the reserve ratio reaches 1.38 percent. 
 CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS 
 The Federal Reserve Board had historically issued risk-based capital ratio and leverage ratio guidelines for bank holding companies. The risk-based capital ratio guidelines establish a systematic analytical framework that makes regulatory capital requirements more sensitive to differences in risk profiles among banking organizations, takes off-balance sheet exposures into explicit account in assessing capital adequacy, and minimizes disincentives to holding liquid, low-risk assets. Under the guidelines and related policies, bank holding companies must maintain capital sufficient to meet both a risk-based asset ratio test and a leverage ratio test on a consolidated basis. The risk-based ratio is determined by allocating assets and specified off-balance sheet commitments into several weighted categories, with higher weightings being assigned to categories perceived as representing greater risk. A bank holding companys capital is then divided by total risk-weighted assets to yield the risk-based ratio. The leverage ratio is determined by relating core capital to total assets adjusted as specified in the guidelines. The Bank is subject to substantially similar capital requirements. 
 The federal regulatory authorities risk-based capital guidelines are currently based upon agreements reached by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the Basel Committee). The Basel Committee is a committee of central banks and bank supervisors and regulators from the major industrialized countries that develops broad policy guidelines for use by each countrys supervisors in determining the supervisory policies they apply. In December 2010, the Basel Committee issued a strengthened set of international capital and liquidity standards for banks and bank holding companies, known as Basel III. In July 2013, the U.S. federal banking agencies issued a joint final rule that implements the Basel III capital standards and establishes the minimum capital levels required under the Dodd-Frank Act. The rule was effective January 1, 2015 subject to a transition period providing for full implementation on January 1, 2019. The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection (EGRRCPA) Act, enacted into law in May 2018, exempts banks with total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion that exceed the community bank leverage ratio from the capital requirements under Basel III. WesBancos assets are in excess of $10 billion, however, so the exemption is inapplicable. 
 Generally, under the applicable guidelines, a financial institutions capital is divided into common equity Tier 1 (CET1), total Tier 1 and Tier 2. CET1 includes common shares and retained earnings less goodwill, intangible assets subject to limitation and certain deferred tax assets subject to limitation. In addition, under the final capital rule, an institution may make a one-time, permanent election to continue to exclude accumulated other comprehensive income from capital. If an institution does not make this election, unrealized gains and losses will be included in the calculation of its CET1. Total Tier 1 is comprised of CET1 and certain restricted capital instruments, including qualifying cumulative perpetual preferred stock and qualifying trust preferred securities, in their Tier 1 capital, up to a limit of 25% of Tier 1 capital. (See below within this section for more information regarding the capital treatment of trust preferred securities.) 
 
8 


 Tier 2, or supplementary capital, includes, among other things, portions of trust preferred securities and cumulative perpetual preferred stock not otherwise counted in Tier 1 capital, as well as perpetual preferred stock, intermediate-term preferred stock, hybrid capital instruments, perpetual debt, mandatory convertible debt securities, term subordinated debt, unrealized holding gains on equity securities, and the allowance for loan and lease losses, all subject to certain limitations. Total capital is the sum of Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital. The amount of Tier 2 capital that exceeds the amount of Tier 1 capital must be excluded from the total capital calculation. 
 The Federal Reserve Board has established the following minimum capital levels banks and bank holding companies are required to maintain as a percentage of risk-weighted assets (including various off-balance sheet items): (i) CET1 of at least 4.5%, (ii) Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 6%, (iii) total capital ratio (Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital) of at least 8%; and (iv) a non-risk-based leverage ratio (Tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets) of 4%. The risk-based capital standards are designed to make regulatory capital requirements more sensitive to differences in credit and market risk profiles among banks and financial holding companies, to account for off-balance sheet exposure, and to minimize disincentives for holding liquid assets. Balance sheet and off-balance sheet exposures are assigned to one of several risk-weights primarily based on relative credit risk. The capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgements by the regulators about components, risk-weightings, and other factors. Additionally, when the final capital rule is fully implemented, it will require an institution to maintain a 2.5% common equity Tier 1 capital conservation buffer over the minimum risk-based capital requirements to avoid restrictions on the ability to pay dividends, discretionary bonuses to executive officers, and engage in share repurchases. The capital conservation buffer was 1.25% for 2017, increasing to 1.875% effective January 1, 2018, and finally increasing to the full 2.5% effective January 1, 2019. 
 Failure to meet applicable capital guidelines could subject a financial institution to a variety of enforcement remedies available to the federal regulatory authorities, including limitations on the ability to pay dividends, the issuance by the regulatory authority of a capital directive to increase capital, and the termination of deposit insurance by the FDIC, as well as to the measures described below under Prompt Corrective Action as applicable to undercapitalized institutions. 
 As of December 31, 2018, WesBancos CET1, Tier 1 and total capital to risk-adjusted assets ratios were 13.14%, 15.09% and 15.99%, respectively. WesBanco made a timely permanent election to exclude accumulated other comprehensive income from regulatory capital. As of December 31, 2018, WesBanco Bank also had capital in excess of the minimum requirements. Neither WesBanco nor the Bank had been advised by the appropriate federal banking regulator of any specific leverage ratio applicable to it. As of December 31, 2018, WesBancos leverage ratio was 10.74%. 
 As of December 31, 2018, WesBanco had $189.8 million in subordinated and junior subordinated debt on its Consolidated Balance Sheets, which includes $164.4 million of junior subordinated debt. For regulatory purposes, Trust Preferred Securities totaling $162.5 million underlying such junior subordinated debt were included in Tier 1 capital as of December 31, 2018, in accordance with regulatory reporting requirements. In 2013, the federal banking agencies amended capital requirements to generally exclude trust preferred securities from Tier 1 capital. A grandfather provision, however, permits bank holding companies with consolidated assets of less than $15 billion, such as WesBanco, to continue counting existing trust preferred securities as Tier 1 capital until they mature. The final Basel III capital rule permanently grandfathers trust preferred securities issued before May 19, 2010 for institutions of less than $15 billion in size, subject to a 25% limit of Tier 1 capital. The amount of trust preferred securities and certain other elements in excess of the 25% limit may be included in Tier 2 capital, subject to restrictions; however, all such securities would no longer be counted as Tier 1 capital (and would instead be counted as Tier 2 capital subject to limits) if, generally speaking, WesBancos total assets increase above $15 billion at some point in the future. For more information regarding trust preferred securities, please refer to Note 11, Subordinated and Junior Subordinated Debt in the Consolidated Financial Statements.

 The risk-based capital standards of the Federal Reserve and the FDIC specify that evaluations by the banking agencies of a banks capital adequacy will include an assessment of the exposure to declines in the economic value of the banks capital due to changes in interest rates. These banking agencies issued a joint policy statement on interest rate risk describing prudent methods for monitoring such risk that rely principally on internal measures of exposure and active oversight of risk management activities by senior management. 
 PROMPT CORRECTIVE ACTION 
 The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA) requires federal banking regulatory authorities to take prompt corrective action with respect to depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. For these purposes, FDICIA establishes five capital tiers: well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized. 
 An institution is deemed to be well-capitalized if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8% or greater, a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 5% or greater, and a new common equity Tier 1 ratio of 6.5% or greater, and is not subject to a regulatory order, agreement, or directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. An institution is deemed to be adequately capitalized if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6% or greater, generally a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4% or greater, and a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 4.5% or greater, and the institution does not meet the definition of a well-capitalized institution. An institution that does not meet one or more of the adequately capitalized tests is deemed to be undercapitalized. If the institution has a total risk-based capital ratio that is less than 6%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio that is less than 4%, or a Tier 1 leverage ratio that is less than 3%, it is deemed to be significantly undercapitalized. Finally, an institution is deemed to be critically undercapitalized if it has a ratio of tangible equity (as defined in the regulations) to total assets that is equal to or less than 2%. At December 31, 2018, WesBanco Bank had capital levels that met the well-capitalized standards under FDICIA and its implementing regulations. 
 FDICIA generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital distribution, including payment of a cash dividend, or paying any management fee to its holding company, if the depository institution would thereafter be undercapitalized. Undercapitalized institutions are subject to growth limitations and are required to submit a capital restoration plan. If any depository institution subsidiary of a holding company is required to submit a capital restoration plan, the holding company would be required to provide a limited guarantee regarding compliance with the plan as a condition of approval of such plan by the appropriate federal banking agency. If an undercapitalized institution fails to submit an acceptable plan, it is treated as if it is significantly undercapitalized. Significantly undercapitalized institutions may be subject to a number of requirements and restrictions, including orders to sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized, requirements to reduce total assets, and cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent banks. Critically undercapitalized institutions may not, beginning 60 days after becoming critically undercapitalized, make any payment of principal or interest on their subordinated debt and/or trust preferred securities. In addition, critically undercapitalized institutions are subject to appointment of a receiver or conservator within 90 days of becoming critically undercapitalized. 
 GRAMM-LEACH-BLILEY ACT 
 Under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (the GLB Act), banks are no longer prohibited from associating with, or having management interlocks with, a business organization engaged principally in securities activities. By qualifying as a financial holding company, as authorized under the GLB Act, a bank holding company acquires new powers not otherwise available to it. WesBanco has elected to become a financial holding company under the GLB Act. It also has qualified a subsidiary of the Bank as a financial subsidiary under the GLB Act. 
 Financial holding company powers relate to financial activities that are determined by the Federal Reserve Board, in coordination with the Secretary of the Treasury, to be financial in nature, incidental to an activity that is 
 
10 


  financial in nature, or complementary to a financial activity, provided that the complementary activity does not pose a safety and soundness risk. The GLB Act itself defines certain activities as financial in nature, including but not limited to: underwriting insurance or annuities; providing financial or investment advice; underwriting, dealing in, or making markets in securities; merchant banking, subject to significant limitations; insurance company portfolio investing, subject to significant limitations; and any activities previously found by the Federal Reserve Board to be closely related to banking. 
 National and state banks are permitted under the GLB Act, subject to capital, management, size, debt rating, and CRA qualification factors, to have financial subsidiaries that are permitted to engage in financial activities not otherwise permissible. However, unlike financial holding companies, financial subsidiaries may not engage in insurance or annuity underwriting; developing or investing in real estate; merchant banking (for at least five years); or insurance company portfolio investing. 
 DODD-FRANK ACT 
 The Dodd-Frank Act, enacted on July 21, 2010, and the rules implementing its provisions have resulted in numerous and wide-ranging reforms to the structure of the U.S. financial system and the enhanced regulation and supervision of WesBanco. This includes, among other things, rules to promote financial stability and prevent or mitigate the risks that may arise from the material distress or failure of a large bank holding company; enhance consumer protections; prohibit proprietary trading; and implement enhanced prudential requirements for large bank holding companies regarding risk-based capital and leverage, risk and liquidity management, stress testing, and recovery and resolution planning. The Dodd-Frank Act, including current and future rules implementing its provisions and the interpretation of those rules, have affected, and management expects will continue to affect, most of WesBancos businesses in some way, either directly through regulation of specific activities or indirectly through regulation of concentration risks, capital or liquidity. 
 Certain bank holding companies are subjected to increased capital requirements (discussed above under Item 1. BusinessCapital Requirements). 
 The Volcker Rule and the final rules jointly issued by federal banking agencies implementing the rules provisions limit WesBancos ability to engage in proprietary trading, as well as its ability to sponsor or invest in hedge funds or private equity funds. The Volcker Rule includes certain compliance program requirements that apply to banking entities that engage in permissible proprietary trading or permitted covered fund activities. The type of compliance program required is determined based on the level of total consolidated assets held by the banking entity. Banking entities who, together with their affiliates and subsidiaries, have trading assets and liabilities (excluding obligations of or guaranteed by the United States or an agency of the United States) of, or greater than, $10 billion for four (4) consecutive quarters are subject to the standard compliance program. WesBanco is not subject to the standard compliance program, which imposes additional compliance program requirements, including a requirement to maintain additional documentation specific to covered fund activities. Regardless, WesBancos activities and investments are currently in full compliance with the Volcker Rule and its regulations and WesBanco has ensured that its compliance program meets the requirements of the standard compliance program. 
 Additionally, an interim final rule was issued in January 2014 that exempts investments in certain collateralized debt obligations backed primarily by trust preferred securities from the provisions of the Volcker Rule. This interim final rule was effective April 1, 2014 and did not have a material impact on WesBanco for the year ended December 31, 2018. 
 Passed in 2011, the Durbin Amendment requires the Federal Reserve to limit fee charges to retailers for debit card processing. The Federal Reserve Board promulgated Regulation II (Debit Card Interchange Fees and Routing) that limits the interchange fees paid by merchants to issuers when their debit cards are used as payment. An issuer is defined as any person that authorizes the use of the debit card to perform an electronic debit 
 
11 


  transaction. The application of the Durbin Amendment is determined by whether the issuer, together with its affiliates, has $10 billion in assets as of the end of the calendar year preceding the date of the electronic debit transaction. An affiliate is defined as any company that controls, or is controlled by, or is under common control with another company. Therefore, if an insured institution issues a debit card and it, together with its affiliates, has assets exceeding $10 billion, it is subject to this rule. The rule caps debit card interchange fees (also known as swipe fees) at $0.21 plus an additional 0.05% of the value of the transaction. Previously, the average interchange fee generated $0.44 per transaction for an insured institution. Financial institutions with more than $10 billion in assets by the year-end assessment deadline are subject to the cap on interchange income in July of the following year. As a result of the FTSB acquisition WesBanco and the Bank will be subject to the requirements imposed by the Durbin Amendment because, for purposes of determining whether an issuer has $10 billion in assets, the assets of the institution and its affiliates are combined, beginning in July of 2019. 
 Additionally, section 165(i)(2) of the Dodd-Frank Actas amended by the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection (EGRRCPA) Act, requires annual company-run stress tests for bank holding companies with total consolidated assets greater than $100 billion. Section 165(1)(2) also requires savings and loan holding companies and state member banks with $10 billion or more in total consolidated assets to conduct company-run stress tests until November 29, 2019, but the Federal Reserve Board, OCC, and FDIC have exempted savings and loan holding companies and state member banks with less than $100 billion in total consolidated assets from that requirement. After November 25, 2019, only savings and loan holding companies and state member banks with $250 billion or more in total consolidated assets will be subject to company-run stress tests. Total consolidated assets are reported on the insured institutions Call Report or the holding companys Consolidated Financial Statements for Holding Companies reporting form (FR Y-9C) and calculated over the four most recent consecutive quarters. The Federal Reserve Board and FDIC promulgated rules requiring these company-run stress tests. These rules establish the testing criteria, reporting requirements, and publication deadlines for all covered institutions, and are meant to be consistent across the federal banking agencies respective annual stress testing rules. 
 The Federal Reserve Board regulates bank holding companies, and therefore, if a bank holding company has total consolidated assets of $100 billion or more, it will be required to conduct the Federal Reserve Board stress-tests. WesBanco Bank, a subsidiary state nonmember bank, is governed by the FDIC. Under the FDIC rule, a covered bank includes any state nonmember bank . . . with average total consolidated assets . . . that are greater than $10 billion but less than $50 billion. However, the FDIC proposed a rule in December 2018 to conform this definition to Section 165 of the Dodd-Frank Act, as amended by the EGRRCPA, to state that a covered bank is a nonmember bank or state savings association with average total consolidated assets that are greater than $250 billion. WesBanco Bank has less than $100 billion in average total consolidated assets, and therefore, is not subject to the Federal Reserve Boards or the FDICs stress-test rules. 
 If the Dodd-Frank Act stress test rules were to apply at some point in the future, WesBanco must assess the potential impact of a minimum of three macroeconomic scenariosbaseline, adverse, and severely adverseon its consolidated losses, revenues, balance sheets (including risk-weighted assets) and capital. Each scenario includes economic variables, including macroeconomic activity, unemployment, exchange rates, prices, incomes and interest rates. The adverse and severely adverse scenarios are not forecasts, but rather hypothetical scenarios designed to assess the strength and resilience of financial institutions. Additionally, WesBanco must publicly disclose these test results on an annual basis. The required summary of results may be published on WesBancos web site or in any other forum that is reasonably accessible to the public. 
 As required by Section 165 of the Dodd-Frank Act, the Federal Reserve issued a rule that strengthens the supervision and regulation of large U.S. bank holding companies and foreign banking organizations by establishing a number of enhanced prudential standards. These standards include liquidity, risk management, and capital. Under the rule, a publicly traded bank holding company with $10 billion or more in consolidated assets is required to establish an enterprise-wide risk committee. However, the EGRRCPA raised the threshold to $50 billion. To conform the rule to the EGRRCPA, the Federal Reserve Board proposed a rule in November 2018 to increase the threshold to $50 billion. WesBanco is therefore, currently not subject to the Federal Reserve Enhanced Prudential Standards.

 The Dodd-Frank Act made several changes affecting the securitization markets, which may affect a banks ability or desire to use those markets to meet funding or liquidity needs. One of these changes calls for federal regulators to adopt regulations requiring the sponsor of a securitization to retain at least 5% of the credit risk, with exceptions for qualified residential mortgages. 
 Publicly traded companies are required by the Dodd-Frank Act to give shareholders an advisory vote on executive compensation, and, in some cases, golden parachute arrangements. Further, SEC and NASDAQ rulemaking under the Dodd-Frank Act requires NASDAQ-listed companies to have a compensation committee composed entirely of independent directors. WesBancos Compensation Committee members currently satisfy the independence criteria. The Dodd-Frank Act also called for regulators to issue new rules relating to incentive-based compensation arrangements deemed excessive, and proxy access by shareholders. The SEC has not issued rules relating to excessive compensation arrangements. 
 All banks and other insured depository institutions will have increased authority to open new branches across state lines (discussed above under Item 1. BusinessSupervision and Regulation). A provision authorizing insured depository institutions to pay interest on checking accounts will likely increase WesBancos interest expenses. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the CFPB), a federal agency created by the Dodd-Frank Act, has the authority to write rules implementing numerous consumer protection laws applicable to all banks (discussed below under Item 1. BusinessConsumer Protection Laws). 
 CONSUMER PROTECTION LAWS 
 In connection with its lending and leasing activities, all banks are subject to a number of federal and state laws designed to protect consumers and promote lending and other financial services to various sectors of the economy and population. These laws include the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Truth in Lending Act (TILA), the Truth in Savings Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA), the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, and, in some cases, their respective state law counterparts. The CFPB has consolidated the authority to write regulations implementing these and other laws. WesBancos other subsidiaries that provide services relating to consumer financial products and services will also be subject to the CFPBs regulations. As an institution with assets of less than $10 billion, WesBanco Bank has historically been examined by the FDIC for compliance with these rules. Through its recently completed acquisitions, the Banks assets have exceeded $10 billion for four consecutive quarters, and it has come under CFPB supervision and examination. Relating to mortgage lending, the Dodd-Frank Act authorized the CFPB to issue new regulations governing the ability to repay, qualified mortgages, mortgage servicing, appraisals and compensation of mortgage lenders, all of which have been issued and have taken effect. They limit the mortgage products offered by the Bank and have an impact on timely enforcement of delinquent mortgage loans. 
 The Dodd-Frank Act also directed the CFPB to integrate the mortgage loan disclosures under TILA and RESPA. The CFPB issued new integrated disclosures rules (TRID), which became effective October 3, 2015 and have combined the prior good faith estimate and truth in lending disclosure form into a new form, the loan estimate. They have also combined the HUD-1 and final truth in lending disclosure forms into a new form, the closing disclosure. The rule is extremely complex, contains significant uncertainties as to penalties, some of which can be quite material, contains prohibitions against correcting even technical mistakes, creates uncertainty regarding last minute changes in the transaction and has triggered significant ambiguity in compliance. Thus for covered transactions and most closed-end consumer credit transactions secured by real property, the TRID rules have presented significant and ongoing challenges to real estate lenders. 
 Federal law currently contains extensive customer privacy protection provisions. Under these provisions, a financial institution must provide to its customers, at the inception of the customer relationship and annually thereafter, the institutions policies and procedures regarding the handling of customers nonpublic personal financial information. These provisions also provide that, except for certain limited exceptions, an institution 
 
13 


  may not provide such personal information to unaffiliated third parties unless the institution discloses to the customer that such information may be so provided and the customer is given the opportunity to opt out of such disclosure. Federal law makes it a criminal offense, except in limited circumstances, to obtain or attempt to obtain customer information of a financial nature by fraudulent or deceptive means. 
 The CRA requires WesBanco Banks primary federal bank regulatory agency, the FDIC, to assess WesBanco Banks record in meeting the credit needs of the communities served by the bank, including low and moderate-income neighborhoods and persons. Institutions are assigned one of four ratings: Outstanding, Satisfactory, Needs to Improve or Substantial Noncompliance. This assessment is reviewed when a bank applies to merge or consolidate with or acquire the assets or assume the liabilities of an insured depository institution, or to open or relocate a branch office. The Banks ongoing community development efforts recently culminated with the FDIC assigning the Bank an Outstanding rating for the Banks community development performance under the CRA received on February 21, 2017. The FDIC assigned this rating based on its examination of our performance from 2013 through June 30, 2016. It is the highest rating awarded by federal regulators. The Bank also received the America Saves Designation of Savings Excellence for Banks, a designation from America Saves that recognizes banks that went above and beyond to encourage people to save money during America Saves Week 2016. WesBanco has worked with America Saves for more than ten years, and has been an active participant in America Saves Week since its inception in 2007. 
 SECURITIES REGULATION 
 WesBancos full service broker-dealer subsidiary, WesBanco Securities, is registered as a broker-dealer with the SEC and in the states in which it does business. WesBanco Securities also is a member of FINRA. WesBanco Securities is subject to regulation by the SEC, FINRA and the securities administrators of the states in which it is registered. WesBanco Securities is a member of the Securities Investor Protection Corporation, which in the event of the liquidation of a broker-dealer, provides protection for customers securities accounts held by WesBanco Securities of up to $500,000 for each eligible customer, subject to a limitation of $250,000 for claims for cash balances. 
 In addition, WesBanco Banks Investment Department serves as an investment adviser to a family of mutual funds and is registered as an investment adviser with the SEC and in some states. 
 On March 15, 2018, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit vacated the Department of Labors (DOL) regulation revising the definition of a fiduciary with respect to the Employment Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and the Internal Revenue Act of 1986 (the Fiduciary Rule) in a panel decision. On June 1, 2018, the full Court affirmed the panel courts decision. The DOL issued the Fiduciary Rule on April 8, 2016. The regulation categorized persons who provide investment advice or recommendations for a fee or other compensation to ERISA retirement plans and individual retirement accounts (hereinafter IRAs) as fiduciaries. After a brief delay of the compliance date issued by the DOL in April 2017 (the Delaying Rule), the Fiduciary Rules mandatory compliance date was set for June 9, 2017. Therefore, a firm whose activities were subject to the Fiduciary Rule was required to comply with ERISAs fiduciary requirements, prohibited transaction restrictions and conditions for reliance on any applicable exemptions, such as the best interest contract exemption (BIC Exemption). The Delaying Rule simplified the conditions required for compliance with the BIC Exemption during a Transition Period, which was originally scheduled to expire on January 1, 2018. On August 31, 2017, the DOL proposed a new rule to extend the Transition Period until July 1, 2019. The DOL published the final rule on November 29, 2017. On May 7, 2018, the DOL issued Field Assistance Bulletin No. 2018-02, announcing a temporary enforcement policy to not pursue claims against fiduciaries working in good faith to comply with the Fiduciary Rule and to allow institutions relying on the BIC Exemption to continue to do so.

 ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING INITIATIVES AND THE USA PATRIOT ACT 
 A major focus of governmental policy on financial institutions in recent years has been aimed at combating money laundering and terrorist financing. The USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 (the USA Patriot Act) substantially broadened the scope of United States anti-money laundering laws and regulations by imposing significant new compliance and due diligence obligations, creating new crimes and penalties and expanding the extra-territorial jurisdiction of the United States. The U.S. Treasury Department has issued various implementing regulations, which apply certain requirements of the USA Patriot Act to financial institutions, such as WesBanco Bank and WesBancos broker-dealer subsidiary. These regulations impose obligations on financial institutions to maintain appropriate policies, procedures and controls to detect, prevent and report money laundering and terrorist financing and to verify the identity of their customers. Failure of WesBanco and its subsidiaries to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, or to comply with all of the relevant laws or regulations, could have serious legal and reputational consequences for WesBanco and its subsidiaries.
