Item 1. | BUSINESS

OUR COMPANY 
TrueBlue, Inc. (the “company,” “TrueBlue,” “we,” “us” and “our”) is a leading provider of specialized workforce solutions that help clients achieve growth and improve productivity. We connected approximately 730,000 people with work during fiscal 2018, and served approximately 151,000 clients in a wide variety of industries through our PeopleReady segment which offers industrial staffing services, our PeopleManagement segment which offers contingent and productivity-based on-site industrial staffing services, and our PeopleScout segment which offers recruitment process outsourcing (“RPO”) and managed service provider (“MSP”) services. We are headquartered in Tacoma, Washington.
We began operations in 1989, specializing in on-demand general labor staffing services with the objective of providing clients with talent and flexible workforce solutions to enhance the performance of their businesses. We expanded our on-demand, general labor staffing services through organic geographic expansion throughout the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico. Commencing in 2004, we began expanding through acquisitions to provide a full range of blue-collar staffing solutions, and to help our clients be more productive with a reliable contingent labor workforce and rapidly respond to changing business needs. Commencing in 2014, we expanded through acquisitions to provide complementary outsourced service offerings in permanent employment RPO and employer recruitment branding services, as well as outsourced management of client’s contingent labor vendors. 
BUSINESS OVERVIEW
We report our business as three distinct reportable segments described below and in Note 17: Segment Information, to our consolidated financial statements found in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

PeopleReady provides access to reliable workers in the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico through a wide range of staffing solutions for on-demand contingent general and skilled labor. PeopleReady connects people to work in a broad range of industries that include construction, manufacturing and logistics, warehousing and distribution, waste and recycling, energy, retail, hospitality, and others.
PeopleReady helped approximately 150,000 clients in fiscal 2018 to be more productive by providing easy access to dependable, blue-collar contingent labor. Through our PeopleReady service line, we connected approximately 310,000 people with work in fiscal 2018. We have a network of 620 branches across all 50 states, Canada and Puerto Rico. Complementing our branch network is our mobile application, JobStackTM, which algorithmically connects workers with jobs, creates a virtual exchange between our workers and clients, and allows our branch resources to expand their recruiting and sales efforts and service delivery. JobStack is increasing the competitive differentiation of our services, expanding our reach into new demographics, and improving both service delivery and work order fill rates.

PeopleManagement provides contingent and productivity-based on-site industrial workforce solutions. In comparison with PeopleReady, services are larger in scale, longer in duration, and provided at the client’s facility.
We use the following distinct brands to market our PeopleManagement contingent workforce solutions:

• | Staff Management | SMX specializes in exclusive outsourced recruitment and on-premise management of the entire facility’s contingent industrial workforce, full shifts or complete functions of the industrial operations. We work closely with on-site management as an integral part of the production and logistics process. We provide scalable solutions to meet the volume requirements in labor-intensive manufacturing, warehousing and logistics. On-premise staffing is large-scale sourcing, screening, recruiting and management of the contingent workforce at a client’s facility in order to achieve faster hiring, lower total cost of workforce, increased safety and compliance, improved retention, greater volume flexibility, and enhanced strategic decision-making through robust reporting and analytics. Client contracts are generally multi-year in duration and pricing is typically based on an hourly rate per contingent worker. Pricing is impacted by factors such as geography, volume, job type, and degree of recruiting difficulty;


• | SIMOS Insourcing Solutions (“SIMOS”) specializes in exclusive outsourced recruitment and on-premise management of the entire warehouse operations or parts of warehouse operations in order to reduce costs and improve performance. SIMOS systematically analyzes and improves business processes in a client’s facilities and manages the contingent workforce with incentives to drive performance improvements in cost, quality and on-time delivery. Our unique productivity model incorporates fixed price-per-unit solutions to drive client value. Additionally, our continuous analysis and improvement of processes and incentive pay drives workforce efficiency, reduces costs, lowers risk of injury and damage, and improves productivity and service levels;


• | Centerline Drivers (“Centerline”) specializes in providing dedicated and temporary truck drivers to the transportation and distribution industries. Centerline delivers compliant drivers specifically matched to each client’s needs, allowing them to improve productivity, control costs and deliver improved service.

Effective March 12, 2018, we divested the PlaneTechs business. For additional information, see Note 3: Acquisitions and Divestiture, to our consolidated financial statements found in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
PeopleScout provides permanent employee RPO for our clients. Our RPO solution serves many major industries and job types. Our RPO solution delivers improved talent quality and candidate experience, faster hiring, increased scalability, reduced turnover, lower cost of recruitment, greater flexibility, and increased compliance. We leverage our proprietary AffinixTM technology platform for sourcing, screening and delivering a permanent workforce, along with dedicated service delivery teams to work as an integrated partner with our clients in providing end-to-end talent acquisition services from employer branding, to candidate sourcing and engagement, through onboarding employees. Our solution is highly scalable and flexible, allowing for outsourcing of all or a subset of skill categories across recruitment marketing and a series of recruitment processes and onboarding steps. Client contracts are generally multi-year in duration and pricing is typically composed of a fee for each hire and talent consulting fees. Pricing is impacted by factors such as geography, volume, job type, degree of recruiting difficulty, and the scope of outsourced recruitment and employer branding services included.
PeopleScout also includes our MSP business which manages our clients’ contingent labor programs including vendor selection, performance management, compliance monitoring and risk management. As the client’s exclusive MSP, we have dedicated service delivery teams which work as an integrated partner with our client to increase the productivity of their contingent workforce program.
Effective June 12, 2018, we acquired TMP Holdings LTD (“TMP”) through our PeopleScout subsidiary. Accordingly, the results associated with the acquisition are included in our PeopleScout operating segment. TMP is a mid-sized RPO and employer branding practice operating in the United Kingdom, which is the second largest RPO market in the world. This acquisition increases our ability to win multi-continent engagements by adding a physical presence in Europe, referenceable clients and employer branding capabilities. For additional information, see Note 3: Acquisitions and Divestiture, to our consolidated financial statements found in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

INDUSTRY AND MARKET DYNAMICS
The staffing industry, which includes our PeopleReady and PeopleManagement services, supplies contingent workforce solutions to minimize the cost and effort of hiring and managing permanent employees. This allows for rapid response to changes in business conditions through the ability to replace absent employees, fill new positions, and convert fixed or permanent labor costs to variable costs. Staffing companies act as intermediaries in matching available temporary workers to employer work assignments. The work assignments vary widely in duration, skill level, and required experience. The staffing industry is large and highly fragmented with many competing companies. No single company has a dominant share of the industry. Staffing companies compete both to recruit and retain a supply of temporary workers, and to attract and retain clients who will employ these workers. Client demand for contingent staffing services is dependent on the overall strength of the economy and workforce flexibility trends. This creates volatility for the staffing industry based on overall economic conditions. Historically, in periods of economic growth, the number of companies providing contingent workforce solutions has increased due to low barriers to entry whereas during recessionary periods, the number of companies has decreased through consolidation, bankruptcies, or other events.
Our solutions address the following key trends contributing to anticipated staffing growth:

• | Workforce flexibility: The staffing industry continues to experience increased demand in relation to total job growth as demand for a flexible workforce continues to grow with competitive and economic pressures to reduce costs, meet dynamic seasonal demands, and respond to rapidly changing market conditions.


• | Workforce productivity: Companies are under increasing competitive pressures to improve productivity through workforce solutions that improve performance.


• | Worker preferences and access to talent: Workers are demanding more flexibility in how, when and where they work as well as access to contingent work opportunities through mobile technology. Baby boomers are leaving the workforce and leaving a talent shortage in what have traditionally been blue-collar trades. The remaining workers are in greater demand and have more power to find the employment situation they want or stay busy working on a contingent basis.

The human resource outsourcing industry involves transitioning various functions handled by internal human resources and labor procurement to outside service providers on a permanent or project basis. Human resource departments are faced with increasingly complex operational and regulatory requirements, a tightening labor market, increased candidate expectations, an expanding talent technology landscape, and pressure to achieve efficiencies, which increase the need to migrate non-core functions to outsourced providers. The human resource outsourcing industry includes RPO and MSP solutions which allow clients to more effectively find and engage high-quality talent, leverage talent acquisition technology, and scale their talent acquisition function to keep pace with changing business needs. PeopleScout is a leader in RPO and MSP services, which are in the early stages of their adoption cycles, and therefore, we believe they continue to have significant growth potential.
 Our solutions address the following key trends contributing to anticipated RPO growth:

• | Talent access and engagement: As competition for qualified candidates increases, clients are relying on RPO providers to elevate the employer brand, build talent communities, create a world class candidate experience, leverage innovative talent technology, and facilitate effective recruitment marketing and candidate communication strategies.


• | Leveraging talent acquisition technology: Automation, artificial intelligence and machine learning are transforming talent acquisition, and the fragmented talent technology ecosystem is becoming more crowded, with significant investments flowing in and new technology coming online rapidly. RPO providers are continuously identifying, evaluating and investing in new technology to leverage as part of their talent technology stack to best meet today’s candidate’s expectations of a personalized, mobile-optimized and efficient hiring process. RPO providers are uniquely positioned to successfully integrate and deploy new talent technology based on the volume of candidate engagements they manage and their understanding of the talent landscape, thereby reducing the investments required to be made by clients.


• | Scalability: RPO providers can add significant scalability to a company’s recruiting and hiring efforts, including accommodating seasonal, project or peak hiring needs without sacrificing quality. Providers also help clients increase efficiency and drive better performance by standardizing processes and reducing time to fill and onboard the best fit talent into a client’s organization, and enabling clients to focus on their core business.

Our solutions address the following key trends contributing to anticipated MSP growth:

• | Vendor consolidation and cost savings: As an organization’s spend on contingent workforce rises, it becomes increasingly interested in reducing the administrative burden of managing multiple outside vendors, having consistency among contractors and processes, and maintaining robust performance tracking and analytics. Vendor consolidation can achieve significant efficiencies through enhanced scale and cost advantages such as single point of contact, standardized contracts, and consolidated invoicing and reporting.


• | Access to talent: An MSP solution allows a company access to a large variety of staffing vendors with the efficiency of working with one supplier. An MSP can access numerous vendors to find the best talent at the best price more quickly, thereby delivering a better outcome for the client.


• | Compliance pressure: Demand for temporary employee sourcing and workforce vendor management solutions is driven by increasing work eligibility legislation and compliance monitoring to ensure correct worker classification in order to properly address tax withholding, overtime, Social Security, unemployment and health care obligations to avoid government penalties and lawsuits.

BUSINESS STRATEGY
Market leadership through organic growth of our specialized workforce solutions
Our clients have a variety of challenges in running their businesses, many of which are unique to the industries in which they operate, their competitive pressures, and business performance. We are industry leaders dedicated to staffing solutions tailored to our clients’ needs and the industries in which they operate. Our differentiated solutions keep pace with their changing needs and are as follows:

• | We will continue to evaluate opportunities to expand our market presence for specialized blue-collar staffing services and expand our geographical reach through new physical locations, expand use of existing locations to provide the full range of blue-collar staffing services, and dispatch of our temporary workers to areas without branches. Continued investment in specialized sales, recruiting and service expertise will create a more seamless experience for our clients to access all of our services with more comprehensive solutions to enhance their performance and our growth. Our service lines offer complementary workforce solutions with unique value propositions to meet our clients’ demand for talent.


• | We will continue to invest in technology that increases our ability to attract more clients and employees as well as reduce the cost of delivering our services. We are committed to leveraging technology to improve the temporary worker and client experience. Our technological innovation makes it easier for our clients to do business with us and easier to connect workers to work opportunities. We are making significant investments in online and mobile applications to improve the access, speed and ease of connecting our clients with both high-quality temporary and permanent employee workforce solutions.


◦ | We introduced our mobile application, JobStack, and completed the roll out to our temporary workers in 2017. We rolled out JobStack to our clients in 2018 and now over 30% of all PeopleReady jobs are filled through JobStack. This has created a virtual exchange between our workers and clients, which allows our branch resources to expand their recruiting and sales efforts and service delivery. JobStack is increasing the competitive differentiation of our services, expanding our reach into new demographics, and improving both service delivery and work order fill rates. We will be adding functionality to further enhance both client and associate retention.


◦ | We introduced a mobile-first, cloud-based proprietary platform, Affinix, in 2017 for sourcing, screening and delivering a permanent workforce. Affinix creates a consumer-like candidate experience and streamlines the sourcing process. Affinix delivers speed and scalability while leveraging recruitment marketing, machine learning, predictive analytics and other emerging technology to make the end-to-end process seamless for the candidate.


• | We are well positioned for growth by providing our clients with the talent and flexible workforce solutions they need to enhance business performance. With growing demand for improved productivity and accessing temporary workers, our clients are looking for a full range of workforce services.

• | We are recognized as an industry leader for RPO services. The RPO industry is in the early stages of its adoption cycle, and therefore, we believe it has significant growth potential. The success of early adopters is generating greater opportunity to expand our service offering. We have a differentiated service that leverages innovative technology for high-volume sourcing and dedicated client service teams for connecting people to opportunities. We have a track record of helping our clients reduce the cost of hiring, add significant scalability to recruiting and hiring, and access numerous sources to prospect for the best talent quickly, thereby delivering a better outcome for the client. Companies are facing rapidly changing employment demographics, a shortage of talent, and dynamic changes to how people connect to work opportunities. Our solution addresses these growing challenges. We expanded our services with the TMP acquisition. TMP is a mid-sized RPO and employer branding practice operating in the United Kingdom, which is the second largest RPO market in the world. This acquisition increases our ability to win multi-continent engagements by adding a physical presence in Europe, referenceable clients, and employer branding capabilities.


• | Our MSP solution is focused on domestic middle-market companies with a growing dependence on contingent labor. Our managed service provider solutions have enabled our clients to efficiently source, engage, fulfill, measure and manage all categories of contingent and externally sourced labor. We believe our MSP solution is uniquely positioned to manage the full range of our clients’ labor needs.

Growth through strategic acquisitions
Strategic acquisitions continue to be a key growth strategy with a focus on globalizing our RPO services. We believe we have a core competence in assessing, valuing and integrating acquisitions culminating in higher shareholder returns. We are excited about the future of human resource outsourcing and believe we can continue to create shareholder value through acquisitions, which expand our service offerings in high-growth markets, enhance our use of technology to better serve our clients, and increase our own efficiency.
CLIENTS
Our clients range from small and medium-sized businesses to Fortune 100 companies.
During fiscal 2018, we served approximately 151,000 clients in industries including construction, energy, manufacturing, warehousing and distribution, waste and recycling, energy, transportation, retail, hospitality, general labor, and many more. Our ten largest clients accounted for 16.1% of total revenue for fiscal 2018, 17.6% for fiscal 2017 and 19.9% for fiscal 2016. Our single largest client for fiscal 2018 accounted for 2.9% of total company revenue.
No single client represented more than 10.0% of total company revenue for fiscal 2018, 2017 or 2016.
EMPLOYEES
As of December 30, 2018, we employed approximately 6,700 full-time equivalent employees.
TEMPORARY WORKERS
We recruit temporary workers daily so that we can be responsive to the planned and unplanned needs of the clients we serve. We attract our pool of temporary workers through our proprietary mobile applications, online resources, extensive internal databases, advertising, job fairs and various other methods. We identify the skills, knowledge, abilities and personal characteristics of a temporary worker and match their competencies and capabilities to a client’s requirements. This enables our clients to obtain immediate value by placing a highly productive employee on the job site. We use a variety of proprietary programs and methods for identifying and assessing the skill level of our temporary workers when selecting a particular individual for a specific assignment and retaining those workers for future assignments. We believe that our programs and methods enable us to offer a higher quality of service by increasing productivity, decreasing turnover, reducing absenteeism, and improving worker safety.
We provide a bridge to permanent, full-time employment for thousands of temporary workers each year. Workers also come to us because of the flexibility we offer to fill a short-term financial need and/or provide longer-term contingent flexible labor opportunities. Workers may be assigned to different jobs and job sites, and their assignments could last for as little as a few hours or extend for several weeks or months. We provide our workers meaningful work and the opportunity to improve their skills. We are considered the legal employer of our workers, and laws regulating the employment relationship are applicable to our operations. We consider our relations with our temporary workers to be good.

We remain focused and committed to worker safety. We have developed an integrated risk management program that focuses on loss analysis, education and safety improvement programs to reduce our operational costs and risk exposure. We regularly analyze our workers’ compensation claims to identify trends. This allows us to focus our resources on those areas that may have the greatest impact on us, price our services appropriately, and adjust our sales and operational approach in these areas. We have also developed educational materials for distribution to our clients and workers to address specific safety risks unique to their industry.
COMPETITION
Contingent staffing services 
The strongest staffing services competitor in a particular market is a company with established relationships and a track record of meeting the client’s needs. We compete with other large publicly-held staffing companies as well as privately-owned staffing companies on a national, regional and local level. We also experience competition from internet-based companies providing a variety of flexible workforce solutions. Competition exists in attracting clients as well as qualified temporary workers for our clients. No single company has a dominant share of the industry. Competitive forces have historically limited our ability to raise our prices to immediately and fully offset increased costs of doing business, some of which include increased temporary worker wages, costs for workers’ compensation, unemployment insurance and health care.
The most significant competitive factors are price, ability to promptly fill client orders, success in meeting clients’ expectations of recruiting temporary workers, and appropriately addressing client service issues. We believe we derive a competitive advantage from our service history and our specialized approach in serving the industries of our clients. Our national presence, industry specialization, investment in technology, and proprietary systems and processes, together with specialized programs focused on worker safety, risk management, and legal and regulatory compliance are key differentiators from many of our competitors.
Human resource outsourcing
The strongest competitors are companies specializing in RPO services and business process outsourcing companies that also offer RPO services. No one provider dominates the market. Competition also includes internal human resource departments that have not or are not considering outsourcing. The most significant competitive factors for RPO services are the ability to reduce client cost by deploying an RPO solution and reducing the internal human resource cost structure of our clients. Important factors for success in RPO services include the ability to add significant scalability to a client’s recruiting and hiring efforts, including accommodating seasonal and irregular hiring; the ability to increase efficiency by standardizing processes and facilitating transitions for candidates and employees; and the ability to source the most attractive talent at the best price. Our tailored solutions, client partnership, proprietary technology and service delivery are key differentiators from many of our competitors.
CYCLICAL AND SEASONAL NATURE OF OUR BUSINESS
The workforce solutions business has historically been cyclical, often acting as an indicator of both economic downturns and upswings. Clients tend to use temporary workers to supplement their existing workforce and generally hire permanent workers when long-term demand is expected to increase. As a consequence, our revenues tend to increase quickly when the economy begins to grow. Conversely, our revenues also decrease quickly when the economy begins to weaken and thus temporary staff positions are eliminated, permanent hiring is frozen, and turnover replacement diminishes.
Our business experiences seasonal fluctuations for contingent staffing services. Demand is lower during the first and second quarters, in part due to limitations to outside work during the winter months and slowdown in manufacturing and logistics after the holiday season. Our working capital requirements are primarily driven by temporary worker payroll and client accounts receivable. Since receipts from clients lag payroll to temporary workers, working capital requirements increase substantially in periods of growth. Demand for contingent labor peaks during the third quarter for outdoor work and the fourth quarter for manufacturing, assembly, warehousing, distribution and logistics for the holiday season.
REGULATION
Our services are subject to a variety of complex federal and state laws and regulations. We continuously monitor legislation and regulatory changes for their potential effect on our business. We invest in technology and process improvements to implement required changes while minimizing the impact to our operating efficiency and effectiveness. Regulatory cost increases are passed through to our clients to the fullest extent possible.
