Dividends and Other Distributions 
Zai Lab Limited is a holding company, and we may rely on dividends and other distributions on equity paid by our Chinese subsidiaries for our cash and financing requirements, including the funds necessary to pay dividends and other cash distributions to our shareholders or holders of our ADSs or to service any debt we may incur. If any of our Chinese subsidiaries incur debt on their own behalf in the future, the instruments governing such debt may restrict their ability to pay dividends to us. To date, there have not been any such dividends or other distributions from our Chinese subsidiaries to our subsidiaries located in or outside of mainland China. In addition, as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, none of our subsidiaries have ever issued any dividends or distributions to us or their respective shareholders in or outside of mainland China, and neither Zai Lab Limited nor any of our subsidiaries has ever directly or indirectly paid dividends or made distributions to U.S. investors. Zai Lab (Shanghai) Co., Ltd., an operating subsidiary of ours that is domiciled in mainland China, received $416.5 million in capital contributions via twenty-three separate contributions from Zai Lab (Hong Kong) Limited, its sole shareholder, domiciled outside of mainland China, from 2014 to 2023 to fund its business operations in mainland China. Zai Lab International Trading (Shanghai) Co., Ltd., an operating subsidiary of ours that is domiciled in mainland China, received RMB1.0 million in capital contributions via contributions from Zai Lab (Shanghai) Co., Ltd., its sole shareholder, in 2019 to fund its business operations in mainland China. Zai Lab (Suzhou) Co., Ltd., an operating subsidiary of ours that is domiciled in mainland China, received RMB166.5 million in capital contributions via ten separate contributions from Zai Lab (Hong Kong) Limited, its sole shareholder, domiciled outside of mainland China, from 2015 to 2019 to fund its business operations in mainland China. Zai Lab Trading (Suzhou) Co., Ltd., an operating subsidiary of ours that is domiciled in mainland China, received RMB1.0 million in capital contributions via contributions from Zai Lab (Suzhou) Co., Ltd., its sole shareholder, in 2020 to fund its business operations in mainland China. Zai Biopharmaceutical (Suzhou) Co., Ltd., an operating subsidiary of ours that is domiciled in mainland China, received $15.0 million in capital contributions via four separate contributions from Zai Lab (Hong Kong) Limited, its sole shareholder, domiciled outside of mainland China, from 2017 to 2018 to fund its business operations in mainland China. In the future, cash proceeds raised from our overseas financing activities may be transferred by us to our Chinese subsidiaries via capital contributions, shareholder loans or intercompany loans. 
According to the Foreign Investment Law of the People’s Republic of China and its implementing rules, which jointly established the legal framework for the administration of foreign-invested companies, a foreign investor may, in accordance with other applicable laws, freely transfer into or out of mainland China its contributions, profits, capital earnings, income from asset disposal, intellectual property rights, royalties acquired, compensation, or indemnity legally obtained, and income from liquidation, made or derived within the territory of mainland China in RMB or any foreign currency, and any entity or individual shall not illegally restrict such transfer in terms of the currency, amount, and frequency. According to the Company Law of the People’s Republic of China and other Chinese laws and regulations, our Chinese subsidiaries may pay dividends only out of their respective accumulated profits as determined in accordance with Chinese accounting standards and regulations. In addition, each of our Chinese subsidiaries is required to set aside at least 10% of its accumulated after-tax profits, if any, each year to fund a certain statutory reserve fund until the aggregate amount of such fund reaches 50% of its registered capital. Where the statutory reserve fund is insufficient to cover any loss the Chinese subsidiary incurred in the previous financial year, its current financial year’s accumulated after-tax profits shall first be used to cover the loss before any statutory reserve fund is drawn therefrom. Such statutory reserve funds and the accumulated after-tax profits that are used for covering the loss cannot be distributed to us as dividends. At their discretion, our Chinese subsidiaries may allocate a portion of their after-tax profits based on Chinese accounting standards to a discretionary reserve fund. 
Renminbi, or RMB, is not freely convertible into other currencies. As a result, any restriction on currency exchange may limit the ability of our Chinese subsidiaries to use their potential future RMB revenues to pay dividends to us. The 
-2-


Chinese government imposes controls on the convertibility of RMB into foreign currencies and, in certain cases, the remittance of currency out of mainland China. Shortages in availability of foreign currency may then restrict the ability of our Chinese subsidiaries to remit sufficient foreign currency to our offshore entities for those offshore entities to pay dividends or make other payments or otherwise to satisfy our foreign-currency-denominated obligations. RMB is currently convertible under the “current account,” which includes dividends and trade- and service-related foreign exchange transactions, but not under the “capital account,” which includes foreign direct investment and foreign debt (which may be denominated in foreign currency or RMB), including loans we may secure for our Chinese subsidiaries. Currently, our Chinese subsidiaries may purchase foreign currency for settlement of current account transactions, including payment of dividends to us, without the approval of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange of China (“SAFE”) by complying with certain procedural requirements. However, the relevant Chinese governmental authorities may limit or eliminate our ability to purchase foreign currencies in the future for current account transactions. The Chinese government may continue to strengthen its capital controls, and additional restrictions and substantial vetting processes may be instituted by SAFE for cross-border transactions falling under both the current account and the capital account. Any existing and future restrictions on currency exchange may limit our ability to utilize revenue generated in RMB to fund our business activities outside of mainland China or pay dividends in foreign currencies to holders of our securities. Foreign exchange transactions under the capital account remain subject to limitations and require approvals from, or registration with, SAFE and other relevant Chinese governmental authorities. This could affect our ability to obtain foreign currency through debt or equity financing for our subsidiaries. See Part I—Item 1A. Risk Factors for a detailed discussion of the Chinese legal restrictions on the payment of dividends, our ability to transfer cash within the Company, and the potential for holders of our ADSs and ordinary shares to be subject to Chinese taxes on dividends paid by us in the event we are deemed a Chinese resident enterprise for Chinese tax purposes.

ZEJULA (Niraparib)
-3-


ZEJULA is an oral, once-daily small-molecule poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (“PARP”) 1/2 inhibitor. A PARP inhibitor blocks the ability of cancer cells to repair themselves after they have been damaged by radiation and certain chemotherapies. This inhibition of DNA damage repair can result in the inability of cancer cells to replicate themselves and in programmed cell death. Tumors that are deficient in key DNA damage repair pathways, such as BRCA1 mutant tumors, are particularly sensitive to ZEJULA. As maintenance therapy, ZEJULA is for women who have had prior chemotherapy treatment but are at high risk of cancer recurrence. ZEJULA is intended to avoid or slow a recurrence of the cancer if it is in remission after prior treatment. In the maintenance setting, ZEJULA does not require the addition of radiation or chemotherapies to kill tumor cells. 
Since 2016, we have had an exclusive license agreement with Tesaro Inc. (a company later acquired by GSK) to develop and commercialize ZEJULA in mainland China, Hong Kong, and Macau for all potential indications except prostate cancer. For more information on this collaboration and license agreement, see Part I—Item 1. Business—Overview of Significant License and Strategic Collaboration Agreements—GSK (Niraparib). 
ZEJULA is currently marketed in the United States, Europe, Greater China, Canada, Australia, and certain other countries/regions. ZEJULA was first approved in 2017 by the FDA for the maintenance treatment of adult patients with recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who exhibit a complete or partial response to platinum-based chemotherapy and by the EMA as a monotherapy for the maintenance treatment of adult patients with platinum-sensitive, relapsed high-grade serous epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who are in complete response or partial response to platinum-based chemotherapy. Subsequently, in 2019, the FDA approved ZEJULA for treatment of patients with advanced ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer treated with three or more prior chemotherapy regimens whose cancer is associated with homologous recombination deficiency (“HRD”)-positive status. And, in 2020, the FDA approved it as a monotherapy in first-line maintenance treatment of women with advanced ovarian cancer who are in complete or partial response to first-line platinum-based chemotherapy regardless of biomarker status, and the EMA approved it as a first-line monotherapy maintenance treatment for adult patients with advanced epithelial (FIGO Stages III and IV) high-grade ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who are in complete or partial response following platinum-based chemotherapy regardless of biomarker status. 
The NMPA approved ZEJULA as a maintenance therapy for adult patients in mainland China with recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer, who are in complete or partial response to platinum-based chemotherapy in December 2019 and as a maintenance therapy for adult patients in mainland China with advanced epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer, who are in complete or partial response to first-line platinum-based chemotherapy in September 2020. 
Throughout this year, the FDA has been reviewing data on PARP inhibitors, and other companies have issued Dear HCP Letters in the U.S. as a result of ongoing discussions with the FDA. In September 2022, GSK disclosed that it was in discussions with the FDA to discuss overall survival (“OS”) data from GSK’s ENGOT-OV16/NOVA Phase III clinical trial for adult patients with recurrent ovarian cancer irrespective of the gBRCA mutation. We do not expect the FDA’s discussions with GSK to impact our approval from the NMPA for ZEJULA in China. The NMPA’s full approval of ZEJULA for patients with recurrent ovarian cancer is based on a separate study, the NORA study, which is a Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of ZEJULA that the Company independently conducted in China. While the NORA study is not fully mature, to date, favorable trends have been observed in OS irrespective of gBRCA mutation status. In December 2022, we presented new interim OS data in Chinese patients with platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer (“PSROC”) from the Phase III NORA study for ZEJULA at the European Society for Medical Oncology (“ESMO”) Virtual Plenary. Median OS was numerically longer for patients receiving ZEJULA regardless of biomarker status, at 46.3 months compared to 43.4 months in the placebo group, and no new safety issues were identified. As a result, we do not anticipate that our second-line all-comer label in China will be affected by the FDA’s discussions with GSK. We also do not expect a change in our first-line label for ZEJULA; the FDA’s discussions with GSK do not apply to this indication. In February 2023, the NMPA approved ZEJULA as a first-line ovarian cancer maintenance treatment; this complete approval was based on data from the Phase III PRIME study in China.
Market Opportunity for ZEJULA
We have completed several studies evaluating ZEJULA as a treatment for Chinese patients with ovarian cancer, which is one of the most common gynecological cancers in China, with over 55,000 newly diagnosed cases and 37,000 deaths in China annually.
We launched ZEJULA in mainland China in January 2020 after ZEJULA was approved by the NMPA in December 2019 as a maintenance treatment for women with recurrent platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer. In September 2020, ZEJULA was approved by the NMPA as a maintenance treatment for adult patients with advanced epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who are in a complete or partial response to first-line platinum-based

chemotherapy. In December 2020, ZEJULA was included in the NRDL as maintenance therapy for adult patients with recurrent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer (collectively, termed as ovarian cancer) who are in a complete or partial response to platinum-based chemotherapy, and in December 2021, ZEJULA was included in the NRDL as a first-line maintenance treatment of adult patients with advanced ovarian cancer following a response to platinum-based chemotherapy. 
We also previously launched ZEJULA in Hong Kong in December 2018 for adult patients with platinum-sensitive, relapsed high-grade, serous epithelial ovarian cancer who are in a complete response or partial response to platinum-based chemotherapy after approval by the Hong Kong Department of Health. In August 2021, the Hong Kong Department of Health approved our post-approval variation for ZEJULA as a maintenance treatment for adult patients with high-grade serous epithelial ovarian cancer who are in a complete response or partial response to first-line platinum-based chemotherapy. ZEJULA was approved and launched in Macau for the same indication.
For details about our clinical development of ZEJULA, see Part I—Item 1. Business—Our Oncology Pipeline—Additional Indications for ZEJULA.
Optune (Tumor Treating Fields)
Tumor Treating Fields (or “TTFields”) is a cancer therapy that uses electric fields tuned to specific frequencies to disrupt cell division, inhibiting tumor growth, causing cancer cell death, decreasing cell migration, and inhibiting DNA damage response. TTFields therapy is delivered through a portable medical device. The complete delivery system, called Optune or Optune Lua, includes a portable electric field generator, arrays, rechargeable batteries, and accessories. Sterile, single-use arrays are placed directly on the skin in the region surrounding the tumor and connected to the electric field generator to deliver therapy. Arrays are changed when hair growth or the hydrogel reduces array adhesion to the skin. The therapy is designed to be delivered continuously throughout the day and night, and efficacy is strongly correlated to time on therapy. When the device is turned on, TTFields are continuously generated within the specific region of the body covered by the arrays. Healthy tissues located outside of this region remain unaffected by the therapy. 
Since 2018, we have had an exclusive license from NovoCure to develop and commercialize Optune in Greater China in all human therapeutic and preventive uses in the field of oncology. For more information on this license and collaboration agreement, see Part I—Item 1. Business—Overview of Significant License and Strategic Collaboration Agreements—NovoCure (Tumor Treating Fields). 
TTFields is currently marketed in the United States, Greater China, Europe, Japan, and certain other countries/regions. In 2015, Optune was approved by the FDA for the treatment of adult patients with newly diagnosed GBM in combination with temozolomide (“TMZ”), a chemotherapy drug, and for adult patients with GBM following confirmed recurrence after chemotherapy as monotherapy treatment. In May 2020, the NMPA approved the Marketing Authorization Application (“MAA”) for Optune in combination with TMZ for the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed GBM and also as a monotherapy for the treatment of patients with recurrent GBM. Optune is also approved or has a CE certificate for the treatment of GBM in the European Union, Japan, and certain other countries. 
In May 2019, NovoCure received FDA approval for the use of Optune Lua as a Humanitarian Use Device in combination with chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of adult patients with unresectable, locally advanced, or metastatic MPM. MPM is a type of cancer that occurs in the thin layer of tissue in the torso covering internal organs. In November 2022, the MAA for MPM was accepted by the NMPA.
Market Opportunity for Optune
GBM, a malignant form of astrocytoma, is the most aggressive form of brain cancer. In mainland China during 2019, GBM represented about 46% of all newly diagnosed cases of brain cancer, with an estimated annual incidence of 15,134 patients in 2020. GBM is treated mainly by surgery, radiotherapy, and TMZ. Despite these treatments, prospects for long-term survival remain poor. In mainland China, the five-year survival rate of GBM patients is less than 5%. Optune is the first treatment approved by the NMPA for GBM in mainland China since 2007. 
We launched Optune in Hong Kong in 2018 and in mainland China in June 2020 after the NMPA approved Optune in May 2020 in combination with TMZ for the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed GBM and also as a monotherapy for the treatment of patients with recurrent GBM. As of December 31, 2022, Optune was listed in 87 regional customized commercial health insurance plans guided by provincial or municipal governments throughout mainland China, or supplemental insurance plans, up from 33 as of December 31, 2021. Enrollment into these regional reimbursement programs has improved, and we expect will continue to improve, access to Optune for patients in need across mainland China.

We launched Optune Lua, a portable medical device that delivers TTFields for the treatment of unresectable, locally advanced, or metastatic MPM in Hong Kong in August 2020 and in Macau in October 2020. 
For more information about our clinical development of TTFields, see Part I—Item 1. Business—Our Oncology Pipeline—Additional Indications for Tumor Treating Fields. 
QINLOCK (Ripretinib)
QINLOCK is an orally administered switch-control tyrosine kinase inhibitor that was engineered to broadly inhibit KIT and PDGFRα mutated kinases by using a dual mechanism of action that regulates the kinase switch pocket and activation loop. 
Since 2019, we have had an exclusive license from Deciphera to develop and commercialize QINLOCK in Greater China for the prevention, prophylaxis, treatment, cure, or amelioration of any disease or medical condition in humans. For more information on this license agreement, see Part I—Item 1. Business—Overview of Significant License and Strategic Collaboration Agreements—Deciphera (Ripretinib). 
QINLOCK is currently approved and marketed in the United States, Greater China, Canada, Australia, and certain other countries/regions for the treatment of fourth-line advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumor (“GIST”). In May 2020, the FDA approved QINLOCK for adult patients with GIST who have received prior treatment with three or more kinase inhibitors, including imatinib. QINLOCK was approved for the treatment of adult patients with advanced GIST who have received prior treatment with three or more kinase inhibitors, including imatinib, by the NMPA, Hong Kong Department of Health, and Taiwan Food and Drug Administration in March 2021, February 2020, and September 2021, respectively. In January 2023, QINLOCK was approved for the treatment of adult patients with advanced GIST who have received prior treatment with three or more kinase inhibitors, including imatinib, in Macau.
In January 2023, Deciphera presented additional data from the planned exploratory analysis from the INTRIGUE Phase III clinical study of QINLOCK using circulating tumor DNA (“ctDNA”) for second-line GIST patients. Patients with mutations in KIT exon 11 and exon 17/18 only derived substantially improved clinical benefit with QINLOCK versus sunitinib. Deciphera plans to initiate the INSIGHT pivotal Phase III clinical study of QINLOCK versus sunitinib in second-line GIST patients with mutations in KIT exon 11 and 17/18 only in the second half of 2023.
Market Opportunity for QINLOCK
We launched QINLOCK in mainland China in May 2021, after receiving NMPA approval in March 2021, and we are focused on the commercialization of QINLOCK for the treatment of fourth-line GIST in Greater China, where we believe QINLOCK is the standard of care. GISTs are the most common mesenchymal tumors, accounting for about 1/20 of gastrointestinal tumors, with an estimated annual incidence of around 20,000 to 30,000 newly diagnosed patients per year in mainland China.
In January 2023, QINLOCK was included in the NRDL for the treatment of advanced GIST patients who have received prior treatment with three or more kinase inhibitors in the all-comer setting. 
NUZYRA (Omadacycline)
NUZYRA is a once-daily oral and intravenous antibiotic in a new class of tetracycline derivatives known as aminomethylcyclines. NUZYRA is primarily being developed by our partner Paratek Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Paratek”) for the treatment of adults with CABP and ABSSSI in both hospital and community settings. 
Since 2017, we have had an exclusive license from Paratek to develop, manufacture, and commercialize NUZYRA in Greater China in all human therapeutic and preventive uses other than biodefense. For more information on this license and collaboration agreement, see Part I—Item 1. Business—Overview of Significant License and Strategic Collaboration Agreements—Paratek (Omadacycline). 
NUZYRA is currently marketed in the United States and mainland China. In October 2018, NUZYRA was approved by the FDA for once-daily oral or intravenous (“IV”) administration for the treatment of adults with CABP and ABSSSI. In December 2021, the NMPA approved NUZYRA as a category 1 innovative drug for the treatment of patients with CABP and ABSSSI for both oral and IV formulation. NUZYRA is locally manufactured by CMOs in mainland China. 
Market Opportunity for NUZYRA
The World Health Organization has identified the worldwide development of resistance to currently available antibacterial agents as one of the greatest threats to human health. In 2020, the estimated incidence of CABP in mainland 
-6-


China was approximately 10 million patients, and in 2015, the estimated incidence of ABSSSI in mainland China was 2.8 million patients. 
We launched NUZYRA in mainland China in December 2021. In January 2023, NUZYRA was included in the NRDL for the treatment of adults with CABP and ABSSSI for IV formulation.

Additional Indications for ZEJULA
ZEJULA is a once-daily small-molecule poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 1/2, or PARP 1/2, inhibitor. 
-7-


As discussed above, we have the exclusive right to develop and commercialize ZEJULA in our licensed territories for all potential indications except prostate cancer pursuant to an exclusive license agreement with GSK. For more information on this collaboration and license agreement, see Part I—Item 1. Business—Overview of Significant License and Strategic Collaboration Agreements—GSK (Niraparib). 
Our partner GSK is building a niraparib clinical development program by assessing activity across multiple tumor types and by evaluating several potential combinations of niraparib with other therapeutics. For the treatment of ovarian cancer, two Phase III studies, PRIMA and NOVA, have been completed to evaluate ZEJULA (niraparib) as monotherapy maintenance treatment in patients with first-line and recurrent ovarian cancer, respectively. 
We continue to explore the use of ZEJULA, including the combination potential of ZEJULA with immuno-oncology therapy, targeted therapy, and chemotherapy in clinically relevant indications. 
Additional Indications for Tumor Treating Fields
TTFields therapy is a cancer treatment that uses electric fields tuned to specific frequencies to disrupt cancer cell division. 
As discussed above, we have an exclusive license from NovoCure to develop and commercialize Optune in Greater China in all human therapeutic and preventive uses in the field of oncology. For more information on this license and collaboration agreement, see Part I—Item 1. Business—Overview of Significant License and Strategic Collaboration Agreements – NovoCure (Tumor Treating Fields). 
NovoCure continues to test TTFields against a broad range of solid tumor types, including NSCLC, gastric cancer, and pancreatic cancer. We have enrolled, or intend to enroll, patients in Greater China in the various global trials for TTFields. The studies currently underway affect over 1.8 million new patients a year in China.
We are participating in the Phase III pivotal LUNAR trial, which is intended for patients who have recently been diagnosed with progression of NSCLC during or after platinum-based therapy. Lung cancer has the highest total incidence of any cancer in mainland China. According to the World Health Organization, the incidence of lung cancer in mainland China in 2020 was 815,563 cases, with 714,699 deaths. In mainland China, the five-year survival rate of lung cancer is estimated to be about 20%. Lung cancer consists of NSCLC in approximately 85% of cases and small cell lung cancer (“SCLC”) in approximately 15% of cases. In January 2023, Zai Lab and NovoCure announced that the pivotal LUNAR study for patients with stage 4 NSCLC who progressed during or after platinum-based therapy met its primary endpoint, demonstrating a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in overall survival over standard therapies alone. The LUNAR study also showed a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in overall survival when patients were treated with TTFields and immune checkpoint inhibitors, as compared to those treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors alone, and a positive trend in overall survival when patients were treated with TTFields and docetaxel versus docetaxel alone. TTFields therapy was well tolerated by patients enrolled in the experimental arm of the study. 
We are participating in the EF-31 Phase II pilot study evaluating the safety and efficacy of TTFields together with standard-of-care treatment (chemotherapy alone or in combination with trastuzumab for HER2-positive patients) as a first-line treatment in patients with gastric cancer. In June 2022, we and NovoCure announced that this study met its primary endpoint of objective response rate with supportive signals across secondary endpoints. TTFields therapy was well tolerated, with no increase in the systemic toxicity of the XELOX chemotherapy regimen or the combination regimen, and no high-grade skin toxicities were reported. Initial analysis was conducted with a median follow-up period of 8.6 months. The primary endpoint, confirmed objective response rate, was 50%. Median progression-free survival was 7.8 months. Duration of response was 10.3 months. Median overall survival has not yet been reached with a one-year survival rate of 72%. Gastric cancer is the third most-frequent cancer in China. According to the World Health Organization, more than one million new gastric cancer cases are diagnosed worldwide in 2020, and approximately half of all gastric cancer cases occur in China. Currently, the five-year survival rate of locally advanced or metastatic gastric cancer ranges from 5% to 20%, and the median overall survival is approximately one year. 
In March 2022, NovoCure announced the results of a pre-specified interim analysis for the global Phase III pivotal INNOVATE-3 study evaluating the safety and efficacy of TTFields together with paclitaxel for the treatment of patients with platinum-resistant ovarian cancer. An independent data monitoring committee reviewed the safety data for all platinum-resistant ovarian cancer patients enrolled in the trial. The pre-specified interim analysis concluded that the INNOVATE-3 study should proceed to the final analysis as planned. Data will be reviewed in 2023, following an 18-month follow-up period.
We are participating in the PANOVA-3 Phase III pivotal trial of TTFields for pancreatic cancer. In February 2023, NovoCure announced that the last patient has been enrolled in this study. PANOVA-3 is a global, open-label, randomized Phase III trial evaluating the efficacy of TTFields administered concomitantly with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel as 
-8-


front-line treatment for patients with unresectable, locally advanced pancreatic cancer. The primary endpoint is overall survival. Secondary endpoints include progression-free survival, local progression-free survival, objective response rate, one-year survival rate, quality of life, pain-free survival, respectability rate, and toxicity. According to the World Health Organization, pancreatic cancer was the eighth-leading cancer type in mainland China in 2020, with an estimated 124,994 newly diagnosed cases and 121,853 deaths. The current median survival of patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer is four to six months, and the five-year survival rate is 7.2%, making it the malignancy with the lowest survival rate in mainland China. 
We are also participating in the pivotal METIS study evaluating the efficacy of TTFields therapy following stereotactic radiosurgery for treatment of patients with brain metastases resulting from NSCLC. In March 2023, NovoCure announced that the last patient has been enrolled in this study.
In September 2021, NovoCure announced that the FDA had granted breakthrough designation to the NovoTTF-200T System, a TTFields delivery system, for use with atezolizumab and bevacizumab for the first-line treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic liver cancer. We expect to participate in the global Phase III study for liver cancer. 
MARGENZA™ (margetuximab)
Margetuximab is an investigational, immune-enhancing monoclonal antibody that targets HER2-expressing tumors, including certain types of breast and gastroesophageal cancers. 
Since 2018, we have had an exclusive license from MacroGenics to develop and commercialize MARGENZA in Greater China in all human fields of use. For more information on the collaboration agreement, see Part I—Item 1. Business—Overview of Significant License and Strategic Collaboration Agreements – MacroGenics (including Margetuximab and Tebotelimab). 
In December 2020, the FDA approved MARGENZA for use in the United States, in combination with chemotherapy, for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who have received two or more prior anti-HER2 regimens, at least one of which was for metastatic disease. 
In January 2022, the NMPA accepted the NDA for review of margetuximab for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer who have received two or more prior anti-HER2 regimens, at least one of which was for metastatic disease, in combination with chemotherapy. 
TIVDAK (Tisotumab vedotin)
TIVDAK is an antibody drug conjugate (“ADC”) composed of Genmab’s human monoclonal antibody directed against cell surface tissue factor (“TF”) and Seagen’s ADC technology that utilizes a protease-cleavable linker that covalently attaches the microtubule-disrupting agent monomethyl auristatin E (“MMAE”) to the antibody. MMAE disrupts the microtubule network of actively dividing cells, leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptotic cell death of actively dividing cells. In vitro, TIVDAK also mediates antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (“ADCP”) and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (“ADCC”). 
Since September 2022, we have had an exclusive license from Seagen to develop and commercialize TIVDAK in Greater China. For more information on this collaboration and license agreement, see Part I—Item 1. Business—Overview of Significant License and Strategic Collaboration Agreements – Seagen (TIVDAK).
In 2021, TIVDAK was approved in the United States for the treatment of adult patients with recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer with disease progression on or after chemotherapy and is an important addition to our oncology portfolio. We are participating in the global Phase III confirmatory innovaTV 301 study in second- or third-line recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer, and we treated the first patient in China in February 2023.
KRAZATI™ (Adagrasib)
Adagrasib is a highly selective and potent oral small-molecule inhibitor of KRASG12C for treating KRAS-G12C-mutated NSCLC, colorectal cancer (“CRC”), pancreatic cancer, and other solid tumors. 
Since May 2021, we have had an exclusive license from Mirati to develop and commercialize adagrasib in Greater China. For more information on the collaboration and license agreement, see Part I—Item 1. Business—Overview of Significant License and Strategic Collaboration Agreements – Mirati (Adagrasib).

Mirati is conducting several studies of adagrasib for the treatment of KRASG12C-mutated NSCLC, CRC, pancreatic cancer, and other solid tumors. We have enrolled, or intend to enroll, patients in Greater China in various global trials for adagrasib.
In December 2022, the FDA approved adagrasib for the treatment of patients with NSCLC who harbor the KRASG12C mutation who have received at least one prior systemic therapy. 
Adagrasib was also granted accelerated approval by the FDA in December 2022 for adult patients with KRASG12C-mutated locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC who have received at least one prior systemic therapy. We seek to leverage the global data package for the FDA approval, the ongoing PK study in China, and the global confirmatory KRYSTAL-12 study to obtain regulatory approval in China. We are participating in the global Phase III KRYSTAL-12 study and treated the first patients in Greater China in July 2022. 
In December 2022, the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation to adagrasib in combination with cetuximab for the treatment of patients with KRASG12C-mutated, advanced CRC whose cancer has progressed following prior treatment with chemotherapy and an anti-VEGF therapy. This designation is supported by results from the Phase Ib cohort of the KRYSTAL-1 trial. The FDA also granted accelerated approval for KRAZATI as a targeted treatment option for adult patients with KRASG12C-mutated locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC who have received at least one prior systemic therapy. We will continue to participate in the global Phase III KRYSTAL-10 study, which we joined in June 2022. 
For first-line NSCLC, we are participating in the global Phase II KRYSTAL-7 study of adagrasib in combination with pembrolizumab in first-line KRASG12C-mutated NSCLC patients, and we treated the first patient in Greater China in August 2022. In December 2022, Mirati reported results from the KRYSTAL-7 Phase II trial and KRYSTAL-1 Phase Ib cohort evaluating adagrasib concurrent combined with pembrolizumab in patients for the treatment of first-line NSCLC harboring a KRASG12C mutation across all PD-L1 subgroups. These results are the first to demonstrate the tolerability and feasibility of a concurrent combination regimen of a KRASG12C inhibitor and a PD-1/L1 checkpoint inhibitor. 
In September 2022, Mirati presented results from KRYSTAL-1, a multicohort Phase I/II study evaluating adagrasib with or without cetuximab in patients with advanced CRC harboring a KRASG12C mutation. Of the evaluable patients in the adagrasib monotherapy cohort (n=43), the investigator assessed confirmed objective response rate (“ORR”) was 19% (8/43), and the disease control rate (“DCR”) was 86% (37/43). The median duration of response (“DOR”) was 4.3 months (95% CI, 2.3–8.3), and median PFS was 5.6 months (95% CI, 4.1–8.3). Of the evaluable patients in the adagrasib plus cetuximab combination cohort (n=28), the investigator assessed confirmed ORR was 46% (13/28), and the DCR was 100% (28/28). The median DOR was 7.6 months (95% CI 5.7–NE), and median PFS was 6.9 months (95% CI, 5.4–8.1). The prognosis for patients with CRC has historically been poor in later lines of therapy with response rates of approximately 1-2% and median PFS of approximately 2 months in patients with late-line CRC; patients with KRASG12C-mutated CRC tend to have even worse outcomes than the broader CRC patient population. In the overall subset of patients with KRASG12C-mutated CRC evaluated in this study, adagrasib was found to be well-tolerated as a monotherapy and in combination with cetuximab. The majority of observed treatment-related adverse events (“TRAEs”) were grade 1-2 (59%); no grade 5 TRAEs were observed.
In June 2022, Mirati presented full results from the registration-enabling Phase II cohort of the KRYSTAL-1 study evaluating adagrasib in patients with previously treated NSCLC harboring a KRASG12C mutation. This presentation included results from a retrospective subgroup analysis from the Phase II NSCLC cohort of the KRYSTAL-1 study evaluating adagrasib in patients with KRASG12C-mutated NSCLC and stable, previously treated central nervous system (“CNS”) metastases. The initial clinical results from the Phase II registration-enabling study (n=112) showed that the ORR was 43%, the disease control rate (“DCR”) was 80%, the median duration of response (“mDOR”) was 8.5 months (95% confidence interval (“CI”): 6.2 – 13.8), and the mPFS was 6.5 months (95% CI: 4.7 – 8.4). With a January 15, 2022 data cutoff, the median overall survival (“mOS”) was 12.6 months (95% CI: 9.2 – 19.2). With respect to CNS-specific activity in a subset analysis of stable, previously treated CNS metastases (n=33), results revealed an intracranial (“IC”) ORR of 33% (11/33). Mirati also reported updated findings from a pooled analysis from the KRYSTAL-1 study, including the registrational Phase II and Phase I/Ib NSCLC cohorts. The initial results of the pooled analysis of KRYSTAL-1 NSCLC cohorts (n=132) showed that the ORR was 44%, the DCR was 81%, the mDOR was 12.5 months, and the mPFS was 6.9 months. With a January 15, 2022 data cutoff, the mOS was 14.1 months.
In June 2022, Mirati also announced the results of a prospective analysis from the Phase Ib cohort of the KRYSTAL-1 study evaluating IC responses of adagrasib in patients with KRASG12C-mutated advanced NSCLC with active and untreated CNS metastases. The results of the CNS-specific activity in active and untreated CNS metastases (n=19) showed an IC ORR of 32% (6/19).

In January 2022, Mirati announced positive results from a Phase II cohort of the KRYSTAL-1 study evaluating adagrasib at the 600mg BID dose in patients with pretreated pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and other gastrointestinal (“GI”) tumors harboring a KRASG12C mutation, including cancers of the biliary tract, appendix, small bowel, gastro-esophageal junction, and esophagus. Results showed that adagrasib demonstrated significant clinical activity and broad disease control. Of the evaluable patients (n=27), the ORR was 41% and the DCR was 100%. In the overall subset of patients with KRAS-G12C-mutated GI cancers evaluated in this cohort, adagrasib was well-tolerated, with a manageable safety profile. 
Bemarituzumab
Bemarituzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody (IgG1 isotype) specific to the human FGFR2b receptor that is in clinical development as a targeted therapy for gastric and GEJ cancer patients whose tumors overexpress FGFR2b. 
Since 2017, we have had an exclusive license from Five Prime Therapeutics, Inc. (“Five Prime”) (a company later acquired by Amgen) to develop and commercialize bemarituzumab in Greater China for the treatment or prevention of any disease or condition in humans. For more information on this license agreement, see Part I—Item 1. Business—Overview of Significant License and Strategic Collaboration Agreements—Amgen (Bemarituzumab). 
In September 2021, the Center for Drug Evaluation (“CDE”) of the NMPA granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation for bemarituzumab (FPA144) for first-line treatment for patients with FGFR2b-overexpressing and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (“HER2”)-negative metastatic and locally advanced gastric and GEJ cancers in combination with modified FOLFOX6 (fluoropyrimidine, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin). 
Amgen is conducting a registrational Phase III program for bemarituzumab in first-line advanced gastric and GEJ cancer. This program is evaluating bemarituzumab in combination with either backbone chemotherapy or chemotherapy plus a checkpoint inhibitor. We plan to join the global Phase 3 FORTITUDE-101 study in first-line gastric cancer in China in mid-2023. 
Amgen continues to enroll patients in several studies of bemarituzumab, including: FORTITUDE-101, a Phase III study of bemarituzumab plus chemotherapy, versus placebo plus chemotherapy in first-line gastric cancer with FGFR2b overexpression, and FORTITUDE-102, the Phase III portion of the Ib/III study of bemarituzumab plus chemotherapy and nivolumab versus chemotherapy and nivolumab in first-line gastric cancer with FGFR2b overexpression. We expect to join the global Phase III FORTITUDE-101 study in China around mid-2023.
In the second quarter of 2022, Amgen reported that the final analysis of the FIGHT study, a Phase II randomized, double-blind, controlled study evaluating bemarituzumab and modified FOLFOX6 (“mFOLFOX6”) in patients with previously untreated advanced gastric and gastroesophageal junction cancer was completed, with results continuing to demonstrate that bemarituzumab + mFOLFOX6 improves the clinical outcome of patients with FGFR2b expressing tumors with no new safety concerns and noting that a greater survival benefit was observed with increasing FGFR2b expression levels. In addition, Amgen initiated a Phase Ib/II FORTITUDE-310 study evaluating the safety and efficacy of bemarituzumab monotherapy in solid tumors with FGFR2b overexpression.
Odronextamab
Odronextamab is an investigational bispecific monoclonal antibody designed to trigger tumor killing by linking and activating a cytotoxic T-cell (binding to CD3) to a lymphoma cell (binding to CD20). Odronextamab has demonstrated clinical activity in heavily pre-treated patients with late stages of follicular lymphoma (“FL”), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (“DLBCL”), and other B-cell lymphomas in a Phase I trial and is currently being investigated in a potentially registrational Phase II program. 
Since April 2020, we have had an exclusive license from Regeneron Ireland Designated Activity Company, an affiliate of Regeneron, to develop and commercialize odronextamab for oncology in Greater China. For more information on the collaboration agreement, see Part I—Item 1. Business—Overview of Significant License and Strategic Collaboration Agreements—Regeneron (Odronextamab). 
We have received Clinical Trial Application (“CTA”) approval in mainland China for, and have joined, the open-label, multi-center, global, registrational Phase II program evaluating the efficacy and safety of odronextamab in several disease-specific cohorts, including patients with relapsed/refractory (“R/R”) FL and DLBCL. In December 2022, Regeneron announced positive first interim data from the ELM-2 Phase II trial in patients with heavily pre-treated, R/R FL and DLBCL. The data were presented at the 64th American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting. In the FL cohort, odronextamab showed the highest CR rates observed in this late-stage setting to date. In the DLBCL cohort, the ORRs are comparable in patients regardless of CAR-T experience. The modified step-up dosing regimen appears to demonstrate an 
-11-


improved safety profile with consistent efficacy resulting in lower rates of treatment discontinuations, interruptions, dose reductions, and dose delay. There is zero Gr3+ CRS event for both the FL and DLBCL cohorts. 
Repotrectinib
Repotrectinib is an investigational next-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor (“TKI”) designed to effectively target ROS1 and TRK A/B/C in TKI-naïve or TKI-pretreated cancer patients. 
Since July 2020, we have had an exclusive license from Turning Point Therapeutics (a company later acquired by BMS) to develop and commercialize repotrectinib in Greater China in all human therapeutic indications. For more information on this license agreement, see Part I—Item 1. Business—Overview of Significant License and Strategic Collaboration Agreements—BMS (Repotrectinib). 
The FDA has granted two Breakthrough Therapy Designations for repotrectinib for: 
•Patients with advanced solid tumors that have an NTRK gene fusion who have progressed following treatment with one or two prior TRK TKIs, with or without prior chemotherapy, and have no satisfactory alternative treatments; 
•Patients with ROS1-positive metastatic NSCLC who have not been treated with a ROS1 TKI. 
The FDA has also granted four Fast-Track designations for repotrectinib for: 
•Patients with ROS1-positive advanced NSCLC who have not been previously treated with a ROS1 TKI; 
•Patients with ROS1-positive advanced NSCLC who have been previously treated with one prior line of platinum-based chemotherapy and one prior ROS1 TKI; 
•Patients with ROS1-positive advanced NSCLC pretreated with one prior ROS1 TKI without prior platinum-based chemotherapy; and 
•Patients with advanced solid tumors who have an NTRK gene fusion and who have progressed following treatment with at least one prior line of chemotherapy and one or two prior TRK TKIs and have no satisfactory alternative treatments. 
Repotrectinib was also granted Orphan Drug Designation by the FDA in 2017. 
We are participating in the global TRIDENT-I study for repotrectinib for the treatment of patients with ROS1-positive metastatic NSCLC who have not been treated with a ROS1 TKI. In April 2022, we announced topline data for repotrectinib within the China region from the previously disclosed Phase I/II TRIDENT-1 study dataset. 
•In TKI-naïve patients (EXP-1), in 71 total patients, there was a confirmed objective response rate (cORR) of 79% across the global trial. Ten of 11 patients responded within China for a cORR of 91% (95% CI: 59,100) and DOR ranged from 3.6+ to 7.5+ months with a median duration of follow-up of 3.7 months.
•In patients previously treated with 1 TKI and platinum-based chemotherapy (EXP-2), in 26 total patients, there was a cORR of 42% across the global trial. Two of 3 patients responded within China for a cORR of 67% (95% CI:9,99) and DOR ranged from 3.6+ to 3.7+ months with a median duration of follow-up of 3.7 months.
•In patients previously treated with two TKIs without prior chemotherapy (EXP-3), in 18 total patients, there was a cORR of 28% across the global trial. Two of 4 patients responded within China for a cORR of 50% (95% CI: 7,93) and DOR ranged from 1.9+ to 3.4+ months with a median duration of follow-up of 2.6 months.
•In patients previously treated with 1 TKI without prior chemotherapy (EXP-4), in 56 total patients, there was a cORR of 36% across the global trial. Four of 11 patients responded within China for a cORR of 36% (95% CI: 11,69) and DOR ranged from 2.0+ to 3.7+ months with a median duration of follow-up of 3.1 months.
In October 2022, Turning Point provided a clinical data update from the global, registrational Phase I/II TRIDENT-1 study of repotrectinib. Repotrectinib continued to demonstrate meaningful clinical activity in patients with ROS1+ advanced NSCLC, who were TKI-naïve or TKI-pretreated, including with ROS1 G2032R resistance mutation. Durable responses and intracranial efficacy were observed in both TKI-naïve and TKI-pretreated patients. Repotrectinib also continued to show clinical activity in patients with NTRK+ advanced solid tumors who were TKI-naïve or TKI-pretreated, and responses were seen across diverse tumor types. Safety is well characterized, manageable with known protocols, and signals potential compatibility with long-term use. Also in October 2022, we completed enrollment in China in all cohorts of the registrational Phase I/II TRIDENT-1 study.

In February 2022, the CDE of the NMPA granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation for repotrectinib for the treatment of patients with ROS1-positive metastatic NSCLC who have not been treated with a ROS1 TKI. The breakthrough therapy designation was supported by the initial data from both global and Chinese TKI-naïve ROS1-positive NSCLC patients enrolled in the Phase I/II TRIDENT-1 study. In June 2022, the CDE of the NMPA granted two additional Breakthrough Therapy Designations for investigational repotrectinib for the treatment of patients with ROS1-positive metastatic NSCLC who have received one prior line of ROS1 TKI and one prior line of platinum-based chemotherapy and for the treatment of patients with ROS1-positive metastatic NSCLC who have received one prior line of ROS1 TKI and no chemotherapy or immunotherapy. These Breakthrough Therapy Designations were supported by the data from both global and Chinese TKI-pretreated ROS1-positive NSCLC patients enrolled in the Phase I/II TRIDENT-1 study. We expect to discuss with the NMPA the regulatory pathway at a pre-NDA meeting in the first quarter of 2023 and submit an NDA to the NMPA for ROS1+ advanced NSCLC in 2023.
Zipalertinib (previously CLN-081)
Zipalertinib (previously CLN-081) is an orally available small molecule designed as a next-generation, irreversible epidermal growth factor receptor (“EGFR”) inhibitor in development by Cullinan Pearl, a subsidiary of Cullinan Oncology, Inc., for the treatment of patients with EGFR exon 20 insertion NSCLC. 
Since December 2020, we have had an exclusive license from Cullinan Pearl (a company later acquired by Taiho) for the research, development, manufacturing, and commercialization of Zipalertinib in Greater China in all uses in humans and animals. For more information on this license agreement, see Part I—Item 1. Business—Overview of Significant License and Strategic Collaboration Agreements – Taiho (Zipalertinib). 
In January 2022, Cullinan Oncology announced that the FDA had granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation for CLN-081 for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC harboring EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations who have previously received platinum-based systemic chemotherapy. 
Cullinan Pearl is conducting a Phase I/IIa dose escalation and expansion trial evaluating oral, twice-daily administration of various doses of CLN-081 in patients with NSCLC harboring EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations who have had at least one prior treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy or another approved standard therapy. In June 2022, Cullinan Oncology presented updated data from this study. Of the 39 patients in the 100 mg BID dose group: 16 (41%) had a confirmed PR; the estimated mDOR was greater than 21 months; mPFS was 12 months; and the safety profile of CLN-081 was amenable for long-term treatment. 
Taiho initiated a pivotal study of zipalertinib in patients with EGFR exon 20 insertion NSCLC progressing after prior systemic therapy in the fourth quarter of 2022. 
Elzovantinib (TPX-0022)
Elzovantinib is an orally bioavailable multi-targeted kinase inhibitor with a novel three-dimensional macrocyclic structure that inhibits the MET, CSF1R (colony stimulating factor 1 receptor), and SRC kinases.
In January 2021, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Turning Point to develop and commercialize elzovantinib in Greater China. For further details of the exclusive license, see Part I—Item 1. Business—Overview of Significant License and Strategic Collaboration Agreements—BMS (TPX-0022).
ZL-2313 (BLU-945)
BLU-945 is a selective and potent investigational oral EGFR inhibitor designed to selectively target the EGFR L858R activating mutation as well as C797X and T790M on-target resistance mutations, while being highly selective against wild-type EGFR. BLU-945 is in development for the potential treatment of EGDR-mutant NSCLC. 
Since November 2021, we have had an exclusive license from Blueprint to develop and commercialize BLU-945 and BLU-701 and certain other forms thereof, including backup compounds, in mainland China. For more information on this license and collaboration agreement, see Part I—Item 1. Business—Overview of Significant License and Strategic Collaboration Agreements—Blueprint (BLU-945 and BLU-701). 
In April 2022, Blueprint announced the proof-of-concept data from the Phase I/II SYMPHONY clinical trial of BLU-945 in advanced EGFR-driven NSCLC patients at the 2022 American Association for Cancer Research (“AACR”) Annual Meeting. The preliminary trial results showed early evidence of safety and clinical activity consistent with preclinical data, supporting plans to expand development of BLU-945 in combination with multiple agents including Osimertinib. Blueprint Medicines is initiating a cohort in the ongoing Phase I/II SYMPHONY trial assessing BLU-945 in 
-13-


combination with osimertinib in patients with second-line or later EGFR-mutant NSCLC. In November 2022, Blueprint presented an update on the Phase I/II SYMPHONY trial data supporting plans to develop BLU-945 in combination with osimertinib in first-line EGFR L858R mutation-positive NSCLC. We expect an initial clinical data update on the SYMPHONY trial expansion of BLU-945 in combination with osimertinib in first-line EGFR L858R-positive NSCLC in the second half of 2023.
ZL-1211 (Claudin18.2)
ZL-1211 is a humanized, IgG1 monoclonal antibody engineered to promote enhanced ADCC that specifically targets CLDN18.2. In preclinical models, ZL-1211 has achieved more potent activity in a wider spectrum of high- and low-CLDN18.2 expressing tumors than other agents in the class. CLDN18.2 has recently emerged as a novel target for gastric cancer and a promising target for therapeutic intervention.
In January 2022, we initiated dosing of a Phase I clinical trial for ZL-1211 in patients with advanced solid tumors. We will present translational and clinical biomarker data for ZL-1211 at the upcoming American Association for Cancer Research conference. Depending on the results of this trial, we may proceed with a Phase II clinical trial. 
ZL-1218 (CCR8)
ZL-1218 is humanized, IgG1 monoclonal antibody that binds to human CCR8 with high affinity and specificity to induce potent ADCC activity enabling strong NK cell-mediated killing of CCR8-expressing T-regs. In preclinical models, we show that in human CCR8 knock-in mouse models bearing syngeneic tumors, ZL-1218 reduces intra-tumoral T-reg cells and thus elicits significant tumor growth inhibition in a dose dependent manner. Preclinical studies also suggest the potential of ZL-1218 in combination immunotherapy, with enhanced anti-tumor activity when ZL-1218 is combined with an anti-PD-1 agent.
We expect to initiate a global Phase I clinical trial for ZL-1218 as monotherapy and in combination with an anti-PD1 mAb in the first half of 2023.
Our Autoimmune Disorder Pipeline
VYGART® (Efgartigimod)
Efgartigimod is an investigational antibody fragment designed to reduce disease-causing immunoglobulin G (“IgG”) antibodies and block the IgG recycling process. Efgartigimod binds to the neonatal Fc receptor (“FcRn”), which is widely expressed throughout the body and plays a central role in rescuing IgG antibodies from degradation. 
Since January 2021, we have had an exclusive license from argenx to develop and commercialize efgartigimod in Greater China. For more information on this collaboration and license agreement, see Part I—Item 1. Business—Overview of Significant License and Strategic Collaboration Agreements – argenx (Efgartigimod). 
In December 2021, the FDA approved efgartigimod for the treatment of generalized myasthenia gravis (“gMG”) in adult patients who are anti-acetylcholine receptor (“anti-AchR”) antibody positive, and it was approved for the same indication in Europe in August 2022. These patients represent approximately 85% of the total gMG population. In January 2022, efgartigimod was approved for intravenous use for the treatment of adult patients with gMG who do not have sufficient response to steroids or non-steroidal immunosuppressive therapies by Japan’s Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare. 
In November 2022, the FDA accepted for priority review a Biologics License Application (“BLA”) for SC efgartigimod for the treatment of adult patients with gMG who are anti-AchR antibody positive. The Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”) date is June 20, 2023. 
 In June 2022, efgartigimod was introduced to the Hainan Bo’ao Lecheng International Medical Tourism Pilot Zone, and the first Chinese patient was treated with efgartigimod. In July 2022, the NMPA accepted our NDA for efgartigimod alfa injection for the treatment of adult patients with gMG in mainland China. This NDA was supported by two pharmacokinetic studies we conducted in Greater China. 
As of December 31, 2022, VYVGART had been listed in 15 supplemental insurance plans in China.
We are participating in the Greater China portion of several studies evaluating efgartigimod, including the registrational ADHERE study of subcutaneous (“SC”) efgartigimod in adult patients with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (“CIDP”), Phase III ADDRESS study of efgartigimod in patients with pemphigus vulgaris (“PV”) or pemphigus foliaceus (“PF”), and Phase III ADVANCE-SC study of SC efgartigimod in patients with primary 
-14-


immune thrombocytopenia (“ITP”). In addition, in February 2023, we initiated enrollment of two proof-of-concept trials in autoimmune rental diseases.
ZL-1102 (IL-17)
ZL-1102 is a human Humabody® targeting the interleukin-17A, or IL-17A, cytokine with high affinity and avidity. It is a Vh fragment of the human IgG and about 1/10th of the molecular weight of a full IgG. This feature may enable enhanced penetration of the psoriatic skin barrier compared to the current marketed anti-IL17 antibodies, thereby potentially avoiding the toxicities observed by systemic exposure. In May 2018, we entered into an exclusive worldwide license agreement with Crescendo Biologics Limited to develop, manufacture and commercialize CB001 Humabody®, an antibody VH domain therapeutic. 
The accepted approach to treatment for mild to moderate chronic plaque psoriasis is different from that for moderate to severe psoriasis. For mild to moderate psoriasis patients, topical treatment is often the first-line choice, and dermatologists tend to avoid systemic treatment. For patients with moderate to severe disease, the use of systemic treatments is usually preferred, and dermatologists often choose IL-17 monoclonal antibodies because they result in excellent response rates. However, therapy with systemic IL-17 antibodies can result in safety issues due to immunosuppression; therefore, labeling is restricted to more severely affected patient populations. As with other full-size monoclonal antibodies, current IL-17-directed antibodies must be administered by intravenous or subcutaneous injection. It is conventionally assumed that antibodies and other macromolecules do not penetrate skin. 
We are conducting a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase Ib proof-of-concept patient study showing that our formulation of ZL-1102, topically applied to lesions, can penetrate psoriatic plaques. Despite a short treatment course (1 month), these changes affected the lesional PASI score which may be indicative of early clinical benefit. In September 2022, we presented results of the Phase 1 proof-of-concept study for ZL-1102 at the 2022 European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology Congress in Milan, Italy. We plan to move ZL-1102 into full global development and initiate a global Phase II study for chronic plaque psoriasis. Our initial plans to initiate the global Phase II study were delayed as manufacturing issues resulted in a program delay. We now anticipate starting this study in 2023. 
Our Infectious Disease Pipeline
Sulbactam/Durlobactam (SUL-DUR)
Sulbactam/durlobactam (“SUL-DUR”) is a combination of a beta-lactam antibiotic (sulbactam) and a beta-lactamase inhibitor (durlobactam) for the treatment of serious infections caused by Acinetobacter, including multidrug-resistant (“MDR”) and carbapenem-resistant strains. Acinetobacter belongs to a group of bacteria commonly found in the environment, such as soil and water. Acinetobacter baumannii accounts for most Acinetobacter infections in humans; the organism can cause infections in all organs, but bloodstream infection and pneumonia are most dangerous and associated with high mortality. In recent years, A. baumannii has become multi-drug resistant, including resistant to the penem class of antibiotics. There are few non-toxic and effective antibiotics left for clinicians. In China, Acinetobacter baumannii infections are often seen in the hospital setting, and approximately 54% of such infections are the result of Acinetobacter baumannii MDR isolates and carbapenemase-producing isolates (“carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii” or “CRAB”). 
Since April 2018, we have had an exclusive license from Entasis to develop and commercialize durlobactam with sulbactam (the combination, SUL-DUR) in all human diagnostic, prophylactic, and therapeutic uses in Greater China, Korea, Vietnam, Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines, Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan. For more information on this license and collaboration agreement, see Part I—Item 1. Business—Overview of Significant License and Strategic Collaboration Agreements—Entasis (SUL-DUR). 
In September 2017, the FDA granted SUL-DUR Qualified Infectious Disease Product, Fast-Track and Priority Review status for the treatment of hospital-acquired and ventilator-acquired bacterial pneumonia and bloodstream infections due to Acinetobacter. We completed a pharmacokinetic study in the fall of 2020 for SUL-DUR in mainland China in normal healthy volunteers. 
Entasis submitted an NDA to the FDA in September 2022, which was accepted for priority review with an action date of May 29, 2023. We submitted an NDA to the NMPA in December 2022 for the treatment of infections caused by Acinetobacter baumannii, including multidrug-resistant and CRAB strains, which was granted priority review status in January 2023 and accepted in February 2023. 
We are participating in the global Phase III registrational ATTACK trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of SUL-DUR versus colistin in patients with infections caused by Acinetobacter baumannii. In April 2022, Entasis announced 
-15-


topline results from the ATTACK trial at the 32nd European Congress of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases Annual Conference in Lisbon, Portugal. The primary efficacy endpoint was met, and the study showed a reduced mortality rate with SUL-DUR versus colistin in the CRAB population. The primary efficacy endpoint, 28-day all-cause mortality (“ACM”) in the CRAB-calcoaceticus (“CRABC”) m-MITT cohort (those in the ITT population who received any study drug and had a CRABC organism isolated at baseline) (n=125) was 19.0% (12/63) and 32.3% (20/62) for SUL-DUR versus colistin, respectively (difference -13.2% [95% CI: -30.0%, 3.5%]). At Test of Cure, there was a statistically significant difference in clinical response favoring SUL-DUR over colistin. The clinical cure rates at test-of-cure (“TOC”) were 61.9% (39/63) and 40.3% (25/62) for SUL-DUR versus colistin (difference 21.6% [95% CI: 2.9%, 40.3%]). SUL-DUR also met the primary safety objective of the study achieving statistically significant reduction in nephrotoxicity. A statistically significant reduction in nephrotoxicity was observed with SUL-DUR compared to colistin: 13.2% (12/91) versus 37.6% (32/85) (difference -24.4% [p=0.0002]). Treatment-related TEAEs were 12.1% (11/91) and 30.2% (26/86) in the SUL-DUR and colistin groups, respectively. In October 2022, Entasis presented additional safety and efficacy data at the annual meeting of the Infectious Disease Society of America that reinforced the positive safety and efficacy data Entasis had previously disclosed from its topline data analysis.
Our Neuroscience Pipeline
KarXT (xanomeline-trospium)
KarXT (xanomeline-trospium) is an oral, investigational M1/M4-preferring muscarinic acetylcholine receptor agonist in development for the treatment of psychiatric and neurological conditions, including schizophrenia and dementia-related psychosis. KarXT preferentially stimulates muscarinic receptors in the central nervous system implicated in these conditions, as opposed to current antipsychotic medicines, which mostly target dopamine or serotonin receptors. KarXT has the potential to represent a new class of treatment for schizophrenia and dementia-related psychosis based on its differentiated mechanism of action. 
Since November 2021, we have had an exclusive license from Karuna to develop, manufacture, and commercialize KarXT in Greater China. For more information on this license agreement, see Part I—Item 1. Business—Overview of Significant License and Strategic Collaboration Agreements—Karuna (KarXT). 
In the third quarter of 2022, Karuna initiated the Phase 3 ADEPT-1 study evaluating KarXT as a treatment for psychosis in Alzheimer’s disease. In the fourth quarter of 2022, Karuna completed enrollment in the Phase 3 EMERGENT-3 trial in schizophrenia and presented data from the Phase 3 EMERGENT-2 trial of KarXT in schizophrenia at the 35th European College of Neuropsychopharmacology Congress in Vienna, Austria. A poster presentation and symposium included previously reported efficacy and safety data, as well as new additional safety data from the trial.
In the fourth quarter of 2022, we initiated a bridging study for KarXT, and we obtained agreement from the NMPA on the development plan for a clinical trial in China to start in mid-2023.
Internally Discovered and Internally Developed Product Candidates
We have assembled an integrated drug discovery and development team with extensive experience in discovery, translational medicine, and pre-clinical and clinical development and who have been directly involved in the discovery and development of several innovative product candidates. We identify pre-clinical assets through both internal-discovery efforts and co-development collaboration with our business partners. Through these efforts, we have advanced our internally developed pipeline, which includes three product candidates that are currently in global Phase I development. In addition to the internally developed and internally discovered product candidates in clinical development mentioned above (ZL-1211, ZL-1218, and ZL-1102), Zai has internally discovered and developed compounds in preclinical development, including ZL-2201, a potent selective inhibitor of DNA-PK involved in DNA damage repair in tumor cells; and multiple other undisclosed compounds.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary or intellectual property protection for our product candidates and our core technologies and other know-how to operate without infringing, misappropriating, or otherwise violating the proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing, misappropriating, or otherwise violating our proprietary or intellectual property rights. We expect that we will seek to protect our proprietary and intellectual property position by, among other methods, licensing or filing our own U.S., international, and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions, and improvements that are important to the development and implementation of our business. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our proprietary and intellectual property position, which we generally seek to protect through contractual obligations with third parties. 
Patents
Patents, patent applications and other intellectual property rights are important in the sector in which we operate. We consider on a case-by-case basis filing patent applications with a view to protecting certain innovative products, processes, and methods of treatment. We may also license or acquire rights to patents, patent applications or other intellectual property rights owned by third parties, academic partners or commercial companies which are of interest to us. For the internally developed product candidates, we identify patents through both self-development effort and joint development through collaboration with business partners such as academic institutions. 
As with other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, our ability to maintain and solidify our proprietary and intellectual property position for our drug candidates and technologies will depend on our success in obtaining effective patent claims and enforcing those claims if granted. However, our pending patent applications, and any patent applications that we may in the future file or license from third parties may not result in the issuance of patents. We also cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowed or enforced in our patents. Any issued patents that we may receive or license in the future may be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented. For example, we cannot be certain of the priority of our patents and patent applications over third-party patents and patent applications. In addition, because of the extensive time required for clinical development and regulatory review of a product candidate we may develop, it is possible that, before any of our product candidates can be commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby limiting protection such patent would afford the respective product and any competitive advantage such patent may provide. For more information regarding the risks related to our intellectual property, see Part I—Item 1A. Risk Factors – Risks Related to Intellectual Property. 
The term of a patent depends upon the laws of the country in which it is issued. In most jurisdictions that we principally operate in, a patent term is 20 years from the earliest filing date of a non-provisional patent application. Under the current China Patent Law (Revised in 2020), the term of patent protection starts from the date of application. Patents relating to inventions are effective for twenty years, and utility models and designs are effective for ten years and fifteen years, respectively, from the date of application. However, with regard to the design patent applications filed and the design patents granted prior to the effectiveness of the current China Patent Law (Revised in 2020), the term of patent protection is ten years from the date of application. 
The laws of each jurisdiction vary, and patent term adjustment or patent term extension may not be available in any or all jurisdictions in which we own or license patents. 
The following describes representative patents and/or pending applications related to our approved products and product candidates. 
ZEJULA
As of December 31, 2022, we exclusively licensed three issued patents in mainland China directed to ZEJULA’s free base compound, salts thereof, or analog of ZEJULA.

Trade Secrets
In addition to patents, we rely upon unpatented trade secrets and know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. However, trade secrets and know-how can be difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, by executing confidentiality agreements with our partners, collaborators, scientific advisors, employees, consultants, and other third parties and invention assignment agreements with our consultants and employees. We have also executed agreements requiring assignment of inventions with selected scientific advisors and collaborators. The confidentiality agreements we enter into are designed to protect our proprietary information, and the agreements or clauses requiring assignment of inventions to us are designed to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through our relationship with the respective counterparty. We cannot guarantee that we have entered into such agreements with each party that may have or have had access to our trade secrets or proprietary technology and processes or that these agreements will afford us adequate protection of our intellectual property and proprietary information rights. If any of the partners, collaborators, scientific advisors, employees, and consultants who are parties to these agreements breaches or violates the terms of any of these agreements or otherwise discloses our proprietary information, we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach or violation, and we could lose our trade secrets as a result. For more information regarding the risks related to our trade secrets, see Part I—Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Intellectual Property – If we are unable to maintain the confidentiality of our trade secrets, our business and competitive position may be harmed. 
Trademarks and Domain Names
We conduct our business using trademarks with various forms of the “ZAI LAB” and “再鼎医药” brands, as well as domain names incorporating some or all of these trademarks. 
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
We believe research and development is important to our future growth and our ability to remain competitive. We are dedicated to discovering or licensing and developing and commercializing proprietary therapeutics that address areas of significant unmet medical need in Greater China and worldwide, including in the fields of oncology, autoimmune disorders, infectious diseases, and neuroscience. 
We have built an integrated product discovery and development platform that aims to bring both in-licensed and internally discovered medicines to patients in Greater China and globally. We have assembled an in-house research and development team with over 400 dedicated personnel who have extensive experience in discovery, translational medicine, and late-stage development. Our in-house research and development team had previously been directly involved in the discovery and development of several innovative product candidates. Our in-house research and development team focuses on the development of innovative therapeutics for the treatment of oncology and autoimmune disorders. We believe our discovery efforts will enable us to achieve our long-term goal of generating a sustainable, internally discovered product pipeline of new product candidates for patients around the world. This effort has resulted in the identification of a number of proprietary candidates against targets in our focus areas that include immuno-oncology, DNA damage response/repair and oncogenic signaling that we are moving into pre-clinical development. The Company has a leadership team with extensive pharmaceutical research, development, and commercialization track records in both global and Chinese biopharmaceutical companies. We believe this team and our in-house discovery and development capabilities will enable us to achieve our long-term goal of commercializing our internally discovered innovative medicine for patients worldwide.

In addition, we collaborate with external research partners, such as leading CROs, academic institutions, and commercial partners. We contract with these parties for execution of our pre-clinical and clinical trials. For details, see Part I—Item 1. Business—Suppliers. 
For 2022 and 2021, our research and development expenses were $286.4 million and $573.3 million, respectively. Our expenditures incurred on research and development activities include the following: (i) expenses incurred for payments to CROs, investigators, and clinical trial sites that conduct our clinical studies; (ii) employee compensation related expenses, including salaries, benefits and equity compensation expense; (iii) expenses for licensors; (iv) the cost of acquiring, developing, and manufacturing clinical study materials; (v) facilities, depreciation, and other expenses, which include office leases and other overhead expenses; (vi) costs associated with pre-clinical activities and regulatory operations; and (vii) expenses associated with the construction and maintenance of our manufacturing facilities. 
GOVERNMENT REGULATION
Government Regulation of Pharmaceutical Product Development and Approval
Chinese Regulation of Pharmaceutical Product Development and Approval
Since mainland China’s entry into the World Trade Organization in 2001, the Chinese government has made significant efforts to standardize regulations, develop its pharmaceutical regulatory system and strengthen intellectual property protection. 
In October 2017, the drug regulatory system entered a new and significant period of reform. The General Office of the State Council and the General Office of the Communist Party of China Central Committee jointly issued the Opinion on Deepening the Reform of the Regulatory Approval System to Encourage Innovation in Drugs and Medical Devices (the “Innovation Opinion”), which is a mandatory plan to further reform the review and approval system and to encourage the innovation of drugs and medical devices. Under the Innovation Opinion and other recent reforms, the expedited programs and other advantages encourage drug manufacturers to seek marketing approval in mainland China first and to develop drugs in high priority disease areas, such as oncology or rare disease. 
To implement the regulatory reform introduced by the Innovation Opinion, the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress (the “SCNPC”), and the NMPA have revised the fundamental laws, regulations and rules governing pharmaceutical products and the pharmaceutical industry, including the amendment of the framework law known as the Drug Administration Law of the People’s Republic of China (the “Drug Administration Law”), which became effective in December 2019. The SAMR, has promulgated two key implementing regulations for the Drug Administration Law: (i) the amended Administrative Measures for Drug Registration and (ii) the amended Measures on the Supervision and Administration of the Manufacture of Drugs. Both regulations took effect in July 2020. 
Regulatory Authorities 
In mainland China, the NMPA is the authority under the SAMR that monitors and supervises the administration of pharmaceutical products, medical appliances and equipment, and cosmetics. The NMPA was established in March 2018 as part of the institutional reform of the State Council. Predecessors of the NMPA include the former China Food and Drug Administration (the “CFDA”) established in March 2013, the State Food and Drug Administration (the “SFDA”) established in March 2003, and the State Drug Administration established in August 1998. The primary responsibilities of the NMPA include: 
•monitoring and supervising the administration of pharmaceutical products, medical devices and equipment as well as cosmetics in mainland China; 
•formulating administrative rules and policies concerning the supervision and administration of the pharmaceutical, medical device and cosmetics industry; 
•evaluating, registering and approving chemical drugs, biological products and traditional Chinese medicine (“TCM”); 
•approving and issuing permits for the manufacture and export/import of pharmaceutical products; and 
•examining and evaluating the safety of pharmaceutical products, medical devices and cosmetics and handling significant accidents involving these products. 
According to the Decision of the CFDA on Adjusting the Approval Procedures under the Administrative Approval Items for Certain Drugs published in March 2017, which became effective in May 2017, approvals of CTAs should be issued by the CDE in the name of the CFDA.

China’s National Health and Family Planning Commission (the “NHFPC”) was rebranded as the National Health Commission (“NHC”) in March 2018. The NHC is an authority at the ministerial level under the State Council and is primarily responsible for national public health. The NHC combines the responsibilities of the former NHFPC, the Leading Group Overseeing Medical and Healthcare Reform under the State Council, the China National Working Commission on Aging, partial responsibilities of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology in relation to tobacco control, and partial responsibilities from the former State Administration of Work Safety in relation to occupational safety. The predecessor of NHFPC is the Ministry of Health (the “MOH”). Following the establishment of the former SFDA in 2003, the MOH was put in charge of the overall administration of the national health in mainland China, excluding the pharmaceutical industry. The NHC performs a variety of tasks in relation to the health industry such as establishing and overseeing the operation of medical institutions, some of which also serve as clinical trial sites, regulating the licensure of hospitals, and producing professional codes of ethics for public medical personnel. The NHC plays a significant role in drug reimbursement. 
Drug Administration Law
The Drug Administration Law as promulgated by the SCNPC in 1984, and the Implementing Measures of the Drug Administration Law as promulgated by the State Council in August 2002, established the legal framework for the administration of pharmaceutical products, including the development and manufacturing of new drugs and the medicinal preparations by medical institutions. The Drug Administration Law also regulates the distribution, packaging, labels and advertisements of pharmaceutical products in mainland China. 
Certain amendments to the Drug Administration Law took effect in December 2001, and subsequent amendments in December 2013, April 2015, and August 2019. These amendments were formulated to strengthen the supervision and administration of pharmaceutical products and to ensure the quality and safety of pharmaceutical products. The current Drug Administration Law applies to entities and individuals engaged in the development, production, distribution, application, supervision and administration of pharmaceutical products. The Drug Administration Law regulates and prescribes a framework for the administration of the law to pharmaceutical manufacturers, pharmaceutical distribution companies, and medicinal preparations of medical institutions and the development, research, manufacturing, distribution, packaging, pricing and advertisements of pharmaceutical products. 
According to the Drug Administration Law, no pharmaceutical products may be produced in mainland China without a Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Permit. A local manufacturer of pharmaceutical products must obtain a Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Permit from one of the provincial administrations of medical products in order to commence production of pharmaceuticals. Prior to granting such license, the relevant government authority will inspect the manufacturer’s production facilities and decide whether the sanitary conditions, quality assurance system, management structure and equipment within the facilities have met the required standards. 
In August 2019, the SCNPC promulgated the latest Drug Administration Law (the “2019 Amendment”), which became effective in December 2019. The 2019 Amendment brought a series of changes to the drug supervision and administration system, including (i) the formalization of the drug marketing authorization holder system (the “MAH system”); (ii) expedited approval pathway; and (iii) the cancelation of relevant certification in relation to Good Manufacturing Practice and Good Supply Practice. The 2019 Amendment requires the marketing authorization holder to assume responsibilities for the entire product life cycle, including non-clinical studies, clinical trials, manufacturing, marketing, post-marketing studies, monitoring, reporting and handling of adverse reactions of the drug. The 2019 Amendment also stipulates that the state supports the innovation of drugs with clinical value, encourages the development of drugs with new therapeutic mechanisms and multi-targeted, systematic adjustment and intervention of physiological function, and promotes the technological advancement of drugs. 
The Implementing Measures of the Drug Administration Law promulgated by the State Council in August 2002 were amended in February 2016 and March 2019, and serve to provide detailed implementation regulations for the Drug Administration Law. On May 9, 2022, the NMPA published a comprehensive draft of Amendment to the Implementing Measures of the Drug Administration Law for public comments. The draft amendment introduced changes to the regulatory framework and aimed to codify certain regulatory initiatives implemented by the Chinese government since the promulgation of the current Drug Administration Law in 2019. However, the draft amendment has not been finalized. 
Administrative Measures for Drug Registration 
In July 2007, the former SFDA released the Administrative Measures for Drug Registration which took effect in October 2007 (the “2007 Drug Registration Regulation”). The 2007 Drug Registration Regulation covers (i) definitions of drug marketing authorization applications and regulatory responsibilities of the former SFDA; (ii) general requirements for drug marketing authorization; (iii) drug clinical trials; (iv) application, examination and approval of drugs (such as new 
-30-


drugs, generic drugs, imported drugs and OTC drugs); (v) supplemental applications and marketing authorization renewals of drugs; (vi) re-registration of drugs; (vii) inspections; (viii) marketing authorization standards and specifications; (ix) time limits; (x) re-examination; and (xi) liabilities and other supplementary provisions. 
In January 2020, the SAMR released the amended Administrative Measures for Drug Registration, which took effect in July 2020 (the “2020 Drug Registration Regulation”). Compared to the 2007 Drug Registration Regulation, the 2020 Drug Registration Regulation provides detailed procedural and substantive requirements for the key regulatory concepts established by the 2019 Amendment and confirms a number of reform actions that have been taken in the past years, including but not limited to: (i) fully implementing the MAH system and implied approval for the commencement of clinical trials; (ii) implementing associated review of drugs, excipients and packaging materials; and (iii) introducing four expedited approval pathways, namely the breakthrough designation, conditional approvals, prioritized reviews and special reviews and approvals. 
Collecting and Using Patients’ Human Genetic Resources and Derived Data 
In June 1998, the Ministry of Science and Technology (the “MOST”) and the former MOH jointly established the Interim Measures for the Administration of Human Genetic Resources in China. In July 2015, the MOST issued the Service Guide for the Examination and Approval of Sampling, Collecting, Trading, Exporting Human Genetic Resources, which provides that foreign entities that collect and use patients’ human genetic resources in clinical trials shall be required to file for an advance approval with the HGRAC through its online system. 
In October 2017, the MOST issued the Circular on Optimizing the Administrative Examination and Approval of Human Genetic Resources, which simplified the approval process for collecting and using human genetic resources for the purpose of seeking marketing authorization of drugs in mainland China. 
In May 2019, the State Council of the People’s Republic of China issued the Regulation on the Administration of Human Genetic Resources (the “HGR Regulation”), which applies to activities that involve collection; biobanking; use of China-sourced human genetic resources (“HGR”), which includes the genetic materials with respect to organs, tissues, cells, and other materials that contain the human genome, genes, and other genetic substances (the “China Biospecimens”) and derived data (together with the China Biospecimens, the “China-Sourced HGR”); and the provision of such items to foreign parties or entities established or actually controlled by them. Pursuant to this new rule, a new filing system (as opposed to the advance approval approach originally in place) is put in place for international clinical trials using Chinese patients’ biospecimens at clinical study sites without involving the export of such biospecimens outside of mainland China. A notification filing that specifies the type, quantity and usage of the biospecimens, among others, with the HGRAC is required before conducting such clinical trials. The collection, use, and outbound transfer of Chinese patients’ biospecimens in international collaboration for basic scientific research involving export of such biospecimens are still subject to the advance approval of the HGRAC. 
In October 2020, the SCNPC promulgated the Biosecurity Law, which became effective on April 15, 2021. The Biosecurity Law reaffirms the regulatory requirements stipulated by the HGR Regulation while potentially increasing the administrative fines significantly in cases in which foreign entities are alleged to have collected, preserved or exported Chinese human genetic resources.
In March 2022, the MOST issued Answers to Frequently Asked Questions Regarding Human Genetic Resources Administration (the “Q&A Series I”). The Q&A Series I provides short answers to 30 frequently asked questions relating to the collection, preservation, utilization, and external provision of China-Sourced HGR. For example, the Q&A Series I clarifies that a notification filing with the HGRAC is required for the purpose of transferring China-Sourced HGR to regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions.
In March 2022, the MOST issued the Draft Implementing Rules of the HGR Regulation (Draft for Comment) (the “Draft Implementing Rules”). The Draft Implementing Rules are intended to provide operational details and clarify questions that have emerged in the past few years. Under the Draft Implementing Rules, clinical studies conducted for the purpose of obtaining marketing authorization for drugs and medical devices in China, if not involving the export of human genetic materials, will be eligible for a notification filing (as opposed to the advance approval) if the human genetic materials are collected by sites, and processed by sites or an onshore third-party lab specified in the clinical trial protocol. The Draft Implementing Rules provide clearer guidance on how to allocate the intellectual property derived from a Sino-foreign cooperative research utilizing China-Sourced HGR. The Draft Implementing Rules enumerate situations where a security review is required for external provision of or open access to of human genetic data, such as external provision of or open access to human genetic data about important genetic pedigrees, human genetic data from specific regions, and exome sequencing and genome sequencing information of over 500 individuals.

In April 2022, the MOST issued Answers to Frequently Asked Questions Regarding Human Genetic Resources Administration (Q&A Series II) (the “Q&A Series II”). The Q&A Series II provides formal written replies to 5 frequently asked questions relating to the collection, preservation, utilization, and external provision of China-Sourced HGR. The Q&A Series II specifies that collection and external provision of or open access to the data related to clinical practices, patient demographics, lab tests, medical images, etc. that do not carry genetic attributes will not be regulated as collection and external provision of or open access to human genetic data. The Q&A Series II stipulates that no advance approval for Sino-foreign cooperative research is required for a research utilizing China-Sourced HGR, if the foreign entity who provides funding support will not substantially participate in the research and have no access to or ownership of the research data and research results. 
Regulations on the Clinical Trials and Marketing Authorization of Drugs 
Four Phases of Clinical Trials
According to the 2020 Drug Registration Regulation, a clinical development program consists of Phases I, II, III, and IV clinical trials as well as bioequivalence trials. Based on the characteristics of study drugs and research objectives, the four phases of studies respectively focus on clinical pharmacology, exploratory, confirmatory, and post-approval assessment of efficacy and safety. 
Approval Authority and Process for Clinical Trial Applications
According to the 2019 Amendment and the 2020 Drug Registration Regulation, clinical studies on investigational drugs must be approved by the CDE before its commencement. 
Upon the completion of the pharmaceutical, pharmacological and toxicological research of the drug clinical trial, the applicant may submit relevant research materials to the CDE for the CTA, to conduct a drug clinical trial. The CDE will organize pharmaceutical, medical and other reviewers to review the application and to decide whether to approve the drug clinical trial within 60 business days of accepting the application. Once the decision is made, the applicant can locate such decision on the CDE’s website. If no notice of decision is issued within the aforementioned time limit, the application of clinical trial shall be deemed as approval. The 2020 Drug Registration Regulation further requires that the applicant shall, prior to conducting a drug clinical trial, register the information of the drug clinical trial protocol, etc. on the Drug Clinical Trial Information Platform. During the drug clinical trials, the applicant shall update registration information continuously and, upon completion, register information about the outcome of the drug clinical trial. The applicant shall be responsible for the authenticity of the drug clinical trial information published on the platform. Pursuant to the Notice on the Drug Clinical Trial Information Platform promulgated by former SFDA in September 2013, the applicant shall complete the trial pre-registration within one month after obtaining the approval of the CTA in order to obtain the trial’s unique registration number and complete registration of certain follow-up information and first-time submission for disclosure of the drug clinical trial information on the platform before the first subject’s enrollment in the trial. If the first-time submission for disclosure is not completed within one year after the approval of the CTA, the applicant shall submit an explanation, and if the first-time submission for disclosure is not completed within three years, the approval of the CTA shall automatically expire. 
Qualification of Clinical Trial Institutions and Compliance with GCP 
According to the Innovation Opinion, certification of clinical trial institutions by the former CFDA and the former NHFPC was no longer required. Instead, a clinical trial institution can be engaged by a drug marketing authorization applicant (i.e., a sponsor) to conduct a drug clinical study after it has been duly registered with the online platform designated by the NMPA. In November 2019, pursuant to the 2019 Amendment, the NMPA and the NHC jointly released the Rules for Administration of the Drug Clinical Trial Institutions, which became effective in December 2019. The rules specify requirements for clinical trial institutions and recordal procedures. Pursuant to the rules, a clinical trial institution should comply with the requirements of the Good Practices for Drug Clinical Trials (the “GCP”), and be capable of undertaking drug clinical trials. It should also evaluate, or engage a third party to evaluate, its clinical trial proficiency, facilities, and expertise before the recordation. According to the Implementing Measures of the Drug Administration Law, a drug marketing authorization applicant should only engage a clinical trial institution that complies with relevant regulations to carry out a drug clinical trial. 
The conduct of clinical trials must adhere to the GCP and the protocols approved by the ethics committee. Since 2015, the former CFDA has strengthened the enforcement against widespread data integrity issues associated with clinical trials in mainland China. To ensure authenticity and reliability of the clinical data, the former CFDA mandated drug marketing authorization applicants to conduct self-inspection and verification of their clinical trial data. Based on the submitted self-inspection results, the former CFDA also regularly launched onsite clinical trial audits over selected 
-32-


applications and rejected those found with data forgery. The GCP audit has been ongoing and has been able to curb the number of unreliable marketing authorization applications. 
In April 2020, the NMPA and the NHC released the Amended GCP that took effect in July 2020. The Amended GCP provides comprehensive and substantive requirements on the design and conduct of clinical trials in mainland China. In particular, the Amended GCP enhances the protection for study subjects and tightens the control over bio-samples collected under clinical trials. 
International Multi-Center Clinical Trials Regulations
In January 2015, the former CFDA promulgated the Tentative Guidelines for International Multi-Center Clinical Trial (the “Multi-Center Clinical Trial Guidelines”), which took effect in March 2015. The Multi-Center Clinical Trial Guidelines aimed to provide guidance for the regulation of application, implementation, and administration of International Multi-Center Clinical Trials in China (the “IMCCT”). IMCCT applicants may simultaneously perform clinical trials in different centers using the same clinical trial protocol. Where the marketing authorization applicant plans to make use of the data derived from the IMCCTs, such IMCCTs shall satisfy, in addition to the requirements set forth in the Drug Administration Law and its implementation regulations, the Administrative Measures for Drug Registration, the GCP, and relevant laws and regulations, the following requirements: 
•The applicant shall first conduct an overall evaluation on the global clinical trial data and further make trend analysis of the Asian and Chinese clinical trial data. In the analysis of Chinese clinical trial data, the applicant shall consider the representativeness of the research subjects, i.e., the participating patients; 
•The applicant shall analyze whether the amount of Chinese research subjects is sufficient to assess and adjudicate the safety and effectiveness of the study drug, and satisfy the statistical and relevant legal requirements; and 
•The onshore and offshore IMCCT research centers shall be subject to on-site inspections by the Chinese regulatory authorities. 
IMCCTs shall follow the Good Clinical Trial Practice of the International Conference on Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (“ICH-GCP”) principles and ethics requirements. Marketing authorization applicants shall ensure the truthfulness, reliability, and trustworthiness of clinical trials results. The investigators shall have the qualification and capability to perform relevant clinical trials. The ethics committee shall continuously supervise the trials and protect the subjects’ interests, benefits, and safety. Before the commencement of the IMCCT, applicants shall obtain clinical trial approvals or complete filings pursuant to requirements under the local regulations where clinical trials are conducted, and applicants shall register and disclose the information of all major investigators and study sites on the NMPA’s drug clinical trial information platform. 
Data derived from IMCCTs can be used for the marketing authorization applications with the NMPA. When using international multi-center clinical trial data to support marketing authorization applications in mainland China, applicants shall submit the completed global clinical trial report, statistical analysis report and database, along with relevant supporting data in accordance with International Conference on Harmonization-Common Technical Document (“ICH CTD”) content and format requirements. Also, subgroup research results summary and comparative analysis shall be conducted concurrently. 
In October 2017, the former CFDA released the Decision on Adjusting Items concerning the Administration of Imported Drug Registration to reform the regulatory framework for IMCCT in China, which includes the following key points: 
•The IMCCT drug does not need to be approved or entered into either a Phase II or III clinical trial in a foreign country, except for preventive biological products. Phase I IMCCT is permissible in mainland China. 
•The application for drug marketing authorization can be submitted directly after the completion of the IMCCT. 
•With respect to clinical trial and market authorization applications for imported innovative chemical drugs and therapeutic biological products, the marketing authorization in the country or region where the foreign drug manufacturer is located will not be required. 
Clinical Trial Waivers and Acceptance of Foreign Clinical Trial Data 
In July 2018, the NMPA issued the Technical Guidance for Accepting Foreign Clinical Trial Data (the “Foreign Clinical Trial Data Guidance”), as one of the implementing rules for the Innovation Opinion. According to the Foreign Clinical Trial Data Guidance, sponsors may use the data of foreign clinical trials to support drug marketing authorization in mainland China, provided that sponsors must ensure the authenticity, completeness, accuracy and traceability requirements, 
-33-


and that such data must be obtained in consistency with the relevant requirements under the ICH-GCP. Clinical trial sponsors must be attentive to potentially meaningful ethnic differences in the subject population. 
The NMPA now officially permits, and its predecessor agencies have permitted on a case-by-case basis in the past, drugs approved outside of mainland China to be approved in mainland China on a conditional basis without pre-approval clinical trials being conducted in mainland China. Specifically, in 2018, the NMPA and the NHC issued the Procedures for the Review and Approval of Urgently Needed Foreign New Drugs. The procedures are intended to accelerate approvals for drugs that have been approved within the last ten years in the United States, the European Union, or Japan and that treat orphan diseases or prevent or treat serious life-threatening illnesses for which there is either no effective therapy in mainland China or for which the foreign-approved drug would have clear clinical advantages. Applicants will be required to establish a risk mitigation plan and may be required to complete post-approval trials in mainland China. 
Marketing Authorization Holder System 
Under the authorization of the SCNPC in November 2015, the State Council issued the Pilot Plan for the Drug Marketing Authorization Holder Mechanism in May 2016, which provides a detailed pilot plan for the MAH system for drugs in 10 provinces in mainland China. Under the MAH system, domestic drug research and development institutions and individuals in the piloted regions are eligible to be holders of drug marketing authorizations without having to become drug manufacturers. The Pilot Plan was originally set for a 3-year period by the SCNPC and would end in November 2018, but the SCNPC later extended the pilot program for another year. 
The latest Drug Administration Law purports to roll out the MAH system nationwide. Companies and research and development institutions can be drug marketing authorization holders. The drug marketing authorization holder should be responsible for their products throughout the life cycle, including nonclinical studies, clinical trials, production and distribution, post-market studies, and the monitoring, reporting, and handling of adverse reactions in connection with pharmaceuticals in accordance with the 2019 Amendment. The marketing authorization holders may engage contract manufacturers for manufacturing, provided that (i) pursuant to the Measures on the Supervision and Administration of the Manufacture of Drugs, the marketing authorization holder must meet the specified requirements and obtain the Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Permit for MAH holder; and (ii) each of the contract manufacturers has obtained and maintained a valid Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Permit for the specific type of drugs. The marketing authorization holders can also engage pharmaceutical distribution enterprises with a valid Pharmaceutical Distribution Permit for the distribution activities. Upon receiving the marketing authorizations from the NMPA, a drug marketing authorization holder may transfer its drug marketing authorization to a company that has the capability of quality management, risk prevention and control, and liability compensation to ensure the safety, effectiveness and quality of the drug, and to fulfill the obligations of the drug marketing authorization holder. 
In December 2022, the NMPA issued the Provisions on Supervision and Administration of Marketing Authorization Holders Concerning the Implementation of Primary Responsibilities for Drug Quality and Safety. This regulation requires marketing authorization holders to establish and improve the drug quality management system, and assume primary responsibility for the safety, effectiveness, and quality of drugs during the total product life cycle. Marketing authorization holders need to build an information-based traceability system and establish a sound drug recall system, among other things.
Drug Marketing Authorization 
According to the 2020 Drug Registration Regulation, the applicant may submit an application for drug marketing authorization to CDE upon completion of relevant research on pharmacy, pharmacology, toxicology and drug clinical trials, determination of the quality standards of the drug, validation of commercial-scale production processes and preparation for acceptance of verification and inspection conducted by the Center for Food and Drug Inspection (the “CFDI”). The NMPA then determines whether to approve the application according to the comprehensive technical review by the CDE. We must obtain approval of drug marketing authorizations before our drugs can be manufactured and sold in the mainland China market. 
Drug Registration Classification 
According to the 2020 Drug Registration Regulation, drug marketing authorization applications are divided into three different types, namely traditional Chinese medicine, chemical drugs and biological products. Drugs falling into one of three general types are further divided by their characteristic, level of innovation and status of review and administration according to auxiliary regulatory documents to the 2020 Drug Registration Regulation. 
In March 2016, the former CFDA issued the Reform Plan for Registration Classification of Chemical Medicine (the “Reform Plan”), which outlined the reclassifications of drug marketing authorization applications under the 2007 Drug 
-34-


Registration Regulation. Under the Reform Plan, Category 1 drugs refer to innovative chemical drugs that have not been marketed anywhere in the world. Improved new chemical drugs that are not marketed anywhere in the world fall into Category 2. Generic drugs that have equivalent quality and efficacy to the originator’s drugs that have been marketed abroad but not yet in mainland China fall into Category 3. Generic drugs that have equivalent quality and efficacy to the originator’s drugs and have been marketed in mainland China fall into Category 4. Category 5 drugs are chemical drugs which have already been marketed abroad but are not yet approved in mainland China. 
As a support policy and implementing rule of the 2020 Drug Registration Regulation, the NMPA issued the Chemical Drug Registration Classification and Application Data Requirements in June 2020, effective in July 2020, which reaffirmed the principles of the classification of chemical drugs set forth by the Reform Plan and made minor adjustments to the subclasses of Category 5. According to such rule, Category 5.1 are originator drugs and improved drugs with clear clinical advantages while Category 5.2 are generic drugs, all of which shall have been already marketed abroad but not yet approved in mainland China. 
Priority Review and Accelerated Review and Approval Channels 
The NMPA and its predecessors have issued a series of regulatory documents aiming to simplify or accelerate the review and approval process for innovative new drugs or drugs in great clinical demand. According to the Special Examination and Approval of Registration of New Drugs promulgated by the former SFDA in January 2009, the former SFDA conducts special examination and approval for new drug marketing authorization applications when: 
•the effective constituent of drug extracted from plants, animals, minerals, etc. as well as the preparations thereof have never been marketed in mainland China, and the material medicines and the preparations thereof are newly discovered; 
•the chemical raw material medicines as well as the preparations thereof and the biological product have not been approved for marketing home and abroad; 
•the new drugs are for treating AIDS, malignant tumors and rare diseases, etc., and have obvious advantages in clinical treatment; or 
•the new drugs are for treating diseases with no effective methods of treatment. 
The Special Examination and Approval of Registration of New Drugs provide that the applicant may file for special examination and approval at the CTA stage if the drug candidate falls within items (1) or (2). The provisions provide that for drug candidates that fall within items (3) or (4), the application for special examination and approval cannot be made until the marketing authorization application stage. 
The Circular Concerning Several Policies on Drug Registration Review and Approval issued by the former CFDA in November 2015 further provides the following policies, potentially simplifying and accelerating the approval process of clinical trials: (x) a single approval for all phases of clinical trials for a new drug, replacing the phase-by-phase application and approval procedure; and (y) a fast-track approval pathway for the following applications: (1) marketing authorization of innovative new drugs treating AIDS, malignant tumors, serious infectious diseases and rare diseases; (2) marketing authorization of pediatric drugs; (3) marketing authorization of drugs treating specific or prevalent diseases in elders; (4) marketing authorization of drugs listed in national major science and technology projects or national key research and development plans; (5) marketing authorization of drugs using advanced technology, using innovative treatment methods, or having distinctive clinical benefits that are urgently needed clinically; (6) marketing authorization of foreign innovative drugs to be manufactured locally in mainland China; (7) concurrent applications for CTA which are already approved in the United States or the European Union or concurrent drug marketing authorization applications for drugs which have applied to the United States or European Union regulatory authorities and are manufactured in mainland China using the same production line that passed the onsite inspections by the United States or the European Union regulatory authorities; and (8) CTA for drugs with urgent clinical need and patent expiry within three years, and marketing authorization applications for drugs with urgent clinical need and patent expiry within one year. 
The Opinions on Encouraging Priority Review and Approval for Drug Innovations promulgated by the former CFDA in December 2017 provide that a fast-track CTA or marketing authorization pathway will be available to both innovative drugs with distinctive clinical benefits, which have not been sold within or outside mainland China, and drugs using advanced technology, innovative treatment methods or having distinctive treatment advantages. 
The 2020 Drug Registration Regulation has incorporated the previous reform with respect to the accelerated review and approval process for clinical trials and drug marketing authorizations. The 2020 Drug Registration Regulation and the auxiliary regulatory documents currently provide four procedures for fast-track review and approvals of drugs. The NMPA would prioritize the allocation of resources for communication, guidance, review, inspection, examination, and approval of 
-35-


applications that are qualified for the application of the four procedures. The four procedures are (1) the review and approval procedures for breakthrough therapeutic drugs; (2) the review and approval procedures for drug conditional approval application; (3) the priority review procedures for drug marketing authorization approval; and (4) drug special review and approval procedures in case of public health emergency. 
Review and Approval Procedures for Breakthrough Therapeutic Drugs 
In principle, during the drug clinical trials, an applicant may submit the application to the CDE for its drug to be designated as a breakthrough therapeutic drug if the following general conditions are met: 
•The drug candidate must be an innovative new drug or improved new drug; 
•The drug candidate must be used for the prevention and treatment of life-threatening illnesses or illnesses which have a serious impact on the quality of life; and 
•There is no other effective prevention or treatment method, or there is adequate evidence proving that the drug candidate has obvious clinical advantages over existing treatment methods. 
Review and Approval Procedures for Drug Conditional Approval Application 
At the clinical trial stage, an applicant may submit the application to the CDE for its drug to be qualified for conditional approval if the following general conditions are met: 
•The drug candidate is for treatment of life-threatening illnesses with no effective treatment method or in dire need in case of a public health emergency; and clinical trial data on drug efficacy is available and the clinical value of the drug candidate can be predicated based on such data; or 
•For vaccines urgently needed in major public health crisis or other vaccines that are deemed by the NHC to be urgently needed, they may receive conditional approvals if their assessed benefits outweigh the risks. 
Priority Review Procedures for Drug Marketing Authorization Approval 
Upon the submission of the marketing authorization application for a drug candidate that has obvious clinical value, an applicant may request that the marketing authorization application be qualified for priority review. Drugs that are qualified for priority review include: 
•Drugs that are in short supply and urgently needed clinically, or innovative new drugs or improved new drugs for the prevention and treatment of major contagious diseases or rare diseases; 
•Drugs for pediatric use with new product specification, dosage form and strength that comply with pediatric physiological characteristics; 
•Vaccines and innovative vaccines urgently needed for the prevention and control of diseases; 
•Drugs that received breakthrough therapeutic drug designation; 
•Drugs that are qualified for conditional approval; and 
•Others qualified for priority review as stipulated by the NMPA. 
Drug Special Review and Approval Procedures in Case of Public Health Emergency 
At the time of a threat or occurrence of public health emergency, the NMPA may, in accordance with law, decide to implement special examination and approval for an urgently needed drug required for the prevention and treatment during the public health emergency. Drugs included in the special examination and approval procedures may, based on special needs of disease prevention and control, be restricted for use within a certain period and scope. 
Administrative Protection for New Drugs 
Under the 2007 Drug Registration Regulation, the Implementing Measures of the Drug Administration Law (effective in March 2019) and the Reform Plan, the NMPA may provide for an administrative monitoring period of not more than five years for Category 1 new drugs for the purpose of protecting public health. The new drug monitoring period commences from the date of approval, and the NMPA will continually monitor the safety of those new drugs. However, the 2020 Drug Registration Regulation omits the provisions relating to the administrative exclusivity created by the new drug monitoring period. The NMPA has not issued any written guidance regarding whether it will grant administrative exclusivity during the new drug monitoring period to new drugs approved after the 2020 Drug Registration Regulation took effect.

In July 2021, the NMPA and the China National Intellectual Property Administration (the “CNIPA”), jointly published the Measures for Implementing an Early-Stage Resolution Mechanism for Pharmaceutical Patent Disputes (Tentative) (the “Measures on Patent Linkage”). The Measures on Patent Linkage provide an operating mechanism for the NMPA and CNIPA to link generic drug applications to pharmaceutical patent protection, also known as Patent Linkage. The most recent amendment to the Patent Law of the People’s Republic of China (the “China Patent Law”), which was promulgated by the SCNPC in October 2020 and became effective in June 2021, describes the general principles of Patent Linkage, but lacks operational details. The Measures on Patent Linkage are intended to answer these operational questions. 
The Measures on Patent Linkage describe a framework for a patentee to defend their patent exclusivity. Upon discovery of generic applications and certifications, if the patentee or the interested person disagrees, the patentee or the interested person will need to file a claim with the court or the CNIPA within 45 days after the CDE’s publication and must submit a copy of the case acceptance notification to the CDE within 15 working days after the case acceptance date. Otherwise, the NMPA can proceed with the technical review and approval. Moreover, for chemical drugs, the NMPA’s approval stay is only nine months, and the technical review does not need to stay in this nine-month period. If the patentee or the interested person cannot secure a favorable court judgment or a decision from the CNIPA within the nine-month period, the NMPA can grant marketing authorization to the generic applicant after the nine-month period expires. In mainland China no NMPA approval stay is available to biosimilar applications. The NMPA can proceed with the technical review and marketing authorization upon receiving biosimilar applications. To delay the entry of biosimilars, the originator/patentee will need to file an infringement claim with the court or CNIPA within 45 days after the CDE’s publication of the biosimilar application, and secure a favorable decision before the NMPA’s issuance of the marketing authorization. The NMPA will then convert the marketing authorizations into a conditional approval effective after the relevant patents expire. 
The Measures on Patent Linkage further provides the conditions and procedures for the certification of non-infringement for generic companies and the marketing exclusivity period that may be granted to the first generic company receiving marketing authorization approval. 
Data Privacy and Data Protection 
The Chinese government continues to strengthen its regulation of network security, data protection, data privacy, and personal information (including personal health information). For example, the Civil Code of the People’s Republic of China (the “PRC Civil Code”), which was promulgated by the National People’s Congress of the People’s Republic of China in May 2020 and became effective in January 2021, provides that the personal information of a natural person shall be protected by the law. Any organization or individual that needs to obtain personal information of others shall obtain such information legally and ensure the safety of such information, and shall not illegally collect, use, process or transmit personal information of others, or illegally purchase or sell, provide or make public personal information of others. 
In November 2016, the SCNPC promulgated the Cyber Security Law, which became effective in June 2017. The Cyber Security Law requires network operators to perform certain functions related to cybersecurity protection and strengthen their network information management and comply with certain requirements when collecting and using personal information. For instance, under the Cyber Security Law, network operators of critical information infrastructure generally are required to store personal information and important data collected and produced during their operations in mainland China within the territory of mainland China. In addition, under the Cyber Security Law, when collecting and using personal information, network operators are required to abide by principles of lawfulness, justifiableness and necessity. Network operators that collect and use personal information are required to announce the rules for such collection and use, expressly disclose the purpose, methods and scope of such collection and use, and obtain the consent of the persons whose personal information are to be collected. Network operators are prohibited from collecting personal information that are unrelated to the services they provide, and from collecting or using personal information in violation of applicable laws and regulations and their agreements regarding their collection and use of such personal information. Network operators are also required to process the personal information they store in accordance with the provisions of laws and administrative regulations and their agreements reached with relevant persons. Network operators are prohibited from disclosing, tampering with or destroying personal information that they collect, and may not disclose personal information to others without the prior consent of the person whose personal information has been collected, unless such personal information has been anonymized by processing it in a manner that prevents the related persons from being identified and any information that can be used to re-identify the related persons from being restored. Under the Cyber Security Law, an individual has the right to require a network operator to delete his or her personal information if he or she finds that the collection and use of such information by such network operator violates applicable laws, administrative regulations or his or her agreement with such network operator, and to require a network operator to correct errors in his or her personal information collected and stored by such network operator. Also, under the Cyber Security Law, any 
-37-


individual or organization is prohibited from acquiring personal information by stealing it or through other illegal ways, and from illegally selling or providing personal information to others. 
On September 14, 2022, the CAC published a draft amendment to the Cyber Security Law for public comment. According to the CAC’s explanatory note, published together with draft amendment, the draft amendment was formulated to align the Cyber Security Law with several new laws that were released after the Cyber Security Law came into effect in June 2017. These new laws include the Administrative Punishment Law of the People’s Republic of China, the Data Security Law, and the Personal Information Protection Law (the “PIPL”), all of which were adopted or amended in 2021. The draft amendment mainly proposes revisions to Chapter VI of the Cyber Security Law on legal responsibility to adjust the types and ranges of administrative penalties for violating the Cyber Security Law and to align them with other laws. Generally, the fines and penalties available to be imposed by Chinese cyberspace regulators have been significantly increased and expanded.
In July 2018, the National Health Commission promulgated the Measures on Health and Medical Big Data, which sets out guidelines and principles for standards management, security management and services management for the health and medical big data sector. Under the Measures, health and medical big data is defined as health and medical related data created in the course of preventing and treating illness and managing the health of individuals. The Measures require that all health and medical big data be stored in secure servers located in mainland China, and that relevant cross-border data transfer laws and regulations be followed and a security assessment be conducted when it is necessary to transfer such data outside of mainland China. 
In June 2021, the SCNPC promulgated the Data Security Law, which became effective in September 2021. The Data Security Law establishes a tiered system for data protection in terms of the data’s importance, and requires that data identified as important data, which will be identified by governmental authorities through the use of catalogs, be treated with a higher level of protection. Specifically, the Data Security Law requires any processors of important data to appoint a data security officer and a management department to take charge of data security. In addition, any processors of important data are required to periodically evaluate the risk of its data processing activities and file risk assessment reports with relevant regulatory authorities. The Data Security Law, in addition to reiterating the Cyber Security Law requirements for cross-border transfers of important data collected and produced during operations within the territory of mainland China of critical information infrastructure operators, also references additional requirements that are yet-to-be formulated regulating the cross-border transfer of important data by all processors. Additionally, the Data Security Law prohibits any organization or individual located within the territory of mainland China from providing to a foreign judicial or law enforcement authority any data stored within the territory of mainland China without the approval of relevant regulatory authorities. Since the Data Security Law is relatively new, uncertainties still exist in relation to its interpretation and implementation. 
The current Cybersecurity Review Measures, which were released by the CAC together with 12 other Chinese regulatory authorities on January 4, 2022, came into effect on February 15, 2022. Pursuant to the Cybersecurity Review Measures, critical information infrastructure operators procuring network products and services and online platform operators carrying out data processing activities, which affect or may affect national security, shall conduct a cybersecurity review pursuant to the provisions therein. In addition, online platform operators possessing personal information of more than one million users seeking to be listed on foreign stock markets must apply for a cybersecurity review. 
In August 2021, the National People’s Congress promulgated the PIPL, which became effective in November 2021. The PIPL is an omnibus regulation that provides a comprehensive set of data privacy and protection requirements that apply to the processing of personal information of individuals conducted within the territory of mainland China and the processing of personal information of individuals located in mainland China conducted outside of mainland China if such processing is for purposes of providing products and services to, or analyzing and evaluating the behavior of, individuals located in mainland China. Under the PIPL, the processing of personal information is not permitted unless a legal basis exists. The legal bases for processing personal information under the PIPL include (i) where the consent of the relevant individual is obtained, (ii) where it is necessary to conclude or perform a contract to which the relevant individual is a party or for implementing human resources management in accordance with labor rules and regulations that are formulated in accordance with the law or collective contracts concluded in accordance with the law, (iii) where it is necessary to perform legal duties or obligations, (iv) where it is necessary to respond to a public health emergency or to protect the life and health of persons or their property, (v) where it is for news reporting and supervision of public opinion carried out for the public interest, and the processing is reasonable in scope, (vi) where it is necessary to process the personal information disclosed by the relevant individual or otherwise legally disclosed, and the processing is reasonable in scope, and (vii) under other circumstances prescribed by laws and regulations. The PIPL clarifies and prescribes new notice and consent requirements for personal information processors, including the requirement to obtain separate consent in five circumstances: (i) when disclosing personal information to another personal information processor, (ii) when processing sensitive personal information, (iii) when transferring personal information outside the territory of mainland China, (iv) 
-38-


when publicly disclosing the personal information of an individual, and (v) when using an individual’s personal image or identification information collected by image capture or personal identification equipment installed in public places for purposes other than maintaining public security. The PIPL also provides that critical information infrastructure operators and personal information processors who process personal information meeting a volume threshold set by Chinese cyberspace regulators are also required to store in mainland China personal information generated or collected in mainland China, and to pass a security assessment administered by Chinese cyberspace regulators for any export of such personal information. In addition, under the PIPL, all personal information processors that need to transfer personal information out of mainland China are required to provide adequate notice to data subjects of such transfer and satisfy one of four conditions: (i) pass a security assessment organized by Chinese cyberspace regulators, (ii) undergo certification by specialized certification agencies in accordance with relevant regulations, (iii) conclude a standard contract designated by China cyberspace regulators with the recipient of the personal information located outside of mainland China, or (iv) other conditions contemplated by laws, administrative regulations or Chinese cyberspace regulators. The PIPL also enumerates a number of data subject rights, including the right of notice, access, correction, deletion, and portability. Additionally, the PIPL prohibits any personal information processor from providing to a foreign judicial or law enforcement authority any data stored within the territory of mainland China without the approval of relevant regulatory authorities. Lastly, the PIPL provides for significant fines for serious violations of up to RMB 50 million or 5% of annual revenues from the prior year and violators may also be ordered to suspend any related activity by competent authorities. 
In November 2021, the CAC further published the Regulations on Network Data Security Management (Draft for Comment) (the “Draft Management Regulations”). The Draft Management Regulations proposed that data processors defined as individuals and organizations who determine the data processing activities in terms of the purpose and methods at their discretion are subject to cybersecurity review if either they process personal information of more than one million individuals and aim to list on foreign stock markets, or their data processing activities influence or may influence national security. The Draft Management Regulations also propose requiring data processors seeking to list on foreign stock markets to annually assess their data security themselves or through data security service organizations and submit the assessment reports to relevant competent authorities. As the Draft Management Regulations was released only for public comment, the final version and the effective date thereof may be subject to change with substantial uncertainty. 
On January 13, 2022, the draft Guidelines for Identification of Important Data were released, which sets out six principals for identifying critical data: (i) data must be assessed based on its security impact from the perspectives of state security, economy, social stability, public health and safety, etc., data which is only important to organizations internally shall not be regarded as critical data; (ii) data classification is important in identifying the area(s) of focus for protection, by classifying data and specifying security protection priorities, only critical data would be subject to additional requirements to the ensure free flow of non-critical data; (iii) existing local regulations and industry practice must be considered to ensure the additional measures work seamlessly with them, (iv) risks should be assessed in a holistic matter including the data’s confidentiality, completeness, availability, authenticity, and accuracy, etc.; (v) both the quality and quantity of data must be considered; and (vi) the assessment must be conducted and reviewed on a regular basis because the uses of the data, the way that the data is shared and the importance of data may change over time. The Guidelines, when finalized, are intended to be used by Chinese industry sector regulators to comply with a directive under the Data Security Law to formulate catalogues of important data that apply to organizations operating within the respective sectors. 
Data Privacy and Data Protection (Cross-Border Data Transfer)
On September 1, 2022, the Security Assessment Measures issued by the CAC came into effect. The Security Assessment Measures set out a security assessment framework for cross-border data transfers out of mainland China as well as ground rules for a security assessment filing for cross-border data transfers which is stipulated in the Cyber Security Law and the PIPL.
A security assessment will be triggered if a cross-border data transfer out of mainland China is under any of the following circumstances: (i) transfer of important data by data processors; (ii) transfer of personal information by critical information infrastructure operators and data processors that process personal information of more than one million individuals; (iii) transfer of personal information by data processors that have transferred either personal information of over 100,000 individuals or sensitive personal information of over 10,000 individuals abroad since January 1 of the preceding year; and (iv) other situations as determined by the CAC. According to statements by the CAC, a cross-border data transfer includes (i) an outbound transfer and overseas storage of data collected and generated during a data processor’s operation in mainland China; and (ii) a remote access or use of data collected and generated by a data processor stored within mainland China by overseas institutions, organizations, and individuals. 
Prior to applying for a security assessment with the CAC, data processors are required to carry out a self-risk assessment, which needs to be presented to the CAC along with an application filing and other required materials for a security assessment. During a security assessment, the CAC will primarily focus on risks to national security, public 
-39-


interests, and the legitimate rights and interests of individuals or organizations that such cross-border data transfer may cause. A cross-border data transfer of relevant data will not be allowed if the CAC does not approve the security assessment filing. Once the CAC approves the security assessment filing, such approval will remain valid for two years and may be renewed. An application for security assessment needs to be re-submitted if there is a change in the cross-border data transfer that may affect the security of the exported data, such as changes in the purpose, method, scope, and type of the exported data and changes in the purpose and method of the processing of the exported data by overseas recipients.
The Security Assessment Measures have retroactive effect for relevant data transfers out of mainland China conducted prior to September 1, 2022, and data processors have until February 28, 2023 to undergo mandatory security assessment for such prior data transfers. If a data processor fails to complete a security assessment for relevant data transfers out of mainland China conducted prior to September 1, 2022, it needs to rectify the failure by February 28, 2023. We continue to assess our obligations under these laws and are working with the CAC to ensure our compliance with respect to any mandatory security assessments.
On August 31, 2022, the CAC promulgated the first edition of the Guide to Applications for Security Assessment of Outbound Data Transfers (the “Security Assessment Guide”). The Security Assessment Guide provides practical guidance to the implementation of the Security Assessment Measures.
The Security Assessment Guide reiterates the timeline and procedures for applications for security assessment of outbound data transfers under the Security Assessment Measures. The Security Assessment Guide specifies the dossier requirements for applications for security assessment and provides templates for some required documents. Consistent with the Security Assessment Measures, prior to submitting an application for security assessment, the applicant must conduct a self-assessment of the risks of the outbound data transfer. Additionally, the Security Assessment Guide clarifies that the application of security assessment shall be submitted to provincial branches of the CAC, who will forward it to the CAC for further review and assessment. 
The Security Assessment Guide also reaffirms CAC’s position that a cross-border data transfer out of mainland China includes where a data processor transfers or stores overseas the data collected or generated in its operations in mainland China, and where a data processor allows an overseas entity, organization, or individual to access, retrieve, download, or export data the data processor collects or generates and stores in mainland China.
On November 4, 2022, the CAC and SAMR jointly issued the Notification on the Implementation of Personal Information Protection Certification, which implements, among other things, the personal information protection certification (“PIPC”) mechanism to satisfy the requirements of the PIPL for the cross-border transfer out of mainland China of personal information. In parallel with that notification, on June 24, 2022, the National Information Security Standardization Technical Committee issued the first version of the Guidance on Network Security Standardized Practice – Specification for Certification of Personal Information Cross-Border Processing Activities (the “Certification Specification”), and on December 16, 2022, the National Information Security Standardization Technical Committee issued an updated version of the Certification Specification. The Certification Specification serves as an industry standard and provides the general principles and detailed requirements for personal information processors engaging in the cross-border transfer out of mainland China of personal information to meet in order to obtain a PIPC from qualified certification institutions with respect to such data transfers. Personal information processors that obtain a PIPC may rely on a PIPC to comply with PIPL requirements for cross-border data transfers of personal information out of mainland China that do not need to undergo a security assessment.
Under the Certification Specification, personal information processors seeking to obtain a PIPC need to (i) demonstrate adherence to general personal information protection principles; (ii) put in place a data transfer agreement meeting certain requirements with overseas recipients of the transferred personal information located outside of mainland China; (iii) implement certain technical and organizational measures directed at personal information protection, including with respect to the cross-border data transfer processing activities; (iv) agree with the overseas recipients’ same rules for cross-border processing of personal information regarding multiple aspects and jointly observe such rules; (v) conducted personal information protection impact assessments and periodic audits of, among other things, the personal information processor’s and the overseas recipients’ personal information protection measures, internal controls, protection of data subject rights, and the impact of the legal and network security environment in destination countries and regions; and (vi) meet, bear, and be subject to, and require the overseas recipients to meet, bear, and be subject to certain legal responsibilities and liabilities and supervision by qualified certification institutions and Chinese cyber regulators with respect to their cross-border data transfer processing activities and to data subjects. The list of qualified certification institutions has not been released to date.
On February 22, 2023, the CAC published the Measures for the Standard Contract for Cross-Border Transfer of Personal Information, along with the final version of the standard contract for the cross-border transfer of personal information outside of mainland China (the “PRC Standard Contract”), which will be effective on June 1, 2023. The PRC 
-40-


Standard Contract clarifies terms and conditions to be agreed on between personal information processors as a data exporter and an overseas recipient as a data importer with respect to cross-border data transfers of personal information out of mainland China. Going forward, the PRC Standard Contract can be used to comply with requirements under the PIPL for cross-border data transfers of personal information out of mainland China that do not need to undergo a security assessment.
A personal information processor may enter into the PRC Standard Contract and provide it along with other required materials to relevant governmental authorities for filing to ensure the legality of a cross-border transfer out of mainland China if the following conditions are satisfied: the personal information processor (i) is not a CIIO; (ii) processes personal information of fewer than 1 million individuals; (iii) has provided personal information of fewer than 100,000 individuals overseas in aggregate since January 1 of the preceding year; and (iv) has provided sensitive personal information of fewer than 10,000 individuals overseas in aggregate since January 1 of the preceding year.
The PRC Standard Contract imposes certain obligations on the parties of such cross-border data transfers to protect the interests of data subjects, including, for example, (i) data exporters are required to use reasonable efforts to ensure data importers have adequate technical and organizational measures to ensure secure processing and have relevant capabilities to fulfill their obligations relating to the data transfer, and (ii) the parties of such cross-border transfer are required to ensure that the rights and interests of data subjects are well recognized in practice (and data subjects’ inquiries are promptly responded to), as such data subjects are considered third-party beneficiaries of the PRC Standard Contract.
Additional regulations, guidelines, and measures relating to data privacy and data protection are expected to be adopted, including more guidance from industry sector regulators on the catalogues of important data, publication of lists of qualified certification institutions for certifications for cross-border transfers of personal information out of mainland China, which may contain additional requirements for transferring personal health information out of mainland China. 
Since our subsidiaries located in mainland China operate computer networks as part of their normal operations, we are required to comply with the requirements of mainland China’s cyber security, data protection, and privacy laws and regulations. In addition, in the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store personal information, including personal information about our clinical trial subjects, customers, and employees in mainland China. We may need to share such personal information with our subsidiaries, licensors, partners, or contractors located outside mainland China. Mainland China’s network and data protection regime is constantly evolving, and we continue to face uncertainties as to whether our efforts to comply with these requirements will be sufficient. Although we develop and maintain compliance protocols and controls designed to maintain compliance with these requirements, development, implementation, improvement, and maintenance of these protocols and controls is costly and requires significant effort, resources, and time. In addition, in certain cases, our CROs, licensors, licensees, partners, and contractors are also required to comply with these laws, and our agreements with them require them to comply with these requirements, but there is always a risk that they may not fully comply with them. 
Good Pharmacovigilance Practice
The latest Drug Administration Law provides that the State shall establish a pharmacovigilance system for monitoring, identifying, assessing and controlling adverse drug reactions and other harmful reactions associated with the use of drugs. As a supporting document in this regard, the Good Pharmacovigilance Practice (“GVP”), which was promulgated by the NMPA and became effective in December 2021, outlines the key requirements for pharmacovigilance activities to be carried out by drug marketing authorization holders and/or drug clinical trial sponsors. The GVP clarifies that pharmacovigilance activities, including collection, identification, evaluation, and control of adverse drug reactions, shall take place in the total life cycle of drugs, from the clinical development stage through the post-approval stage. The GVP calls for effective and differentiated pharmacovigilance activities for different types of drugs, such as innovative drugs, traditional Chinese medicines and ethnic medicines. 
Good Laboratories Practice Certification for Nonclinical Research 
To improve the quality of nonclinical research, the former SFDA promulgated the Administrative Measures for Good Laboratories Practice of Pre-clinical Laboratory in 2003 (the “GLP 2003”) and began to conduct the certification program of the GLP. The GLP 2003 was then abolished and replaced by the Administrative Measures for Good Laboratories Practice of Pre-clinical Laboratory promulgated in 2017. In April 2007, the former SFDA promulgated the Administrative Measures for Certification of Good Laboratory Practice of Pre-clinical Laboratory, providing that the former SFDA (now the NMPA) is responsible for certification of nonclinical research institutions. According to the Administrative Measures for Certification of Good Laboratory Practice of Pre-clinical Laboratory, the former SFDA (now the NMPA) decides whether an institution is qualified for undertaking pharmaceutical nonclinical research upon the evaluation of the institution’s organizational administration, personnel, laboratory equipment and facilities and its operation and 
-41-


management of nonclinical pharmaceutical projects. If all requirements are met, a GLP certification will be issued by the former SFDA (now the NMPA) and published on the government website. 
An online information platform has been launched by the NMPA in December 2022. GLP certified institutions, provincial medical products administrations, and the CFDI must maintain information related to GLP institutions on the platform, including GLP certification status, results of GLP inspections, investigations, and penalty of violations, etc.
In January 2023, the NMPA issued a revised version of the Administrative Measures for Certification of Good Laboratory Practice of Pre-clinical Laboratory, which will come into effect on July 1, 2023. Under the new rule, a GLP certification issued by the NMPA will be valid for five years. GLP certified institutions shall submit a GLP annual report to the provincial medical products administration, covering the institution’s basic information, Quality Management System operation status, research progress, etc.
Animal Testing Permits
According to Regulations for the Administration of Affairs Concerning Experimental Animals promulgated by the State Science and Technology Commission in November 1988, as amended by the State Council in January 2011, July 2013, and March 2017, and Administrative Measures on the Certificate for Animal Experimentation (Tentative) promulgated by the State Science and Technology Commission and other regulatory authorities in December 2001, performing experiments on animals requires a Certificate for Use of Laboratory Animals. Applicants must satisfy the following conditions: 
•laboratory animals must be qualified and sourced from institutions that have Certificates for Production of Laboratory Animals; 
•the environment and facilities for the animals’ living and propagating must meet state requirements; 
•the animals’ feed must meet state requirements; 
•the animals’ feeding and experimentation must be conducted by professionals, specialized and skilled workers, or other trained personnel; 
•the management systems must be effective and efficient; and 
•the applicable entity must follow other requirements as stipulated by Chinese laws and regulations. 
Drug Technology Transfer and Marketing Authorization Transfer 
In August 2009, the former SFDA promulgated the Administrative Regulations for Registration of Drug Technology Transfer to standardize the registration process of drug technology transfer, which includes application for, and evaluation, examination, approval, and monitoring of, drug technology transfer. Drug technology transfer refers to the transfer of drug production technology by the owner to a drug manufacturer and the application for drug registration by the transferee according to the provisions in the technology transfer regulations. Drug technology transfer includes new drug technology transfer and drug production technology transfer. 
Conditions for the Application for New Drug Technology Transfer 
Applications for new drug technology transfer may be submitted prior to the expiration date of the monitoring period of the new drugs with respect to: 
•drugs with new drug certificates only; or 
•drugs with new drug certificates and drug approval numbers. 
For drug products with new drug certificates only and not yet in the monitoring period, or drug substances with new drug certificates, applications for new drug technology transfer should be submitted prior to the respective expiration date of the monitoring periods. 
Conditions for the Application of Drug Production Technology Transfer 
Applications for drug production technology transfer may be submitted if: 
•the transferor holds new drug certificates or both new drug certificates and drug approval numbers, and the monitoring period has expired or there is no monitoring period; or 
-42-


•with respect to drugs without new drug certificates, both the transferor and the transferee are legally qualified drug manufacturing enterprises, one of which holds over 50% of the equity interests in the other, or both of which are majority-owned subsidiaries of the same drug manufacturing enterprise. 
With respect to imported drugs with imported drug licenses, the original applicants for the imported drug licenses may transfer these drug production technologies to domestic drug manufacturing enterprises. 
Application for, and Examination and Approval of, Drug Technology Transfer 
Applications for drug technology transfer should be submitted to the provincial administration of medical products where the transferee is located. If the transferor and the transferee are located in different provinces, the provincial administration of medical products where the transferor is located should provide examination opinions. The provincial administration of medical products where the transferee is located is responsible for examining application materials for technology transfer and organizing inspections on the production facilities of the transferee. Drug control institutes are responsible for testing three batches of drug samples. 
The CDE should further review the application materials, provide technical evaluation opinions and form a comprehensive evaluation opinion based on the site inspection reports and the testing results of the samples. The NMPA should determine whether to approve the application according to the comprehensive technical review opinions of the CDE. An approval letter of supplemental application and a drug approval number will be issued to qualified applications. The CDE may require the conduct of clinical studies. For rejected applications, a notification letter of the examination opinions will be issued with the reasons for rejection. 
Conditions for the Application for Marketing Authorization Transfer 
As previously discussed under Part I—Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks related to our dependence on third parties, the Drug Administration Law and the 2020 Drug Registration Regulation allow for the transfer of marketing authorization under the MAH system. If the manufacturing location of an imported drug is relocated to mainland China through drug manufacturing technology transfer, the transferee in mainland China can choose to file a supplemental application pursuant to the Administrative Regulations for Technology Transfer Registration of Drugs with the provincial medical product administration which contains technical data showing consistency of quality and manufacturing processes during the two-year grace period from January 13, 2021. Alternatively, the transferee in mainland China can file a marketing authorization application with the CDE referencing technical data in the original import drug approval application dossier pursuant to the NMPA’s Administrative Measures for Post-approval Changes to Drugs (Tentative). 
Permits and Licenses for Drug Manufacturing Operations
Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Permit and GMP Requirements 
According to the Drug Administration Law and the Implementing Measures of the Drug Administration Law, to manufacture pharmaceutical products in mainland China, a pharmaceutical manufacturing enterprise must first obtain a Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Permit issued by the relevant provincial medical products administration where the enterprise is located. Among other things, such a permit must set forth the scope of production and effective period. The grant of such license is subject to an inspection of the manufacturing facilities, and an inspection to determine whether the sanitary condition, quality assurance systems, management structure and equipment meet the required standards. 
According to the Implementing Measures of the Drug Administration Law and Measures on the Supervision and Administration of the Manufacture of Drugs, promulgated in August 2004 and amended in November 2017 and January 2020, each Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Permit issued to a pharmaceutical manufacturing enterprise is effective for a period of five years. Any enterprise holding a Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Permit is subject to review by the relevant regulatory authorities on an annual basis. The enterprise is required to apply for renewal of such permit within six months prior to its expiry and will be subject to reassessment by the issuing authorities in accordance with then prevailing legal and regulatory requirements for the purposes of such renewal. The Good Manufacturing Practice was promulgated in March 1988 and was amended in June 1999 and January 2011. The Good Manufacturing Practice comprises a set of detailed standard guidelines governing the manufacture of drugs, which includes institution and staff qualifications, production premises and facilities, equipment, hygiene conditions, production management, quality controls, product operation, raw material management, maintenance of sales records and management of customer complaints and adverse event reports. 
Pharmaceutical Distribution Permit and GSP Requirements 
To distribute pharmaceutical products in mainland China, including wholesale and retail distribution, a pharmaceutical distribution enterprise must first obtain a Pharmaceutical Distribution Permit. 
-43-


Pursuant to the Administrative Measures of the Pharmaceutical Distribution Permit promulgated by the former CFDA in February 2004 and subsequently amended in November 2017, each Pharmaceutical Distribution Permit issued to a pharmaceutical distribution enterprise is effective for a period of five years. Any enterprise holding a Pharmaceutical Distribution Permit is subject to periodic review and inspection by the relevant regulatory authorities. The enterprise is required to apply for renewal of such permit within six months prior to its expiry and will be subject to reassessment by the issuing authorities in accordance with then prevailing legal and regulatory requirements for the purposes of such renewal. 
The Good Supply Practice for Drugs was promulgated in April 2000 and was amended in November 2012, May 2015, and June 2016. The Good Supply Practice for Drugs is the basic rules for drug operation and quality control, setting forth the requirements for pharmaceutical distribution enterprises throughout the process of procurement, storage, sales and transportation. 
U.S. Regulation of Pharmaceutical Product Development and Approval 
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs and biological products under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the Public Health Service Act, and their implementing regulations. Drugs and biologics are also subject to other federal, state, and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining marketing approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, and local rules and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. regulatory requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval may subject an applicant and/or sponsor to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include, among other actions, FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters and other types of enforcement-related letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal investigations and penalties brought by FDA and the Department of Justice (“DOJ”) or other governmental entities. Our drug and biologic candidates must be approved by the FDA through the NDA and BLA processes, respectively, before they may be legally marketed in the United States. The process required by the FDA before a drug or biologic may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 
•completion of extensive pre-clinical studies, sometimes referred to as pre-clinical laboratory tests, pre-clinical animal studies and formulation studies all performed in compliance with applicable regulations, including the FDA’s GLP regulations; 
•submission to the FDA of an IND which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin and must be updated annually; 
•approval by an independent institutional review board (“IRB”) representing each clinical site before each clinical trial may be initiated; 
•performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with applicable good clinical practices, or GCPs and other clinical trial-related regulations, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug or biological product for its proposed indication; 
•preparation and submission to the FDA of an NDA or BLA; 
•a determination by the FDA within sixty (60) days of its receipt of an NDA or BLA to accept the application for filing referral of the NDA or BLA to an FDA advisory committee, if FDA determines it to be appropriate; 
•satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the API and finished drug or biological product are produced to assess compliance with the FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP; 
•potential FDA audit of the pre-clinical and/or clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA or BLA; and 
•payment of user fees and FDA review and approval of the NDA or BLA prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug or biologic in the United States. 
Pre-Clinical Studies 
The data required to support an NDA is generated in two distinct development stages: pre-clinical and clinical. For new chemical entities, or NCEs, the pre-clinical development stage generally involves synthesizing the active component, developing the formulation and determining the manufacturing process, evaluating purity and stability, as well as carrying out non-human toxicology, pharmacology, and drug metabolism studies in the laboratory, which support subsequent 
-44-


clinical testing. The conduct of the pre-clinical tests must comply with federal regulations, including GLPs and the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Animal Welfare Act. The sponsor must submit the results of the pre-clinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational product to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for human trials. The IND automatically becomes effective thirty (30) days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions regarding the proposed clinical trials and places the IND on clinical hold within that thirty-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before the clinical trial can begin. Some long-term pre-clinical testing, such as animal tests of reproductive adverse events and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a product candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. Accordingly, submission of an IND does not guarantee the FDA will allow clinical trials to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that could cause the trial to be suspended or terminated. 
Clinical Studies 
The clinical stage of development involves the administration of the product candidate to human subjects or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control, in accordance with GCPs, which establish standards for conducting, recording data from, and reporting the results of clinical trials, and GCPs are intended to assure that the data and reported results are accurate, and that the rights, safety and well-being of study participants are protected. GCPs also include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under written study protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety and assess efficacy. Each protocol, and any subsequent amendments to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also reviews and approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trial results to public registries. For example, information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health for public dissemination on their www.clinicaltrials.gov website. 
Clinical trials are generally conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined, known as Phase I, Phase II and Phase III clinical trials. 
•Phase I: The product candidate is initially introduced into a small number of healthy volunteers who are initially exposed to a single dose and then multiple doses. The primary purpose of these clinical trials is to assess the metabolism, pharmacologic action, side effect tolerability and safety of the product candidate. 
•Phase II: The product candidate is administered to a limited patient population to determine dose tolerance and optimal dosage required to produce the desired benefits. At the same time, safety and further pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic information is collected, as well as identification of possible adverse effects and safety risks and preliminary evaluation of efficacy. 
•Phase III: The product candidate is administered to an expanded number of patients, generally at multiple sites that are geographically dispersed, in well-controlled clinical trials to generate enough data to demonstrate the efficacy of the product candidate for its intended use, its safety profile and to establish the overall benefit/risk profile of the product candidate and provide an adequate basis for approval and labeling. Phase III clinical trials may include comparisons with placebo and/or other comparator treatments. 
•Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase IV clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, FDA may mandate the performance of Phase IV clinical trials. 
Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. Written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events or any finding from tests in laboratory animals that suggests a significant risk to human subjects. The FDA, the IRB, or the clinical trial sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. The FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP and the integrity of the clinical 
-45-


data submitted. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution, or an institution it represents, if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the product candidate has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the trial. Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the drug in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, cGMPs impose extensive procedural, substantive and recordkeeping requirements to ensure and preserve the long-term stability and quality of the final drug or biological product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 
NDA and BLA Review and Approval 
After the successful completion of clinical studies of a drug or biological product, FDA approval of an NDA or BLA respectively must be obtained before commercial marketing of the product. The results of non-clinical studies and of the clinical trials, together with other detailed information, including extensive manufacturing information and information on the composition of the drug or biologic and proposed labeling, are submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA or BLA requesting approval to market the drug or biologic for one or more specified indications. FDA approval of an NDA or BLA must be obtained before a drug or biologic may be offered for sale in the United States. 
Under the PDUFA, as amended, each NDA or BLA must be accompanied by a substantial application user fee in the range of several million dollars. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. PDUFA also imposes an annual prescription drug program fee for human drugs. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on NDAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication. 
The FDA reviews all NDAs and BLAs submitted before it accepts them for filing and may request additional information rather than accepting an application for filing. The FDA conducts a preliminary review of an NDA or BLA within sixty days of receipt. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the NDA or BLA. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under PDUFA, the FDA aims to complete its initial review of an NDA or BLA and respond to the applicant within ten months from the filing date for a standard NDA or BLA and, and within six months from the filing date for a priority NDA or BLA. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and Priority Review NDAs and BLAs, and the review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. 
After the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA reviews the NDA or BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed drug or biologic is safe and effective for its intended use, and whether the drug or biologic is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel products or product candidates that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. The FDA may re-analyze the clinical trial data, which can result in extensive discussions between the FDA and us during the review process. 
Before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities to determine whether they comply with cGMPs. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. In addition, before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA may also audit data from clinical trials to ensure compliance with GCP requirements. After the FDA evaluates the application, manufacturing process and manufacturing facilities where the product will be produced, it may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter (“CRL”). An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A CRL indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete, and the application is not ready for approval. A CRL usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the NDA or BLA identified by the FDA. The CRL may require additional clinical data and/or an additional pivotal clinical trial(s) and/or other significant, expensive, and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, pre-clinical studies or manufacturing. If a CRL is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the NDA or BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. Even if such data and information is submitted, the FDA may 
-46-


ultimately decide that the NDA or BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data. 
If a drug receives marketing approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases, dosages, or patient populations or the indications for use may otherwise be limited. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings, or precautions be included in the product labeling or may condition the approval of the NDA or BLA on other changes to the proposed labeling, development of adequate controls and specifications, or a commitment to conduct post-market testing or clinical trials and surveillance to monitor the effects of approved products. For example, the FDA may require Phase IV testing which involves clinical trials designed to further assess a product’s safety and effectiveness and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. The FDA may also place other conditions on approvals including the requirement for a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (the “REMS”) to ensure that the benefits of a drug or biological product outweigh its risks. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the NDA or BLA must submit a proposed REMS. The FDA will not approve the NDA or BLA without an approved REMS, if required. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. Any of these limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the commercial promotion, distribution, prescription or dispensing of drugs or biologics. Product approvals may be withdrawn for non-compliance with regulatory standards or if problems occur following initial marketing. 
Pediatric Trials 
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, an NDA or BLA or supplement thereto must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the product candidate for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. With the enactment of FDASIA in 2012, a sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a product candidate that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration must also submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan, or PSP, within sixty days of an end-of-Phase II meeting or as may be agreed between the sponsor and FDA. The initial PSP must include an outline of the pediatric study or studies that the sponsor plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, age groups, relevant endpoints and statistical approach, or a justification for not including such detailed information and any request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the requirement to provide data from pediatric studies along with supporting information. FDA and the sponsor must reach agreement on the PSP. A sponsor can submit amendments to an agreed-upon initial PSP at any time if changes to the pediatric plan need to be considered based on data collected from pre-clinical studies, early phase clinical trials and/or other clinical development programs. 
Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity 
Under the Orphan Drug Act, FDA may grant orphan designate to a drug or biological product intended to treat a rare disease or condition (generally meaning that the disease or condition affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more in cases in which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a product available in the United States for treatment of the disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product). A company must request orphan product designation before submitting an NDA or BLA. If the request is granted, FDA will publicly disclose the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential use. Orphan product designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process, but if the product ultimately receives FDA approval, the product will be entitled to orphan product exclusivity, meaning that FDA may not approve any other applications for the same product for the same indication for seven years, except in certain limited circumstances. Competitors may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity and may obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication. If a drug or biological product designated as an orphan product ultimately receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what was designated in its orphan product application, it may not be entitled to exclusivity. 
Post-Marketing Requirements 
Following approval of a new product, the manufacturer and the approved product are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, monitoring and recordkeeping activities, reporting to the applicable regulatory authorities of adverse experiences with the drug, providing the regulatory authorities with updated safety and efficacy information, drug sampling and distribution requirements and complying with applicable promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among others, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, restrictions on promoting drugs for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the product’s approved labeling (known as “off-label use”), limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and requirements for promotional activities involving 
-47-


the internet. Although physicians may legally prescribe products for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such off-label uses. Modifications or enhancements to the product or its labeling or changes of the site of manufacture are often subject to the approval of the FDA and other regulators, which may or may not be received or may result in a lengthy review process. 
FDA regulations also require that approved products be manufactured in specific approved facilities and in accordance with cGMP. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our products in accordance with cGMP regulations. NDA and BLA holders using contract manufacturers, laboratories or packagers are responsible for the selection and monitoring of qualified firms, and, in certain circumstances, qualified suppliers to these firms. These manufacturers must comply with cGMP regulations that require, among other things, quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation and the obligation to investigate and correct any deviations from cGMP. Manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs and biologics are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. The discovery of violative conditions, including failure to conform to cGMP, could result in enforcement actions that interrupt the operation of any such facilities or the ability to distribute products manufactured, processed or tested by them. Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved NDA or BLA, including, among other things, recall or withdrawal of the product from the market. Discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements can have negative consequences, including adverse publicity, judicial or administrative enforcement, warning letters from the FDA, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors and civil or criminal penalties, among others. Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a product’s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures. Also, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our product candidates under development. 
The failure to comply with regulatory requirements subjects manufacturers to possible legal or regulatory action. Depending on the circumstances, failure to meet applicable regulatory requirements can result in criminal prosecution, fines or other penalties, injunctions, recall or seizure of drugs, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of product approvals, or exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs. Even if a firm complies with FDA and other requirements, new information regarding the safety or efficacy of a product could lead the FDA to modify or withdraw product approval. Prohibitions or restrictions on sales or withdrawal of future products marketed by us could materially affect our business in an adverse way. 
Changes in regulations, statutes or the interpretation of existing regulations could impact our business in the future by requiring, for example: (1) changes to our manufacturing arrangements; (2) additions or modifications to product labeling; (3) the recall or discontinuation of our products; or (4) additional record-keeping requirements. If any such changes were to be imposed, they could adversely affect the operation of our business. 
Rest of the World Regulation of Pharmaceutical Product Development and Approval 
For other countries outside of mainland China and the United States, such as countries in Europe, Latin America, or other parts of Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, drug licensing, pricing, and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with applicable GCP requirements and the applicable regulatory requirements and ethical principles. 
If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension, or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions, and criminal prosecution. 
Coverage and Reimbursement 
Chinese Coverage and Reimbursement 
Historically, most Chinese healthcare costs had been borne by patients out-of-pocket, which had limited the growth of more expensive pharmaceutical products. However, in recent years the number of people covered by government and private insurance has increased. According to the National Healthcare Security Administration (“NHSA”), as of December 
-48-


2021, approximately 1.36 billion residents in mainland China were enrolled in the Basic Medical Insurance scheme, representing a coverage rate of above 95% of the total population. 
Reimbursement under the National Medical Insurance Program 
The Basic Medical Insurance scheme was adopted pursuant to the Decision of the State Council on the Establishment of the Urban Employee Basic Medical Insurance Program issued by the State Council on December 14, 1998, under which all employers in urban cities are required to enroll their employees in the Basic Medical Insurance scheme and the insurance premium is jointly contributed by the employers and employees. The State Council promulgated Guiding Opinions for the Pilot of Urban Resident Basic Medical Insurance on July 10, 2007, under which urban residents of the pilot district, rather than urban employees, may voluntarily join Urban Resident Basic Medical Insurance. 
Pursuant to the Chinese Social Insurance Law promulgated by the SCNPC in October 2010 and subsequently amended in December 2018, all employees are required to enroll in the basic medical insurance program and the insurance premium is jointly contributed by the employers and employees as required by the state. 
The Interim Measures for the Administration of Use of Drugs Covered by the Basic Medical Insurance was promulgated by NHSA in July 2020 and came into effect in September 2020. According to which, expenses of drugs listed in the Basic Medical Insurance Catalog, typically known in the industry as the NRDL, will be paid in full or part from the basic medical insurance fund in accordance with applicable provisions, and the drugs with the same generic names as those specified in the Basic Medical Insurance Catalog will be automatically regulated by the Basic Medical Insurance Catalog and shall also be eligible for the reimbursement by the basic medical insurance fund. These measures further clarify that the Basic Medical Insurance Catalog shall be promulgated by the NHSA and adjusted on an annual basis. Provinces shall have the right to add eligible ethnic drugs, preparations of medical institutions, and traditional Chinese medicine decoction pieces into the provincial medical insurance-based payment scope, which shall be implemented after being filed with the NHSA for record. 
The Chinese Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, together with other government authorities, have the power to determine the medicines included in the NRDL. In January 2023, the NHSA and the Chinese Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security released the 2022 National Drug Catalog for Basic Medical Insurance, Work-Related Injury Insurance and Maternity Insurance (the “2022 NRDL”), and 111 new drugs were admitted to the 2022 NRDL. Previous updates to the NRDL occurred in 2021, 2020, 2019, 2017, and 2009. Admission to the NRDL depends on a number of factors, including on-market experience, scale of patient adoption, physician endorsement, cost effectiveness, and budget impact. Since 2019, provincial governments were not allowed to create provincial reimbursable drug lists by adding or removing chemical and biological drugs from the NRDL. 
Medicines included in the NRDL are divided into two classes, Class A and Class B. Patients purchasing medicines included in the NRDL are entitled to reimbursement of the entire amount or a certain percentage of the purchase price. The percentage of reimbursement for Class B medicines differs from region to region in mainland China. 
The total amount of reimbursement for the cost of medicines, in addition to other medical expenses, for an individual participant under the Basic Medical Insurance scheme in a calendar year is capped at the amount in such participant’s individual account under such program. The amount in a participant’s account varies, depending on the amount of contributions from the participant and his or her employer. 
National List of Essential Drugs 
In August 2009, the former MOH and eight other ministries and commissions in mainland China issued the Provisional Measures on the Administration of the National List of Essential Drugs (the “NEDL”) and the Guidelines on the Implementation of the NEDL System. The provisional measures aimed to promote essential medicines sold to consumers at fair prices in mainland China and ensured that the general public in mainland China has equal access to the drugs contained in the NEDL. The Provisional Measures on the Administration of the National List of Essential Drugs was then amended in February 2015. The former MOH promulgated the NEDL (Catalog for the Basic Healthcare Institutions) in August 2009, a revised NEDL in March 2013, and another revised NEDL in September 2018, which became effective in November 2018. According to these regulations, basic healthcare institutions funded by government, which primarily include county-level hospitals, county-level Chinese medicine hospitals, rural clinics, and community clinics, shall store up and use drugs listed in the NEDL. The drugs listed in NEDL shall be purchased by centralized tender process and shall be subject to the price control by NDRC. Drugs listed in the NEDL will be given priority to being listed in the NRDL. 
Commercial Insurance 
-49-


In October 2016, the State Council and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China jointly issued the Plan for Healthy China 2030. According to the Plan, the country will establish a multi-level medical security system built around Basic Medical Insurance, with other forms of insurance supplementing the Basic Medical Insurance, including serious illness insurance for urban and rural residents, commercial health insurance and medical assistance. Furthermore, the Plan encourages enterprises and individuals to participate in commercial health insurance and various forms of supplementary insurance. The evolving medical insurance system makes innovative drugs more affordable and universally available to the Chinese population, which renders greater opportunities to drug manufacturers that focus on the research and development of innovative drugs, such as high-cost cancer therapeutics. 
Price Controls 
Instead of direct price controls which were historically used in mainland China but abolished in June 2015, the government regulates prices mainly by establishing price negotiations, consolidated procurement mechanism and revising medical insurance reimbursement standards as discussed below. 
Price Negotiations 
The Chinese government has initiated several rounds of price negotiations with manufacturers of patented drugs, drugs with an exclusive source of supply and oncology drugs since 2016. The average percentage of price reduction has been around 50%. Once the government agreed with the drug manufacturers on the supply prices, the drugs would be automatically listed in the NRDL and qualified for public hospital purchase. 
There were NRDL price negotiations in 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022. In 2022, 111 drugs were newly added to the 2022 NRDL, the average price reduction of the 108 drugs participating in price negotiations is 60.1%. 
Centralized Procurement and Tenders 
The Guiding Opinions concerning the Urban Medical and Health System Reform, promulgated in February 2000, aims to regulate the purchasing process of pharmaceutical products by medical institutions. The former MOH and other relevant government authorities have promulgated a series of regulations in order to implement the tender requirements. 
According to the Notice on Issuing Certain Regulations on the Trial Implementation of Centralized Tender Procurement of Drugs by Medical Institutions promulgated in July 2000, and the Notice on Further Improvement on the Implementation of Centralized Tender Procurement of Drugs by Medical Institutions promulgated in August 2001, non-for-profit medical institutions established by county or higher-level government are required to implement centralized tender procurement of drugs. 
The former MOH promulgated the Working Regulations of Medical Institutions for Procurement of Drugs by Centralized Tender and Price Negotiations (for Trial Implementation) in March 2002, which provides rules for the tender process and negotiations of the prices of drugs, operational procedures, a code of conduct and standards or measures of evaluating bids and negotiating prices. In January 2009, the former MOH, the former SFDA, and four other national departments jointly promulgated the Notice of the Financial Planning Department of Ministry of Health on Issue of the Opinions on Further Regulating Centralized Procurement of Drugs by Medical Institutions. According to the notice, non-for-profit medical institutions owned by the government at the county level or higher or owned by state-owned enterprises (including state-controlled enterprises) shall purchase pharmaceutical products by online centralized procurement. Each provincial government shall formulate its catalog of drugs subject to centralized procurement. Except for drugs in the NEDL (the procurement of which shall comply with the relevant rules on NEDL), certain pharmaceutical products which are under the national government’s special control, such as toxic, radioactive, and narcotic drugs and TCMs, in principle, all drugs used by non-for-profit medical institutions medical institutions shall be subject to centralized procurement. In July 2010, the former MOH and six other ministries and commissions jointly promulgated the Notice on Printing and Distributing the Working Regulations of Medical Institutions for Centralized Procurement of Drugs to further regulate the centralized procurement of drugs and clarify the code of conduct of the parties in centralized drug procurement. The Opinions of the General Office of the State Council on Improvement of the Policy of Production, Circulation and Use of Drugs promulgated in January 2017 aim to deepen the reform of medical health system, improve the quality of the drug and regulate the distribution and use of the drug. The Notice of the General Office of the State Council on Issuing Pilot Plan of Centralized Procurement and Use of the Drug Organized by the State promulgated in January 2019 aims to improve the pricing mechanism of the drug, which also further regulates the scope and model of centralized procurement. 
The centralized tender process takes the form of public tender operated and organized by provincial or municipal government agencies. The centralized tender process is in principle conducted once every year in the relevant province or city in mainland China. The bids are assessed by a committee composed of pharmaceutical and medical experts who will be randomly selected from a database of experts approved by the relevant government authorities. The committee members 
-50-


assess the bids based on a number of factors, including but not limited to, bid price, product quality, clinical effectiveness, product safety, qualifications and reputation of the manufacturer, after-sale services and innovation. Only pharmaceuticals that have won in the centralized tender process may be purchased by public medical institutions funded by the governmental or state-owned enterprise (including state-controlled enterprises) in the relevant region. 
“4+7” Volume-based Drug Procurement and Tenders 
In June 2018, the State Council decided to launch a new round of drug pricing and procurement reform. This reform is implemented mainly by the NHSA, a new government authority established in 2018 as part of the institutional restructuring with a mandate of pricing and procurement of drugs and medical disposables. The NHC supports the reform by introducing policy that encourages purchasing and prescribing of the selected drug and managing the supplier’s behavior. The NMPA is responsible for the quality assurance of the drug. 
In November 2018, the Joint Procurement Office, the procurement alliance formed by representatives of procurement agencies in 11 pilot cities established to oversee the bidding and procurement process, published the Paper on Drug Centralized Procurement in “4+7” Regions, launching the national pilot scheme for centralized volume-based drug procurement and tenders. According to the papers, the initial procurement of 31 generic drugs was implemented in 4 municipalities, namely Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin and Chongqing and 7 cities, namely Shenyang, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Xi’an, Dalian, Chengdu and Xiamen. This pilot program is thus also referred to as the “4+7” procurement scheme. On January 1, 2019, the General Office of the State Council published a circular on National Pilot Program for Centralized Procurement and Use of the Drug Organized by the State, which provides detailed implementing measures for the nation-wide centralized drug procurement and tender scheme. 
The “4+7” pilot program puts special emphasis on procurement volume guarantee. Public hospitals in pilot regions are encouraged to form a group procurement organization to increase the negotiation leverage. The committed volume will be shared by all qualified bid-winners, and public hospitals should prioritize their use of drugs purchased through the volume-based procurement in order to realize the volume commitment. Under this program, a company is provided with a substantial volume guarantee. The selected drugs must pass the generic drug consistency evaluation on quality and effectiveness. The reform policy is aimed to lower drug costs for patients, reduce transaction costs for enterprises, regulate drug use of hospitals, and improve the centralized drug procurement and pricing system. The centralized volume-based procurement is open to all approved enterprises that manufacture drugs on the government-set procurement list in mainland China. Clinical effects, adverse reactions and batch stability of the drugs are considered, and their quality consistency with the originator drugs will be the main criteria for evaluation. Production capacity and stability of the supplier are also considered. 
In December 2018, the preliminary results of the “4+7” centralized volume-based procurement were announced: 25 out of 31 generic drugs were selected, of which there are 3 originator drugs and 22 generics. As of December 2019, many provinces have published regional implementation measures, expanding the pilot program. In January 2020, the results of the second round of the national centralized volume-based procurement and tender program were published: the average price reduction reached more than 50%, and the highest reduction has reached 90%. The results of the third, the fourth, the fifth, the sixth (specially for insulin), and the seventh round of the national centralized volume-based procurement and tender program were published in August 2020, February 2021, June 2021, November 2021, and July 2022, respectively, show similar levels of reduction in average price reduction of about 50%, with the highest reduction reaching about 93%, 96%, 98%, 74%, and 98%, respectively. 
Two-Invoice System 
In addition to the centralized tender process, the Chinese government also rolled out a “two-invoice system.” Under the 2016 List of Major Tasks in Furtherance of the Healthcare and Pharmaceutical Reforms issued by the General Office of the State Council in April 2016, the two-invoice system will be fully implemented in mainland China. According to the Circular on Issuing the Implementing Opinions on Carrying out the Two-invoice System for Drug Procurement among Public Medical Institutions (Tentative), which came into effect in December 2016, the two-invoice system means, in principle, there cannot be more than two invoices issued for drug products supplied by manufacturers to public hospitals. To meet this requirement, many drug manufacturers have reduced the tiers of distributors, or converted drug distributors into contracted service organizations. This excludes the sale of products invoiced from the manufacturer to its wholly owned or controlled distributors, or for imported drugs, to its exclusive distributor, or from a distributor to its wholly owned or controlled subsidiary (or between its wholly owned or controlled subsidiaries). However, the system still significantly limits the options for companies to use multiple distributors to reach a larger geographic area in mainland China. The reduction in distribution tiers resulted in a decrease in distribution mark-ups, hence the supply prices to public hospitals would also be reduced. Compliance with the two-invoice system is a prerequisite for pharmaceutical companies to participate in the tender and procurement processes of public hospitals, which currently provide most of Chinese 
-51-


healthcare services. Manufacturers and distributors that fail to implement the two-invoice system may lose their qualifications to participate in the tender and procurement process. Non-compliant manufacturers may also be blacklisted from engaging in drug sales to public hospitals. The two-invoice system has been implemented in all provinces, each with its own regional implementation rules. 
Medical Insurance Reimbursement Standards 
The Opinions on Integrating the Basic Medical Insurance Systems for Urban and Rural Residents, issued by the State Council in January 2016, call for the integration of the urban resident basic medical insurance and the new rural cooperative medical care system and the establishment of a unified Basic Medical Insurance system. This unified Basic Medical Insurance system will cover all urban and rural residents other than rural migrant workers and persons in flexible employment arrangement who participate in the Basic Medical Insurance for urban employees. 
The General Office of the State Council further announced a master plan for the medical insurance reimbursement reform in June 2017. The main objectives are to implement a diversified reimbursement mechanism including Diagnosis Related Groups (“DRGs”), per-capita caps, and per-bed-day caps. Local administration of healthcare security will introduce a total budget control for their jurisdictions and decide the amount of reimbursement to public hospitals based on hospitals’ performance and the spending targets of individual Basic Medical Insurance funds. In June 2019, the NHSA, the Ministry of Finance, the NHC and the National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine jointly issued the Notice on the National List of Pilot Cities for the DRG Payment Mechanism, identifying 30 cities as pilot cities for the DRG payment pilot program, proposing to further the medical insurance reimbursement reform. 
To further standardize payment in the Basic Medical Insurance schemes, in October 2019, the NHSA issued two key technical documents for a pilot project that introduces DRGs, the Technical Guideline of the Classification and Payment for China Healthcare Security Diagnosis Related Groups (CHS-DRG) and the CHS-DRG Classification Plan. According to the classification plan, patients will be sorted into 26 major diagnostic categories and 376 adjacent diagnosis-related groups. DRG-based settlement is currently only applicable to expenses of inpatient care incurred by the insureds at designated hospitals participating in the DRG payment pilot programs and payable by regional medical insurance fund under the Basic Medical Insurance schemes. DRG-based payments are made directly to the participating medical institutions, while the covered benefits enjoyed by the insureds, under the current public insurance schemes, are not affected by such settlement. In June 2020, the NHSA issued a more detailed CHS-DRG Classification Plan, further diving the 376 diagnosis-related groups into 618 basic reimbursement unit. The 30 municipalities participating in the DRG pilot project were required to submit technical assessment report to the local branch of NHSA before August 31, 2020. Upon receiving NHSA’s approval, the participating municipalities may commence conducting simulation runs of the pilot project. After the simulation runs, the DRG-based settlement system is expected to be launched gradually from 2022 to 2024. In February 2020, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council jointly promulgated the Opinions on Deepening the Reform of the Healthcare Security System, which suggests that a multi-compound medical insurance payment method based on payment by disease shall be implemented. In October 2020, the NHSA issued the Notice on Issuance of the Pilot Work Plan for Total Budget by Regional Points Method and Diagnosis-Intervention Packet Payment to introduced and further implement the Diagnosis-Intervention Packet (DIP) payment. DIP and DRG are the same in essence and principle, and therefore DIP can be considered as a variant of DRG. In November 2020, the NHSA issued two key technical documents for the DIP payment pilot project, the China Healthcare Security Technical Specification of Diagnosis-Intervention Packet (DIP) and the DIP Classification Catalogue (Version 1.0). In May 2021, the NHSA issued the Medical Insurance Handling Management Regulations (Trial) for Diagnosis-Intervention Packet (DIP) Payment to provide detailed guidance for implementing medical insurance payment based on DIP. In the List of Pilot Cities for DRG/DIP Payment published by NHSA in December 2021, 18 cities were identified as pilot cities for the DRG payment pilot program, 12 cities were identified as pilot cities for the DIP payment pilot program, and 2 cities were identified as pilot cities for both the DRG payment pilot program and the DIP payment pilot program. In order to accelerate the reform of DRG / DIP payment, the NHSA has formulated and made public a Three-Year Action Plan for DRG / DIP payment reform on November 19, 2021, which makes it clear that by the end of 2024, DRG / DIP payment reform will be carried out in all overall planning areas across the country. By the end of 2025, DRG / DIP payment will cover all qualified medical institutions providing inpatient services. 
Healthcare System Reform
In the past decade, the Chinese government promulgated several healthcare reform policies and regulations to reform the healthcare system. In March 2009, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council jointly issued the Guidelines on Strengthening the Reform of Healthcare System. The State Council issued the Notice on the Issuance of the 13th Five-year Plan on Strengthening the Reform of Healthcare System in December 2016. The General Office of the State Council issued a Notice on the Issuance of the 14th Five-year Medical-Security Plan in September 2021. 
-52-


The General Office of the State Council issued a Notice on the Main Tasks of Strengthening the Reform of Healthcare System for each year of 2017, 2018, 2019, 2021, and 2022. 
Highlights of these healthcare reform policies and regulations include the following: 
One of the main objectives of the reform was to establish a basic healthcare system to cover both urban and rural residents and provide the Chinese people with safe, effective, convenient, and affordable healthcare services. During the 14th five-year period (2021-2025), Basic Medical Insurance coverage will remain above 95% of the country’s population every year. 
Another main objective of reform was to improve the healthcare system, through the reform and development of a graded diagnosis and treatment system, modern hospital management, Basic Medical Insurance, drug supply support and comprehensive supervision. 
The reforms aimed to promote orderly market competition and improve the efficiency and quality of the healthcare system to meet the various medical needs of the Chinese population. From 2009, basic public healthcare services such as preventive healthcare, maternal and child healthcare and health education were to be provided to urban and rural residents. In the meantime, the reforms also encouraged innovations by pharmaceutical companies to eliminate pharmaceutical products that fail to prove definite efficacy and positive risk-benefit ratio. 
The key tasks of the reform in the 13th five-year period were as follows: (1) to deepen the reform of public hospitals, (2) to accelerate the development of a graded diagnosis and treatment system, (3) to consolidate and improve the universal medical insurance system, (4) to guarantee drug supply, (5) to establish and improve a comprehensive supervision system, (6) to cultivate talented health-care practitioners, (7) to stabilize and perfect the basic public health service equalization system, (8) to advance the construction of health information technology, (9) to accelerate the development of the health services industry generally, and (10) to strengthen organization and implementation. 
In December 2019, the SCNPC promulgated the Law of the People’s Republic of China on Promotion of Basic Medical and Health Care, which came into effect in June 2020. Such law established the legal framework for the administration of basic medical and health services for citizens in mainland China, including the administration of basic medical care services, medical care institutions, medical staff, guarantee of drug supply, health promotion and guarantee of medical funds. 
In February 2020, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council jointly promulgated the Opinions on Deepening the Reform of the Healthcare Security System, which envisages that a higher-level healthcare system should be established by 2030, which centers on basic medical insurance, is underpinned by medical aid and pursues the joint development of supplementary medical insurance, commercial health insurance, charitable donations and medial mutual assistance. To this end, such opinions map out tasks in several respects, including making the mechanism of medical insurance benefits more impartial and appropriate, improving the robust and sustainable operating mechanism for funds raised, establishing more effective and efficient healthcare payment mechanism, and enhancing the supervision and administration on medical security fund. 
According to the 14th Five-year Medical-Security Plan, China should enhance the medical insurance system through collaborative governance, optimizing medical insurance payments and the drug pricing mechanism, while strengthening the medical fund supervision system. Efforts should also be made to build up a strong supporting system with a solid legal basis and better digital services. More efforts are needed too to enhance the basic medical security system, improve the mechanism that provides insurance and aid for the treatment of major and serious diseases, and boost the synergy between health insurance and medical assistance. 
U.S. Coverage and Reimbursement
Successful sales of our drug candidates in the U.S. market, if approved, will depend, in part, on the extent to which our drugs are covered and adequately reimbursed by third-party payors, such as government health programs or private health insurance (including managed care plans). Patients who are provided with prescriptions as part of their medical treatment generally rely on such third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the costs associated with their prescriptions and therefore adequate coverage and reimbursement from such third-party payors are critical to new and ongoing product acceptance. These third-party payors are increasingly limiting coverage of medical drugs, reducing reimbursements for medical drugs and services and implementing measures to control utilization of drugs (such as requiring prior authorization for coverage). Additionally, the containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal and state governments, and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. Federal and state governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic drugs. If our drug candidates are approved, limitations on coverage or reimbursement as well as 
-53-


price controls and cost-containment measures could have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations, and financial condition. 
Health care reform initiatives have resulted in significant changes to the coverage, reimbursement, and delivery of health care, including drugs, such as the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which contains numerous drug pricing and payment reforms. Health care reform efforts are likely to continue, and such efforts have included, and may include in the future, attempts to repeal or modify prior healthcare reform. 
General legislative cost control measures may also affect reimbursement for our products. The Budget Control Act, as amended, resulted in the imposition of reductions in Medicare (but not Medicaid) payments to providers in 2013 and will remain in effect through 2031 (except May 1, 2020 to March 31, 2021) unless additional Congressional action is taken. If we obtain approval to market a drug candidate in the United States, any significant spending reductions affecting Medicare, Medicaid or other publicly funded or subsidized health programs that may be implemented and/or any significant taxes or fees that may be imposed on us could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. 
Other Healthcare Laws 
Other Chinese Healthcare Laws 
Advertising of Pharmaceutical Products 
Pursuant to the Interim Administrative Measures for the Review of Advertisements for Drugs, Medical Devices, Health Food and Formula Food for Special Medical Purposes promulgated by the SAMR in December 2019 and effective in March 2020, an enterprise seeking to advertise its pharmaceutical products must apply for an advertisement approval number. The advertisement approval number is issued by the relevant local administrative authority. The validity term of the advertisement approval number for drugs shall be consistent with the shortest validity term of the pharmaceutical product marketing authorization, filing certificate or Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Permit. If no valid term is prescribed in the pharmaceutical product marketing authorization, filing certificate or Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Permit, the valid term of the advertisement approval number shall be two years. The content of an approved advertisement may not be altered without prior approval. 
Insert Sheet and Labels of Pharmaceutical Products 
According to the Measures for the Administration of the Insert Sheets and Labels of Drugs effective on June 1, 2006, the insert sheets and labels of drugs should be reviewed and approved by the former SFDA (now the NMPA). A drug insert sheet should include the scientific data, conclusions and information concerning drug safety and efficacy in order to direct the safe and rational use of drugs. The inner label of a drug should bear such information as the drug’s name, indication or function, strength, dose and usage, production date, batch number, expiry date and drug manufacturer, and the outer label of a drug should indicate such information as the drug’s name, ingredients, description, indication or function, strength, dose and usage, adverse reaction, contraindication, precautions, storage, production date, batch number, expiry date and drug manufacturer. 
Packaging of Pharmaceutical Products 
According to the Measures for the Administration of Pharmaceutical Packaging effective in September 1988, pharmaceutical packaging must comply with national and industry standards. If no national or industry standards are available, the enterprise can formulate its own standards and implement after obtaining the approval of administration of medical products and bureau of standards at provincial level. The enterprise shall reapply with the relevant authorities if it needs to change its own packaging standards. Drugs that have not developed and received approval for packing standards must not be sold or traded in mainland China (except for drugs for the military). 
Measures for the Supervision and Administration of Online Drug Sales
On August 3, 2022, the SAMR announced the Measures for the Supervision and Administration of Online Drug Sales (the “Measures”), which came into effect on December 1, 2022. The Measures set out a comprehensive regulatory framework for the online sale of drugs, including the online sale of prescription drugs and the regulation of trading platforms that engage in the online sale of drugs.
The Measures include six chapters and 42 articles. The main sections include: (i) the obligations, qualifications, and responsibilities of online drug sellers; (ii) the responsibilities of trading platforms for online drug sales; (iii) the supervision and management of online sales of prescription drugs; (iv) the division of responsibilities of drug regulators at all levels in 
-54-


the supervision of online drug sales; and (v) the legal liability for illegal online drug sales. Notably, both drug marketing authorization holders and drug distributors can qualify as online drug sellers. Online sale of prescription drugs is permitted, but drug retailers and providers of trading platforms for the online sale of prescription drugs must abide by the regulatory requirements specified in the Measures.
Other U.S. Healthcare and Regulatory Laws 
Within the United States, manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities that may follow drug approval are also subject to regulation by numerous federal, state and local regulatory authorities, including, the FDA, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, other divisions of the Department of Health and Human Services, the Drug Enforcement Administration for controlled substances, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational Safety & Health Administration, and the Environmental Protection Agency. 
We may therefore be subject to healthcare regulation and enforcement by the U.S. federal government and the states where we may market our drug candidates, if approved. These laws include, without limitation, anti-corruption, federal and state fraud and abuse, privacy, and security and transparency laws, such as the following: 
•the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”), which prohibits U.S. companies and their representatives from paying, offering to pay, promising to pay, or authorizing the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or to otherwise obtain favorable treatment or influence a person working in an official capacity. In many countries, the health care professionals we regularly interact with may meet the FCPA’s definition of a foreign government official. The FCPA also requires public companies to make and keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect their transactions and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls; 
•federal healthcare program anti-kickback laws, which prohibit, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully offering, soliciting, receiving, or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an individual, for an item or service or the purchasing or ordering of a good or service, for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid; 
•federal false claims laws which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, information or claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid or other third-party payers that are false or fraudulent; 
•the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended, which prohibits executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program (including private health plans) or making false statements relating to healthcare matters and which also imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information; 
•federal laws that require pharmaceutical manufacturers to report certain calculated product prices to the government or provide certain discounts or rebates to government authorities or private entities, often as a condition of reimbursement under government healthcare programs; 
•the federal Sunshine Act, which requires pharmaceutical and medical device companies to monitor and report certain financial interactions with physicians, certain non-physician practitioners and teaching hospitals to the federal government for re-disclosure to the public; and 
•state law equivalents of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payer, including private insurers, state transparency laws, state laws limiting interactions between pharmaceutical manufacturers and members of the healthcare industry, state laws regulating or requiring the reporting of prices, and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by federal laws, thus complicating compliance efforts. 
In addition, the distribution of pharmaceutical drugs is subject to specific regulatory requirements, including licensure, extensive record-keeping, storage and security requirements intended to prevent the unauthorized sale of pharmaceutical drugs. The handling of any controlled substances must comply with the U.S. Controlled Substances Act and Controlled Substances Import and Export Act. Drugs must meet applicable child-resistant packaging requirements under the U.S. Poison Prevention Packaging Act. 
If and when we become subject to these various healthcare and regulatory laws, efforts to ensure that our activities comply with applicable healthcare laws may involve substantial costs. Many of these laws and their implementing regulations contain ambiguous requirements or require administrative guidance for implementation. Given the lack of 
-55-


clarity in laws and their implementation, our activities could be subject to challenge. If our operations were found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we could be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, including, without limitation, damages, fines, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, or contracting with government authorities and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, which could significantly harm our business. 
Other Significant Chinese Regulation Affecting Our Business Activities in Mainland China 
Chinese Regulation of Foreign Investment 
The establishment, operation, and management of corporate entities in mainland China are governed by the Company Law of the People’s Republic of China (the “PRC Company Law”), which was adopted by the SCNPC in December 1993, implemented in July 1994, and subsequently amended in December 1999, August 2004, October 2005, December 2013, and October 2018. Under the PRC Company Law, companies are generally classified into two categories: limited liability companies and companies limited by shares. The PRC Company Law also applies to foreign-invested limited liability companies and foreign-invested companies limited by shares. Pursuant to the PRC Company Law, where laws on foreign investment have other stipulations, such stipulations shall prevail. In December 2021, the SCNPC issued the first draft amendment to the PRC Company Law for comment. The first draft amended PRC Company Law has made roughly 70 substantive changes on the basis of the 13 chapters and 218 articles of the current Company Law (rev. 2018). It would (i) refine special provisions on state-funded companies; (ii) improve the company establishment and exit system; (iii) optimize corporate structure and corporate governance; (iv) optimize the capital structure; (v) tighten the responsibilities of controlling shareholders and management personnel; and (vi) strengthen corporate social responsibility. In December 2022, the SCNPC issued the second draft amendment to the PRC Company Law for comment. On the basis of the changes made in the previous draft, the second draft amended PRC Company Law has introduced numerous new provisions to further strengthen shareholder’s capital contribution responsibility, reinforce liabilities of directors and senior management by holding them jointly liable for their willful misconduct or gross negligence, optimize corporate structure and enhance corporate governance of listed companies, among other things. Listed companies are required to disclose information on shareholders and actual controllers in accordance with applicable laws. Shareholders are obliged to make capital contributions in advance at the request of a company or its creditor where the company is unable to pay its debts when they become due.
Investment activities in mainland China by foreign investors are governed by the Guiding Foreign Investment Direction, which was promulgated by the State Council in February 2002, and came into effect in April 2002, and the latest Special Administrative Measures (Negative List) for Foreign Investment Access (2021) (the “Negative List”), which was promulgated by the Ministry of Commerce (the “MOFCOM”), and the NDRC on December 27, 2021, and took effect on January 1, 2022. The Negative List set out in a unified manner the restrictive measures, such as the requirements on shareholding percentages and management, for the access of foreign investments, and the industries that are prohibited for foreign investment. The Negative List covers 12 industries, and any field not falling in the Negative List shall be administered under the principle of equal treatment to domestic and foreign investment. 
The Foreign Investment Law of the People’s Republic of China (the “Foreign Investment Law”) was promulgated by the NPC in March 2019 and become effective in January 2020. After the Foreign Investment Law came into force, the Law of the People’s Republic of China on Wholly Foreign-Owned Enterprises, the Law of the People’s Republic of China on Sino-foreign Equity Joint Ventures and the Law of the People’s Republic of China on Sino-foreign Contractual Joint Ventures have been repealed simultaneously. The investment activities of foreign natural persons, enterprises or other organizations (hereinafter referred to as foreign investors) directly or indirectly within the territory of mainland China shall comply with and be governed by the Foreign Investment Law, including: 1) establishing by foreign investors of foreign-invested enterprises in mainland China alone or jointly with other investors; 2) acquiring by foreign investors of shares, equity, property shares, or other similar interests of Chinese domestic enterprises; 3) investing by foreign investors in new projects in mainland China alone or jointly with other investors; and 4) other forms of investment prescribed by laws, administrative regulations or the State Council. 
In December 2019, the State Council issued the Regulations on Implementing the Foreign Investment Law, which came into effect in January 2020. After the Regulations on Implementing the Foreign Investment Law came into effect, the Regulation on Implementing the Law on Sino-foreign Equity Joint Ventures, Provisional Regulations on the Duration of Sino-Foreign Equity Joint Ventures, the Regulations on Implementing the Law on Wholly Foreign-Owned Enterprises and the Regulations on Implementing the Law on Sino-Foreign Cooperative Joint Ventures have been repealed simultaneously. 
In December 2019, the MOFCOM and the SAMR issued the Measures for the Reporting of Foreign Investment Information, which came into effect in January 2020. After the Measures for the Reporting of Foreign Investment 
-56-


Information came into effect, the Interim Measures on the Administration of Filing for Establishment and Change of Foreign Invested Enterprises has been repealed simultaneously. Since January 1, 2020, for foreign investors carrying out investment activities directly or indirectly in mainland China, the foreign investors or foreign-invested enterprises shall submit investment information to the relevant commerce administrative authorities pursuant to these measures. 
Chinese Regulation of Commercial Bribery 
Pursuant to specific provisions in the PRC Anti-Unfair Competition Law promulgated by the SCNPC in September 1993, as amended in November 2017, and April 2019, commercial bribery is prohibited. Under the current effective PRC Anti-Unfair Competition Law, a business operator shall not resort to bribery, by offering money or goods or by any other means, to any of the following entities or individuals, in order to seek a transaction opportunity or competitive advantage: (i) any employee of the counterparty in a transaction; (ii) any entity or individual entrusted by the counterparty in a transaction to handle relevant affairs; or (iii) any other entity or individual that is to take advantage of powers or influence to influence a transaction. Administrative liability is directly imposed on the bribe giver, however, both the bribe giver and the bribe recipient are subject to civil and criminal liability. 
In November 2022, the SAMR issued for public comments a draft revision to the PRC Anti-Unfair Competition Law. Under the draft revised law, offering benefits directly to the transaction counterparty might also be considered a commercial bribe, and the scope of commercial bribery has been expanded to include giving bribe with the help of a third party. Both the bribe giver and the bribe recipient are subject to administrative liability prescribed by the draft revised law. 
Further, pharmaceutical companies involved in a criminal investigation or administrative proceedings related to bribery are listed in the Adverse Records of Commercial Briberies by its provincial health and family planning administrative department. Pursuant to the Provisions on the Establishment of Adverse Records of Commercial Briberies in the Medicine Purchase and Sales Industry which became effective in March 2014, provincial health and family planning administrative departments formulate the implementing measures for the establishment of Adverse Records of Commercial Briberies. If a pharmaceutical company is listed in the Adverse Records of Commercial Briberies for the first time, their production is not required to be purchased by public medical institutions. A pharmaceutical company will not be penalized by the relevant Chinese government authorities merely by virtue of having contractual relationships with distributors or third-party promoters who are engaged in bribery activities, so long as such pharmaceutical company and its employees are not utilizing the distributors or third-party promoters for the implementation of, or acting in conjunction with them in, the prohibited bribery activities. In addition, a pharmaceutical company is under no legal obligation to monitor the operating activities of its distributors and third-party promoters, and it will not be subject to penalties or sanctions by relevant Chinese government authorities as a result of failure to monitor their operating activities. 
Chinese Regulation of Product Liability 
In addition to the strict new drug approval process, certain Chinese laws have been promulgated to protect the rights of consumers and to strengthen the control of medical products in mainland China. Under current Chinese law, manufacturers, and vendors of defective products in mainland China may incur liability for loss and injury caused by such products. Pursuant to the General Principles of the Civil Law of the People’s Republic of China (the “China Civil Law”), promulgated in April 1986, and amended in August 2009, a defective product which causes property damage or physical injury to any person may subject the manufacturer or vendor of such product to civil liability for such damage or injury. The PRC Civil Code, which was promulgated in May 2020 and became effective in January 2021, amalgamates and replaces a series of specialized laws in civil law area, including the PRC Civil Law. The rules on product liability in the PRC Civil Code remain consistent with the rules in the PRC Civil Law. 
In February 1993, the Product Quality Law of the People’s Republic of China (the “Product Quality Law”) was promulgated to supplement the PRC Civil Law aiming to protect the legitimate rights and interests of the end-users and consumers and to strengthen the supervision and control of the quality of products. The Product Quality Law was revised in July 2000, August 2009, and December 2018. Pursuant to the revised Product Quality Law, manufacturers who produce defective products and distributors who sell defective products may be subject to civil or criminal liability and revocation of their business licenses. 
The Law of the People’s Republic of China on the Protection of the Rights and Interests of Consumers was promulgated in October 1993, and was amended in August 2009 and October 2013, to protect consumers’ rights when they purchase or use goods and accept services. All business operators must comply with this law when they manufacture or sell goods and/or provide services to customers. Under the amendment on October 25, 2013, all business operators shall pay high attention to protect the customers’ privacy and strictly keep confidential any consumer information they obtain during the business operation. In addition, in extreme situations, pharmaceutical product manufacturers and operators may be subject to criminal liability if their goods or services lead to the death or injuries of customers or other third parties. 
-57-


Chinese Tort Law 
Under the Tort Law of the People’s Republic of China (the “Tort Law”), which became effective in July 2010, if damages to other persons are caused by defective products due to the fault of a third party, such as the parties providing transportation or warehousing, the producers and the sellers of the products have the right to recover their respective losses from such third parties. If defective products are identified after they have been put into circulation, the producers or the sellers shall take remedial measures such as the issuance of a warning, the recall of products, etc. in a timely manner. The producers or the sellers shall be liable under tort if they fail to take remedial measures in a timely manner or have not made efforts to take remedial measures, thus causing damages. If the products are produced or sold with known defects, causing deaths or severe adverse health issues, the infringed party has the right to claim punitive damages in addition to compensatory damages. The PRC Civil Code amalgamated and replaced the Tort Law effective in January 2021. The rules on tort in the PRC Civil Code are generally consistent with the Tort Law. 
Chinese Regulation of Intellectual Property Rights 
Mainland China has made substantial efforts to adopt comprehensive legislation governing intellectual property rights, including patents, trademarks, copyrights, and domain names. 
Patents
Pursuant to the China Patent Law, most recently amended in December 2008 and October 2020, and its implementation rules, most recently amended in January 2010, patents in mainland China fall into three categories: invention, utility model and design. An invention patent is granted to a new technical solution proposed in respect of a product or method or an improvement of a product or method. A utility model is granted to a new technical solution that is practicable for application and proposed in respect of the shape, structure, or a combination of both of a product. A design patent is granted to the new design of a certain product in shape, pattern, or a combination of both and in color, shape, and pattern combinations aesthetically suitable for industrial application. Under the China Patent Law, the term of patent protection starts from the date of application. Patents relating to invention are effective for twenty years, and utility models and designs are effective for ten and fifteen years, respectively, from the date of application. The China Patent Law adopts the principle of “first-to-file” system, which provides that where more than one person files a patent application for the same invention, a patent will be granted to the person who files the application first. 
Existing patents can become narrowed, invalid or unenforceable due to a variety of grounds, including lack of novelty, creativity and deficiencies in patent application. In mainland China, a patent must have novelty, creativity and practical applicability. Under the China Patent Law, novelty means that before a patent application is filed, no identical invention or utility model has been publicly disclosed in any publication in mainland China or overseas or has been publicly used or made known to the public by any other means, whether in or outside of mainland China, nor has any other person filed with the patent authority an application that describes an identical invention or utility model and is recorded in patent application documents or patent documents published after the filing date. Creativity means that, compared with existing technology, an invention has prominent substantial features and represents notable progress, and a utility model has substantial features and represents any progress. Practical applicability means an invention or utility model can be manufactured or used and may produce positive results. Patents in mainland China are filed with the CNIPA. Normally, the CNIPA publishes an application for an invention patent within 18 months after the filing date, which may be shortened at the request of applicant. The applicant must apply to the CNIPA for a substantive examination within three years from the date of application. 
Article 19 of the China Patent Law provides that, for an invention or utility model completed in mainland China, any applicant (not just Chinese companies and individuals), before filing a patent application outside of mainland China, must first submit it to the CNIPA for a confidential examination. Failure to comply with this requirement will result in the denial of any Chinese patent for the relevant invention. This added requirement of confidential examination by the CNIPA has raised concerns by foreign companies who conduct research and development activities in mainland China or outsource research and development activities to service providers in mainland China. The China Patent Law also sets up the framework and adds the provisions for patent linkage and patent term extension. 
Patent Term Extension and Adjustment 
The China Patent Law, which was most recently amended by the SCNPC in October 2020, and became effective in June 2021, for the first time, provides for patent term extension and adjustments for certain patents. Under the China Patent Law, patent term extensions can be obtained for regulatory delays in the review and approval of new drugs but are limited to no more than five years and the total post-marketing patent term of the new drug cannot exceed 14 years. The China Patent Law also provides for patent term adjustments where there is an unreasonable delay caused during patent examination. A patentee may apply for a patent term adjustment where the patent is granted at least four years after the 
-58-


filing date, and at least three years after substantive examination was requested. It remains to be seen how the patent term extensions and adjustments under the China Patent Law will be implemented. The Chinese government published draft amendments to the Implementing Regulations of the Patent Law in November 2020, which provides further details on what is an unreasonably delay in respect of patent term adjustments and proposes certain limitations on the types of patents eligible for patent term extensions, details of how amount of the extension would be determined and applicability to drug products covered by the relevant patent. For example, there is a risk that the patent term extension will only apply where approval in mainland China by the NMPA is the first approval anywhere in the world. 
Patent Linkage 
The China Patent Law describes the general principles of linking generic drug applications to pharmaceutical patent protection, also known as Patent Linkage. In July 2021, the NMPA and the China National Intellectual Property Administration, or CNIPA, jointly published the Measures for Implementing an Early-Stage Resolution Mechanism for Pharmaceutical Patent Disputes (Tentative), or Measures on Patent Linkage, providing an operating mechanism for Patent Linkage. Upon notification of generic applications and certifications, if the patentee or the interested person disagrees, the patentee or the interested person will need to file a claim with the court or the CNIPA within 45 days after the CDE’s publication and must submit a copy of the case acceptance notification to the CDE within 15 working days after the case acceptance date. Otherwise, the NMPA can proceed with the technical review and approval. For chemical drugs, the NMPA would initiate a nine-month approval stay period upon notification. If the patentee or the interested person cannot secure a favorable court judgment or a decision from the CNIPA within the nine-month period, the NMPA can grant marketing authorization to the generic applicant after the nine-month period expires. 
Patent Enforcement 
Unauthorized use of patents without consent from owners of patents, forgery of the patents belonging to other persons, or engagement in other patent infringement acts, will subject the infringers to infringement liability. Serious offenses such as forgery of patents may be subject to criminal penalties. 
When a dispute arises out of infringement of the patent owner’s patent right, Chinese law requires that the parties first attempt to settle the dispute through mutual consultation. However, if the dispute cannot be settled through mutual consultation, the patent owner, or an interested party who believes the patent is being infringed, may either file a civil legal suit or file an administrative complaint with the relevant patent administration authority. A Chinese court may issue a preliminary injunction upon the patent owner’s or an interested party’s request before instituting any legal proceedings or during the proceedings. Damages for infringement are calculated as the loss suffered by the patent holder arising from the infringement, or the benefit gained by the infringer from the infringement. If it is difficult to ascertain damages in this manner, damages may be determined by using a reasonable multiple of the license fee under a contractual license. Statutory damages may be awarded in the circumstances where the damages cannot be determined by the above-mentioned calculation standards. The damage calculation methods shall be applied in the aforementioned order. Generally, the patent owner has the burden of proving that the patent is being infringed. However, if the owner of an invention patent for manufacturing process of a new product alleges infringement of its patent, the alleged infringer has the burden of proof. 
Medical Patent Compulsory License 
According to the China Patent Law, for the purpose of public health, the CNIPA may grant a compulsory license for manufacturing patented drugs and exporting them to countries or regions covered under relevant international treaties to which mainland China has acceded. 
Exemptions for Unlicensed Manufacture, Use, Sale, or Import of Patented Products 
The China Patent Law provides five exceptions permitting the unauthorized manufacture, use, sale or import of patented products. None of following circumstances is deemed an infringement of the patent rights, and any person may manufacture, use, sell or import patented products without authorization granted by the patent owner as follows: 
•Any person who uses, promises to sell, sells or imports any patented product or product directly obtained in accordance with the patented methods after such product is sold by the patent owner or by its licensed entity or individual; 
•Any person who has manufactured an identical product, has used an identical method or has made necessary preparations for manufacture or use prior to the date of patent application and continues to manufacture such product or use such method only within the original scope;

•Any foreign transportation facility that temporarily passes through the territory, territorial waters or territorial airspace of mainland China and uses the relevant patents in its devices and installations for its own needs in accordance with any agreement concluded between mainland China and that country to which the foreign transportation facility belongs, or any international treaty to which both countries are party, or on the basis of the principle of reciprocity; 
•Any person who uses the relevant patents solely for the purposes of scientific research and experimentation; or 
a.Any person who manufactures, uses or imports patented drug or patented medical equipment for the purpose of providing information required for administrative approval, or manufactures, uses or imports patented drugs or patented medical equipment for the abovementioned person. 
However, if patented drugs are utilized on the ground of exemptions for unauthorized manufacture, use, sale, or import of patented drugs prescribed in China Patent Law, such patented drugs cannot be manufactured, used, sold, or imported for any commercial purposes without authorization granted by the patent owner. 
Trade Secrets 
According to the PRC Anti-Unfair Competition Law, the term “trade secrets” refers to technical and business information that is unknown to the public that has utility and may create business interests or profits for its legal owners or holders, and is maintained as a secret by its legal owners or holders. 
Under the PRC Anti-Unfair Competition Law, business persons are prohibited from infringing others’ trade secrets by: (i) obtaining the trade secrets from the legal owners or holders by any unfair methods such as theft, bribery, fraud, coercion, electronic intrusion, or any other illicit means; (ii) disclosing, using or permitting others to use the trade secrets obtained illegally under item (i) above; (iii) disclosing, using, or permitting others to use the trade secrets, in violation of any contractual agreements or any requirements of the legal owners or holders to keep such trade secrets in confidence; or (iv) instigating, inducing or assisting others to violate confidentiality obligation or to violate a rights holder’s requirements on keeping confidentiality of trade secrets, disclosing, using or permitting others to use the trade secrets of the rights holder. If a third party knows or should have known of abovementioned illegal conduct but nevertheless obtains, uses, or discloses trade secrets of others’ trade secrets, the third party may be deemed to have committed a misappropriation of the others’ trade secrets. 
The measures to protect trade secrets include oral or written non-disclosure agreements or other reasonable measures to require the employees of, or persons in business contact with, legal owners or holders to keep trade secrets confidential. Once the legal owners or holders have asked others to keep trade secrets confidential and have adopted reasonable protection measures, the requested persons bear the responsibility for keeping the trade secrets confidential. 
Trademarks and Domain Names 
Trademarks. According to the Trademark Law of the People’s Republic of China, promulgated by the SCNPC in August 1982, as amended in February 1993, October 2001, August 2013, and April 2019, and its implementation rules (collectively, the “Trademark Law”), the Trademark Office of China National Intellectual Property Administration is responsible for the registration and administration of trademarks throughout mainland China. The Trademark Law has adopted a “first-to-file” principle with respect to trademark registration. 
Domain Names. Domain names are protected under the Administrative Measures on the Internet Domain Names promulgated by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology in August 2017 and effective from November 2017. The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology is the main regulatory body responsible for the administration of Chinese internet domain names. 
PRC Anti-Monopoly Law
On June 24, 2022, the SCNPC published amendments to the PRC Anti-Monopoly Law (the “amended AML”), which came into effect on August 1, 2022. The amended AML formally implements China’s latest anti-monopoly policies by, among other things, improving regulatory rules for anti-competitive agreements, expressly addressing monopoly issues in the platform economy, and substantially increasing the penalties for violating the law. 
The improvements of the regulatory rules for anti-competitive agreements made by the amended AML mainly includes: (i) expressly stipulating that an agreement which fixes or limits resale prices, that is, a vertical anti-competitive agreement, is not prohibited if relevant business operators can prove that such agreement does not have the effect of eliminating or restricting competition; (ii) formally provides the “safe harbor” regime which stipulates that a vertical anti-competitive agreement is not prohibited, if the parties’ market share in the relevant market is lower than the market share 
-60-


percentage set by the anti-monopoly enforcement agency and other conditions established by the anti-monopoly enforcement agency are met; (iii) codifies that business operators shall not organize other business operators to reach a monopoly agreement or provide substantial assistance for other business operators to reach a monopoly agreement. 
The amended AML formally extends the anti-monopoly regulatory regime to the platform economy by outlining the general principal that business operators shall not engage in monopolistic activities, such as by taking advantage of data and algorithms, technology, capital advantage, and platform rules. The amended AML also specifically prohibits business operators from abusing market dominance, such as by using data and algorithms, technology, and platform rules. 
Penalties for violation of the AML have been substantially increased by the amended AML. For example, according to the amended AML, if a company completes a concentration of business in violation of the AML that will have or is likely to have the effect of eliminating or restricting competition, in addition to other remedial measures, a fine of up to 10% of the last year’s sales revenue may be imposed. If the concentration of business in violation of the AML completed by the company does not have the effect of eliminating or restricting competition, a fine of up to RMB 5 million may be imposed. In the case that the aforementioned violation has particularly serious circumstances, bad impact, or consequences, the fine imposed may be further increased to between two and five times the aforementioned fine amount.
Chinese Regulation of Labor Protection 
Under the Labor Law of the People’s Republic of China, which became effective in January 1995 and was amended in August 2009 and December 2018; the Employment Contract Law of the People’s Republic of China, which became effective in January 2008 and was amended in December 2012; and the Implementing Regulations of the Employment Contract Law, which became effective in September 2008, employers must establish a comprehensive management system to protect the rights of their employees, including a system governing occupational health and safety to provide employees with occupational training to prevent occupational injury and employers are required to truthfully inform prospective employees of the job description, working conditions, location, occupational hazards and status of safe production as well as remuneration and other conditions as requested by the Labor Contract Law of the People’s Republic of China. 
Pursuant to the Work Safety Law of the People’s Republic of China, which became effective in November 2002 and was amended in August 2009, August 2014, and June 2021, manufacturers must establish a comprehensive management system to ensure manufacturing safety in accordance with applicable laws, regulations, national standards and industrial standards. Manufacturers not meeting relevant legal requirements are not permitted to commence their manufacturing activities. 
Pursuant to the Good Manufacturing Practice, which became effective in March 2011, manufacturers of pharmaceutical products are required to establish production safety and labor protection measures in connection with the operation of their manufacturing equipment and manufacturing process. 
Pursuant to applicable Chinese laws, rules and regulations, including the Social Insurance Law, which became effective in July 2011 and was amended in December 2018; the Interim Regulations on the Collection and Payment of Social Security Funds, which became effective in January 1999 and was amended in March 2019; Interim Measures concerning the Maternity Insurance of Employees, which became effective in January 1995; and the Regulations on Work-Related Injury Insurance, which became effective in January 2004 and was amended in December 2010, employers are required to contribute, on behalf of their employees, to a number of social security funds, including funds for basic pension insurance, unemployment insurance, basic medical insurance, work-related injury insurance and maternity insurance. If an employer fails to make social insurance contributions timely and in full, the social insurance collecting authority will order the employer to make up outstanding contributions within the prescribed time period and impose a late payment fee at the rate of 0.05% per day from the date on which the contribution becomes due. If such employer fails to make the overdue contributions within such time limit, the relevant administrative department may impose a fine equivalent to one to three times the overdue amount. 
Regulations Relating to Foreign Exchange Registration of Offshore Investment by Chinese Residents 
In July 2014, SAFE issued the Circular on Relevant Issues Concerning Foreign Exchange Control on Domestic Residents’ Offshore Investment and Financing and Roundtrip Investment through Special Purpose Vehicles (“SAFE Circular 37”) and its implementation guidelines. Pursuant to SAFE Circular 37 and its implementation guidelines, residents of mainland China (including Chinese institutions and individuals) must register with local branches of SAFE in connection with their direct or indirect offshore investment in an overseas special purpose vehicle (“SPV”), directly established or indirectly controlled by Chinese residents for the purposes of offshore investment and financing with their legally owned assets or interests in domestic enterprises, or their legally owned offshore assets or interests. Such Chinese residents are also required to amend their registrations with SAFE when there is a change to the basic information of the SPV, such as changes of a Chinese resident individual shareholder, the name or operating period of the SPV or when there is a significant change to the SPV, such as changes of the Chinese individual resident’s increase or decrease of its capital 
-61-


contribution in the SPV, or any share transfer or exchange, merger, division of the SPV. Failure to comply with the registration procedures set forth in SAFE Circular 37 may result in restrictions being imposed on the foreign exchange activities of the relevant onshore company, including the payment of dividends and other distributions to its offshore parent or affiliate, the capital inflow from the offshore entities and settlement of foreign exchange capital, and may also subject relevant onshore company or Chinese residents to penalties under Chinese foreign exchange administration regulations. 
Regulations Relating to Employee Stock Incentive Plan 
In February 2012, SAFE promulgated the Notices on Issues Concerning the Foreign Exchange Administration for Domestic Individuals Participating in Stock Incentive Plans of Overseas Publicly Listed Companies (the “Stock Option Rules”). In accordance with the Stock Option Rules and relevant rules and regulations, Chinese citizens or non-Chinese citizens residing in mainland China for a continuous period of not less than one year, who participate in any stock incentive plan of an overseas publicly listed company, subject to a few exceptions, are required to register with SAFE through a domestic qualified agent, which could be a Chinese subsidiary of such overseas listed company, and complete certain procedures. We and our employees who are Chinese citizens or who reside in mainland China for a continuous period of not less than one year and who participate in our stock incentive plan will be subject to such regulation. In addition, the State Taxation Administration of the People’s Republic of China (the “SAT”) has issued circulars concerning employee share options or restricted shares. Under these circulars, employees working in mainland China who exercise share options, or whose restricted shares vest, will be subject to Chinese individual income tax (the “IIT”). The Chinese subsidiaries of an overseas listed company have obligations to file documents related to employee share options or restricted shares with relevant tax authorities and to withhold IIT of those employees related to their share options or restricted shares. If the employees fail to pay, or the Chinese subsidiaries fail to withhold, their IIT according to relevant laws, rules and regulations, the Chinese subsidiaries may face sanctions imposed by the tax authorities or other Chinese government authorities. 
Regulations Relating to Dividend Distribution 
Pursuant to the PRC Company Law and Foreign Investment Law, and Regulations on Implementing the Foreign Investment Law, foreign investors may freely remit into or out of mainland China, in RMB or any other foreign currency, their capital contributions, profits, capital gains, income from asset disposal, intellectual property royalties, lawfully acquired compensation, indemnity or liquidation income and so on within the territory of mainland China. 
In January 2017, the SAFE issued the Notice on Improving the Check of Authenticity and Compliance to Further Promote the Reform of Foreign Exchange Control, which stipulates several capital control measures with respect to outbound remittance of profits from domestic entities to offshore entities, including the following: (i) under the principle of genuine transaction, banks shall check board resolutions regarding profit distribution, the original version of tax filing records and audited financial statements; and (ii) domestic entities shall hold income to account for previous years’ losses before remitting the profits. Moreover, domestic entities shall provide detailed explanations of the sources of capital and the utilization arrangements and board resolutions, contracts and other proof when completing the registration procedures in connection with an outbound investment. 
Regulations Relating to Foreign Exchange 
The principal regulations governing foreign currency exchange in China are the Foreign Exchange Administration Regulations, most recently amended in August 2008. Under the Foreign Exchange Administration Regulations, payments of current account items, such as profit distributions and trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions, can be made in foreign currencies without prior approval from SAFE by complying with certain procedural requirements. However, approval from or registration with appropriate government authorities is required where RMB is to be converted into foreign currency and remitted out of mainland China to pay capital expenses such as the repayment of foreign currency-denominated loans. 
In August 2008, SAFE issued the Circular on the Relevant Operating Issues Concerning the Improvement of the Administration of the Payment and Settlement of Foreign Currency Capital of Foreign-Invested Enterprises (the “SAFE Circular 142”), regulating the conversion by a foreign-invested enterprise of foreign currency-registered capital into RMB by restricting how the converted RMB may be used. SAFE Circular 142 provides that the RMB capital converted from foreign currency registered capital of a foreign-invested enterprise may only be used for purposes within the business scope approved by the applicable government authority and may not be used for equity investments within mainland China. SAFE also strengthened its oversight of the flow and use of the RMB capital converted from foreign currency registered capital of foreign-invested enterprises. The use of such RMB capital may not be changed without SAFE’s approval, and such RMB capital may not in any case be used to repay RMB loans if the proceeds of such loans have not been used. In March 2015, SAFE issued the Circular of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange on Reforming the Management Approach regarding the Settlement of Foreign Exchange Capital of Foreign-invested Enterprises (the “SAFE Circular 19”), 
-62-


which took effective and replaced SAFE Circular 142 in June 2015. Although SAFE Circular 19 allows for the use of RMB converted from the foreign currency-denominated capital for equity investments in mainland China, the restrictions continue to apply as to foreign-invested enterprises’ use of the converted RMB for purposes beyond the business scope, for entrusted loans or for inter-company RMB loans. SAFE promulgated the Notice of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange on Reforming and Standardizing the Foreign Exchange Settlement Management Policy of Capital Account (the “SAFE Circular 16”), effective in June 2016, which reiterates some of the rules set forth in SAFE Circular 19, but changes the prohibition against using RMB capital converted from foreign currency-denominated registered capital of a foreign-invested company to issue RMB entrusted loans to a prohibition against using such capital to issue loans to unassociated enterprises. Violations of SAFE Circular 19 or SAFE Circular 16 could result in administrative penalties. 
The Circular of Further Improving and Adjusting Foreign Exchange Administration Policies on Foreign Direct Investment was promulgated by SAFE in November 2012 and amended in May 2015, which substantially amends and simplifies the current foreign exchange procedure. Pursuant to this circular, the opening of various special purpose foreign exchange accounts (e.g., pre-establishment expenses accounts, foreign exchange capital accounts and guarantee accounts), the reinvestment of lawful incomes derived by foreign investors in mainland China (e.g., profit, proceeds of equity transfer, capital reduction, liquidation and early repatriation of investment), and purchase and remittance of foreign exchange as a result of capital reduction, liquidation, early repatriation or share transfer in a foreign-invested enterprise no longer require SAFE approval, and multiple capital accounts for the same entity may be opened in different provinces, which was not possible before. In addition, SAFE promulgated the Circular on Printing and Distributing the Provisions on Foreign Exchange Administration over Domestic Direct Investment by Foreign Investors and the Supporting Documents in May 2013, which specifies that the administration by SAFE or its local branches over direct investment by foreign investors in mainland China shall be conducted by way of registration and banks shall process foreign exchange business relating to the direct investment in mainland China based on the registration information provided by SAFE and its branches. 
In February 2015, SAFE promulgated the Circular on Further Simplifying and Improving the Policies Concerning Foreign Exchange Control on Direct Investment (the “SAFE Circular 13”), which took effect in June 2015 and was amended in December 2019. SAFE Circular 13 delegates the authority to enforce the foreign exchange registration in connection with the inbound and outbound direct investment under relevant SAFE rules to certain banks and therefore further simplifies the foreign exchange registration procedures for inbound and outbound direct investment. 
Regulations on Securities Offering and Listing Outside of China 
On February 17, 2023, the CSRC, promulgated a new set of regulations that consist of the Trial Measures and five supporting guidelines, which will become effective on March 31, 2023, to regulate overseas securities offering and listing activities by domestic companies either in direct or indirect form. 
The Trial Measures and supporting guidelines apply to overseas offerings by domestic companies of equity shares, depository receipts, convertible corporate bonds, or other equity-like securities, and overseas listing of the securities for trading. Both direct and indirect overseas securities offering and listing by domestic companies would be regulated, of which the former refers to securities offering and listing in an overseas market made by a joint-stock company incorporated domestically, and the latter refers to securities offering and listing in an overseas market made in the name of an offshore entity, while based on the underlying equity, assets, earnings or other similar rights of a domestic company which operates its main business domestically. According to the Trial Measures, if an issuer meets the following conditions, the offering and listing shall be determined as an indirect overseas offering and listing by a domestic company: (i) the total assets, net assets, revenues or gross profits of the domestic company(ies) of the issuer in the most recent financial year account for more than 50% of the corresponding figure in the issuer’s audited consolidated financial statements over the same period; (ii) the majority of the senior management in charge of business operation and management of the issuer are Chinese citizens or habitually reside in mainland China, or its main places of business operation are located in China or main parts of its business activities are conducted in China. 
Under the Trial Measures and supporting guidelines, a filing-based regulatory system would be implemented covering both direct and indirect overseas offering and listing. For an indirect initial public offering and listing in an overseas market, the issuer shall designate a major domestic operating entity to submit the filing documents to the CSRC, including but not limited to the prospectus within three working days after such application of overseas offering and listing is submitted. The CSRC would, within 20 working days if filing documents are complete and in compliance with the stipulated requirements, complete the filing notice, and publish the filing information on the CSRC’s official website. While for confidential filings of overseas offering and listing application documents, the designated filing entity may apply for an extension of the publication of such filing. The issuer shall report to the CSRC within three working days after the overseas offering and listing application documents become public. In addition, subsequent securities offerings of an issuer in the same overseas market where it has previously offered and listed securities shall be filed with the CSRC within three working days after the offering is completed. 
-63-


Meanwhile, overseas offering and listing would be prohibited under certain circumstances, including but not limited to that (i) the offering and listing are expressly forbidden by the Chinese laws, regulations and relevant rules; (ii) the intended overseas securities offering and listing may endanger national security as reviewed and determined by competent authorities under the State Council in accordance with laws or (iii) there are material disputes with regard to the ownership of the equity held by the domestic company’s controlling shareholder or by other shareholders that are controlled by the controlling shareholder and/or actual controller. If a domestic company falls into the circumstances where overseas offering and listing is prohibited prior to the overseas offering and listing, the domestic company shall postpone or terminate the intended overseas offering and listing and report to the CSRC and competent authorities under the State Council in a timely manner. 
If domestic companies fail to fulfill the above-mentioned filing procedures or offer and list in an overseas market against the prohibited circumstances, they may be warned and fined up to RMB10 million. The controlling shareholders and actual controllers of such domestic companies that organize or instruct the aforementioned violations may be fined up to RMB10 million and directly liable persons-in-charge and other directly liable persons may be fined up to RMB5 million. 
Auxiliary Rules for the Regulations on Supervision and Administration of Medical Devices
In February 2021, the State Council published new Regulations on Supervision and Administration of Medical Devices (“Order 739”), which became effective in June 2021. This top-level medical device administrative regulation contains a number of important changes, the practical effects of which will be implemented in corresponding auxiliary regulations and rules. Recently, a series of regulations have been amended accordingly to support the implementation of Order 739 in terms of the production, distribution and clinical trials of medical devices.
•Measures for the Supervision and Administration of the Production of Medical Devices
On May 1, 2022, a revised version of the Measures for the Supervision and Administration of the Production of Medical Devices, or Order 53, promulgated by the SAMR, became effective. All medical device manufacturing activities within China should comply with Order 53. Order 53 clarifies the responsibilities and obligations of medical device registrants/record-filing applicants and their entrusted manufacturers where applicable. Order 53 also establishes a medical device reporting system with an aim to improve administration of medical device production. The reporting system consists of several types of reports, including annual self-inspection report, production product variety report, production conditions change report, re-production report and recall and disposal report. The medical device registrants/ record-filing applicants and/or the medical device manufacturers need to submit corresponding reports to the local relevant Medical Product Administrations in accordance with Order 53.
•Measures for the Supervision and Administration of the Distribution of Medical Devices
On May 1, 2022, a revised version of the Measures for the Supervision and Administration of the Distribution of Medical Devices, or Order 54, promulgated by SAMR, came into effect. All medical device distribution activities within China should comply with Order 54. Under Order 54, explicit regulatory requirements were introduced to distributors of medical devices. For example, Order 54 requires medical device distributors to establish a quality management system and adopt quality control measures covering the total process of distribution and submit annual self-inspection reports to local relevant medical product administrations.
•Good Practices for Medical Device Clinical Trials
On May 1, 2022, a revised version of the Good Practices for Medical Device Clinical Trials, or 2022 Medical Device GCP, jointly released by the NMPA and the National Health Commission, came into effect. All medical device clinical trials that have not passed ethics review by May 1, 2022 must be conducted in compliance with the 2022 Medical Device GCP, if they were conducted for the purpose of applying for medical device registrations. The 2022 Medical Device GCP specifies responsibilities of each party participating in a medical device clinical trial, in particular the responsibilities of the sponsor. The 2022 Medical Device GCP no longer requires clinical trials of medical devices to be conducted in two or more clinical trial institutions. This will make it easier for medical device companies to conduct medical device registration studies.
Other Chinese National- and Provincial-Level Laws and Regulations 
We are subject to changing regulations under many other laws and regulations administered by governmental authorities at the national, provincial, and municipal levels, some of which are or may become applicable to our business. For example, regulations control the confidentiality of patients’ medical information and the circumstances under which patient medical information may be released for inclusion in our databases or released by us to third parties. These laws 
-64-


and regulations governing both the disclosure and the use of confidential patient medical information may become more restrictive in the future. 
We also comply with numerous additional national and provincial laws relating to matters such as safe working conditions, manufacturing practices, environmental protection, and fire hazard control in all material aspects. We believe that we are currently in compliance with these laws and regulations in material aspects; however, we may be required to incur significant costs to comply with these laws and regulations in the future. Unanticipated changes in existing regulatory requirements or adoption of new requirements could therefore have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
SALES AND MARKETING 
Commercialization 
We believe that the scale and sophistication of our commercial operation is crucial to our business. We have invested, and will continue to invest, substantial financial and management resources to build-out our commercial infrastructure and to recruit and train sufficient additional qualified marketing, sales, and other personnel in support of the sales of our commercialized products. 
As of January 31, 2023, our commercialization team consisted of approximately 965 sales and marketing staff, covering major medical centers across Greater China. Our commercialization team has a proven track record and experience from leading oncology multinational pharmaceutical companies including AstraZeneca, Roche, Novartis, and BMS in Greater China. Our commercial team has capabilities that cover the product sales cycle, including medical affairs, market access, and distributor management. We tailor our commercialization strategies according to our individual products and their different market potential to drive product launch. For ZEJULA, we plan to increase market penetration in mainland China, accelerate sales in the growing 1L maintenance market in part through ZEJULA’s inclusion on NRDL effective in January 2022, which we anticipate will allow us to make ZEJULA available to more hospitals and patients during 2022. For Optune, we plan to increase brand perception and adoption in mainland China and provide more post-launch product support services for patients. For NUZYRA, in March 2020, we entered an exclusive promotion agreement with Huizheng (Shanghai) Pharmaceutical Technology Co., Ltd. (“Huizheng”), a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Hanhui Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (“Hanhui”), one of the leading pharmaceutical companies for antibiotics in mainland China. The agreement allows us to use Hanhui’s existing infrastructure for the potential future commercial launch of NUZYRA in mainland China. For QINLOCK, we plan to continuously enhance physicians’ education to attempt to establish QINLOCK as standard of care in 4L GIST in mainland China.
Our Distribution Channel 
We rely on independent third-party distributors in Greater China to sell our commercialized products, which is consistent with the pharmaceutical industry norm. We believe that distributors help us effectively execute our marketing strategies specifically tailored to each geographical location and the hospitals located within their distribution territories across mainland China. During 2020, after we launched ZEJULA and Optune in mainland China, we started to engage distributors. Our commercial relationship with the distributors we use is a seller and buyer relationship. Accordingly, we recognize product revenue when our products are delivered to and accepted by the distributors. During 2022 and 2021, the aggregate amount of product revenue generated from our five largest customers accounted for approximately 37.7% and 39.9%, respectively. 
We select distributors based on their business qualifications and distribution capabilities, such as distribution network coverage, quality, number of personnel, cash flow conditions, creditworthiness, logistics, compliance standard, and past performance, and their capacity for customer management. We offer rebates to our distributors, consistent with pharmaceutical industry practice. We retain no ownership control over the products sold to our distributors, and all significant risks (including inventory risks) and rewards associated with the products are generally transferred to the distributors upon delivery to and acceptance by the distributors. 
MANUFACTURING AND SUPPLY 
Our Manufacturing Facilities 
We currently operate two manufacturing facilities in Suzhou, China, which support the clinical and commercialized production of certain of our products and development candidates, including ZEJULA. 
-65-


Since 2018, we have had a large molecule facility in Suzhou that uses Cytiva FlexFactory platform technology and is capable of supporting the clinical production of our product candidates. The annual production capacity of our large molecule manufacturing capacity is up to 12 to 18 200L or 1000L clinical batches, respectively. In 2022, we added an additional 1000L drug substance (“DS”) production line at this facility from Cytiva and a self-clean/autoclave automatic drug product (“DP”) production line from Tofflon Science. The annual production capacity of this facility is up to 22 of either 200L or 1000L clinical DS batches and 40 clinical DP batches (up to 10,000 vials), respectively.
Since 2017, we have also had a cGMP-compliant small molecule facility in Suzhou with capacity to produce up to 50 million units per year for oral solid dosage form. In 2021, we added an early clinical manufacturing workshop for oral solids at this facility with additional capacity to produce approximately 30,000 units/batch. We also enabled additional R&D capability for small molecule Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls (“CMC”) that supported technology transfer, process development, and method validation. We have successfully manufactured supplies for multiple projects at this facility. For example, in December 2021, we updated our Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Permit to cover the manufacturing of internal product ZL-1218 for injection, and in November 2022, we successfully passed a ZL-1218 related European Union Qualified Person audit with only 2 minor observations.
Our two manufacturing facilities feature an oral solid dosage and a biological processing/formulation production line designed to comply with both the PRC and PIC/S drug manufacturing standards. The oral solids manufacturing facility is capable of performing the entire production process, including blending, granulation (i.e., wet granulation process, fluidized bed process, and roller compaction), tableting, coating, and packaging for oral solid drug products. We procure our manufacturing equipment from leading domestic and international suppliers. We have acquired manufacturing licenses for both oral solid dosage and biological facilities. We have passed an onsite inspection by the NMPA for ZEJULA. Additionally, we have obtained the Marketing Authorization Holder (“MAH”) manufacturing license for ZEJULA and NUZYRA. As of January 31, 2023, our manufacturing team consisted of 84 employees.
Although we expect our two manufacturing facilities to be able to satisfy the commercial as well as clinical needs and support the growth of our business in the near future, we are investing in the expansion of our large molecule manufacturing facility in anticipation of increased activities for our internally developed pipeline. In addition, we acquired land use rights in Suzhou that can be used to expand our manufacturing and research needs in the future. We believe that possessing manufacturing and commercialization capabilities presents benefits, which include maintaining better control over the quality and compliance of our operations with increasingly stringent industry regulations. 
We are or will be dependent on third party partners for the manufacture and supply of certain of our products and product candidates. For example, we source Optune from NovoCure, QINLOCK from Deciphera, TIVDAK from Seagen, adagrasib from Mirati, efgartigimod from argenx, SUL-DUR from Entasis, odronextamab from Regeneron, repotrectinib from Turning Point, margetuximab from MacroGenics, and BLU-945 from Blueprint. We also are or will be dependent on third parties for our supply chain. If any of these third parties fail to provide us with sufficient quantities of product or materials, or fail to do so at acceptable quality levels or prices, our business could be harmed. 
For more information on risks related to our manufacturing and commercialization activities as well as our reliance on third parties, including our third-party partners discussed above and CMOs and suppliers discussed below, see Part I—Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
Contract Manufacturing Organizations 
We outsource to a limited number of external CMOs the production of some drug substances and products, and we expect to continue to do so to meet the pre-clinical, clinical, and commercial requirements of our products and product candidates. For example, we have engaged CMOs to locally manufacture NUZYRA and ZL-1102 in mainland China. By outsourcing a portion of our manufacturing activities, we can increase our focus on core areas of competence such as product candidate development, commercialization, and research. We have adopted procedures to promote compliance by our CMOs with relevant regulatory requirements and internal guidelines with respect to production qualifications, facilities, and processes. When selecting our CMOs, we consider a number of factors, including their qualifications, relevant expertise, production capacity, geographic proximity, reputation, track record, product quality, reliability in meeting delivery schedules, and proposed terms for the production arrangement. The CMOs with which we contract provide services to us on a short-term and project-by-project basis. Our agreements with the CMOs typically specify requirements, including, but not limited to, product quality or service details, technical standards or methods, delivery terms, agreed price and payment, and product inspection and acceptance criteria. The CMOs procure the necessary raw materials themselves. 
Suppliers 
-66-


Our suppliers consist primarily of (i) third party licensors from which we obtained license rights in respect of our in-licensed products and drug candidates; (ii) selected CROs; and (iii) suppliers of other raw materials for our clinical trial activities. 
We obtain raw materials for our clinical trial activities from multiple suppliers who we believe have sufficient capacity to meet our demands. In addition, we believe that adequate alternative sources for such supplies exist. However, if there was an interruption to supplies, this could harm our business, perhaps materially. We typically order raw materials and services on a purchase order basis and do not enter into long-term dedicated capacity or minimum supply arrangements. While we do experience price fluctuations associated with our raw materials, we have not experienced any material disruptions in the supply of these raw materials in the past. In addition, we have suppliers across the world and do not rely exclusively on the imports from the suppliers in the United States. 
COMPETITION 
Competition in the biopharmaceutical industry is intense. There are many companies, including biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, engaged in developing products for the indications our approved products are approved to treat and the therapeutic areas we are targeting with our research and development activities. Some of our competitors may have substantially greater financial, marketing, research and development, and other resources than we do. 
We believe that competition and leadership in the industry is based on managerial and technological excellence and innovation as well as establishing patent and other proprietary positions through research and development. The achievement of a leadership position also depends largely upon our ability to maximize the approval, acceptance, and use of our product candidates and the availability of adequate financial resources to fund facilities, equipment, personnel, clinical testing, manufacturing, and marketing. Another key aspect of remaining competitive in the industry is recruiting and retaining leading scientists and technicians to conduct our research activities and advance our development programs, including with the commercial expertise to effectively market our products. 
Competition among products approved for sale may be based, among other things, on patent position, product efficacy, safety, patient convenience, delivery devices, reliability, availability, reimbursement, and price. In addition, early entry of a new pharmaceutical product into the market may have important advantages in gaining product acceptance and market share. Accordingly, the relative speed with which we can develop products, complete the testing and approval process and supply commercial quantities of products will have a significant impact on our competitive position. 
The introduction of new products or technologies, including the development of new processes or technologies by competitors or new information about existing products or technologies, results in increased competition for our marketed products and pricing pressure on our marketed products. The development of new or improved treatment options or standards of care or cures for the diseases our products treat reduces and could eliminate the use of our products or may limit the utility and application of ongoing clinical trials for our product candidates. 
We also face increased competitive pressures from the introduction of generic versions, prodrugs and biosimilars of existing products and products approved under abbreviated regulatory pathways. Such products are likely to be sold at substantially lower prices than branded products, which may significantly reduce both the price that we are able to charge for our products and the volume of products we sell. In addition, in some markets, when a generic or biosimilar version of one of our products is commercialized, it may be automatically substituted for our product and significantly reduce our revenues in a short period of time. 
We believe our long-term competitive position depends upon our success in discovering and developing innovative, cost-effective products that serve unmet medical needs, along with our ability to manufacture products efficiently and to launch and market them effectively in a highly competitive environment. 
Additional information about the competition that our marketed products face is set forth below in Part I—Item 1A. Risk Factors.
INSURANCE 
We maintain insurance policies that are required under Chinese laws and regulations as well as based on our assessment of our operational needs and industry practice. We maintain liability insurance for certain clinical trials, which covers the patient human clinical trial liabilities such as bodily injury, product liability insurance, general insurance policies covering property loss due to accidents or natural disasters, and director and officer (“D&O”) insurance. We do not maintain insurance to cover intellectual property infringement or misappropriation.

HUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCES 
We know that our employees are integral to our success, and we are committed to building and maintaining a strong and engaged workforce that is focused on delivering on our mission to become a leading global biopharmaceutical company and to positively impact human health in China and beyond. We seek to attract, retain, and motivate our employees through competitive compensation programs, professional development opportunities, and employee engagement. In evaluating our human capital management, we consider various factors, including employee performance, development, and our ability to recruit well qualified employees to support our business and operations. 
As of January 31, 2023, we had 2,036 full-time employees, of which 1,956 were located in Greater China. The number of full-time employees by function as of such date was as follows:

By Function | Number ofemployees
Research and Development | 832 
Commercial | 965 
Manufacturing | 84 
General and Administrative* | 155 
Total | 2,036 

* Includes finance, legal, human resources, information technology, and other general and administrative functions. 
Our management executive team is comprised of our CEO and her direct reports who, collectively, have management responsibility for our business. Our management team places significant focus and attention on matters concerning our human capital assets, with a focus on being an employer of choice as well as on diversity, employee capabilities and growth, and succession planning. 
The competition for top talent in our industry is intense. To help attract, motivate, and retain well qualified employees, we strive to provide competitive compensation programs and benefits, including cash compensation, stock-based compensation, and other benefits to support the financial, physical, and emotional health of our employees. For our employees in China, consistent with Chinese regulations, we participate in a housing fund and various employee social security plans that are organized by applicable local municipal and provincial governments, including housing, pension, medical, work-related injury, maternity, and unemployment benefit plans, under which we make contributions at specified percentages of the salaries of our employees. For our U.S.-based employees, in addition to our health and welfare benefits and parental leave, we provide retirement benefits in the form of certain matching contributions to tax-qualified 401(k) plans. 
We provide professional development and training opportunities to our employees to help enhance their competencies and capabilities. These opportunities include formal and comprehensive company-level and department-level training for new employees followed by on-the-job training; periodic trainings to promote awareness and compliance with our policies and procedures; and cross-functional trainings to strengthen and reinforce employee collaborations across different functions, groups, and departments that work together to support our day-to-day operations. We have a performance management and talent development process through which managers provide regular feedback and coaching to develop employees. This process also helps the Company identify our pipeline of talent as well as areas in potential need of additional resources or support. We also seek to engage our employees through our Culture Committee with the launch of our Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (“DEI”) Council and employee resource groups, such as our women’s leadership community and local DEI committees. 
We seek to bring together employees with different backgrounds and expertise to support our growth while also creating an inclusive culture. We are proud of the diversity, skills, and achievements that our employees bring to our business from various parts of the world. In addition, we are committed to being an equal opportunity employer, where everyone is treated equally and respected, regardless of their gender, nationality, marital status, age, disability, or religious belief. Our commitment to diversity is reflected in the composition of our workforce. For example, with respect to gender diversity, the majority of our full-time employees are women, and the majority of STEM-related positions are held by women. 
Our worldwide teams are united by a common mission to improve human health. We strive to maintain a good working relationship with our employees. We are committed to encouraging a culture of open communication where employees can ask questions, raise concerns, and contribute creative solutions. Our management team routinely makes themselves available to all employees, including in regular town hall events that encourage open dialogue. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and we have not experienced

any material work stoppages or labor disputes. Further, we have been able to recruit strong employees to support our business and operations.
QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE
We have our own independent quality control system and devote significant attention to quality control for the designing, manufacturing, and testing of our drug candidates. We have established a strict quality control system in accordance with NMPA regulations. We monitor our operations in real time throughout the entire production process, from inspection of raw and auxiliary materials to manufacture and delivery of finished products to clinical testing at hospitals. Our quality assurance team is also responsible for our compliance with applicable regulations, standards, and internal policies. Our senior management team is actively involved in setting quality policies and managing the internal and external quality performance of the Company. 
RISK MANAGEMENT 
We are committed to acting ethically, which includes identifying and responsibly managing risk. As a result, we have adopted a consolidated risk management methodology and program, which includes a three lines of defense risk management framework to identify, assess, evaluate, and monitor key risks associated with our strategic objectives on an on-going basis, and a risk governance structure that includes oversight by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. The risk governance structure also includes a Risk Coordination Council that is comprised of leaders of governance and quality functions along with operational line leaders and serves as a forum to discuss and monitor risks across the organization. We conduct an annual enterprise risk assessment to identify our top tier risks and, based on that assessment, will complete enterprise risk management plans to manage those risks. Management discusses with the Audit Committee the results of its annual enterprise risk assessments as well as its enterprise risk management policies and guidelines. 
The following provides additional information on our three lines of defense and risk governance structure: 
•First Line of Defense: Our business functions are primarily responsible for implementing our risk management program in their areas. This includes identifying, measuring, monitoring, controlling, and reporting risk in adherence to our risk policies, controls, and guidelines established by management and the Board of Directors or Audit Committee.
•Second Line of Defense: Our Legal and Ethics and Compliance functions oversee implementation of our enterprise risk management program. For example, our Chief Legal Officer, supported by our Chief Compliance Officer, is responsible for: developing and updating our enterprise risk management program and targets; reviewing and approving major risk management issues; promulgating and supervising implementation of risk management measures; providing guidance and support on our risk management approach to the relevant departments in the Company; and reporting to management, the Board of Directors, and the Audit Committee, as deemed appropriate. 
•Third Line of Defense: Our Internal Audit Division is responsible for evaluating the design, adequacy, operational effectiveness, and efficiency of our governance, risk management, and control processes.
•Risk Coordination Council: The Risk Coordination Council, which is co-chaired by the Chief Compliance Officer and another rotating member and is comprised of governance function leaders as well as business operations leaders, provides a forum to discuss and identify, monitor, and manage risks across the organization. Potential risks identified through this forum are escalated and managed both at the functional line level and through the Chief Compliance Officer directly to executive leadership and/or the Audit Committee, as deemed appropriate.
•Audit Committee: The Audit Committee is responsible for assisting the Board of Directors in its oversight of the Company’s risk management and internal controls; the integrity of our financial statements; compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements; the qualifications, independence, and performance of our auditors; and our internal audit and compliance functions.
•Board of Directors: The Board of Directors is responsible for establishing our enterprise risk management and internal control system and reviewing its effectiveness. For more information on the Board of Director’s oversight of risk management, including through its committees, see Corporate Governance – Board Leadership Structure and Role in Risk Oversight.
Investment Risk Management 
-69-


To help meet our liquidity needs without significantly increasing our risk, we have an investment policy, which was approved by the Audit Committee and provides guidelines and specific instructions for the investment of our funds. Our investment strategy aims to minimize risks by reasonably and conservatively matching the maturities of the portfolio to anticipated operating cash needs. We make our investment decisions on a case-by-case basis after considering a number of factors, including, but not limited to, our cash flow levels, operational needs, and capital expenditures; the macro-economic environment; general market conditions; and the expected profit or potential loss of the investment. In accordance with our investment policy, we may engage in short-term investments with surplus cash on hand. Our investment portfolio primarily consists of time deposits. We are prohibited from investing in high-risk products, and proposed investments must not interfere with our business operations or capital expenditures.
