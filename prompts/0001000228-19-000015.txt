ITEM 1.  Business
Spin-Off of Henry Schein Animal Health Business
 
On February 7, 2019 (the “Distribution Date”), we completed the previously announced separation (the “Separation”) and subsequent merger of our animal health business (the “Henry Schein Animal Health Business”) with Direct Vet Marketing, Inc. (d/b/a Vets First Choice, “Vets First Choice”) (the “Merger”).  This was accomplished by a series of transactions among us, Vets First Choice, Covetrus, Inc. (f/k/a HS Spinco, Inc. “Covetrus”), a wholly owned subsidiary of ours prior to the Distribution Date, and HS Merger Sub, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Covetrus (“Merger Sub”).  In connection with the Separation, we contributed, assigned and transferred to Covetrus certain applicable assets, liabilities and capital stock or other ownership interests relating to the Henry Schein Animal Health Business.  On the Distribution Date, we received a tax-free distribution of $1,120.0 million from Covetrus pursuant to certain debt financing incurred by Covetrus.  On the Distribution Date and prior to the Distribution, Covetrus issued shares of Covetrus common stock to certain institutional accredited investors (the “Share Sale Investors”) for $361.1 million (the “Share Sale”).  The proceeds of the Share Sale were paid to Covetrus and distributed to us.  Subsequent to the Share Sale, we distributed, on a pro rata basis, all of the shares of the common stock of Covetrus held by us to our stockholders of record as of the close of business on January 17, 2019 (the “Animal Health Spin-off”).  After the Share Sale and Animal Health Spin-off, Merger Sub consummated the Merger whereby it merged with and into Vets First Choice, with Vets First Choice surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Covetrus.  Immediately following the consummation of the Merger, on a fully diluted basis, (i) approximately 63% of the shares of Covetrus common stock were (a) owned by our stockholders and the Share Sale Investors, and (b) in respect of certain equity awards held by certain employees of the Henry Schein Animal Health Business, and (ii) approximately 37% of the shares of Covetrus common stock were (a) owned by stockholders of Vets First Choice immediately prior to the Merger, and (b) in respect of certain equity awards held by certain employees of Vets First Choice.  After the Separation and the Merger, we no longer beneficially owned any shares of Covetrus common stock and, following the Distribution Date, will not consolidate the financial results of Covetrus for the purpose of our financial reporting.  Following the Separation and the Merger, Covetrus was an independent, publicly traded company on the Nasdaq Global Select Market, under the symbol CVET.
 
All financial information within this Form 10-K includes the Henry Schein Animal Health Business as the Separation occurred in 2019.  Effective first quarter 2019, we will report the historical earnings of the Henry Schein Animal Health Business as a discontinued operation.  The Company estimates that on a continuing operations basis, its 2018 revenues were $9.4 billion and its 2018 net income was $430.7 million.
 
General
 
The description of our business throughout this Form 10-K excludes our global animal health business as the filing date of this Form 10-K is subsequent to the effective date of the Separation.
 
We believe we are the world’s largest provider of health care products and services primarily to office-based dental and medical practitioners.  We serve more than 1 million customers worldwide including dental practitioners and laboratories and physician practices, as well as government, institutional health care clinics and other alternate care clinics.  We believe that we have a strong brand identity due to our more than 86 years of experience distributing health care products.
 
We are headquartered in Melville, New York, employ more than 18,000 people (of which more than 8,800 are based outside the United States) and have operations or affiliates in 31 countries, including the United States, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Hong Kong SAR, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Malaysia, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Poland, Portugal, Singapore, Slovakia, South Africa, Spain, Switzerland, Thailand, United Arab Emirates and the United Kingdom.
 
We offer a comprehensive selection of products and services and value-added solutions for operating efficient practices and delivering high quality care.  We operate through a centralized and automated distribution network 
  3

  

with a selection of more than 120,000 branded products and Henry Schein private brand products in stock, as well as more than 180,000 additional products available as special order items.  We also offer our customers exclusive, innovative technology solutions, including practice management software and e-commerce solutions, as well as a broad range of financial services.
 
We have established over 3.5 million square feet of space in 30 strategically located distribution centers around the world to enable us to better serve our customers and increase our operating efficiency.  This infrastructure, together with broad product and service offerings at competitive prices, and a strong commitment to customer service, enables us to be a single source of supply for our customers’ needs.  Our infrastructure also allows us to provide convenient ordering and rapid, accurate and complete order fulfillment.
 
We conduct our business through two reportable segments: (i) health care distribution and (ii) technology and value-added services.  These segments offer different products and services to the same customer base.  
 
The health care distribution reportable segment aggregates our global dental, medical and, prior to the completion of the Animal Health Spin-off, animal health operating segments.  This segment distributes consumable products, small equipment, laboratory products, large equipment, equipment repair services, branded and generic pharmaceuticals, vaccines, surgical products, diagnostic tests, infection-control products and vitamins.  Our global dental group serves office-based dental practitioners, dental laboratories, schools and other institutions.  Our global medical group serves office-based medical practitioners, ambulatory surgery centers, other alternate-care settings and other institutions.  
 
Our technology and value-added services group provides software, technology and other value-added services to health care practitioners.  Our technology group offerings include practice management software systems for dental, medical and, prior to the completion of the Animal Health Spin-off, animal health practitioners.  Our value-added practice solutions include financial services on a non-recourse basis, e-services, practice technology, network and hardware services, as well as continuing education services for practitioners.
 

Industry
 
The health care products distribution industry, as it relates to office-based health care practitioners, is fragmented and diverse.  The industry ranges from sole practitioners working out of relatively small offices to group practices or service organizations ranging in size from a few practitioners to a large number of practitioners who have combined or otherwise associated their practices.
 
Due in part to the inability of office-based health care practitioners to store and manage large quantities of supplies in their offices, the distribution of health care supplies and small equipment to office-based health care practitioners has been characterized by frequent, small quantity orders, and a need for rapid, reliable and substantially complete order fulfillment.  The purchasing decisions within an office-based health care practice are typically made by the practitioner or an administrative assistant.  Supplies and small equipment are generally purchased from more than one distributor, with one generally serving as the primary supplier.
 
The health care products distribution industry continues to experience growth due to the aging population, increased health care awareness, the proliferation of medical technology and testing, new pharmacology treatments and expanded third-party insurance coverage, partially offset by the effects of unemployment on insurance coverage.  In addition, the physician market continues to benefit from the shift of procedures and diagnostic testing from acute care settings to alternate-care sites, particularly physicians’ offices.
 
We believe that consolidation within the industry will continue to result in a number of distributors, particularly those with limited financial, operating and marketing resources, seeking to combine with larger companies that can provide growth opportunities.  This consolidation also may continue to result in distributors seeking to acquire companies that can enhance their current product and service offerings or provide opportunities to serve a broader customer base.

In recent years, the health care industry has increasingly focused on cost containment.  This trend has benefited distributors capable of providing a broad array of products and services at low prices.  It also has accelerated the growth of HMOs, group practices, other managed care accounts and collective buying groups, which, in addition to their emphasis on obtaining products at competitive prices, tend to favor distributors capable of providing specialized management information support.  We believe that the trend towards cost containment has the potential to favorably affect demand for technology solutions, including software, which can enhance the efficiency and facilitation of practice management.
 
Competition 
 
The distribution and manufacture of health care supplies and equipment is highly competitive.  Many of the health care distribution products we sell are available to our customers from a number of suppliers.  In addition, our competitors could obtain exclusive rights from manufacturers to market particular products.  Manufacturers also could seek to sell directly to end-users, and thereby eliminate or reduce our role and that of other distributors.  
 
In North America, we compete with other distributors, as well as several manufacturers, of dental and medical products, primarily on the basis of price, breadth of product line, customer service and value-added products and services.  In the dental market, our primary competitors are the Patterson Dental division of Patterson Companies, Inc. and Benco Dental Supply Company.  In addition, we compete against a number of other distributors that operate on a national, regional and local level.  Our primary competitors in the medical market are McKesson Corporation and Medline Industries, Inc., which are national distributors.  We also compete against a number of regional and local medical distributors, as well as a number of manufacturers that sell directly to physicians.  With regard to our dental practice management software, we compete against numerous companies, including Carestream Health, Inc. and the Patterson Dental division of Patterson Companies, Inc.  The medical practice management and electronic medical records market is very fragmented and we compete with numerous companies such as the NextGen division of Quality Systems, Inc., eClinicalWorks and Allscripts Healthcare Solutions, Inc. 
 
We also face significant competition internationally, where we compete on the basis of price and customer service against several large competitors, including the GACD Group, Pluradent AG & Co., Lifco AB, Planmeca Oy, Billericay Dental Supply Co. Ltd., as well as a large number of dental and medical product distributors and manufacturers in Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Hong Kong SAR, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Malaysia, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Poland, Portugal, Singapore, Slovakia, South Africa, Spain, Switzerland, Thailand, United Arab Emirates and the United Kingdom.
 
Significant price reductions by our competitors could result in a similar reduction in our prices.  Any of these competitive pressures may materially adversely affect our operating results.

Integrated management information systems. Our information systems generally allow for centralized management of key functions, including accounts receivable, inventory, accounts payable, payroll, purchasing, sales and order fulfillment. These systems allow us to manage our growth, deliver superior customer service, properly target customers, manage financial performance and monitor daily operational statistics. 


Cost-effective purchasing. We believe that cost-effective purchasing is a key element to maintaining and enhancing our position as a competitive-pricing provider of health care products. We continuously evaluate our purchase requirements and suppliers’ offerings and prices in order to obtain products at the lowest possible cost. In 2018, our top 10 health care distribution suppliers and our single largest supplier accounted for approximately 32% and 6%, respectively, of our aggregate purchases. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Efficient distribution. We distribute our products from our strategically located distribution centers. We strive to maintain optimal inventory levels in order to satisfy customer demand for prompt delivery and complete order fulfillment. These inventory levels are managed on a daily basis with the aid of our management information systems. Once an order is entered, it is electronically transmitted to the distribution center nearest the customer’s location and a packing slip for the entire order is printed for order fulfillment.

Business Strategy
 
Our objective is to continue to expand as a global value-added provider of health care products and services to office-based dental and medical practitioners.  To accomplish this, we will apply our competitive strengths in executing the following strategies:
  7

  

 
• | Increase penetration of our existing customer base. We have over 1 million customers worldwide and we intend to increase sales to our existing customer base and enhance our position as their primary supplier. 


• | Increase the number of customers we serve. This strategy includes increasing the number and productivity of field sales consultants, as well as using our customer database to focus our marketing efforts in all of our operating segments. In the dental business, we provide products and services to traditional dental practices as well as new emerging segments, such as dental service organizations and community health centers. Leveraging our unique assets and capabilities, we offer solutions to address these new markets. In the medical business, we have expanded to serve customers located in settings outside of the traditional office, such as urgent care clinics, retail and occupational health settings. As settings of health care shift, we remain committed to serving these practitioners and providing them with the products and services they need. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Leverage our value-added products and services. We continue to increase cross-selling efforts for key product lines utilizing a consultative selling process. In the dental business, we have significant cross-selling opportunities between our dental practice management software users and our dental distribution customers. In the medical business, we have opportunities to expand our vaccine, injectables and other pharmaceuticals sales to health care practitioners, as well as cross-selling core products and electronic health record and practice management software. Our strategy extends to providing health systems, integrated delivery networks and other large group and multi-site health care organizations, that include physician clinics, these same value added products and services. As physicians and health systems closely align, we have increased access to opportunities for cross-marketing and selling our product and service portfolios. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Pursue strategic acquisitions and joint ventures. Our acquisition strategy includes acquiring businesses and entering into joint ventures complementary to ours that will provide, among other things, additional sales to be channeled through our existing distribution infrastructure, access to additional product lines and field sales consultants and an opportunity to further expand into new geographic markets. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Markets Served  
 
Demographic trends indicate that our markets are growing, as an aging U.S. population is increasingly using health care services.  Between 2018 and 2028, the 45 and older population is expected to grow by approximately 12%.  Between 2018 and 2038, this age group is expected to grow by approximately 24%.  This compares with expected total U.S. population growth rates of approximately 8% between 2018 and 2028 and approximately 14% between 2018 and 2038.  
 
In the dental industry, there is predicted to be a rise in oral health care expenditures as the 45 and older segment of the population increases.  There is increasing demand for new technologies that allow dentists to increase productivity, and this is being driven in the U.S. by lower insurance reimbursement rates.  At the same time, there is an expected increase in dental insurance coverage.
 
We support our dental professionals through the many SKUs that we offer, as well as through important value-added services, including practice management software, electronic claims processing, financial services and continuing education, all designed to help maximize a practitioner’s efficiency.  
 
In the medical market, there continues to be a migration of procedures from acute-care settings to physicians’ offices, a trend that we believe provides additional opportunities for us.  There also is the continuing use of vaccines, injectables and other pharmaceuticals in alternate-care settings.  We believe we have established a leading position as a vaccine supplier to the office-based physician practitioner.
 
Additionally, we are expanding our dental full-service model and our medical offerings in countries where opportunities exist. Through our “Schein Direct” program, we also have the capability to provide door-to-door air package delivery to practitioners in over 190 countries around the world.

Seasonality and Other Factors Affecting Our Business and Quarterly Results
 
We experience fluctuations in quarterly earnings.  As a result, we may fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts and investors, which could cause our stock price to decline.
 
Our business is subject to seasonal and other quarterly fluctuations.  Revenues and profitability generally have been higher in the third and fourth quarters due to the timing of sales of seasonal products (including influenza vaccine, equipment and software products), purchasing patterns of office-based health care practitioners and year-end promotions.  Revenues and profitability generally have been lower in the first quarter, primarily due to increased sales in the prior two quarters.  We expect our historical seasonality of sales to continue in the foreseeable future.  Quarterly results may also be materially adversely affected by a variety of other factors, including: 
 
 
• | timing and amount of sales and marketing expenditures;
--+-------------------------------------------------------


• | timing of pricing changes offered by our suppliers;
--+----------------------------------------------------


• | timing of the introduction of new products and services by our suppliers;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | timing of the release of upgrades and enhancements to our technology-related products and services;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | changes in or availability of supplier contracts or rebate programs;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


• | supplier rebates based upon attaining certain growth goals;
--+------------------------------------------------------------


• | changes in the way suppliers introduce or deliver products to market;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


• | costs of developing new applications and services;
--+---------------------------------------------------


• | our ability to correctly identify customer needs and preferences and predict future needs and preferences;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | uncertainties regarding potential significant breaches of data security or disruptions of our information technology systems;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | unexpected regulatory actions, or government regulation generally;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


• | exclusivity requirements with certain suppliers may prohibit us from distributing competitive products manufactured by other suppliers;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | loss of sales representatives;
--+-------------------------------


• | costs related to acquisitions and/or integrations of technologies or businesses;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | costs associated with our self-insured medical and dental insurance programs;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | general market and economic conditions, as well as those specific to the health care industry and related industries;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | our success in establishing or maintaining business relationships;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


• | unexpected difficulties in developing and manufacturing products;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


• | product demand and availability or recalls by manufacturers;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


• | exposure to product liability and other claims in the event that the use of the products we sell results in injury;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | increases in shipping costs or service issues with our third-party shippers;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------



 9

  
 
• | fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies;


• | restructuring costs;
--+---------------------


• | the adoption or repeal of legislation;
--+---------------------------------------


• | changes in accounting principles; and 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------
• | litigation or regulatory judgments, expenses or settlements.



Any change in one or more of these or other factors could cause our annual or quarterly financial results to fluctuate.  If our financial results do not meet market expectations, our stock price may decline.
 
Governmental Regulations
 
Operating, Security and Licensure Standards
 
Certain of our businesses involve the distribution of pharmaceuticals and medical devices, and in this regard we are subject to various local, state, federal and foreign governmental laws and regulations applicable to the distribution of pharmaceuticals and medical devices.  Among the United States federal laws applicable to us are the Controlled Substances Act, the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as amended (“FDC Act”), and Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act.  We are also subject to comparable foreign regulations.
 
The FDC Act and similar foreign laws generally regulate the introduction, manufacture, advertising, labeling, packaging, storage, handling, reporting, marketing and distribution of, and record keeping for, pharmaceuticals and medical devices shipped in interstate commerce, and states may similarly regulate such activities within the state.  Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act, which provides authority to prevent the spread of communicable diseases, serves as the legal basis for the United States Food and Drug Administration’s (“FDA”) regulation of human cells, tissues and cellular and tissue-based products, also known as “HCT/P products.”
 
The Federal Drug Quality and Security Act of 2013 brought about significant changes with respect to pharmaceutical supply chain requirements and pre-empts state law.  Title II of this measure, known as the Drug Supply Chain Security Act (“DSCSA”), is being phased in over ten years, and is intended to build a national electronic, interoperable system to identify and trace certain prescription drugs as they are distributed in the United States.  The law’s track and trace requirements applicable to manufacturers, wholesalers, repackagers and dispensers (e.g., pharmacies) of prescription drugs took effect in January 2015, and continues to be implemented.  The DSCSA product tracing requirements replace the former FDA drug pedigree requirements and pre-empt state requirements that are inconsistent with, more stringent than, or in addition to, the DSCSA requirements.
 
The DSCSA also establishes certain requirements for the licensing and operation of prescription drug wholesalers and third party logistics providers (“3PLs”), and includes the creation of national wholesaler and 3PL licenses in cases where states do not license such entities.  The DSCSA requires that wholesalers and 3PLs distribute drugs in accordance with certain standards regarding the recordkeeping, storage and handling of prescription drugs.  The DSCSA requires wholesalers and 3PLs to submit annual reports to the FDA, which include information regarding each state where the wholesaler or 3PL is licensed, the name and address of each facility and contact information.  According to FDA guidance, states are pre-empted from imposing any licensing requirements that are inconsistent with, less stringent than, directly related to, or covered by the standards established by federal law in this area.  Current state licensing requirements will likely remain in effect until the FDA issues new regulations as directed by the DSCSA.  
 
We believe that we are substantially compliant with applicable DSCSA requirements.
 
The Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 and the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act of 2012 amended the FDC Act to require the FDA to promulgate regulations to implement a unique device identification (“UDI”) system.  The FDA is phasing in the implementation of the UDI regulations over seven years, generally beginning with the highest-risk devices (i.e., Class III medical devices) and ending with the lowest-risk devices.  Most compliance dates were reached as of September 24, 2018, with a final set of 
  10

  

requirements for low risk devices being reached on September 24, 2022, which will complete the phase in.  The UDI regulations require “labelers” to include unique device identifiers (“UDIs”), with a content and format prescribed by the FDA and issued under a system operated by an FDA-accredited issuing agency, on the labels and packages of medical devices, and to directly mark certain devices with UDIs.  The UDI regulations also require labelers to submit certain information concerning UDI-labeled devices to the FDA, much of which information is publicly available on an FDA database, the Global Unique Device Identification Database.  The UDI regulations provide for certain exceptions, alternatives and time extensions.  For example, the UDI regulations include a general exception for Class I devices exempt from the Quality System Regulation (other than record-keeping requirements and complaint files).  Regulated labelers include entities such as device manufacturers, repackagers, reprocessors and relabelers that cause a device’s label to be applied or modified, with the intent that the device will be commercially distributed without any subsequent replacement or modification of the label, and include certain of our businesses.
 
We believe that we are substantially compliant with applicable UDI requirements.
 
Under the Controlled Substances Act, as a distributor of controlled substances, we are required to obtain and renew annually registrations for our facilities from the United States Drug Enforcement Administration (“DEA”) permitting us to handle controlled substances.  We are also subject to other statutory and regulatory requirements relating to the storage, sale, marketing, handling, reporting, record-keeping and distribution of such drugs, in accordance with the Controlled Substances Act and its implementing regulations, and these requirements have been subject to heightened enforcement activity in recent times.  We are subject to inspection by the DEA.
 
Certain of our businesses are also required to register for permits and/or licenses with, and comply with operating and security standards of, the DEA, the FDA, the United States Department of Health and Human Services, and various state boards of pharmacy, state health departments and/or comparable state agencies as well as comparable foreign agencies, and certain accrediting bodies depending on the type of operations and location of product distribution, manufacturing or sale.  These businesses include those that distribute, manufacture and/or repackage prescription pharmaceuticals and/or medical devices and/or HCT/P products, or own pharmacy operations, or install, maintain or repair equipment.  In addition, Section 301 of the National Organ Transplant Act, and a number of comparable state laws, impose civil and/or criminal penalties for the transfer of certain human tissue (for example, human bone products) for valuable consideration, while generally permitting payments for the reasonable costs incurred in procuring, processing, storing and distributing that tissue.  We are also subject to foreign government regulation of such products.  The DEA, the FDA and state regulatory authorities have broad inspection and enforcement powers, including the ability to suspend or limit the distribution of products by our distribution centers, seize or order the recall of products and impose significant criminal, civil and administrative sanctions for violations of these laws and regulations.  Foreign regulations subject us to similar foreign enforcement powers.  Furthermore, compliance with legal requirements has required and may in the future require us to institute voluntary recalls of products we sell, which could result in financial losses and potential reputational harm.  Our customers are also subject to significant federal, state, local and foreign governmental regulation.
 
Certain of our businesses are subject to various additional federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations, including with respect to the sale, transportation, storage, handling and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances, and safe working conditions.
 
Certain of our businesses also maintain contracts with governmental agencies and are subject to certain regulatory requirements specific to government contractors.
 
Antitrust
 
The U.S. federal government, most U.S. states and many foreign countries have antitrust laws that prohibit certain types of conduct deemed to be anti-competitive.  Violations of antitrust laws can result in various sanctions, including criminal and civil penalties.  Private plaintiffs also could bring civil lawsuits against us in the United States for alleged antitrust law violations, including claims for treble damages.

Health Care Fraud
 
Certain of our businesses are subject to federal and state (and similar foreign) health care fraud and abuse, referral and reimbursement laws and regulations with respect to their operations.  Some of these laws, referred to as “false claims laws,” prohibit the submission or causing the submission of false or fraudulent claims for reimbursement to federal, state and other health care payers and programs.  Other laws, referred to as “anti-kickback laws,” prohibit soliciting, offering, receiving or paying remuneration in order to induce the referral of a patient or ordering, purchasing, leasing or arranging for, or recommending ordering, purchasing or leasing of, items or services that are paid for by federal, state and other health care payers and programs.
 
The fraud and abuse laws and regulations have been subject to varying interpretations, as well as heightened enforcement activity over the past few years, and significant enforcement activity has been the result of “relators” who serve as whistleblowers by filing complaints in the name of the United States (and if applicable, particular states) under federal and state false claims laws, and who may receive up to 30% of total government recoveries.  Penalties under fraud and abuse laws may be severe.  For example, under the federal False Claims Act, violations may result in treble damages, plus civil penalties of up to $22,363 per claim, as well as exclusion from federal health care programs and criminal penalties. Most states have adopted similar state false claims laws, and these state laws have their own penalties which may be in addition to federal False Claims Act penalties.  With respect to “anti-kickback laws,” violations of, for example, the federal Anti-Kickback Law may result in civil penalties of up to $100,000 for each violation, plus up to three times the total amount of remuneration offered, paid, solicited or received, as well as exclusion from federal health care programs and criminal penalties.  Notably, effective October 24, 2018, a new federal anti-kickback law (the “Eliminating Kickbacks in Recovery Act of 2018”) enacted in connection with broader addiction services legislation, may impose criminal penalties for kickbacks involving clinical laboratory services, regardless of whether the services at issue involved addiction services, and regardless of whether the services were reimbursed by a federal health care program or by a commercial health insurer.  Furthermore, the United States Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act as amended by the Health Care Education Reconciliation Act, each enacted in March 2016 (the “Health Care Reform Law”) significantly strengthened the federal False Claims Act and the federal Anti-Kickback Law provisions, clarifying that a federal Anti-Kickback Law violation can be a basis for federal False Claims Act liability.
 
With respect to measures of this type, the United States government (among others) has expressed concerns about financial relationships between suppliers on the one hand and physicians and dentists on the other.  As a result, we regularly review and revise our marketing practices as necessary to facilitate compliance.
 
We also are subject to certain United States and foreign laws and regulations concerning the conduct of our foreign operations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, German anti-corruption laws and other anti-bribery laws and laws pertaining to the accuracy of our internal books and records, which have been the focus of increasing enforcement activity globally in recent years.
 
Failure to comply with fraud and abuse laws and regulations could result in significant civil and criminal penalties and costs, including the loss of licenses and the ability to participate in federal and state health care programs, and could have a material adverse effect on our business.  Also, these measures may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations or incur substantial defense and settlement expenses.  Even unsuccessful challenges by regulatory authorities or private relators could result in reputational harm and the incurring of substantial costs.  In addition, many of these laws are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts, and have been subject to frequent modification and varied interpretation by prosecutorial and regulatory authorities, increasing the risk of noncompliance.
 
While we believe that we are substantially compliant with applicable fraud and abuse laws and regulations, and have adequate compliance programs and controls in place to ensure substantial compliance, we cannot predict whether changes in applicable law, or interpretation of laws, or changes in our services or marketing practices in response to changes in applicable law or interpretation of laws, could have a material adverse effect on our business.

Health Care Reform
 
The Health Care Reform Law increased federal oversight of private health insurance plans and included a number of provisions designed to reduce Medicare expenditures and the cost of health care generally, to reduce fraud and abuse, and to provide access to increased health coverage.
 
The Health Care Reform Law requirements include a 2.3% excise tax on domestic sales of many medical devices by manufacturers and importers that began in 2013 and a fee on branded prescription drugs and biologics that was implemented in 2011, both of which may affect sales.  However, with respect to the medical device excise tax, a two year moratorium was imposed under the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016, suspending the imposition of the tax on device sales during the period beginning January 1, 2016 and ending on December 31, 2017, and on January 22, 2018 an additional two-year moratorium was imposed under Public Law No. 115-120, suspending the imposition of the tax on device sales during the period beginning January 1, 2018 and ending on December 31, 2019.  The Health Care Reform Law has also materially expanded the number of individuals in the United States with health insurance.  The Health Care Reform Law has faced ongoing legal challenges, including litigation seeking to invalidate some of or all of the law or the manner in which it has been implemented. 
 
In addition, the President is seeking to repeal and replace the Health Care Reform Law.  Repeal and replace legislation has been passed in the House of Representatives, but did not obtain the necessary votes in the Senate.  Subsequently, the President has affirmed his intention to repeal and replace the Health Care Reform Law and has taken a number of administrative actions to materially weaken it, including, without limitation, by permitting the use of less robust plans with lower coverage and eliminating “premium support” for insurers providing policies under the Health Care Reform Law.  On December 22, 2017, the President signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Act”), which contains a broad range of tax reform provisions that impact the individual and corporate tax rates, international tax provisions, income tax add-back provisions and deductions and which also repealed the individual mandate of the Health Care Reform Law.  Further, in December 2018, a Texas federal court struck down the entire Health Care Reform Law, a ruling which is being appealed, and, if upheld could have a significant impact on the U.S. healthcare industry.  The uncertain status of the Health Care Reform Law affects our ability to plan.
 
A Health Care Reform Law provision, generally referred to as the Physician Payment Sunshine Act or Open Payments Program,  imposes  annual reporting and disclosure requirements for drug and device manufacturers with regard to payments or other transfers of value made to certain covered recipients (including physicians, dentists and teaching hospitals), and for such manufacturers and for group purchasing organizations, with regard to certain ownership interests held by physicians in the reporting entity.  The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) publishes information from these reports on a publicly available website, including amounts transferred and physician, dentist and teaching hospital identities.  Effective January 1, 2022, transfers of value to physician assistants, nurse practitioners or clinical nurse specialists, certified registered nurse anesthetists, and certified nurse-midwives must be reported.
 
Under the Physician Payment Sunshine Act we are required to collect and report detailed information regarding certain financial relationships we have with covered recipients such as with physicians, dentists and teaching hospitals.  We believe that we are substantially compliant with applicable Physician Payment Sunshine Act requirements.  The Physician Payment Sunshine Act pre-empts similar state reporting laws, although we or our subsidiaries may also be required to report under certain state transparency laws that address circumstances not covered by the Physician Payment Sunshine Act, and some of these state laws, as well as the federal law, can be ambiguous.  We are also subject to foreign regulations requiring transparency of certain interactions between suppliers and their customers.  While we believe we have substantially compliant programs and controls in place to comply with these requirements, our compliance with these rules imposes additional costs on us.
 
Another notable Medicare health care reform initiative, the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (“MACRA”), enacted on April 16, 2015, established a new payment framework, called the Quality Payment Program, which modifies certain Medicare payments to “eligible clinicians,” including physicians, dentists and other practitioners.  Under MACRA, certain eligible clinicians are required to participate in Medicare through the Merit-Based Incentive Payment System (“MIPS”) or Advanced Alternative Payment Models (“APMs”).  MIPS generally consolidated three current programs; the physician quality reporting system, the value-based payment 
  13

  

modifier and the Medicare electronic health record (“EHR”) programs into a single program in which Medicare reimbursement to eligible clinicians includes both positive and negative payment adjustments that take into account quality, promoting interoperability, resource use, clinical practice improvement and improving patient access to health information.  Advanced APMs generally involve higher levels of financial and technology risk.    The first MIPS performance year was 2017, and the data collected in the first performance year determines payment adjustments beginning January 1, 2019.  MACRA represents a fundamental change in physician reimbursement that is expected to provide substantial financial incentives for physicians to participate in risk contracts, and to increase physician information technology and reporting obligations.  The implications of the implementation of MACRA are uncertain and will depend on future regulatory activity and physician activity in the marketplace.  MACRA may encourage physicians to move from smaller practices to larger physician groups or hospital employment, leading to a consolidation of a portion of our customer base.  Although we believe that we are positioned to capitalize on this consolidation trend, there can be no assurances that we will be able to successfully accomplish this.
 
As a result of political, economic and regulatory influences, the health care distribution industry in the United States is under intense scrutiny and subject to fundamental changes.  We cannot predict what further reform proposals, if any, will be adopted, when they may be adopted, or what impact they may have on us.
 
Regulated Software; Electronic Health Records
 
The FDA has become increasingly active in addressing the regulation of computer software intended for use in health care settings.  The 21st Century Cures Act (“Cures Act”), signed into law on December 13, 2016, amended the device definition to exclude certain software, including clinical decision support software that meet certain criteria.  In December 2017, the FDA issued draft guidance documents describing its proposed interpretation of the statutory language regarding which types of clinical decision support tools and other software are exempt from regulation as medical devices.  Certain of our businesses involve the development and sale of software and related products to support physician and dental practice management, and it is possible that the FDA or foreign government authorities could determine that one or more of our products is a medical device, which could subject us or one or more of our businesses to substantial additional requirements with respect to these products.
 
In addition, our businesses that involve physician and dental practice management products include electronic information technology systems that store and process personal health, clinical, financial and other sensitive information of individuals.  These information technology systems may be vulnerable to breakdown, wrongful intrusions, data breaches and malicious attack, which could require us to expend significant resources to eliminate these problems and address related security concerns and could involve claims against us by private parties and/or governmental agencies.  For example, we are directly or indirectly subject to numerous and evolving federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations that protect the privacy and security of such information, such as the privacy and security provisions of the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended, and implementing regulations (“HIPAA”).  HIPAA requires, among other things, the implementation of various recordkeeping, operational, notice and other practices intended to safeguard that information, limit its use to allowed purposes and notify individuals in the event of privacy and security breaches.  Failure to comply with these laws and regulations can result in substantial penalties and other liabilities.
 
In addition, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union have adopted a new pan-European General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), effective from May 25, 2018, which increased privacy rights for individuals in Europe, extended the scope of responsibilities for data controllers and data processors and imposes increased requirements and potential penalties on companies offering goods or services to individuals who are located in Europe (“Data Subjects”) or monitoring the behavior of such individuals (including by companies based outside of Europe).  Noncompliance can result in penalties of up to the greater of EUR 20 million, or 4% of global company revenues.  Individual member states may impose additional requirements and penalties as they relate to certain things such as employee personal data.  Among other things, the GDPR requires with respect to data concerning Data Subjects, company accountability, consents from Data Subjects or other acceptable legal basis needed to process the personal data, prompt breach notifications within 72 hours, fairness and transparency in how the personal data is stored, used or otherwise processed, and data integrity and security, and provides rights to Data Subjects relating to modification, erasure and transporting of the personal data.  While we expect we have substantially compliant programs and controls in place to comply with the GDPR requirements, our compliance 
  14

  

with the new regulation is likely to impose additional costs on us, and we cannot predict whether the interpretations of the requirements, or changes in our practices in response to new requirements or interpretations of the requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our business.
 
We also sell products and services that health care providers, such as physicians and dentists, use to store and manage patient medical or dental records.  These customers are subject to laws, regulations and industry standards, such as HIPAA and the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards, which require that they protect the privacy and security of those records, and our products may be used as part of these customers’ comprehensive data security programs, including in connection with their efforts to comply with applicable privacy and security laws.  Perceived or actual security vulnerabilities in our products or services, or the perceived or actual failure by us or our customers who use our products to comply with applicable legal requirements, may not only cause us significant reputational harm, but may also lead to claims against us by our customers and/or governmental agencies and involve substantial fines, penalties and other liabilities and expenses and costs for remediation.
 
Various federal initiatives involve the adoption and use by health care providers of certain electronic health care records systems and processes.  The initiatives include, among others, programs that incentivize physicians and dentists, through Medicare’s MIPS, to use certified EHR technology in accordance with certain evolving requirements, including regarding quality, promoting interoperability, resource use, clinical practice improvement and improving patient access to health information.  Qualification for the MIPS incentive payments requires the use of EHRs that are certified as having certain capabilities designated in standards adopted by CMS and by the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (“ONC”) of the Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”).  These standards have been subject to change.  
 
Certain of our businesses involve the manufacture and sale of certified EHR systems and other products linked to MIPS and other incentive programs.  In order to maintain certification of our EHR products, we must satisfy the changing governmental standards. If any of our EHR systems do not meet these standards, yet have been relied upon by health care providers to receive federal incentive payments, we are exposed to risk, such as under federal health care fraud and abuse laws, including the False Claims Act.  For example, on May 31, 2017, the U.S. Department of Justice announced a $155 million settlement and 5-year corporate integrity agreement involving a vendor of certified EHR systems, based on allegations that the vendor, by misrepresenting capabilities to the certifying body, caused its health care provider customers to submit false Medicare and Medicaid claims for meaningful use incentive payments in violation of the False Claims Act.  While we believe we are substantially in compliance with such certifications and with applicable fraud and abuse laws and regulations, and we have adequate compliance programs and controls in place to ensure substantial compliance, we cannot predict whether changes in applicable law, or interpretation of laws, or changes in our practices in response to changes in applicable law or interpretation of laws, could have a material adverse effect on our business.  Moreover, in order to satisfy our customers, our products may need to incorporate increasingly complex reporting functionality.  Although we believe we are positioned to accomplish this, the effort may involve increased costs, and our failure to implement product modifications, or otherwise satisfy applicable standards, could have a material adverse effect on our business.
 
Other health information standards, such as regulations under HIPAA, establish standards regarding electronic health data transmissions and transaction code set rules for specific electronic transactions, such as transactions involving claims submissions to third party payers.  Certain of our businesses provide electronic practice management products that must meet these requirements.  Failure to abide by electronic health data transmission standards could expose us to breach of contract claims, substantial fines, penalties, and other liabilities and expenses, costs for remediation and harm to our reputation.
 
Additionally, as electronic medical devices are increasingly connected to each other and to other technology, the ability of these connected systems safely and effectively to exchange and use exchanged information becomes increasingly important.  On September 6, 2017, the FDA issued guidance to assist industry in identifying specific considerations related to the ability of electronic medical devices to safely and effectively exchange and use exchanged information.  As a medical device manufacturer, we must manage risks including those associated with an electronic interface that is incorporated into a medical device.

There may be additional legislative or regulatory initiatives in the future impacting health care.
 
E-Commerce
 
Electronic commerce solutions have become an integral part of traditional health care supply and distribution relationships.  Our distribution business is characterized by rapid technological developments and intense competition.  The continuing advancement of online commerce requires us to cost-effectively adapt to changing technologies, to enhance existing services and to develop and introduce a variety of new services to address the changing demands of consumers and our customers on a timely basis, particularly in response to competitive offerings.
 
Through our proprietary, technologically based suite of products, we offer customers a variety of competitive alternatives.  We believe that our tradition of reliable service, our name recognition and large customer base built on solid customer relationships, position us well to participate in this significant aspect of the distribution business.  We continue to explore ways and means to improve and expand our Internet presence and capabilities, including our online commerce offerings and our use of various social media outlets.
 
International Transactions
 
In addition, United States and foreign import and export laws and regulations require us to abide by certain standards relating to the importation and exportation of products.  We also are subject to certain laws and regulations concerning the conduct of our foreign operations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act, German anti-corruption laws and other anti-bribery laws and laws pertaining to the accuracy of our internal books and records, as well as other types of foreign requirements similar to those imposed in the United States.
 
While we believe that we are substantially compliant with the foregoing laws and regulations promulgated thereunder and possess all material permits and licenses required for the conduct of our business, there can be no assurance that regulations that impact our business or customers’ practices will not have a material adverse effect on our business.  
 
See “ITEM 1A. Risk Factors” for a discussion of additional burdens, risks and regulatory developments that may affect our results of operations and financial condition.
