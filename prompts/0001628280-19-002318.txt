Item 1. Business
Overview
Accelerate Diagnostics, Inc. (“Accelerate”) is an in vitro diagnostics company dedicated to providing solutions that improve patient outcomes and lower healthcare costs through the fast diagnosis of serious infections. Microbiology laboratories are in need of new tools to address what the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (the “CDC”) calls one of the most serious healthcare threats of our time, antibiotic resistance. A significant contributing factor to the rise of resistance is the overuse and misuse of antibiotics, which is exacerbated by a lack of timely diagnostic results. The delay of identification and antibiotic susceptibility results is often due to the reliance by microbiology laboratories on traditional culture-based tests that often take two to three days to complete. Our technology platform is built to address these challenges by delivering significantly faster testing of infectious pathogens in various patient sample types.
Our first system to address these challenges is the Accelerate Pheno™ system. The Accelerate Pheno™ system utilizes genotypic technology to identify (ID) infectious pathogens and phenotypic technology to conduct antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST), which determines whether live bacterial and fungal cells are resistant or susceptible to a particular antimicrobial. The Accelerate PhenoTest™ BC Kit, which is the first test kit for the system, provides ID and AST results for patients suspected of bacteremia or fungemia, both life-threatening conditions with high morbidity and mortality risk. This information is used to rapidly modify antibiotic therapy to lessen side-affects, improve clinical outcomes, and help preserve the useful life of antibiotics.
On June 30, 2015, we declared our conformity to the European In Vitro Diagnostic Directive 98/79/EC and applied a CE Mark to the Accelerate Pheno™ system and the Accelerate PhenoTest™ BC Kit for in vitro diagnostic use. On February 23, 2017, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) granted our de novo request to market our Accelerate Pheno™ system and Accelerate PhenoTest™ BC Kit.
In 2017, we began selling the Accelerate Pheno™ system in hospitals in the United States, Europe, and the Middle East. Consistent with the Company's “razor” / “razor-blade” business model, revenues to date have principally been generated from the sale of the instruments and the sale of single use consumable test kits.
History
We were incorporated in 1982 in Colorado under the name Sage Resources Corp., and through a series of subsequent transactions, we became Accelerate Diagnostics, Inc., a Delaware corporation, in December 2012.
From 2001 to 2012, we focused primarily upon furthering the research and development of the OpTest portfolio of technologies (“OpTest”) that we acquired from DDx, Inc. in 2001 and the development of revenue producing products related to that technology. The purchase of OpTest provided us with a proprietary surface chemistry formulation, which led to our OptiChem and other surface chemistry products, and quantitative bio-analytical measurement instruments.
In 2012, our Board of Directors and management team established a new strategic direction for the Company, which was (1) to focus on the internal development, manufacture, and commercialization of the Accelerate Pheno™ system and (2) to discontinue efforts to develop and actively market OptiChem and our other surface chemistry products. Our Board of Directors and management pursued this new strategic direction based on the belief that we could internally develop and commercialize the Accelerate Pheno™ system, formerly called the BacCel System.
Since the adoption of the new strategic direction in 2012, we have made significant investments in research and development personnel, facilities, equipment, and consumables to support the internal development of the Accelerate Pheno™ system. The Company has also invested in the hiring of regulatory, manufacturing, quality, sales, and marketing personnel experienced in the manufacture and commercialization of medical devices.
This strategic direction required the Company to raise additional capital, including through the following transactions: 
4


• | In June 2012, the Company raised $14.4 million through the sale of common stock to Abeja Ventures, LLC.


• | In March 2013, the Company obtained additional capital through the exercise of warrants issued to Abeja Ventures, LLC in the aggregate amount of $20.1 million.


• | In August 2013, the Company completed a rights offering that raised gross proceeds of $20.0 million.


• | In April 2014, the Company completed a rights offering that raised gross proceeds of $45.0 million.


• | In December 2015, the Company completed a publicly marketed common stock offering that raised gross proceeds of $109.3 million.


• | In May 2017, the Company completed another publicly marketed common stock offering that raised additional gross proceeds of $89.0 million.


• | In March 2018, the Company completed a convertible debt offering providing additional gross proceeds of $171.5 million.

This strategic direction coupled with various investments permitted the development, clinical trial and FDA registration, and commercialization of the Accelerate Pheno™ system and the Accelerate PhenoTest™ BC Kit. Accelerate has expanded the strategic direction it took in 2012 to include the development of additional test kits, systems, and geographic expansion to advance its mission to improve patient outcomes and lower healthcare costs through the rapid diagnosis of serious infections globally. 
Clinical Need
Antibiotic resistance poses a significant impact to healthcare, costing the U.S. an estimated $55 billion per year in healthcare and productivity costs. This estimate includes $20 billion in direct costs and $35 billion in indirect costs, such as lost productivity and sick days. Increasing infection rates and misuse of antibiotics results in serious treatment complications. Recent studies have shown that the number of hospital-acquired infections in the United States ranges from 214,700 to 1.4 million per year, contributing to an estimated 75,000 deaths per year. According to the CDC, there are approximately 2 million illnesses per year attributable to antibiotic resistance. Moreover, inappropriate antibiotic use is widespread. Of the approximately 35 million patients admitted to U.S. hospitals each year, 56% are put on empiric antibiotic therapy, of which more than half are on inappropriate or unnecessary antibiotics.
AST testing determines which antibiotics will be effective and which will be ineffective for treating a particular patient's infections. Accordingly, AST is ideally designed to address this challenge but previous post culture methods for obtaining AST results took 2-3 days to deliver. Studies have shown that even a modest decrease in the time it takes to deliver an AST result correlates to reduced length and cost of hospital stay per patient. One such study showed that a five hour reduction in the time to receive an AST result delivered a two-day reduction in length of stay and a reduction in patient treatment costs of $1,750 per patient. Based on our analysis, we estimate that the Accelerate Pheno™ system is capable of delivering clinically-actionable results in approximately 19 hours from the time a blood sample is received by the laboratory, while current solutions often require 2-3 days to deliver these results. Studies have established that the Accelerate Pheno™ system is between 24 and 36 hours faster to ID results and 36 to 54 hours faster to AST results.
Market Opportunity
Across North America, Europe and Asia Pacific geographies, we estimate there are over 16 million ID and AST tests completed annually across various sample types. We estimate that of these 16 million tests, our current test kit, the Accelerate PhenoTest™ BC Kit, can address the over 4 million blood culture samples tested each year in North America and Europe. 
In addition, based on information compiled from various competitor annual reports and other publicly available information, as well as our own estimates, we believe there are nearly 20,000 global instrument placements currently, consisting of approximately 10,000 bioMerieux Vitek 2® automated instrument installations, 6,000 Danaher Microscan® Systems installations and 4,000 instruments from other companies. We believe these placements approximate the number of potential placements for the Accelerate Pheno™ system globally.
Certain government initiatives are complementary to the Accelerate Pheno™ system. For example, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) programs, which are designed to decrease hospital-acquired infections directly impact hospital budgets via reimbursement cuts, thereby incentivizing providers to enhance infection-management protocols. These programs include the Medicare Hospital-Acquired Condition Reduction Program and the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program. Similarly, on March 27, 2015, the White House released the National Action Plan for Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria, which directly and indirectly promotes rapid susceptibility 
5

testing. The plan identifies several milestones to accomplish this goal, such as calling on the National Institutes of Health to fund new projects and provide prizes aimed at the development of rapid diagnostic tests that characterize antibiotic susceptibility and improve antibiotic stewardship; mandating implementation of antibiotic stewardship programs by all hospitals participating in Medicare and Medicaid; and calling on the FDA and CMS to evaluate new regulatory pathways to promote development and adoption of innovative infectious disease diagnostics. The antibiotic stewardship programs are being implemented by many hospitals in advance of the 2020 implementation deadline.
Products
The Accelerate Pheno™ system is the Company’s first in vitro diagnostic platform and is intended for the identification and antibiotic susceptibility testing of pathogens most commonly associated with serious or health care-associated infections, including Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms, as well as yeast. The system leverages long-accepted bacteriological testing principles enhanced by proprietary technology and automation enabling the analysis of live microbial cells. It detects and identifies pathogens directly from a single patient sample followed by antimicrobial susceptibility testing based on the identification results. Antimicrobial susceptibility is determined by morphokinetic cellular analysis (“MCA”), a process that evaluates the change of individual cells and microcolonies in response to a range of antibiotics over time. The system’s combined technologies and automation dramatically reduce the need for time-consuming traditional bacterial culturing, thus eliminating the major source of delay with current testing methods. Identification results are typically available within 90 minutes of presenting the patient sample to the system, and susceptibility results, including minimum inhibitory concentrations (“MIC”), are available about 5 five hours after identification results. In the case of the Accelerate PhenoTest™ BC Kit for positive blood culture samples, a blood culture screening step is required, which we estimate takes an average of approximately twelve hours to complete before the sample is introduced to the Accelerate Pheno™ system. This combined turnaround time is a significant improvement over the multiple days currently required to obtain AST results, with MIC details, using conventional testing methods.
The Accelerate Pheno™ system features walk-away automation and consists of a fixed instrument and proprietary single-use test kit. The instrument consists of module(s) connected to a single analysis computer, which allows hospitals to acquire various numbers of modules to address their particular test volume. In order to run a patient sample on the Accelerate Pheno™ system a laboratory technician would pipette the patient sample into our system, insert the Accelerate PhenoTest™ BC Kit, and initiate the run. In the case of our initial test, a positive blood culture sample is introduced to the system through pipetting directly from the blood culture bottle into our Accelerate PhenoTest™ BC Kit.
The Accelerate Pheno™ system is the result of over a decade of technological development and several years of instrument design and engineering. The system is comprised of custom-engineered functional components, including a robotic pipettor for fluidic manipulation, an optical system with both dark-field and fluorescent illumination, and an imaging system. These sensor components, among others, are used in the four processes that follow, each of which is a crucial component in delivering the rapid ID and AST results.
These processes include:

• | Automated specimen preparation. The initial step in the process is the automated purification of samples through an on-board and proprietary process to separate live organisms from sample debris. 


• | Live-cell immobilization. Following preparation, the purified sample is moved to the imaging cassette where pathogens are immobilized onto the cassette surface such that they can be imaged and analyzed in a stationary position during the identification and antibiotic susceptibility testing. 


• | Identification testing via fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). The now immobilized cells are tested with our proprietary FISH probes to enable identification. Because the genetic sequences of bacteria are distinctive, the binding of fluorescently labeled probes indicates the presence of a specific target sequence of RNA associated with a single or group of bacterial species or yeasts. When the probe finds a targeted sequence, it binds to it—generating a fluorescent signal—which is visible by the imaging system on the Accelerate Pheno™ system. Positive fluorescent signals from more than one target probe indicate polymicrobial samples and a universal bacterial stain discriminates target from non-target bacteria or fungi. The identification result is presented on the Accelerate Pheno™ system's graphic user interface in approximately 90 minutes from the introduction of the sample into the Accelerate Pheno™ system. 

6


• | Susceptibility testing via live-cell optical analysis. With the identification of the pathogen known, the system’s software determines the antibiotic panel to be used for susceptibility testing. These antibiotics, growth media, and additional patient sample are introduced to additional channels on the optical cassette. Finally, our proprietary imaging platform and algorithms determine the minimum inhibitory concentration of the bacteria by observing which antibiotics arrested live cell growth and led to cell death and which antibiotics were ineffective in ceasing live cell growth. The susceptibility test result is presented approximately five hours after the conclusion of the identification test. 

The Accelerate Pheno™ system has been the subject of dozens of scientific posters and studies. Recent studies and associated publications have covered subjects including time savings, performance, opportunity rates for clinical interventions, and clinical outcomes including length of stay. Published study abstracts and links to full papers are available on our website at http://acceleratediagnostics.com/updates/#publications. 
Research and Development 
The Company plans to continue making significant investments in the research and development of new applications for existing technologies and in the research and development of new complementary technologies.
Since the completion and launch of the Accelerate Pheno™ system and Accelerate PhenoTest™ BC Kit, the Company has focused on product improvements and the development of additional test kits to address opportunities in additional sample types including, but not limited to, our next kit for severe bacterial pneumonia samples. Similar to the Accelerate PhenoTest™ BC Kit, the objective is to develop test kits that work seamlessly with the Accelerate Pheno™ system and deliver substantial benefits to microbiology laboratories and to physicians in the treatment of serious infections.
We anticipate seeking separate regulatory approval for each additional test kit that we develop. If and when we determine that we will pursue regulatory approvals for those applications, we would likely include the identification of the most prevalent infectious pathogens found in each specimen type and the most commonly prescribed antimicrobial agents for treatment.
Our research activity also includes the evaluation and development of (i) technologies which reduce the cost and increase the throughput of AST, (ii) improved identification technologies, and (iii) other platform technologies potentially useful in addressing other parts of the infectious disease laboratory testing work flow. 
The Company's research and development expense for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, is included in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss.
Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, employee and third-party non-disclosure agreements, license agreements, and other intellectual property protection methods to protect our proprietary rights. We intend to continue developing intellectual property, and we intend to aggressively protect our position in key technologies. Our patented technology covers key components of the Accelerate Pheno™ system and is, thus, very important to the Company. Our patents are focused on several key technologies, including our automated process for sample preparation, automated immobilization process, and methods for imaging and analysis of individual pathogen cells. The Company’s first patent on the Accelerate Pheno™ system technology, U.S. Patent No. 7,341,841 titled “Rapid Microbial Detection and Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing,” was issued on March 11, 2008. The patent specification covers methods used to derive identification and antibiotic susceptibility from tests on individual immobilized bacterial cells. As of December 31, 2018, we had 45 issued patents worldwide, including 19 patents issued in the United States and 26 issued outside the United States. Our patents are set to expire on various dates in 2022 through 2035. Additionally, as of December 31, 2018, we had 23 patent applications pending worldwide, including 11 U.S. applications and 12 applications outside the United States. The Company believes that its patent suite would make it difficult for any other company to conduct rapid antibiotic susceptibility testing of individual pathogens utilizing our technology. From a trademark perspective, we had 19 pending and 26 registered marks protecting our brand and prospective products both domestically and internationally.
Sales, Marketing, and Distribution
The target customers for our products are hospital microbiology laboratories that perform identification and 
7

antibiotic susceptibility testing. Globally, the vast majority of hospitals with an intensive care unit have such a laboratory. In general, we utilize our own direct sales force to market the Accelerate Pheno™ system to our targeted customers. However, in select geographies, we plan to use third-party distributors to market the product.
The business, while not seasonal, is influenced by the timing of hospital budget and tender approval cycles which vary by geography. Due to the relatively long sales cycles, back-logs are not typical and inventory is managed based on an estimation of demand forecasts.
For the year ended December 31, 2018, none of the Company’s customers represented more than 10% of the Company’s total net sales.
Competition
The leading companies with automated microbiological testing products include Becton, Dickinson and Company (“BD”), bioMerieux, Danaher Corporation (“Danaher”), Bruker Corporation, Luminex Corporation, T2 Biosystems, Abbott and Thermo Fisher Scientific’s subsidiary TREK Diagnostics Systems, Inc. (“TREK”). These companies provide products for the broad-based culturing and analysis of a wide variety of bacteria. These competitors’ AST products require purified bacterial strains or “isolates” for analysis, which require at least overnight culturing of a sample to produce enough organisms to test. We believe these standard culturing methods, including enrichment growth and colony isolation, cannot achieve the speed that the Accelerate Pheno™ system provides. 
Potential competitors for rapid AST have recently made announcements at various trade shows, including - but not limited to - Quantamatrix, Q-Linea and Lifescale. While we do not have visibility into all of these companies’ respective stages of development, we believe they are early stage and will require years to achieve FDA approval. In addition to existing and emerging companies, there are manual methods which could be validated by individual hospitals to deliver rapid identification and susceptibility results. See “Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Business and Strategy-Our industry is highly competitive, and we may not be successful in competing with our competitors. We currently face competition from new and established competitors and expect to face competition from others in the future, including those with new products, technologies or techniques” for additional information.
Industry Developments
The clinical microbiology industry is subject to rapid technological changes, and new products are frequently introduced for rapid bacterial identification using genes or other molecular markers. Numerous acquisitions, licenses, and distribution arrangements have been announced over the last few years for such products. However, we do not believe that any of these technologies offers the advantages afforded by the Accelerate Pheno™ system. For example, gene detection can be highly sensitive and specific for the identification of pathogens, but very few antibiotic resistance mechanisms are simple enough to accurately guide drug selection. Even in those rare instances that have a direct relationship between a gene and effective resistance, such as particular Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA) strains, leading literature has reported novel mutations that escape detection by recently commercialized tests.
Fundamental biological limitations arise from the complexity of the majority of drug resistance expression mechanisms. This complexity precludes direct interpretation of molecular marker presence or absence and extrapolating to prescription guidance. Accordingly, recent studies indicate that identification and resistance results alone are not consistently acted upon by clinicians. Further, many new diagnostic technologies also require prior isolation of cultured colonies in order to assure accuracy. The time required to obtain such isolates, with a minimum of overnight turnaround, prevents these technologies from serving as rapid diagnostics for treatment decision support.
Another new technology receiving wide attention is mass spectrometry, and particularly the matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight version (“MALDI-TOF”), such as the Biotyper® system from Bruker Corporation. Bruker Corporation has agreements with a number of companies for distribution, including BD, TREK, and Siemens. bioMerieux has a similar system for distribution with Shimadzu Corporation. These systems build an empiric database from protein spectra acquired from many thousands of purified bacterial and fungal strains. They require a pure strain isolate for analysis and enrichment culturing to produce enough material to analyze. Some research papers on these systems report attempts to directly analyze isolate or blood culture smears, but results are not as reliable as those from samples prepared using a cleanup process to produce crude protein extracts.
MALDI-TOF systems have a major advantage over other molecular methods in identifying a very broad range 
8

of organisms. Cost of ownership is also substantially below that of older molecular methods. But the requirement for extensive organism enrichment and purification, as well as the inability to quantify live organisms or distinguish samples derived from viable organisms, substantially limits this technology from time-critical decision support. In this respect, the Accelerate Pheno™ system provides a substantial advantage for more rapid test results. Finally, as with the older molecular methods, MALDI-TOF systems cannot identify major drug resistance expression and face the same fundamental biological barriers as gene detection.
Government Regulation
Our products under development and our operations are subject to significant government regulation. In the United States, our products are regulated as medical devices by the FDA and other federal, state, and local regulatory authorities.
FDA Regulation of Medical Devices
The FDA and other U.S. and foreign governmental agencies regulate, with respect to medical devices:

• | design, development, manufacturing, and storage;


• | testing, content, and language of instructions for use and storage;


• | labeling;


• | pre-clinical testing and clinical trials;


• | product safety;


• | advertising, promotion, marketing, sales, and distribution;


• | pre-market clearance and approval;


• | record-keeping procedures;


• | advertising and promotion;


• | recalls and corrective field actions;


• | post-market reporting, including reporting of deaths, serious injuries, and malfunctions that, if they were to recur, could lead to death or serious injury;


• | post-market studies and surveillance; and


• | product import and export.

In the United States, numerous laws and regulations govern all the processes by which medical devices are brought to market and marketed. These include the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the “FDCA”) and the FDA's regulations implementing the law codifying the FDCA.
FDA Pre-market Clearance and Approval Requirements
Each medical device we seek to commercially distribute in the United States must first receive 510(k) clearance, approval of a reclassification petition or de novo classification request, or pre-market approval from the FDA, unless specifically exempted by the FDA. The FDA categorizes medical devices into one of three classes - Class I, II, or III - based on their risks and the regulatory controls necessary to provide a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness. Class I devices generally pose the lowest risk to the patient and/or user and Class III devices pose the highest risk. Regulatory control increases from Class I to Class III. The device classification regulation defines the regulatory requirements for a general device type. Generally, in order to market or commercially distribute a Class I, II, and III device intended for human use in the United States, for which a Premarket Approval application (PMA) is not required, one must submit a 510(k) to FDA unless, as noted, the device is exempt from the 510(k) pre-market 
9

notification requirements of the FDCA. Per the FDA, generally, most Class I devices are exempt from Premarket Notification 510(k); most Class II devices require Premarket Notification 510(k); and most Class III devices require a PMA.
510(k) Clearance Process
To obtain 510(k) clearance, we must submit a pre-market notification to the FDA demonstrating that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to a device that has previously obtained 510(k) clearance, a device that has been classified into Class I or II, or a device that was legally marketed before May 28, 1976 and that is not yet subject to an FDA order requiring pre-market approval. In rare cases, Class III devices may be cleared through the 510(k) process. The FDA has committed to review most 510(k) decisions within 90 days, but the review clock may be stopped due to requests for additional information. A decision may take significantly longer, and clearance is never assured. Although many 510(k) pre-market notifications are cleared without clinical data, in some cases, the FDA requires significant clinical data to support substantial equivalence. In reviewing a pre-market notification submission, the FDA may request additional information, including clinical data, which may significantly prolong the review process.
After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any subsequent modification of the device that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, requires a new 510(k) clearance or, in some cases, approval of a PMA. The FDA requires each manufacturer to make this determination initially, but the FDA may review any such decision and may disagree with a manufacturer's determination. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer's determination, the FDA may require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or approval of a PMA is obtained. Under these circumstances, the FDA may also subject a manufacturer to enforcement action and sanctions, including those described below. In addition, the FDA is currently evaluating the 510(k) process and may make substantial changes to regulatory requirements, including changes that could affect which devices are eligible for 510(k) clearance, the FDA’s ability to rescind 510(k) clearances, and additional requirements that may significantly impact the 510(k) review process.
Pre-market Approval (“PMA”) Process
A PMA generally must be submitted if the medical device is in Class III or cannot be cleared through the 510(k) process. A PMA must be supported by extensive technical, preclinical, clinical, manufacturing, and labeling data to demonstrate to the FDA's satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the device.
After a PMA is submitted and filed, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the submitted information. During this review, the FDA may request additional information or clarification of information already provided. Also during the review period, an advisory panel of experts from outside the FDA may be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the FDA as to the approvability of the device. In addition, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility to ensure compliance with Quality System Regulation (“QSR”), which imposes elaborate development, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance requirements on the design and manufacturing process. The FDA has committed to review most PMAs within 180 days where an advisory panel is not required and within 320 days where an advisory panel is required, but the review clock may be stopped due to requests for additional information. A decision may take significantly longer, and approval is never assured. The FDA may approve a PMA with post-approval conditions intended to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device including restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale, and distribution and collection of safety data. Failure to comply with the conditions of approval can result in enforcement action and sanctions, including those described below. New PMAs or PMA supplements are required for significant modifications to the manufacturing process, labeling of the product, or design of a device that is approved through the PMA process. PMA supplements often require submission of the same type of information as an original PMA, except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the original PMA and may not require as extensive clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel.
De novo Classification Process
Medical device types that the FDA has not previously classified as Class I, II, or III are automatically classified into Class III regardless of the level of risk they pose. The Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 established a new route to market for low-to-moderate risk medical devices that are automatically placed into Class III due to the absence of a predicate device, called the “Request for Evaluation of Automatic Class III Designation,” or the de novo classification procedure. This procedure allows a manufacturer whose novel device is automatically classified into Class III to request down-classification of its medical device into Class I or Class II on the basis that the 
10

device presents low or moderate risk, rather than requiring the submission and approval of a PMA. Prior to the enactment of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (“FDASIA”) in July 2012, a medical device could only be eligible for de novo classification if the manufacturer first submitted a 510(k) pre-market notification and received a determination from the FDA that the device was not substantially equivalent to a predicate device. FDASIA streamlined the de novo classification pathway by permitting manufacturers to also request de novo classification directly without first submitting a 510(k) pre-market notification to the FDA and receiving a not substantially equivalent determination. Under FDASIA, the FDA is required to classify the device within 120 days following receipt of such a direct de novo request; however, this time period can be extended if questions and/or requests for additional information are asked of the applicant. If the manufacturer seeks classification into Class II, the manufacturer should include a draft proposal for special controls that are necessary to provide a reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the medical device. In addition, the FDA may reject a de novo request if the FDA identifies a legally marketed predicate device that would be appropriate for a 510(k), determines that the device is not low-to-moderate risk, or determines that general controls would be inadequate to control the risks and special controls cannot be developed. 
In July of 2016, we submitted a de novo request for evaluation of automatic Class III Designation to the FDA for the Accelerate Pheno™ system and Accelerate PhenoTest™ BC Kit, and on February 23, 2017, the FDA granted our de novo request to market the Accelerate Pheno™ system and Accelerate PhenoTest™ BC Kit.
Clinical Trials
Clinical trial data is typically required to support a PMA and is usually required for a 510(k) pre-market notification. Initiation of a clinical trial generally requires submission of an application for an Investigational Device Exemption (an “IDE”) to the FDA. The IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory testing results, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the investigational protocol is scientifically sound. The IDE application must be approved in advance by the FDA for a specified number of patients, unless the product is deemed a non-significant risk device and eligible for abbreviated IDE requirements. Clinical trials for a significant risk device may begin once the IDE application is approved by the FDA as well as the appropriate institutional review boards at the clinical trial sites and the informed consent of the patients participating in the clinical trial is obtained. After a trial begins, the FDA may place it on hold or terminate if it concludes that the clinical subjects are exposed to unacceptable risks. Any trials we conduct must be undertaken in accordance with FDA regulations as well as other federal regulations and state laws concerning human subject protection and privacy. Moreover, the results of a clinical trial may not be sufficient to obtain clearance or approval of the product.
Clinical trial sponsors may also be subject to the Medicare Secondary Payer laws, which prohibit Medicare from making a payment if payment has been made or can reasonably be expected to be made by other plans, such as liability insurance plans (including self-insurance). Section 111 of the Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Extension Act of 2007 (“MMSEA”) established mandatory reporting requirements with respect to Medicare beneficiaries who receive settlements, judgments, awards, or other payment from liability insurance (including self-insurance) plans. When payments are made by sponsors of clinical trials for complications or injuries arising out of the trials, such payments are considered to be payments by liability insurance (including self-insurance) and must be reported. Section III of the MMSEA includes authority for CMS to impose civil monetary penalties against liability insurance (including self-insurance) plans that are determined to be non-compliant with the applicable reporting requirements.
Pervasive and Continuing Regulation
After a medical device is placed on the market, numerous FDA regulatory requirements apply, including the following:

• | the QSR, which imposes elaborate development, testing, control, documentation, and other quality assurance requirements on the design and manufacturing process;


• | establishment registration, which requires establishments involved in the production and distribution of medical devices, intended for commercial distribution in the United States, to register with the FDA;


• | medical device listing, which requires manufacturers to list the devices they have in commercial distribution with the FDA;


• | labeling regulations and various statutory provisions, which prohibit false or misleading labeling, as well as the promotion of products for unapproved or “off-label” uses, and impose other restrictions on labeling;

11

and

• | post-market reporting requirements, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA deaths, serious injuries, and malfunctions that, if they were to recur, could lead to death or serious injury, recalls, and corrective field actions.

In certain cases, advertising is also subject to scrutiny by the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) in addition to the FDA. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce these and other applicable laws and regulations, accordingly. Failure to comply with applicable requirements may result in enforcement action by the FDA and/or the U.S. Department of Justice, which may include one or more of the following administrative or judicial sanctions:

• | untitled letters or warning letters;


• | fines, injunctions, and civil penalties;


• | mandatory recall or seizure of our products;


• | administrative detention or banning of our products;


• | operating restrictions, partial suspension, or total shutdown of production;


• | import holds;


• | refusing to approve pending 510(k) notifications or PMAs;


• | revocation of 510(k) clearance or pre-market approvals previously granted; and


• | criminal prosecution and penalties.

International Regulation
Sales of medical devices outside the United States are subject to foreign government regulations, which vary substantially from country to country. In order to market our products in other countries, we must obtain regulatory approvals and comply with extensive safety and quality regulations in other countries. The time required to obtain approval by a foreign country may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA clearance or approval, and the requirements may differ significantly.
In the European Economic Area, or EEA, which comprises the 28 Member States of the EU plus Liechtenstein, Norway and Iceland, in vitro medical devices are required to conform with the essential requirements of the EU Directive on in vitro diagnostic medical devices (Directive 98/79/EC, as amended). To demonstrate compliance with the essential requirements, the manufacturer must undergo a conformity assessment procedure. The conformity assessment varies according to the type of medical device and its classification. For low-risk devices, the conformity assessment can be carried out internally, but for higher risk devices (self-test devices and those included in List A and B of Annex II of Directive 98/79/EC) it requires the intervention of an accredited EEA Notified Body. If successful, the conformity assessment concludes with the drawing up by the manufacturer of an EC Declaration of Conformity entitling the manufacturer to affix the CE mark to its products and to sell them throughout the EEA. The EC Declaration of Conformity was received by the Company in 2015.
Other Healthcare Laws
With the FDA’s granting of our de novo request to market the Accelerate Pheno™ system and Accelerate PhenoTest™ BC Kit, we are actively commercializing the Accelerate Pheno™ system. Such business activities, including the activities of any third-party distributors that we retain, will be subject to additional healthcare laws and regulations and related enforcement by the federal government as well as the governments of states and foreign jurisdictions where we conduct our business. These laws and regulations include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, privacy and security, and physician payment transparency laws and regulations. Violations of these laws or regulations can result in criminal or civil sanctions, including substantial fines and, in some cases, exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid. The following discussion describes certain federal and state healthcare laws and regulations that may impact our operations 
12

and the operations of our customers, but is not intended to be an exhaustive discussion of all potentially applicable federal and state health laws and regulations.
The U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits any person from knowingly and willfully offering, soliciting, receiving, or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for an item or service, or the purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease, or order of any good, facility, item, or service for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. A person need not have actual knowledge of the Anti-Kickback Statute or specific intent in order to commit a violation, and several courts have interpreted the intent requirement of the Anti-Kickback Statute to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement is to induce referrals or purchases of federal healthcare program business, the Anti-Kickback Statute has been violated. In addition to criminal fines and penalties set forth under the Anti-Kickback Statute, violations of the Anti-Kickback Statute can result in exclusion or debarment from participation in the federal healthcare programs, as well as substantial penalties under the Civil Monetary Penalties Statute, which imposes penalties against any person or entity that is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal healthcare program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent. A violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act, which, as discussed below, imposes liability on any person or entity that knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment by a federal healthcare program. Several states also have anti-kickback laws which establish similar prohibitions and, in some cases, may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payer, including commercial insurers.
The federal False Claims Act imposes liability on any person or entity that knowingly presents or causes to be presented a false or fraudulent claim for payment to, or approval by, the U.S. government. Liability under the False Claims Act can give rise to treble damages and civil monetary penalties. In addition to actions initiated by the government itself, the qui tam provisions of the False Claims Act authorize private individuals to bring False Claims Act actions on behalf of the federal government alleging that the defendant has submitted a false claim to the federal government, and to share in a percentage of the recovery. In recent years, the government and qui tam relators have initiated suits resulting in multi-million and multi-billion dollar settlements under the False Claims Act in addition to criminal convictions under applicable criminal statutes. Given the significant size of actual and potential settlements, it is expected that the government and qui tam relators will continue to devote substantial resources and use the False Claims Act to investigate and prosecute healthcare companies’ compliance with applicable fraud and abuse laws.
The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) created federal criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme or artifice to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payers or to obtain—by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises—any of the money or property owned by or under the custody or control of any healthcare benefit program; and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing, or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. The Affordable Care Act amended certain sections of the HIPAA criminal statutes such that a person need not have actual knowledge of the applicable statute or specific intent in order to have committed a healthcare fraud violation.
As stated above, many states and foreign countries have adopted similar fraud and abuse laws that may be broader in scope and may apply regardless of payer. Violations of any of these laws can lead to additional risk such as risk of plaintiff class actions, state attorney general actions, and investigation by agencies such as the Department of Justice (“DOJ”) or the FTC.
The Physician Payment Sunshine Act, implemented by Section 6002 of the Affordable Care Act, imposes transparency requirements on certain manufacturers, referred to as “applicable manufacturers,” of drugs, devices, biological, or medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, the Children’s Health Insurance Program (“CHIP”), or a waiver of a plan offered under CHIP. Applicable manufacturers must track and report to the CMS certain payments or “transfers of value” provided to U.S. licensed physicians and teaching hospitals during the preceding calendar year, as well as certain ownership and investment interests held by U.S. licensed physicians and their immediate family members. CMS releases the reported data on a public website on an annual basis. Failure to report as required under the Physician Payment Sunshine Act could subject applicable manufacturers to significant financial penalties, while tracking and reporting the required payments and transfers of value may result in considerable administrative expense. Several states currently have similar laws, and more states may enact similar legislation, some of which may be broader in scope. For example, certain states require the implementation of compliance 
13

programs, compliance with industry ethics codes, implementation of gift bans, and spending limits, and/or reporting of gifts, compensation, and other remuneration to healthcare professionals.
We also may be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”), and their respective implementing regulations, including the final omnibus rule published by the Department of Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights (“OCR”) in January 2013, restrict the use and disclosure of patient-identifiable health information, mandate the adoption of standards relating to the privacy and security of patient-identifiable health information, and require us to report certain security breaches to healthcare provider customers with respect to such information where we are acting as a HIPAA business associate, as that term is defined, to that customer. In addition to HIPAA criminal penalties, HITECH created four new tiers of civil and monetary penalties and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA privacy and security laws and seek attorneys' fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances and impose reporting requirements for data breaches, many of which differ from each other and HIPAA in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.
The use of certain diagnostic products by our potential customers is affected by the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (“CLIA”) and related federal and state regulations that provide for regulation of laboratory testing. CLIA is intended to ensure the quality and reliability of clinical laboratories in the United States by mandating specific standards in the areas of personnel qualifications, administration, and participation in proficiency testing, patient test management, quality assurance, quality control, and inspections. Current or future CLIA requirements or the promulgation of additional regulations affecting laboratory testing may prevent some laboratories, hospitals, providers, or other customers with laboratories from using some or all of our diagnostic products.
Healthcare Reform
In the United States and several foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and we expect there may continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system seeking to reduce healthcare costs that could affect our future results of operations as we begin to commercialize our products.
In the United States, the Affordable Care Act (“ACA”), enacted in March 2010, made changes that are expected to have a continued and significant impact on the medical device industry and clinical laboratories, including the way healthcare is delivered and financed by governmental and private insurers. For example, the legislation provided for reductions in the Medicare clinical laboratory fee schedule and, since 2013 (with exception of a moratorium period from January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2019), has required that certain medical device manufacturers pay an excise tax in an amount equal to 2.3% of the price for which such manufacturer sells its medical devices. The ACA also requires CMS to reduce payments to hospitals reimbursed under Medicare’s Inpatient Prospective Payment System (“IPPS”) that have excess readmissions. While the ACA is intended to expand health insurance coverage to uninsured persons in the United States, other elements of this legislation that are still being developed and refined, such as Medicare provisions aimed at improving quality and decreasing costs, comparative effectiveness research, an independent payment advisory board, and pilot programs to evaluate alternative payment methodologies, make it difficult to determine the overall impact on sales of our products. In addition to uncertainty regarding the impact of implementation of the ACA, there are some continued legal challenges to the ACA that, if successful, could call into question the legitimacy of the ACA and its future applicability. Further, the current White House administration has at times threatened to challenge or repeal the ACA, although the scope and timing of any legislation to repeal, amend, replace or reform the ACA is uncertain. See “Risk Factors-Risks related to government regulation” for additional information.
In addition, frequently in recent years, other legislative, regulatory, and political changes aimed at regulating healthcare delivery in general and clinical laboratories in particular have been proposed and adopted in the United States. Payment and reimbursement for the laboratory industry and hospital and other healthcare provider services have been under significant pressure. In January 2015, the Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) announced a plan to shift the Medicare program and the healthcare system at large toward paying providers based on quality, rather than the quantity of care provided to patients.

Reimbursement
We do not believe that hospitals will specifically seek reimbursement from the government or private insurance companies for their purchase of the Accelerate Pheno™ system or the Accelerate PhenoTest™ BC Kit. Instead, we believe that hospitals will recoup such costs by obtaining reimbursement from the government or private insurance companies for in-bed occupancies, which traditionally includes all testing required for admitted patients.
Hospitals, clinical laboratories, and other healthcare provider customers that may purchase our products, if approved, generally bill various third-party payers to cover all or a portion of the costs and fees associated with diagnostic tests, including the cost of the purchase of our products. We currently expect that all of our diagnostic tests will be performed in a hospital inpatient setting, where governmental payers, such as Medicare, generally reimburse hospitals a single bundled payment that is based on the patient’s diagnosis under a classification system known as the Medicare severity diagnosis-related groups (“MS-DRGs”) classification for all items and services provided to the patient during a single hospitalization, regardless of whether our diagnostic tests are performed during such hospitalization.
Environmental Laws
We use hazardous materials in some of our research, development and manufacturing processes, and our operations are subject to regulation under various federal, state, local, and foreign laws concerning the environment. We believe that our operations are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations. The costs we incur in complying with such environmental laws and regulations are presently not material to our operations, cash flows or financial condition. It is possible, however, that future developments, including changes in environmental laws and regulations, could lead to material compliance costs, and such costs may have a material adverse effect on our operations, cash flows or financial condition. See “Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Research and Development Activities-We use hazardous materials in some of our research, development and manufacturing processes and face the accompanying risks and regulations governing environmental safety” for additional information.
Operations
In January 2013, we relocated our headquarters from Denver, Colorado, to Tucson, Arizona, where we currently lease approximately 54,092 square feet of office, manufacturing and laboratory space. Further information regarding our Tucson facility is included in Item 2. Properties included elsewhere in this report, and details regarding our lease arrangement are included in Item 8, Note 18, Commitments and Contingencies to the audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.
We assemble the Accelerate Pheno™ system instrument and formulate, fill, and assemble the Accelerate PhenoTest™ BC Kit in our facilities in Tucson, Arizona. The Accelerate Pheno™ system requires certain components that are custom-fabricated to our specifications. Such components include injection-molded plastic components, die-cut laminates, and machined mechanical components. We own the necessary production tooling and believe that we will be able to qualify secondary sources as needed to support future demand for the Accelerate Pheno™ system.
Raw Materials
We purchase many different types of raw materials, including plastics, glass, metals, electronic and mechanical sub-assemblies and various biological and chemical products. We seek to ensure continuity of raw material supply by securing multiple options for sourcing. We also audit relevant sources for compliance with conflict minerals requirements. However, many of our components are custom-made by only a few outside suppliers. In certain instances, we have a sole source supply for key product components of the Accelerate Pheno™ system. We have entered into supply agreements with most of our suppliers to help ensure component availability and flexible purchasing terms with respect to the purchase of such components. See “Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Research and Development Activities-Disruptions in the supply of raw materials, consumable goods or other key product components, or issues associated with their quality from our single source suppliers, could result in a significant disruption in sales and profitability” for additional information.
Employees
We have 287 employees as of December 31, 2018. We have not entered into any collective bargaining agreements and consider our labor practices and employee relations to be good.
