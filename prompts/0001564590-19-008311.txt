Our Business
 We are a clinical-stage immuno-oncology (“I-O”) company with a pipeline of immune modulating antibodies, cancer vaccines, adjuvants and adoptive cell therapies - dedicated to becoming a leader in the discovery and development of innovative combination therapies and committed to bringing effective medicines to patients with cancer. Our business is designed to
 drive success in I-O through speed, innovation and effective combination therapies. We believe that combination therapies and a deep understanding of each patient’s cancer will drive substantial expansion of the patient population benefiting from current I-O therapies. In addition to a diverse pipeline, we have assembled fully integrated end-to-end capabilities including novel target discovery, antibody generation, cell line development and good manufacturing practice (“GMP”) manufacturing. We believe that these fully integrated capabilities enable us to produce novel candidates on timelines that are shorter than the industry standard. Leveraging from our science and capabilities, we have forged important partnerships to advance our innovation.  
 We believe the next generation of cancer treatment will build on clinically validated antibodies targeting CTLA-4 and PD-1 combined with novel immunomodulatory agents designed to address underlying tumor immune-escape mechanisms.  
 Our immunotherapy pipeline features vaccines, adjuvants, immunomodulatory and tumor microenvironment modifying antibodies, including our proprietary lead antibodies, AGEN1884 (an anti-CTLA-4 of the same IgG1 subclass as Yervoy®), and AGEN2034 (an anti-PD-1 antibody). These proprietary antibodies bind to validated targets—CTLA-4 and PD-1—and are our most advanced clinical stage combination agents with registrational potential in cervical cancer. We are aiming to develop, register and launch these products with a first potential biologics license application (“BLA”) filing as early as 2020 for both AGEN2034 monotherapy and combination therapy with AGEN1884 in second line cervical cancer. The overall strength of our pipeline, which includes potential first-in-class and best-in-class assets, is expected to drive our ability to meet individual patients’ needs. 
 In addition to our lead programs, Agenus scientists have leveraged our internal discovery and translational platforms and powerful algorithms to develop a pipeline of molecules that are intended to address key aspects of antitumor immunity and tumor resistance mechanism.
 For tumors not yet visible to the immune system, we are leveraging our immune educating neoantigen vaccine platform, designed to target mutationally based and biochemically based (phosphorylated) neoantigens (AutoSynVax and PhosphoSynVax) to prime the immune system to attack tumors. These vaccines may be applicable for patients where checkpoint modulating (“CPM”) antibodies alone are not sufficient to bring about tumor control. To further improve patient response rates, Agenus scientists are developing therapies intended to address mechanisms of immune evasion and therapeutic resistance. These include “multi-specific” antibodies that are designed to condition the tumor microenvironment and augment the activity of immune cells. We and our partners are on track to begin clinical trials with these assets in 2019. With this diverse pipeline, we are positioned to potentially deliver combination therapies with the goal to enhance response rates and benefit patients who are unresponsive to current immunotherapies. 
 In 2017, we formed a subsidiary, AgenTus Therapeutics, to bring innovative living drugs to cancer patients. AgenTus’ pipeline includes T cell receptors (TCR) and chimeric antigen receptors (CAR) formulated in both autologous and allogeneic cell formats. We anticipate filing our first cell therapy IND through AgenTus and advancing our differentiated allogeneic cell format towards an IND in 2019. 
 To succeed in I-O, innovation and speed are paramount. We are a vertically integrated biotechnology company equipped with a suite of technology platforms to advance from novel target identification (Retrocyte Display, SECANT, Agenus Immunogenic Platform (“AIM”), functional genomics and ligandomics) through manufacturing for clinical trials of antibodies and vaccines.
 Our common stock is currently listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “AGEN.”
 
Our Vision
 We believe that combination therapies and a deep understanding of each patient’s cancer will be key drivers of success in substantially expanding the patient population benefiting from current I-O therapies. In addition, delivering innovation with speed is critical for our future success, as drug development timelines in oncology shorten while product obsolescence rates climb. We believe our fully integrated, end-to-end capabilities from novel target discovery, antibody generation, cell line development, to GMP manufacturing, together with a comprehensive portfolio consisting of antibody-based therapeutics, adjuvants and cancer vaccines, will uniquely position us to produce novel therapies on accelerated timelines. We believe that a balanced pipeline of product candidates should focus on both validated targets as well as novel targets designed to address tumor escape mechanisms. CTLA-4 and PD-1 antagonists are recognized as the first clinically validated immunotherapy combination. These, in combination with innovative immunomodulatory antibodies or immune education vaccines, could be a focal point of the next generation of I-O combinations. Therefore, we plan to develop, register and launch our proprietary antibodies targeting PD-1 and CTLA-4 aggressively through the clinic and expand with novel combination therapies designed to improve clinical response and the durability of response of existing therapies.

Our Strategy
 Our strategy is to bring innovative combination therapies for cancer patients to substantially expand the patient population benefiting from current I-O therapies. Our diverse pipeline of antibodies, vaccines and adjuvants enable us to pursue optimal combinations for optimal efficacy. We are pursuing a tiered risk profile and targeting compressed timelines for regulatory filings. In 2018, we met with the FDA and expect that each of our lead anti-CTLA-4 (AGEN1884) and anti-PD-1 (AGEN2034) trials are designed to support a BLA filing in second-line cervical cancer as early as 2020. We believe that we are positioned to take advantage of accelerated pathways for approval with a relatively small number of patients and surrogate or short-term endpoints in our trials. In addition, we plan to pursue select indications to further expedite market entry. 
 Our strategy for our more novel, earlier stage programs include (i) pursuit of effective I-O antibody, vaccine and cell-therapy combinations with CTLA-4 and/or PD-1 targeted antibodies as the backbone and (ii) advancement of our differentiated antibody programs such as our bispecific programs, a next generation anti-CTLA-4, and differentiated CD137 and TIGIT antibodies. 
 Part of our strategy is to develop and commercialize some of our product candidates by continuing our existing arrangements with collaborators and licensees and by entering into new collaborations. We are also pursuing novel financial mechanisms to support programs such as AGEN2034, including our recently announced launch of Biotech Electronic Security Tokens (BEST). See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Tokens.”
 Our Assets
 Our I-O assets include antibody-based therapeutics, cancer vaccine platforms and adjuvants. Our proprietary CTLA-4 and PD-1 antagonists are in clinical development; we are one of only a few companies to have proprietary anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 antibodies in clinical combinations.  
 To complement our portfolio of foundational CPMs, we and our partners have pre-clinical antibodies targeting tumor escape mechanisms and therapeutic resistance. These include potential best-in-class and first-in-class assets such as our next-generation anti-CTLA-4 (AGEN1181) and TIGIT (AGEN1307), as well as CD137 (AGEN2373) and bispecific antibodies that are partnered with Gilead.
 Further, our neoantigen vaccine platforms include: (i) Individualized AutoSynVax™ (ASV™), which targets the unique antigens expressed by a patient’s own tumor, and (ii) off-the-shelf (or pre-manufactured) PhosphoSynVax™ (PSV™), which targets antigens expressed across patients and tumors, thereby seeking to treat broader categories of patients. Our vaccines are powered by our proprietary adjuvant, QS-21 Stimulon®. We plan to evaluate ASV in combination with checkpoint antibodies in 2019 and we are advancing preclinical development of PSV.
 Our proprietary QS-21 Stimulon® is believed to be one of the most potent adjuvants known. QS-21 Stimulon® is a key component in several GSK vaccines, including GSK’s Shingrix, which has demonstrated greater than 90% efficacy, as well as the first ever malaria vaccine, Mosquirix®. Shingrix sales are substantially ahead of forecasts, making additional milestones from our royalty transaction with HCR much more likely. QS-21 is being used in numerous other clinical-stage vaccines, including our own cancer vaccines. Recently, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation awarded us a grant to develop an alternative, plant cell culture-based manufacturing process to ensure the continuous future supply of QS-21 Stimulon® adjuvant. 
 Our Antibody Discovery Platforms and CPM Programs
 Checkpoint antibodies regulate immune response against pathogens that invade the body and are achieving positive outcomes in a number of cancers that were untreatable only a few years ago. Two classes of checkpoint targets include:

1. | inhibitory checkpoints that help suppress an immune response in order to prevent excessive immune reaction resulting in undesired inflammation and/or auto-immunity, and
2. | stimulatory checkpoints that can enhance or amplify an antigen-specific immune response. 

 We possess a suite of antibody discovery platforms that are designed to drive the discovery of future CPM antibody candidates.  We are planning to employ a variety of techniques to identify and optimize mono-specific and multi-specific antibody candidates, internally. 
 Our anti-CTLA-4 and anti-PD-1 programs (AGEN1884 and AGEN2034, respectively) are in clinical trials that included a Phase 1 dose escalation with expansion cohorts in multiple solid tumors. These molecules are now in expansion trials with both anti-PD-1 monotherapy and anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 combination trials for patients with second-line cervical cancer that are designed to support one or more BLA filings as soon as 2020. In 2018, we presented data on our AGEN1884 and AGEN2034 programs at major oncology conferences, including the American Society of Clinical Oncology (“ASCO”) conference in June 2018 and the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) congress in October 2018. In addition, we presented pre-clinical data on our Gilead-partnered anti-CD137 (AGEN2373), and our Incyte-partnered programs anti-TIM-3 and anti-LAG-3 antibodies at the American Association for Cancer Research (“AACR”) conference in April 2018 and the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (“SITC”) conference in November 2018. Our early clinical data demonstrated a clinical benefit (i.e., complete response, partial response or disease 
 4

stabilization) in more than 60% of patients treated with AGEN1884 and AGEN2034. 
 As of our latest data update in the fourth quarter of 2018, we have reported the following:
  
• | We treated more than 140 patients with AGEN1884 and/or AGEN2034 and observed clinical benefit in more than 60% of them
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | In our AGEN2034 (anti-PD-1) monotherapy trial, 68% of evaluable patients with metastatic and/or locally advanced solid tumors experienced clinical benefit. We presented data showing that:
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Among 38 subjects from Phase 1 of the study, three patients displayed partial response to therapy (i.e., tumors shrunk) and 23 patients displayed stable disease (i.e., tumor size was unchanged) during the follow-up period (median of 191 days or 27 weeks).
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | In the ongoing Phase 2 expansion portion of this study (NCT03104699) in advanced refractory cervical cancer, three out of seven (43%) of evaluable patients experienced a clinical benefit as of July 2018. Data continues to accumulate.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | AGEN2034 appeared to be clinically active and well-tolerated.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


• | In our AGEN2034 (anti-PD-1) plus AGEN1884 (anti-CTLA-4) combination trial, 63% of patients with ovarian, breast, and soft tissue sarcomas showed clinical benefit, including an objective durable response in a patient with ovarian cancer.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  With respect to our novel discovery pipeline, our most advanced asset is our next generation anti-CTLA-4 antibody, an IgG1 anti-CTLA-4 antagonist.  Based on preclinical data, we believe that this molecule has potential advantages over competing anti-CTLA-4 molecules, including: 
 (1) potential to induce enhanced T cell priming via the engineered Fc region, as T cell priming is a crucial step in generating potent immune responses against cancer, 
 (2) increased potential to deplete intratumoral regulatory T cells, which represent a significant barrier to successful anti-cancer immune responses, 
 (3) better combination potential with other antitumor or immunomodulatory antibodies, vaccines, and targeted therapies and 
 (4) potential therapeutic benefit to a wider patient population, including the estimated 40% of patients who are unlikely to fully benefit from the first generation CTLA-4 therapies due to a genetic predisposition.
 We filed an IND for AGEN1181 in the fourth quarter of 2018 and expect to initiate clinical trials in 2019.
 Partnered CPM Programs
 In December 2018, we entered into a series of agreements with Gilead Sciences, Inc. (“Gilead”) to collaborate on the development and commercialization of up to five novel I-O therapies. Pursuant to the collaboration agreements, we received an upfront cash payment from Gilead of $120.0 million following the closing in January 2019 and are eligible to receive up to an additional $1.7 billion in aggregate potential fees and milestones. At closing, Gilead received worldwide exclusive rights to our bispecific antibody, AGEN1423. Gilead also received the exclusive option to license exclusively AGEN1223, a bispecific antibody, and AGEN2373, a monospecific antibody. We recently filed INDs for AGEN1423 and AGEN1223 and are planning to file an IND for AGEN2373 in the first half of 2019. We are responsible for developing the option programs up to the option decision points, at which time Gilead may acquire exclusive rights to the programs on option exercise. For either, but not both, of the option programs, we have the right to opt-in to share Gilead’s development and commercialization costs in the United States in exchange for a profit (loss) share on a 50:50 basis and revised milestone payments. Gilead also received the right of first negotiation for two additional, undisclosed preclinical programs. At the closing, Gilead also purchased 11,111,111 shares of Agenus common stock for $30.0 million pursuant to a stock purchase agreement.
 In January 2015, we entered into a collaboration with Incyte Corporation (“Incyte”) to discover, develop and commercialize novel immuno-therapeutics using our antibody platforms. The collaboration was initially focused on four CPM programs targeting GITR, OX40, TIM-3 and LAG-3, and in November 2015, we expanded the alliance by adding three novel undisclosed CPM targets. Pursuant to the terms of the original agreement, Incyte paid us $25.0 million in upfront cash. Targets under the collaboration were designated as either profit-share programs, where the parties shared all costs and profits equally, or royalty-bearing programs, where Incyte funded all costs, and we were eligible to receive milestones and royalties. Under the original collaboration agreement, programs targeting GITR, OX40 and two of the undisclosed targets were designated as profit-share programs, while the other targets were royalty-bearing programs. For each profit-share product, we were eligible to receive up to $20.0 million in future contingent development milestones. For each royalty-bearing product, we were eligible to receive (i) up to $155.0 million in future contingent development, regulatory, and commercialization milestones and (ii) tiered royalties on global net sales at rates generally ranging from 6%-12%. Concurrent with the execution of the original collaboration agreement, we and Incyte also entered into a stock purchase agreement pursuant to which Incyte purchased approximately 7.76 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $35.0 million. In February 2017, we and Incyte amended the terms of the original collaboration agreement to, among other things, convert the GITR and OX40 programs from profit-share to royalty-bearing programs with royalties on global net sales at a flat 
 5

15% rate for each. In addition, the profit-share programs relating to two undisclosed targets were removed from the collaboration, with one reverting to Incyte and one to Agenus (the latter being our TIGIT antibody program), each with royalties on global net sales at a flat 15% rate. The remaining three royalty-bearing programs in the collaboration targeting TIM-3, LAG-3 and one undisclosed target remain unchanged, and there are no more profit-share programs under the collaboration. Pursuant to the amended agreement, we received accelerated milestone payments of $20.0 million from Incyte related to the clinical development of INCAGN1876 (anti-GITR agonist) and INCAGN1949 (anti-OX40 agonist). Concurrent with the execution of the amendment agreement, we and Incyte entered into a separate stock purchase agreement whereby Incyte purchased an additional 10 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $60.0 million. Incyte advanced both INCAGN1876 (anti-GITR agonist) and INCAGN1949 (anti-OX40 agonist) into the clinic in 2016. INCAGN1876 is currently in a Phase 1/2 trial exploring its safety, tolerability, and efficacy in combination with immune therapies, ipilimumab and nivolumab, in advanced or metastatic malignancies such as advanced or metastatic endometrial cancer, gastric cancer (including stomach, esophageal, and gastroesophageal junction), and squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. INCAGN1949 is currently in a Phase 1/2 trial exploring its safety, tolerability, and efficacy in combination with immune therapies, ipilimumab and nivolumab, in advanced or metastatic malignancies such as advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma or RCC. In 2018, Incyte initiated clinical trials for their INCAGN2385 (LAG-3) and INCAGN2390 (TIM-3) programs.
 In April 2014, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Merck to discover and optimize fully-human antibodies against two undisclosed CPM targets. In 2016, Merck selected a lead product candidate against one of the undisclosed targets to advance into preclinical studies, and subsequently initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial with the undisclosed antibody in August 2018. Under the terms of the agreement, Merck is responsible for all future product development expenses for the selected antibody candidate, and Agenus is eligible to receive up to $95.0 million in potential milestones plus royalties on any future sales.
 On September 20, 2018, we, through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Agenus Royalty Fund, LLC, entered into a Royalty Purchase Agreement (the “XOMA Royalty Purchase Agreement”) with XOMA (US) LLC (“XOMA US”). Pursuant to the terms of the XOMA Royalty Purchase Agreement, XOMA US paid us $15.0 million at closing in exchange for the right to receive 33% of the future royalties and 10% of the future milestones that we are entitled to receive from Incyte and Merck, net of certain of our obligations to a third party and excluding the milestone we received from Incyte in the fourth quarter of 2018. After taking into account our obligations under the XOMA Royalty Purchase Agreement, as of December 31, 2018, we remain eligible to receive up to $450.0 million and $85.5 million in potential development, regulatory and commercial milestones from Incyte and Merck, respectively.
 We also have a collaboration agreement with Recepta Biopharma SA for the development of our antibodies targeting CTLA-4 and PD-1, which gives Recepta certain rights to South American countries. We expect to continue exploring additional future collaborations.
 Vaccine Platforms
 Our current vaccine platforms for the treatment of cancer, and potentially other indications, include our HSP based Prophage vaccine candidates, and our fully synthetic, neoantigen vaccine candidates, ASV and PSV.
 HSPs are a group of proteins present at high levels in most mammalian cells. Their expression is increased when cells are exposed to elevated temperatures or other stresses. A potential role for HSPs in regulating immune responses was revealed when it was first discovered that HSP complexes purified from cancer cells produced immunity to cancer, whereas HSP complexes purified from normal tissue did not. This discovery led to the understanding that HSPs bind to and carry a broad sampling of the protein environment within cells, including mutant proteins that might arise from genetic mutations within cancer cells. It was further shown that immunization with HSP complexes purified from tumors generate both CD4 and CD8 positive T-cell immune responses. These activated T-cells target the cancer cells of the tumor, from which the HSP complexes were derived, for destruction. Thus, HSP complexes isolated from cancer cells may be particularly helpful in mediating successful immunization. Since HSPs are expressed in all tumor cells, the approach of immunizing with the HSP complexes isolated from a particular tumor may be broadly applicable to a variety of cancer types. We believe that we pioneered the use of gp96, an HSP, purified from a patient’s own tumor tissue, as a way to make I-O vaccine candidates. 
     Prophage Vaccine Candidates
 Our early vaccine technology, Prophage (HSPPC-96), is an autologous cancer vaccine therapy derived from cancer tissues that are surgically removed from an individual patient designed to contain a broad sampling of potentially antigenic mutant proteins to educate the patient’s immune system to seek out and destroy cancer. To date, more than 1,000 patients have been treated with Prophage. Data reported at ASCO in 2015 demonstrated that patients with newly diagnosed GBM (ndGBM) with lower immune suppression (measured by peripheral PD-L1 expression) had an improved response to vaccine. To further explore these findings, we announced a Phase 2 clinical trial collaboration with the National Cancer Institute (“NCI”) to evaluate Prophage in combination with pembrolizumab (Keytruda®). The trial is being conducted by the Brain Tumor Trials Collaborative (“BTTC”), led by Dr. Mark Gilbert, Chief of the Neuro-Oncology Branch at the NCI Center for Cancer Research with product provided by Agenus and Merck. The trial is ongoing.

    Neoantigen Vaccine Platforms
 Our neoantigen vaccine platforms include: (i) individualized AutoSynVax™ (ASV™), which targets the unique antigens expressed by a patient’s own tumor, and (ii) off-the-shelf (or pre-manufactured) PhosphoSynVax™ (PSV™), which targets antigens expressed across patients and tumors, potentially enabling us to treat broader categories of patients. 
 Our neoantigen vaccines are designed with unique features, intending to confer important advantages: (1) proprietary methods to develop an effective and relevant “Blueprint” of immunogenic neoantigens for each patient; (2) HSPs to efficiently deliver neoantigens to the right immune cells to activate an anti-cancer immune response. Our proprietary linker technology is designed to enable efficient neoantigen loading for a robust cancer specific immune response with significantly less peptide; and (3) QS-21 Stimulon® adjuvant, a potent immune stimulator now in GSK’s commercial shingles vaccine, Shingrix.
 Mutation-based neo-epitopes, which will form the basis for the immunogens used in ASV, appear to be almost always particular to a given patient. Therefore, ASV is a largely individualized vaccine product candidate. With a small amount of a patient’s tumor as a sample, our ASV program is designed to utilize next generation sequencing technologies coupled with complex bioinformatics algorithms to identify mutations in a tumor’s DNA and RNA. Once these mutations have been identified, we plan to manufacture synthetic peptides encoding these neoepitopes, load these peptides on to our recombinant HSP70 and deliver a fully synthetic polyvalent vaccine to the patient. This program is based on the hypothesis that the HSP70 platform would shuttle the mutated peptides to sites where they could be recognized by the immune system and elicit a cytotoxic and helper T cell response in patients with cancer. 
 Biochemically based neoantigens, such as those arising from dysregulated phosphorylation of various proteins in malignant cells, can serve as a tumor fingerprint across a broad histology of tumors. Through our acquisition of PhosImmune, we have a portfolio of proprietary phosphorylated antigenic targets that can be used for therapeutic development. PSV is a vaccine candidate designed to induce immunity against this novel class of tumor specific neoepitopes known as Phosphopeptides (“PTTs”). PSV is intended to induce cellular immunity to abnormal phosphopeptide neoepitopes that are characteristic of these various forms of cancer. We believe PTTs are among the most promising candidates for anti-cancer immunity, as patients with PTT immunity have been shown to have better outcomes than those without PTT immunity. We have amassed a proprietary library of more than 2,000 PTTs. Many of these PTTs are shared among many cancer patients and across multiple tumor types. We are using these PTTs for developing multiple off-the-shelf vaccines. PSV is based on our vaccine platform and includes our proprietary QS-21 Stimulon adjuvant and heat-shock protein backbone. We are developing multiple indication-specific PSV offerings, with lead programs in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and colorectal cancer (CRC). By leveraging our proprietary vaccine platform which has already demonstrated clinical safety and immunogenicity, we intend to advance at least one PSV formulation into the clinic in 2019.
     QS-21 Stimulon Adjuvant
 QS-21 Stimulon is an adjuvant, which is a substance added to a vaccine or other immunotherapy that is intended to enhance an immune response to the target antigens. QS-21 Stimulon is a natural product, a triterpene glycoside, or saponin, purified from the bark of the Chilean soapbark tree, Quillaja saponaria. QS-21 Stimulon has the ability to stimulate an antibody-mediated immune response and has also been shown to activate cellular immunity. It has become a key component in the development of investigational preventive vaccine formulations across a wide variety of diseases. These studies have been carried out by academic institutions and pharmaceutical companies in the United States and internationally. A number of these studies have shown QS-21 Stimulon to be significantly more effective in stimulating immune responses than aluminum hydroxide or aluminum phosphate, the adjuvants most commonly used in approved vaccines in the United States today. In January 2019, we announced that the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation awarded us a grant to develop an alternative, plant cell culture-based manufacturing process to ensure the continuous future supply of QS-21 Stimulon adjuvant.
    Partnered QS-21 Stimulon Programs
 In 2006, we entered into a license agreement and a supply agreement with GSK for the use of QS-21 Stimulon (the “GSK License Agreement” and the “GSK Supply Agreement,” respectively). In 2009, we entered into an Amended and Restated Manufacturing Technology Transfer and Supply Agreement (the “Amended GSK Supply Agreement”) under which GSK has the right to manufacture all of its requirements of commercial grade QS-21 Stimulon. GSK is obligated to supply us, or our affiliates, licensees, or customers, certain quantities of commercial grade QS-21 Stimulon for a stated period of time. In March 2012, we entered into a First Right to Negotiate and Amendment Agreement amending the GSK License Agreement and the Amended GSK Supply Agreement to clarify and include additional rights for the use of QS-21 Stimulon (the “GSK First Right to Negotiate Agreement”). In addition, we granted GSK the first right to negotiate for the purchase of Agenus or certain of our assets, which expired in March 2017. As consideration for entering into the GSK First Right to Negotiate Agreement, GSK paid us an upfront cash payment of $9.0 million, $2.5 million of which was creditable toward future royalty payments. We refer to the GSK License Agreement, the Amended GSK Supply Agreement and the GSK First Right to Negotiate Agreement collectively as the GSK Agreements. In 2017, we received a final milestone payment of $1.0 million from GSK and are no longer entitled to any additional milestone payments under the GSK Agreements. Under the terms of the Agreement, we are generally entitled to receive a 2% royalty on net sales of prophylactic vaccines for a period of 10 years after the first commercial sale of a resulting GSK product, which was triggered with GSK’s first commercial sale of Shingrix in 2017. Notably, we have already monetized and sold this entire royalty stream as discussed in more detail below. 
 7

The GSK License and Amended GSK Supply Agreements may be terminated by either party upon a material breach if the breach is not cured within the time specified in the respective agreement. The termination or expiration of the GSK License Agreement does not relieve either party from any obligation which accrued prior to the termination or expiration. Among other provisions, the license rights granted to GSK survive expiration of the GSK License Agreement. The license rights and payment obligations of GSK under the Amended GSK Supply Agreement survive termination or expiration, except that GSK's license rights and future royalty obligations do not survive if we terminate due to GSK's material breach unless we elect otherwise. We do not incur clinical development costs for products partnered with GSK.
 In September 2015, we monetized a portion of the royalties associated with the GSK License Agreement to an investor group led by Oberland Capital Management for up to $115.0 million in the form of a non-dilutive royalty transaction. Under the terms of a note purchase agreement with the investor group (the “Note Purchase Agreement”), we received $100.0 million at closing for which the investors had the right to receive 100% of our worldwide royalties under the GSK License Agreement on sales of GSK’s Shingrix and malaria (RTS,S) prophylactic vaccine products that contain our QS-21 Stimulon adjuvant to pay down principle and interest. In November 2017, and pursuant to the Note Purchase Agreement, we received an additional $15.0 million in cash from the investors based on the approval of Shingrix by the FDA. Pursuant to the terms of this transaction, we retained the right to receive all royalties from GSK after all principal, interest and other obligations were satisfied under the Note Purchase Agreement. The Note Purchase Agreement also allowed us to buy back the loan and extinguish the notes early under pre-specified terms, which we did in January 2018.
 In January 2018, we sold 100% of all royalties we were entitled to receive from GSK to Healthcare Royalty Partners III, L.P. and certain of its affiliates (collectively, “HCR”) and used the proceeds to extinguish the debt under the Note Purchase Agreement. HCR paid approximately $190.0 million at closing for the royalty rights, of which approximately $161.9 was used to extinguish the prior notes, yielding us approximately $28.0 million in net proceeds. We are also entitled to receive up to $40.35 million in milestone payments from HCR based on sales of GSK’s vaccines as follows: (i) $15.1 million upon reaching $2.0 billion last-twelve-months net sales any time prior to 2024 and (ii) $25.25 million upon reaching $2.75 billion last-twelve-months net sales any time prior to 2026. We would owe a reverse milestone payment of approximately $25.9 million to HCR in 2021 if neither of the following sales milestones are achieved: (i) 2019 sales of the GSK vaccines exceed $1.0 billion or (ii) 2020 sales of the GSK vaccines exceed $1.75 billion (the “Rebate Payment”). As part of the transaction, we provided a guaranty for the potential Rebate Payment and secured the obligation with substantially all of our assets pursuant to a security agreement, subject to certain customary exceptions and excluding all assets necessary for AgenTus Therapeutics, Inc. In February 2019, GSK reported that Shingrix sales for 2018, its first full year on the market, were over $1.0 billion.  
 Manufacturing
 Manufacturing CPM Antibodies
 In December 2015, we acquired an antibody manufacturing pilot plant in Berkeley, CA from XOMA Corporation (“XOMA”), which we refer to as “Agenus West.” A team of former XOMA employees with valuable chemistry, manufacturing and controls experience joined us and continue to operate the facility. In addition, in February 2017, we amended our collaboration with Incyte, transferring manufacturing responsibilities for all antibodies under the collaboration to them. This includes antibodies targeting GITR, OX40, TIM-3, LAG-3 and one undisclosed target. We have transferred the manufacturing know how to Incyte to support these endeavors and allow Agenus to focus on the manufacture of antibodies for some of our own CPM programs and those of existing and potential third-party collaborators. Since the acquisition of Agenus West, we have made significant improvements in the plant, and added additional headcount increasing both scale and capacity. Agenus West is currently producing antibody drug substance for our lead programs. We have been able to deliver clinical grade material from research cell banks in approximately four months, which we believe to be three to four times faster than the industry average. Agenus West utilizes cutting-edge technology platforms, enabling us to be self-reliant and giving us the advantage of manufacturing speed, cost efficiency, operational flexibility and manufacturing technology transfer to commercial scale partners—all with desired product quality, with the ultimate goal of benefiting patients.
Manufacturing Cancer Vaccines
 We manufacture our cancer vaccine candidates in our Lexington, MA facility.
 Each Prophage vaccine is manufactured using a patient’s own tumor. After the patient undergoes surgery to remove cancerous tumor tissue, the tumor is shipped frozen in a specially designed kit provided by us to our Lexington, Massachusetts facility. The turnaround time from the date of surgery to delivery of vaccine is approximately three to four weeks, which generally fits well with the patient’s recovery time from surgery.
 ASV and PSV vaccine candidates are manufactured using HSP70 loaded with synthetic peptide synthesized by approved manufacturers. The sequence of the peptides is determined by sequencing and analysis of patient and tumor DNA and RNA and run through complex algorithms by our bioinformatics group who have specialized knowledge of the attributes required to elicit immune responsiveness. This process takes several weeks, after which the manufactured vaccine undergoes extensive quality testing, including sterility testing, which takes a further two weeks.

We have established, within a single facility, well-defined, cost efficient vaccine manufacturing under GMPs, including bioanalytical, quality control and quality assurance, logistics, distribution and supply chain management. After manufacturing, Prophage and ASV vaccine candidates are tested and released by our analytical and quality systems staff. The quality control organization performs a series of release assays designed to ensure that the product meets all applicable specifications. Our quality assurance staff also reviews manufacturing and quality control records prior to batch release in an effort to assure conformance with current GMP (“cGMP”) as mandated by the FDA and foreign regulatory agencies.
 Our manufacturing staff is trained and routinely evaluated for conformance to rigorous manufacturing procedures and quality standards. This oversight is intended to ensure compliance with FDA and foreign regulations and to provide consistent vaccine output. Our quality control and quality assurance staff is similarly trained and evaluated as part of our effort to ensure consistency in the testing and release of the product, as well as consistency in materials, equipment and facilities.
 QS-21 Stimulon
 Except in the case of GSK, we have retained worldwide manufacturing rights for QS-21 Stimulon, and we have the right to subcontract manufacturing for QS-21 Stimulon. In addition, under the terms of our agreement with GSK, upon request by us, GSK is committed to supply certain quantities of commercial grade QS-21 Stimulon to us and our licensees for a fixed period of time.
Intellectual Property Portfolio 
 We seek to protect our technologies through a combination of patents, trade secrets and know-how, and we currently own, co-own or have exclusive rights to approximately 25 issued United States patents and approximately 75 issued foreign patents. We also own, co-own or have exclusive rights to approximately 35 pending United States patent applications and approximately 180 pending foreign patent applications. We may not have rights in all territories where we may pursue regulatory approval for our product candidates.
  Through various acquisitions, we own, co-own, or have exclusive rights to a number of patents and patent applications directed to various methods and compositions, including methods for identifying therapeutic antibodies and product candidates arising out of such entities’ technology platforms. In particular, we own patents and patent applications relating to our Retrocyte Display technology platform, a high throughput antibody expression platform for the identification of fully-human and humanized monoclonal antibodies. This patent family is projected to expire between 2029 and 2031. We own, co-own, or have exclusive rights to patents and patent applications directed to various methods and compositions, including a patent directed to methods for identifying phosphorylated proteins using mass spectrometry. This patent is projected to expire in 2023. In addition, as we advance our research and development efforts with our institutional and corporate collaborators, we are seeking patent protection for certain newly identified therapeutic antibodies and product candidates. We can provide no assurance that any of our patents, including the patents that we acquired or in-licensed, will have commercial value, or that any of our existing or future patent applications, including the patent applications that were acquired or in-licensed, will result in the issuance of valid and enforceable patents. Our issued patents covering Prophage vaccine and methods of use thereof, alone or in combination with other agents, expired or will expire at various dates between 2015 and 2024. In particular, our issued U.S. patents covering Prophage composition of matter expired in 2015. In addition, our issued patents covering QS-21 Stimulon composition of matter expired in 2008. We continue to explore means of extending the life cycle of our patent portfolio. 
 Various patents and patent applications have been exclusively licensed to us by the following entities:
 University of Virginia
 In connection with our acquisition of PhosImmune in December 2015, we obtained exclusive rights to a portfolio of patent applications and one issued patent relating to PTTs under a patent license agreement with the University of Virginia (“UVA”). The UVA license gives us exclusive rights to develop and commercialize the PTT technology. Under the license agreement, we will pay low to mid-single digit running royalties on net sales of PTT products, and a modest flat percentage of sublicensing income. In addition, we may be obligated to make milestone payments of up to $2.7 million for each indication of a licensed PTT product to complete clinical trials and achieve certain sales thresholds. The term of the UVA license agreement ends when the last of the licensed patents expires or becomes no longer valid. The UVA license agreement may be terminated as follows: (i) by UVA in connection with our bankruptcy or cessation of business relating to the licensed technology, (ii) by UVA if we commit a material, uncured breach or (iii) by us for our convenience on 180 days written notice. 
Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research
 On December 5, 2014, our wholly-owned subsidiary, Agenus Switzerland Inc. (formerly known as 4-Antibody AG) (“4-AB”), entered into a license agreement with the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research Ltd. (“Ludwig”), which replaced and superseded a prior agreement entered into between the parties in May 2011. Pursuant to the terms of the license agreement, Ludwig granted 4-AB an exclusive, worldwide license under certain intellectual property rights of Ludwig and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center arising from the prior agreement to further develop and commercialize GITR, OX40 and TIM-3 antibodies. On January 25, 2016, we and 4-AB entered into a second license agreement with Ludwig, on substantially similar terms, to develop CTLA-4 and PD-1 
 9

antibodies. Pursuant to the December 2014 license agreement, 4-AB made an upfront payment of $1.0 million to Ludwig. The December 2014 license agreement also obligates 4-AB to make potential milestone payments of up to $20.0 million for events prior to regulatory approval of licensed GITR, OX40 and TIM-3 products, and potential milestone payments in excess of $80.0 million if such licensed products are approved in multiple jurisdictions, in more than one indication, and certain sales milestones are achieved. Under the January 2016 license agreement, we are obligated to make potential milestone payments of up to $12.0 million for events prior to regulatory approval of CTLA-4 and PD-1 licensed products, and potential milestone payments of up to $32.0 million if certain sales milestones are achieved. Under each of these license agreements, we and/or 4-AB will also be obligated to pay low to mid-single digit royalties on all net sales of licensed products during the royalty period, and to pay Ludwig a percentage of any sublicensing income, ranging from a low to mid-double digit percentage depending on various factors. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we paid a percentage of sublicensing income totaling $2.0 million to Ludwig under the license agreements. No payments were made during the year ended December 31, 2018. The license agreements may each be terminated as follows: (i) by either party if the other party commits a material, uncured breach; (ii) by either party if the other party initiates bankruptcy, liquidation or similar proceedings; or (iii) by 4-AB or us (as applicable) for convenience upon 90 days’ prior written notice. The license agreements also contain customary representations and warranties, mutual indemnification, confidentiality and arbitration provisions.
 University of Connecticut Health Center
 In May 2001, we entered into a license agreement with the University of Connecticut Health Center (“
UConn”) which was amended in March 2003 and June 2009. Through the license agreement, we obtained an exclusive, worldwide license to patent rights resulting from inventions discovered under a research agreement that was effective from February 1998 until December 2006. The term of the license agreement ends when the last of the licensed patents expires in 2028 or becomes no longer valid. UConn may terminate the agreement: (1) if, after 30 days written notice for breach, we continue to fail to make any payments due under the license agreement, or (2) we cease to carry on our business related to the patent rights or if we initiate or conduct actions in order to declare bankruptcy. We may terminate the agreement upon 90 days written notice. We are required to make royalty payments on any obligations created prior to the effective date of termination of the license agreement. Upon expiration or termination of the license agreement due to breach, we have the right to continue to manufacture and sell products covered under the license agreement which are considered to be works in progress for a period of six months. The license agreement contains aggregate milestone payments of approximately $1.2 million for each product we develop covered by the licensed patent rights. These milestone payments are contingent upon regulatory filings, regulatory approvals, and commercial sales of products. We have also agreed to pay UConn a royalty on the net sales of products covered by the license agreement as well as annual license maintenance fees beginning in May 2006. Royalties otherwise due on the net sales of products covered by the license agreement may be credited against the annual license maintenance fee obligations. Under the March 2003 amendment, we agreed to pay UConn an upfront payment and to make future payments for each patent or patent application with respect to which we exercised our option under the research agreement. As of December 31, 2018, we had paid approximately $1.0 million to UConn under the license agreement. The license agreement gives us complete discretion over the commercialization of products covered by the licensed patent rights but also requires us to use commercially reasonable diligent efforts to introduce commercial products within and outside the United States. If we fail to meet these diligence requirements, UConn may be able to terminate the license agreement.
Regulatory Compliance
 Governmental authorities in the United States and other countries extensively regulate the pre-clinical and clinical testing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, record keeping, advertising, promotion, export, marketing and distribution, among other things, of our investigational product candidates. In the United States, the FDA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the Public Health Service Act and other federal statutes and regulations, subject pharmaceutical products to rigorous review.
 In order to obtain approval of a new product from the FDA, we must, among other requirements, submit proof of safety and efficacy as well as detailed information on the manufacture and composition of the product. In most cases, this proof entails extensive pre-clinical, clinical, and laboratory tests. Before approving a new drug or marketing application, the FDA may also conduct pre-licensing inspections of the company, its contract research organizations and/or its clinical trial sites to ensure that clinical, safety, quality control, and other regulated activities are compliant with Good Clinical Practices (“GCP”), or Good Laboratory Practices (“GLP”), for specific non-clinical toxicology studies. The FDA may also require confirmatory trials, post-marketing testing, and extra surveillance to monitor the effects of approved products, or place conditions on any approvals that could restrict the commercial applications of these products. Once approved, the labeling, advertising, promotion, marketing, and distribution of a drug or biologic product must be in compliance with FDA regulatory requirements.
 In Phase 1 clinical trials, the sponsor tests the product in a small number of patients or healthy volunteers, primarily for safety at one or more doses. Phase 1 trials in cancer are often conducted with patients who have end-stage or metastatic cancer. In Phase 2, in addition to safety, the sponsor evaluates the efficacy of the product in a patient population somewhat larger than Phase 1 trials. Phase 3 trials typically involve additional testing for safety and clinical efficacy in an expanded population at geographically dispersed test sites. The FDA may order the temporary or permanent discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time.
 The sponsor must submit to the FDA the results of pre-clinical and clinical testing, together with, among other things, detailed information on the manufacture and composition of the product, in the form of a new drug application (“NDA”), or in the case of 
 10

biologics, a BLA. In a process that can take a year or more, the FDA reviews this application and, when and if it decides that adequate data are available to show that the new compound is both safe and effective for a particular indication and that other applicable requirements have been met, approves the drug or biologic for marketing.
 Whether or not we have obtained FDA approval, we must generally obtain approval of a product by comparable regulatory authorities of international jurisdictions prior to the commencement of marketing the product in those jurisdictions. We are also subject to cGMP, GCP, and GLP compliance obligations and are subject to inspection by international regulatory authorities. International requirements may in some circumstances be more rigorous than U.S. requirements and may require additional investment in manufacturing process development, non-clinical studies, clinical studies, and record-keeping that are not required for U.S. regulatory compliance or approval. The time required to obtain this approval may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval and can also require significant resources in time, money and labor.
 Under the laws of the United States, the countries of the European Union and other nations, we and the institutions where we sponsor research are subject to obligations to ensure the protection of personal information of human subjects participating in our clinical trials. We have instituted procedures that we believe will enable us to comply with these requirements and the contractual requirements of our data sources. The laws and regulations in this area are evolving, and further regulation, if adopted, could affect the timing and the cost of future clinical development activities.
 We are also subject to regulation under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, and other current and potential future federal, state, or local regulations. Our research and development activities involve the controlled use of hazardous materials, chemicals, biological materials, various radioactive compounds, and for some experiments we use recombinant DNA. We believe that our procedures comply with the standards prescribed by local, state, and federal regulations; however, the risk of injury or accidental contamination cannot be completely eliminated. We conduct our activities in compliance with the National Institutes of Health Guidelines for Recombinant DNA Research.
 Additionally, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”), prohibits U.S. corporations and their representatives from offering, promising, authorizing or making payments to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business abroad. The scope of the FCPA includes interactions with certain healthcare professionals in many countries. Other countries have enacted similar anti-corruption laws and/or regulations.
 Competition
 Competition in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries is intense. Many pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies have products on the market and are actively engaged in the research and development of products for the treatment of cancer.
 Many competitors have substantially greater financial, manufacturing, marketing, sales, distribution, and technical resources, and more experience in research and development, clinical trials, and regulatory matters, than we do. Competing companies developing or acquiring rights to more efficacious therapeutic products for the same diseases we are targeting, or which offer significantly lower costs of treatment, could render our products noncompetitive or obsolete. See Part I-Item 1A. “Risk Factors-Risks Related to our Business-Our competitors may have superior products, manufacturing capability, selling and marketing expertise and/or financial and other resources.”
 Academic institutions, governmental agencies, and other public and private research institutions conduct significant amounts of research in biotechnology, medicinal chemistry and pharmacology. These entities have become increasingly active in seeking patent protection and licensing revenues for their research results. They also compete with us in recruiting and retaining skilled scientific talent.
 The CPM landscape is crowded with several competitors developing assets against a number of targets. Development plans are spread out across various indications and lines of therapy, either alone or in combination with other assets. Competitors range from small cap to large cap companies, with assets in pre-clinical or clinical stages of development. Therefore, the landscape is dynamic and constantly evolving. We and our partners have CPM antibody programs, currently in clinical stage development targeting PD-1, CTLA-4, GITR, OX40, TIM-3 and LAG-3. We are aware of many companies that have antibody-based products on the market or in clinical development that are directed to the same biological targets as these programs, including, without limitation, the following: (1) BMS markets ipilimumab, an anti-CTLA-4 antibody, and nivolumab, an anti-PD-1 antibody, and is developing additional antagonists to LAG-3 and TIM-3. BMS also has next generation anti-CTLA-4 antibodies in the clinic, which may be competitive to our next generation anti-CTLA-4 program, (2) Merck has an approved anti-PD-1 antibody, as well as anti-CTLA-4 and LAG-3 antagonists and an anti-GITR agonist in clinical development, (3) Regeneron has an approved anti-PD-1 antibody as well as antibodies targeting CTLA-4 and LAG-3 in preclinical or early clinical development, (4) AstraZeneca has an approved anti PD-L1 antibody, as well as an anti-CTLA-4 (using a different isotype, an IgG2 isotype) targeting antibody in the clinic, (5) Pfizer has an approved anti-PD-L1 (with Merck KgaA) as well as anti-PD-1, and anti-OX40 antibodies in clinical development, and (6) Roche/Genentech has an approved anti-PD-L1 antibody. Besides these PD-1 and PD-L1 antibodies that were approved in the U.S., we are also aware of competitors with approved PD-1 agents in ex-US geographies such as China. These include Innovent Biologics and Shanghai Junshi Biosciences. We are also aware of other competitors with PD-1/PD-L1 agents in clinical development, including but not limited to, AbbVie, Arcus 
 11

Biosciences, Boehringer Ingelheim, Tesaro, Beigene, Eli Lilly, Jiangsu HengRui Medicine, Macrogenics/Incyte, CytomX/BMS, Novartis, Symphogen, Jounce Therapeutics, Gilead Sciences, Janssen, CBT Pharmaceuticals/Genor Biopharma, Checkpoint Therapeutics, CStone Pharmaceuticals, Livzon MabPharm Inc, Suzhou Alphamab, Mabspace Biosciences, Henlix Biotech Inc., Akeso Biopharma and CSPC ZhongQi Pharmaceutical Technology. We are also aware of competitors with pre-clinical antibodies against PD-1 or PD-L1. In addition, we are aware of competitors with clinical stage antibodies against GITR, OX40, LAG-3, TIM-3 as well as our earlier stage programs such as TIGIT and CD137. As outlined above, some of these include, but are not limited to, BMS, Pfizer, Novartis, Merck, Tesaro, Regeneron, Eli Lilly, OncoMed, Boehringer Ingelheim, Potenza, Arcus Biosciences, GlaxoSmithKline, AbbVie, Leap Therapeutics and Symphogen. Additionally, we are aware of competitors developing preclinical assets and bispecifics against each of the above targets. There is no guarantee that our antibody product candidates will be able to compete with our competitors’ antibody products and product candidates. 
 We are conducting both single arm and combination trials in second line cervical cancer. We are aware that Merck’s PD-1 antagonist, Keytruda, has been approved in advanced cervical cancer. We are also aware of industry sponsored clinical trials, including exploratory studies that are underway in this setting. Clinical stage competitors include, but are not limited to, Regeneron (anti-PD-1), Ono Pharmaceuticals and BMS (anti-PD-1 alone or in combination with agents against other checkpoint targets), Seattle Genetics and Genmab (antibody drug conjugate targeting Tissue Factor), Iovance Biotherapeutics (autologous TILs), Genor Biopharma and Lee Pharmaceuticals. Additionally, we are aware of other early stage clinical trials testing alternate checkpoint targets in cervical cancer patients. These include, but are not limited to, OX40 +/- CD137 agonists (Pfizer) and anti-PD-1 + anti-ICOS (GSK/Merck).
  We have autologous vaccine programs in development including our Prophage vaccine in clinical development for GBM. We are aware of other therapeutic options in GBM that could compete with our vaccine, including but not limited to the following: Merck markets temozolomide for treatment of patients with ndGBM and refractory astrocytoma. Other companies are developing vaccines for the treatment of patients with ndGBM, including, but not limited to Northwest Biotherapeutics (DC-Vax), Mimivax Inc. (SurVaxM) and Annias Immunotherapeutics (CMV Vaccine). Other companies may begin development programs as well. We are advancing our neoantigen vaccine, AutoSynVax, in solid tumors.  There are companies advancing individualized or synthetic vaccine technologies and/or patient-specific medicine techniques that compete with our HSP based vaccines such as: Neon Therapeutics, Gritstone Oncology, Advaxis/Amgen, BioNTech, Moderna/Merck, Genocea Biosciences, ISA Pharmaceuticals, Nouscom, EpiVax Inc., and Vaccibody.
 In addition, and prior to regulatory approval, if ever, our vaccines and our other product candidates may compete for access to patients with other products in clinical development, with products approved for use in the indications we are studying, or with off-label use of products in the indications we are studying. We anticipate that we will face increased competition in the future as new companies enter markets we seek to address and scientific developments surrounding immunotherapy and other traditional cancer therapies continue to accelerate. 
 We are aware of compounds that claim to be comparable to QS-21 Stimulon that are being used in clinical trials. Several other vaccine adjuvants are in development or in use and could compete with QS-21 Stimulon for inclusion in vaccines. These adjuvants may include but are not limited to: (1) oligonucleotides, under development by Pfizer, Idera, and Dynavax, (2) MF59, under development by Novartis, (3) IC31, under development by Intercell (now part of Valneva), and (4) MPL, under development by GSK. In the past, we have provided QS-21 Stimulon to other entities under materials transfer arrangements. In at least one instance, it is possible that this material was used unlawfully to develop synthetic formulations and/or derivatives of QS-21. In addition, companies such as Adjuvance Technologies, Inc., CSL Limited, and Novavax, Inc., as well as academic institutions and manufacturers of saponin extracts, are developing saponin adjuvants, including derivatives and synthetic formulations. These sources may be competitive to our ability to execute future partnering and licensing arrangements involving QS-21 Stimulon. The existence of products developed by these and other competitors, or other products of which we are not aware, or which other companies may develop in the future, may adversely affect the marketability of products developed or sold using QS-21 Stimulon.
 We are also aware of a third party that manufactures pre-clinical material purporting to be comparable to QS-21 Stimulon. The claims being made by this third party may create marketplace confusion and have an adverse effect on the goodwill generated by us and our partners with respect to QS-21 Stimulon. We are also aware of at least two additional manufacturers of QS-21. Any diminution of this goodwill may have an adverse effect on our ability to commercialize future products, if any, incorporating this technology, either alone or with a third party.
 Employees
 As of February 28, 2019, we had 294 employees, of whom 90 were PhDs and three were MDs. None of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We believe that we have good relations with our employees.
Corporate History
 Antigenics L.L.C. was formed as a Delaware limited liability company in 1994 and was converted to Antigenics Inc., a Delaware corporation, in February 2000 in conjunction with our initial public offering of common stock. On January 6, 2011, we changed our name from Antigenics Inc. to Agenus Inc.
