ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 
In this Annual Report on Form 10-K (the “Form 10-K”), references to the “Company” and to “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to Tuscan Holdings Corp.
 
We are a blank check company formed under the laws of the State of Delaware on November 5, 2018. We were formed for the purpose of entering into a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or other similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities. Our efforts to identify a prospective target business will not be limited to a particular industry or geographic location, although we are currently focusing our search for target businesses in the cannabis industry.
 
In November 2018, we issued an aggregate of 5,750,000 shares of our common stock (“founders’ shares”) for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000, or approximately $0.004 per share, to our initial stockholders. In March 2019, we effectuated a stock dividend of 0.2 shares of common stock for each outstanding share of common stock, resulting in our initial stockholders holding an aggregate of 6,900,000 founders’ shares.
 
In November 2018, we also issued to designees of EarlyBirdCapital, Inc., the representative of the underwriters in our initial public offering (“IPO”), an aggregate of 300,000 shares of common stock (after giving effect to the stock dividend referred to above) (“representative shares”) at a price of $0.0001 per share.
 
On March 7, 2019, we consummated the IPO of 24,000,000 of its units. Each unit consists of one share of common stock and one redeemable warrant, with each warrant entitling the holder to purchase one share of common stock at a price of $11.50 per share. The units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds of $240,000,000.
 
Simultaneously with the consummation of the IPO, we consummated the private placement (“Private Placement”) of 615,000 Units (“Private Units”) at a price of $10.00 per Private Unit, generating total proceeds of $6,150,000. The Private Units were sold to Tuscan Holdings Acquisition LLC, our sponsor, and EarlyBirdCapital and its designee. The Private Units are identical to the units sold in the IPO, except that the warrants underlying the Private Units are non-redeemable and may be exercised on a cashless basis, in each case so long as they continue to be held by the initial purchasers or their permitted transferees.
 
On March 12, 2019, we consummated the sale of an additional 3,600,000 units that were subject to the underwriters’ over-allotment option at $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $36,000,000. Simultaneously with the closing of the sale of additional units, we consummated the sale of an additional 72,000 Private Units at $10.00 per Private Unit, generating total proceeds of $720,000. Following the closing of the over-allotment option and sale of additional Private Units, an aggregate amount of $276,000,000 has been placed in the trust account established in connection with the IPO.
 
Transaction costs amounted to $6,059,098, consisting of $5,520,000 of underwriting fees and $539,098 of other offering costs. In addition, $809,840 of cash was held outside of the trust account established in connection with the IPO and is available for working capital purposes.
 
As a result of the underwriters’ exercise of the over-allotment option in full, 900,000 founder shares are no longer subject to forfeiture.
