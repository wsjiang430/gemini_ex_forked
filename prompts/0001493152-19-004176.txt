ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS.
1. Organizational History
 
The Company was formed as a limited liability company under the laws of the State of New York on June 17, 2005 as “Vycor Medical LLC”. On August 14, 2007, we converted into a Delaware corporation and changed our name to “Vycor Medical, Inc.”. The Company’s listing went effective on February 2009 and on November 29, 2010 Vycor completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of NovaVision, Inc. (“NovaVision”) and on January 4, 2012 Vycor, through its wholly-owned NovaVision subsidiary, completed the acquisition of all the shares of Sight Science Limited (“Sight Science”), a previous competitor to NovaVision.
2. Overview of Business
 
Vycor is dedicated to providing the medical community with innovative and superior surgical and therapeutic solutions and operates two distinct business units within the medical device industry. Vycor Medical designs, develops and markets medical devices for use in neurosurgery. NovaVision provides non-invasive rehabilitation therapies for those who have vision disorders resulting from neurological brain damage such as that caused by a stroke. Both businesses adopt a minimally or non-invasive approach. Both technologies have strong sales growth potential, address large potential markets and have the requisite regulatory approvals. The Company has 68 issued or allowed patents and a further 6 pending. The Company leverages joint resources across the divisions to operate in a cost-efficient manner.
 
The Company periodically engages in discussions with potential strategic partners for or purchasers of each or both of our operating divisions.

Vycor Medical
 
Vycor Medical designs, develops and markets medical devices for use in neurosurgery. Vycor Medical’s ViewSite Brain Access System (“VBAS”) is a next generation retraction and access system that was fully commercialized in early 2010 and is the first significant technological change to brain tissue retraction in over 50 years in contrast to significant development in most other neuro-surgical technologies. Vycor Medical is ISO 13485:2016 certified and MDSAP (Medical Device Single Audit Program), and VBAS has U.S. FDA 510(k) clearance and CE Marking for Europe (Class III) for brain and spine surgeries, and regulatory approvals in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Korea, Japan, Russia and Taiwan.
 
NovaVision
 
NovaVision provides non-invasive, computer-based rehabilitation targeted at a substantial and largely un-addressed market of people who have lost their sight as a result of stroke or other brain injury, and has 45 granted patents.
 
Competition
 
The VBAS device is both a brain access system and a retractor and is therefore unique with no direct competitors. Competitive manufacturers of brain retractors include Cardinal Health (V. Mueller line), Aesculap, Integra Life Science and Codman (Division of Johnson & Johnson). Nico Corporation has a brain access device specifically designed to work with its Myriad resection and suction product.
 
NovaVision provides restoration therapies (VRT and NeET) and compensation or saccadic therapies (NeuroEyeCoach) for those suffering vision loss as a result of neurological trauma. The other therapy type for this condition is substitution (optical aids such as prisms) and is not considered by NovaVision as competition. In restoration, there are a few very small companies or entities offering some form of vision rehabilitation product in Germany. Within compensation there are no real direct competitors. Other companies in the general rehabilitation space include RevitalVision, PositScience and Dynavision. In the professional market, NovaVision competes with aggregator products or those that provide a range of non-specific therapies, such a Rehacom, Sanet Vision Integrator and Bioness BITS. NovaVision’s products are dedicated to vision.

Strategy
 
The Company is executing on a plan to achieve a reduction in cash operating losses1 and, while operating expenses are generally greater in the first two quarters, the Company generated a cash operating profit1 in both the 3rd and 4th quarters. For Vycor Medical this plan includes in particular: increasing market penetration in the US through targeted focus group programs with surgeons, closer cooperation with complementary product manufacturers and tight management of the distribution network; increasing international growth particularly in Europe and other territories where we are not represented or under represented; and continued new product development. The first phase of modification of the existing VBAS product range to make it more easy to use with the most common IGS systems was completed in September 2017 and has been well received by surgeons; we are continuing our roll-out of this model through hospital inventories. The second phase of the development of further IGS integration will be completed in 2019. We will also be exploring with surgeons and focus groups additional selected development work targeted at increasing the ease and applicability of our products to common procedures. For NovaVision, given the company’s resources, and the large size and diversity of its end markets, we believe that the most efficient way to tackle the distribution of its broad range of patient and professional products is by partnering with entities that have either direct access to the end users or established distribution channels in the various target markets and the financial resources to market and distribute the products effectively. The Company is in the process of identifying and talking to such partners. The range of alternatives for NovaVision could comprise distribution and marketing partnerships, licensing, merger, sale and/or a significant restructuring of its activities.

Vycor Medical uses a sub-contract manufacturer to manufacture, package, label and sterilize its VBAS products. The Company has migrated all its VBAS manufacturing to Life Science Outsourcing, Inc. in Brea, California that is FDA-registered and meets ISO standards and certifications.

Government Regulations
 
We are committed to an integrated total quality management system. We believe that we have completed the necessary procedures and Vycor Medical is certified to the ISO standards expected of medical device manufacturers as follows:
ISO 13485:2016 Medical Devices — Quality Management Systems
 
The certification of a quality management system to ISO 1348:20165, specifically for medical devices, is advantageous and often essential for medical companies to export their products to the global market, as well as maintain and enter into certain agreements and business growth opportunities within the U.S. For example, Canada requires that medical device manufacturers marketing their products in Canada must have a quality system certified to ISO 13485:2016 and from January 1, 2019 also be certified to MDSAP. The certification is also required for placement of branded devices into the European Union.
 
Vycor Medical has the following certification/licensing:
 

● | ISO 13485.2016 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | MDSAP (Medical Device Single Audit Program) 
● | Fully Quality Assurance System Directive 93/42/EEC for Medical Devices, Annex II (3) 
● | EC Design-Examination Certificate Directive 93/42/EEC for Medical Devices, Annex II (4) 

 
Vycor Medical’s products have been classified as Class II products by the FDA and cleared for marketing through the 510(k) process. NovaVision’s VRT product has been cleared as a Class U product through the 510(k) while its NeuroEyeCoach is registered as an exempt Class 1 device.
 
Vycor Medical has CE marking approval to allow for distribution of its VBAS products in Europe as a Class III device and has a Health Canada Medical Device License (MDL) for distribution in Canada as a Class II device. VBAS also has regulatory approvals in Australia, Brazil, China, Japan, Korea, Mexico and Russia. NovaVison’s VRT, NeuroEyeCoach and Sight Science’s NeET have CE mark registrations as Class I devices in Europe.
