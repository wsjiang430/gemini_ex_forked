ITEM 1.BUSINESS
General
    We are a diversified mineral company that delivers potassium, magnesium, sulfur, salt, and water products essential for customer success in agriculture, animal feed and the oil and gas industry. We are the only U.S. producer of muriate of potash (sometimes referred to as potassium chloride or potash), which is applied as an essential nutrient for healthy crop development, utilized in several industrial applications, and used as an ingredient in animal feed. In addition, we produce a specialty fertilizer, Trio®, which delivers three key nutrients, potassium, magnesium, and sulfate, in a single particle. We also provide water, magnesium chloride, brine and various oilfield products and services. 
Our extraction and production operations are conducted entirely in the continental U.S. We produce potash from three solution mining facilities: our HB solution mine in Carlsbad, New Mexico, our solution mine in Moab, Utah and our brine recovery mine in Wendover, Utah. We also operate our North compaction facility in Carlsbad, New Mexico, which compacts and granulates product from the HB mine. We produce Trio® from our conventional underground East mine in Carlsbad, New Mexico.
    We have permitted, licensed, declared and partially adjudicated water rights in New Mexico under which we sell water primarily to support oil and gas development in the Permian Basin near our Carlsbad facilities. We continue to work to expand our sales of water. In May 2019, we acquired certain land, water rights, state grazing leases for cattle, and other related assets from Dinwiddie Cattle Company. We refer to these assets and operations as "Intrepid South." Due to the strategic location of Intrepid South, part of our long-term operating strategy is selling small parcels of land, including restricted use agreements of surface or subsurface rights to customers, where such sales provide a solution to a customer's operations in the oil and gas industry.
    Our principal offices are located at 707 17th Street, Suite 4200, Denver, Colorado 80202, and our telephone number is (303) 296-3006. Intrepid was incorporated in Delaware in 2007. 
Our Products and Services
Our three primary products are potash, Trio®, and water. We also sell salt, magnesium chloride, metal recovery salts, brines, and water that are derived as part of our mining processes. Product sales as a percentage of total sales for the last three years were as follows:

 | Year Ended December 31,
 | 2022 | | 2021 | | 2020

Total | 100 | % | | 100 | % | 100 | %

Potash
We sell potash into three primary markets: the agricultural market as a fertilizer input, the industrial market as a component in drilling and fracturing fluids for oil and gas wells and an input to other industrial processes, and the animal feed market as a nutrient supplement. Potash is sold in different product sizes, such as granular, standard, and fine standard. The agricultural market predominately uses granular-sized potash, while the industrial and animal feed markets mostly use standard- and fine standard-sized product. We have the flexibility to produce all of our product in a granular form, which decreases our dependence on sales of any one particular size of potash and any particular market. 
We manage sales and marketing operations centrally. This allows us to evaluate the product needs of our customers and then centrally determine which of our production facilities is best suited, typically based on geographic location, to use to fill customer orders in a manner designed to realize the highest average net realized sales price per ton. Average net realized sales price per ton is a non-GAAP measure that we calculate as sales less byproduct sales and freight costs and then divided by product sales tons. We also monitor product inventory levels and overall production costs centrally. 
    During 2022, we supplied approximately 0.5% of annual world potassium consumption and approximately 3.5% of annual U.S. potassium consumption.
Substantially all of our potash is sold in the U.S., and many of our potash sales are geographically concentrated in the central and western U.S. Fertilizer sales are affected by weather and planting conditions in these regions, as well as farmer economics. For more information, please see "Seasonality." A significant portion of our industrial sales are derived from oil and gas customers and vary based on the price of potash, the availability and price of substitute products, and changes in industry preferences. 
Trio® 
    Trio® is our specialty fertilizer that delivers potassium, sulfate, and magnesium in a single particle and has the added benefit of being low in chloride. This unique combination of nutrients makes Trio® an attractive fertilizer across diverse crops and geographies. We produce Trio® in premium, granular, standard, and fine standard sizes for sale both domestically and internationally. 
Oilfield Solutions 
We have permitted, licensed, declared and partially adjudicated water rights in New Mexico under which we sell water primarily for industrial uses in the oil and gas services industry. In May 2019, we acquired certain land, water rights, state grazing leases for cattle, and other related assets from Dinwiddie Cattle Company that support oil and gas development in the Permian Basin in southeast New Mexico. Our other oilfield related products and service offerings include, but are not limited to, caliche, right-of-way agreements, surface damages and easements, and a produced water royalty. We refer to these assets and operations as "Intrepid South." Due to the strategic location of Intrepid South, part of our long-term operating strategy is selling small parcels of land, including restricted use agreements of surface or subsurface rights, to customers, where such sales provide a solution to a customer's operations in the oil and gas industry. Demand for water and other oilfield related products and services is due to oil and gas activity and development in southeast New Mexico. 
Byproducts
We also sell salt, magnesium chloride, metal recovery salts, brines, and water that are derived as part of our mining processes. Our salt is used in a variety of markets including animal feed, industrial applications, pool salt, and the treatment of roads and walkways for ice melting or to manage road conditions. Magnesium chloride is typically used as a road treatment agent for both deicing and dedusting. Our brines contain salt and potassium and are used primarily by the oil and gas industry to support well workover and completion activities. When the water that we sell was previously used in the production process for potash or Trio®, it is considered a byproduct of the underlying product. We continue to work to expand sales of byproducts, particularly to serve the oil and gas markets near our operating facilities. Sales of byproducts are accounted for within the segment that produced the byproduct. In each of the last three years, the potash segment accounted for the majority of our byproduct sales.
Production Facilities
We produce potash from three solar evaporation solution mining facilities: our HB solution mine in Carlsbad, New Mexico, a solution mine in Moab, Utah, and a brine recovery mine in Wendover, Utah. We also operate our North compaction facility in Carlsbad, New Mexico, which compacts and granulates product from the HB mine. Solution mining is a process by which potash is extracted from mineralized beds by injecting a salt-saturated brine into a potash ore body and recovering a brine that contains potash and other minerals. The brine is brought to the surface for mineral recovery through solar evaporation. For solar evaporation, the brine is placed in ponds and solar energy is used to evaporate water thus crystallizing out the potash and minerals contained in the brine. The resulting mineral evaporates are then processed to separate the minerals for sale. Solution mining does not require employees or machines to be underground.
We produce Trio® from our conventional underground East mine in Carlsbad, New Mexico. A conventional underground mine uses a mechanical method of extracting minerals from underground. Underground mining consists of multiple shafts or entry points and a network of tunnels to provide access to minerals and conveyance systems to transport materials to the surface. Underground mining machines are used to remove the ore and a series of pillars are left behind to provide the appropriate level of ground support to ensure safe access and mining.
We have a current estimated annual designed productive capacity of approximately 390,000 tons of potash from our solar evaporation solution mines. We also have an estimated annual designed productive capacity of 400,000 tons of Trio®.
Our annual production rates for potash and Trio® are less than our estimated productive capacity. Actual production is affected by operating rates, the grade of ore mined, recoveries, mining rates, evaporation rates, product pricing, product demand, and the amount of development work that we perform. Therefore, as with other producers in our industry, our production results tend to be lower than reported productive capacity. 
We also have water pipelines and reservoir ponds that we use to deliver water to our New Mexico facilities and to customers. As mentioned above, we acquired Intrepid South in May 2019 which increased our water rights and water delivery infrastructure.
Industry Overview
Fertilizer serves a fundamental role in global agriculture by providing essential crop nutrients that help sustain both the yield and the quality of crops. The three primary nutrients required for plant growth are nitrogen, phosphate, and potassium. There are no known substitutes for these nutrients. A proper balance of each of the three nutrients is necessary to maximize their effectiveness in crop growth. Potassium helps regulate plants' physiological functions and improves plant durability, providing crops with protection from drought, disease, parasites, and cold weather. Unlike nitrogen and phosphate, the potassium contained in naturally occurring potash does not require additional chemical conversion to be used as a plant nutrient.
In addition to the primary nutrients, which are required in the greatest quantities in crop nutrition, important secondary nutrients such as sulfur and magnesium are also essential in crop nutrition. Intrepid's Trio® product contains the primary nutrient potassium and two secondary nutrients, sulfur and magnesium. 
Long-term global fertilizer demand has historically been driven by population growth and global economic conditions with annual demand variations based on planted acreage, agricultural commodity yields and prices, inventories of grains and oilseeds, application rates of fertilizer, weather patterns, and farm sector income. We expect these key variables to continue to have an impact on global fertilizer demand for the foreseeable future. Sustained per capita income growth and agricultural policies in the developing world also affect global demand for fertilizer. Fertilizer demand is affected by other geopolitical factors such as temporary disruptions in fertilizer trade related to government intervention and changes in the buying patterns of key fertilizer consuming countries. Volatility in agricultural commodity prices also may impact farmer fertilizer buying decisions.
Nameplate production capacities that exceed demand have historically shaped the world potash market. A few potash companies have controlled a significant portion of this capacity, which was magnified in early 2018 with the merger of two Canadian producers. Generally, these larger producers have managed production levels to approximate world demand. Several international brownfield and greenfield expansions have also begun potash production, with increases in production rates expected over the next few years. Sanctions on Belarusian potash and Russia's invasion of Ukraine resulted in a significant decrease in global production and uncertainty of planned expansion projects in Russia. Production is expected to remain below 2021 levels in 2023 and possibly longer. As planned expansions come online in future years, potash pricing will likely depend on the larger producers' ability to continue to manage the supply and demand balance through decreased utilization rates. Increases in world fertilizer demand, due mainly to population growth and limitations on arable land, are expected to eventually lessen the burden on producers, although recent increases in productive capacities and the continued progress of key expansion projects, specifically BHP's approval of the Jansen Stage 1 potash project, add additional uncertainty to the long-term supply and demand balance for the potash market. 
The volume of imports to the U.S. further impacts the potash market. A change in the volume of imports could result in a material change to potash prices in the U.S. The U.S. imposed sanctions on Belarusian potash imports, which took effect in April 2022. Belarusian potash historically accounted for approximately 7% of annual demand in the U.S. In response to these sanctions, other foreign suppliers increased the volume of potash imports to the U.S. The overall effect of these sanctions on the potash market remains uncertain. 
Virtually all of the world's potash is currently extracted from 20 commercial deposits. According to S&P Global Commodity Insights and data published by potash mining companies, six countries accounted for approximately 91% of the world's aggregate potash production during 2022. During the same period, the top nine country potash producers supplied approximately 97% of world production. Two major Canadian producers participate in the Canpotex marketing group that supplied approximately 35% of global potash production in 2022. Owing to sanctions directed at potash production in Belarus, S&P Global Commodity Insights estimates that Belarus accounted for 6% of global production in 2022, compared to 17% in the prior year, while they estimate that Russia accounted for 21% of global production in both 2021 and 2022.
    Hydraulically fractured horizontal wells account for the majority of oil and gas wells drilled in the U.S. today and are responsible for the record amount of fossil fuels produced in the U.S. in recent years. The use of horizontal drilling in oil and gas production allows a well to remain in contact with the targeted formation, increasing production compared to a vertically drilled well. This process has resulted in longer wells, with some horizontal drilling sections reaching several miles long. The increase in horizontal drilling has also increased the use of fresh water, with a single frac potentially using millions of gallons. In the frac process, water and sand are used to move proppant and other frac additives into the targeted rock formation. Fresh water is important in the fracking process, as impurities in the water can impact the overall effectiveness of the frac. The majority of water used in fracking is transported by pipeline to the frac site, where it is stored in ponds or storage tanks. While fresh water remains a key input for many fracs, some operators have switched to using exclusively recycled/produced water or a combination of fresh water and recycled/produced water when completing wells. We believe this change is due to the growing focus on environmentally friendly operations and a response to the large amounts of produced water that is present in certain basins and formations, such as the Delaware Basin in southeast New Mexico. By recycling and reusing produced water, operators are able to reduce fresh water purchases and decrease the cost of transporting and disposing of produced water into disposal wells.
    The most productive region in the U.S. for oil production is the Permian Basin, which spans from west Texas to southeastern New Mexico. As of January 2023, the Permian Basin produced approximately 5.6 million barrels of oil per day. For comparison, the next most productive region in the U.S. produced approximately 1.2 million barrels of oil per day. In addition to producing wells, the Permian Basin also had approximately 1,100 drilled but uncompleted wells as of December 2022.
Competition and Competitive Strategy
We sell our potash and Trio® into commodity markets and compete based on delivered price, our ability to timely deliver product, and product quality. We also compete based on the durability, particle size, and potassium oxide content of our potash and Trio® products. For potash, we compete with larger Canadian potash producers and, to a lesser extent, producers located in Russia, Belarus, Chile, Germany, and Israel. For Trio®, we compete with one other producer of langbeinite as well as producers of other specialty nutrients and blended products. The competitive market for our water resources include other water right holders, which include companies, farmers, and ranchers operating in or near the Permian Basin in New Mexico. Some of our competitors and potential competitors may have significant advantages over us, including greater name recognition, longer operating histories, pre-existing relationships with current or potential customers, significantly greater financial, marketing and other resources, ownership of more diverse assets and products, geographically and/or access to less expensive mining assets, any of which could allow them to respond more quickly to new or changing opportunities.
Our competitive strategy is focused on the following:
•Maximizing potash gross margin and optimizing potash production. All of our potash production comes from solar solution mines, which carry fewer fixed costs than our conventional potash mines. Our per-ton costs are lower for solution mining than conventional mining as solar solution mining requires less labor, energy, and equipment. Additionally, the North American market is significantly larger than our production capacity and we are advantageously located close to the markets we serve. Therefore, we are able to selectively participate in the markets that we believe will provide the highest average net realized sales price per ton. We also attempt to leverage our freight advantage to key geographies, our diverse customer and market base, and our flexible marketing approach to maximize our gross margin. We have optimization and expansion opportunities at our solution mining facilities, that, over time, could further reduce our per-ton costs and increase our potash production.
•Expanding Trio® sales and maximizing gross margin. We plan to continue expansion of our sales and marketing efforts for Trio® in domestic markets and select international markets. Our efforts include continued crop nutrition education and increased marketing efforts targeting organic agriculture and high-value specialty crop markets. To maximize gross margin, we are working to optimize our production process to produce more granular-sized product, which is preferred by most markets. We currently operate our Trio® facility at a reduced production level and expect to continue to do so for the foreseeable future.
•Expanding offerings of oilfield solutions. We intend to continue expansion of water sales, particularly to service the oil and gas markets near our operating plants in New Mexico. We have water rights that we sell water for commercial uses in the oil and gas services industry. Additionally, as described above, in May 2019, we acquired certain land, water rights, state grazing leases for cattle, and other related assets from Dinwiddie Cattle Company in the Permian Basin which we operate as Intrepid South. We expect to increase the amount of water available for sale on the Intrepid South property over the next few years through additional infrastructure investments. Our other oilfield related products and services include, but are not limited to, caliche, right-of-way agreements, and a produced water royalty. The heightened focus on environmentally friendly operations and due to the large amounts of produced water in the Delaware Basin, operators are using increasing amounts of recycled and produced water when completing wells. We may expand our current oilfield solutions products and services to include water recycling. Given the location of Intrepid South, part of our long-term operating strategy is selling small parcels of land, including through the use of restricted use agreements for surface or subsurface rights, to customers.
•Continuing diversification of products and services. We recover magnesium chloride, salt, brines, and water during the production of potash and Trio®. These byproducts diversity our portfolio of product and service offerings. As we continue to explore and evaluate opportunities to diversify our revenue sources, we may enter into new or complementary businesses that expand our product and service offerings, including an expansion into oil and natural gas exploration and production, or into new products or services in our current industry or other industries.
Competitive Strengths
•U.S.-based producer. We are the only producer of potash in the U.S. We are located in a market that consumes significantly more potash than we can currently produce on an annual basis. Our geographic location provides us with a transportation advantage over our competitors for shipping our product to customers. In general, this allows us to obtain a higher average net realized sales price per ton than our competitors, who must ship their products across longer distances to consuming markets, which increases their costs and reduces their gross margin. Our location allows us to target sales to the markets in which we have the greatest transportation advantage, maximizing our average net realized sales price per ton. Our access to strategic rail destination points and our location along major agricultural trucking routes also supports this advantage.
As a U.S. producer, we enjoy a significantly lower total production tax and royalty burden than our principal competitors, which operate primarily in Saskatchewan, Canada. The Saskatchewan tax system for potash producers includes a capital tax and several potash mineral taxes, none of which are imposed on us as a U.S. producer. We currently pay an average royalty rate of approximately 4.7% for our potash and Trio® sales less their related freight costs, which compares favorably to that of our competitors in Canada. The relative tax and royalty advantage for U.S. producers becomes more pronounced when profits per ton increase due primarily to the profit tax component of the Saskatchewan potash mineral tax. 
•Solar evaporation operations. All of our potash production comes from solar solution mines. Solar evaporation is a cost-efficient production method because it significantly reduces labor and energy consumption, which are two of the largest costs of production. Our understanding and application of low-cost solution mining, combined with our reserves being located where a favorable climate for evaporation exists, make solar solution mining difficult for other producers to replicate. We also have significant reserves for future expansion of our solution mining operations. 
•Participation in specialty markets. Given the greater scarcity of langbeinite relative to potash and its agronomic suitability for certain soils and crops, we believe there is a market for Trio® outside of our core potash markets. We also believe that there is a market for Trio® beyond the U.S., although freight expense and competition from substitute products have made this a difficult market to penetrate. We also offer Organic Materials Review Institute ("OMRI") listed potash and Trio® products that provide essential minerals for growing certified organic crops. Through our existing operations and assets, we also have the potential to grow our offerings of salt, water, and brine with low capital investments.
•Water rights. Water rights in New Mexico are real property rights, which authorize a water right owner to use a specific amount of water, diverted from a specific location, for a specific purpose of use, in a specific place. Water rights are limited to the amount of water put to beneficial use. In New Mexico, the New Mexico Office of the State Engineer (“OSE”) administers water rights. The validity of water rights are ultimately confirmed or denied by a court in an adjudication proceeding. Prior to an adjudication, a water right may be acquired through the OSE’s permitting or licensing process. If a water right existed before the OSE had authority to issue permits, a water rights owner may file a declaration with the OSE. The OSE issues permits for both surface and groundwater appropriations. These permits are inchoate rights, which allow a permittee to put the water to beneficial use as prescribed by the agency. Once the OSE confirms that water diversion works have been completed and water has been put to beneficial use, the water right is licensed. A declaration is made when water was put to beneficial use either before New Mexico adopted its current water code in 1907 for surface water declarations, or before the OSE declared an underground water basin for groundwater declarations. A water right claimant must apply to the OSE for a permit to make changes to a water right, including changes in the place or purpose of use. The validity of water rights are ultimately confirmed or denied by courts in an adjudication process. We have permitted, licensed, declared and partially adjudicated water rights in New Mexico under which we sell water primarily for commercial uses in the oil and gas services industry. We continue to work to expand sales of water, especially to support oil and gas development in the Permian Basin near our Carlsbad facilities. The Intrepid South property increased the total water rights available for sale in and around the Delaware Basin, a sub-basin of the Permian Basin. This has expanded our relationships with oil and gas producers, which we may be able to use to expand sales of our industrial potash products, byproducts, and services.
•Diversity of potash markets. We sell potash into three different markets—the agricultural, industrial, and feed markets. During 2022, these markets represented approximately 69%, 8%, and 23% of potash sales, respectively, and during 2021, these markets represented approximately 78%, 6%, and 16%, of our potash sales, respectively. The agricultural market supplies farmers producing a wide range of crops in different geographies. Because of our geographic proximity to areas that have seen recent increases in oil and gas drilling activity, we believe that we have an opportunity to promote the benefits of potash in drilling activities and to increase our industrial sales volumes. 
•Marketing flexibility. We have the ability to convert all of our standard-sized potash product into granular-sized product as market conditions warrant. We also produce Trio® in premium, granular, standard and fine standard sizes. This provides us with increased marketing flexibility as well as decreased dependence on any one particular market.
•Significant reserve life. Our potash and langbeinite reserves each have substantial years of reserve life, with remaining reserve lives for our actively mined areas ranging from approximately 24 years to more than 100 years, based on mineral resource and reserve estimates. In addition to our reserves, we have water rights and access to additional mineralized areas of potash for potential future exploitation. 
•Existing facilities and infrastructure. Constructing a new potash production facility requires substantial time and extensive capital investment in mining, milling, and infrastructure to extract, process, store, and ship product. Our operations already have significant facilities and infrastructure in place. We also have the ability to expand our business using existing installed infrastructure, in less time and with lower expenditures than would be required to construct entirely new mines. 
Seasonality
The month-to-month seasonality of our agricultural sales is somewhat moderated due to the variety of crops, industries, distribution strategies, and geographies that we serve. There is a seasonal sales pattern for potash sold into the agricultural market. Over the last three years, our monthly potash sales volume has been highest in February through May and September through November when purchasers are looking to have product on hand in advance of the spring and fall application seasons in the U.S. In turn, our monthly potash sales volume has been the lowest in June, July and December. The specific timing of when farmers apply potash remains highly weather dependent and varies across the numerous growing regions within the U.S. The timing of potash sales is significantly influenced by the marketing programs of potash producers, as well as storage volumes closer to the farm gate.
The sales pattern for Trio® sold into the domestic agricultural market is also seasonal. Over the last three years, our domestic Trio® sales volume has been highest in March and April, as Trio® products are typically applied to crops in the U.S. during the spring planting season. Demand for the spring planting season generally runs from December to May, during which we have sold approximately 60% of our domestic Trio® volumes over the past three years. 
 We observed fertilizer dealers in North America instituting practices that are designed to reduce the risk of changes in the price of fertilizer products through consignment-type programs. These programs tend to make the timing of the spring and fall seasonal demand profile less predictable within the season. Further, through technological advances, farmers in the U.S. are more efficient in planting and harvesting their crops, which has compressed the application seasons.
Our quarterly and yearly financial results can also vary from one year to the next due to weather‑related shifts in planting schedules and purchasing patterns.
Because all of our potash production comes from our solar solution mines, our potash production is also seasonal. Our solar solution mines suspend potash production activities from early spring through late summer, the peak solar evaporation period. Accordingly, we manage our inventories during the low demand periods of the year in order to ensure timely product availability during the peak sales seasons, as well as during the summer evaporation period when we have no potash being produced. The seasonality of fertilizer demand results in our sales volumes being the highest during the spring and our working capital requirements being the highest just before the start of the spring season. 
Demand for our oilfield products and services is highly correlated to oil and gas exploration activities and can vary from quarter to quarter and year to year.
Major Customers
Within the agricultural market, we supply a diversified customer base of distributors, cooperatives, retailers, and dealers, which in turn supply farmers producing a wide range of crops in different geographies. We sell into the industrial and feed markets through sales to distributors and directly to end users. For water, we sell to a diverse set of customers through a combination of spot sales and multi-year contracts.
In 2022, we had one customer, Bill Barr & Company, Inc., which accounted for more than 10% of our total consolidated revenues. In each of 2021 and 2021, no customer accounted for more than 10% of our total sales.
Environmental, Safety, and Health Matters
We are subject to an federal, state, and local environmental, safety, and health laws that regulate, among other things; (1) soil, air, and water quality standards for our facilities; (2) disposal, storage, and management of hazardous and solid wastes; (3) post-mining land reclamation and closure; (4) conditions of mining and production operations; (5) employee and contractor safety and occupational health; and (6) product content and labeling. We employ and consult with professionals who assist in monitoring our compliance with these laws and who work with management to ensure that appropriate strategies and processes are in place to promote a culture that prioritizes safety and environmental responsibility.
In 2022, we had approximately $2.1 million of capital investments and reclamation, and $1.0 million in other expenses, relating to environmental compliance, environmental studies, and remediation efforts. We expect to spend $3.0 million to $5.0 million for environmental related capital and reclamation projects in both 2023 and 2024. Future capital expenditures are subject to uncertainties, including changes to environmental laws. Material expenditures could be required in the future to fulfill environmental compliance requirements, either new or existing. We anticipate a focus on environmental issues will result in increased future investments for environmental controls at our operations. See Item 1A. Risk Factors “Risks Related to Our Business - Environmental laws and regulations could subject us to significant liability and require us to incur additional costs.”
Product Registration Requirements
We are required to register fertilizer products with each U.S. state and foreign country where products are sold. Each brand and grade of commercial fertilizer must be registered appropriately before being offered for sale, sold, or distributed. In most cases, these product registrations impose specific requirements relating to guaranteed analysis, product labeling, and regular reporting of sales.
Some U.S. states require similar registration and reporting for feed grade products. Industrial-grade products typically do not require registration or reporting.
Operating Requirements and Government Regulations
Permits
    We are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations, including laws and regulations regarding land use and reclamation; release of emissions to the atmosphere; release of contaminants to water; preservation of plant and animal life; and the generation, treatment, storage, disposal, and handling of hazardous substances and wastes. These laws include the Clean Air Act ("CAA"); the Clean Water Act ("CWA"); the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act; the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act ("CERCLA"); the Toxic Substances Control Act ("TSCA"); and various other federal, state, and local laws and regulations. Violations can result in substantial penalties, court orders to install pollution‑control equipment, civil and criminal sanctions, permit revocations, and facility shutdowns. Environmental laws and regulations may impose joint and several liability, without regard to fault, for cleanup costs on potentially responsible parties who have released, disposed of, or arranged for release or disposal of hazardous substances in the environment.
We hold numerous environmental, mining, and other permits or approvals authorizing operations at each of our facilities. Our operations are subject to permits for, among other things, extraction of salt and brine, discharges of process materials and waste to air and water, injection of brine, and appropriation of water. Some of our proposed activities may require waste storage permits. A decision by a government agency to deny or delay issuing a new, modified, or renewed permit or approval, or to revoke or substantially modify an existing permit or approval, could limit or prevent us from mining at these properties. In addition, changes to environmental and mining regulations or permit requirements could limit our ability to continue operations at the affected facility. In many cases, environmental permits and approvals are also required for an expansion of, or changes to, our operations. As a condition to procuring the necessary permits and approvals, we may be required to comply with financial assurance regulatory requirements. The purpose of these requirements is to assure the government that sufficient company funds will be available for the ultimate reclamation, closure, and post-closure care at our facilities. We obtain bonds as financial assurance for these obligations. These bonds require annual payment and renewal.
We believe we are in compliance with existing regulatory programs, permits, and approvals where non-compliance could have a material adverse effect on our operating results or financial condition. In 2016, the OSE determined that our East tailing impoundment embankments are considered jurisdictional dams. We continue to work with the Dam Safety Bureau to determine the hazard level of our dams and the OSE to determine required dam modifications associated with this determination. We may be required to spend a significant amount of capital to bring the impoundments into compliance with requirements for jurisdictional dams or modify our operations to no longer use impoundments that may qualify as jurisdictional dams.
Occasionally governmental agencies notify us of noncompliance with certain environmental laws, regulations, permits, or approvals. For example, although designated as zero discharge facilities under the applicable water quality laws and regulations, our East, North, and Moab facilities at times may experience some water and brine discharges during periods of significant rainfall or due to other circumstances. We have implemented several initiatives to address discharge issues, including the reconstruction or modification of certain impoundments, increasing evaporation, and reducing process water usage and discharges and improved management systems. State and federal officials are aware of these issues and have visited the sites to review our corrective efforts and action plans. 
Air and Drinking Water
    In the ordinary course of our business, from time to time, we receive notices from the New Mexico Environment Department of alleged air or drinking water quality control violations. Upon receipt of these notices, we evaluate the matter and take any required corrective actions. In some cases, we may be required to pay civil penalties for these notices of violation. The Utah Division of Air Quality conducts periodic compliance inspections at our Moab and Wendover facilities and affirms our compliance with applicable approval orders.
Safety and Health Regulation and Programs
    Some of our facilities are subject to the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 ("MSHA"), the Occupational Safety and Health Act ("OSHA"), related state statutes and regulations, or a combination of these laws.
    Our conventional underground mines and related surface facilities in New Mexico are subject to MSHA jurisdiction. In accordance with MSHA, these facilities are regularly inspected by MSHA personnel. Item 4 and Exhibit 95.1 to this Annual Report provide information concerning certain mine safety violations.
As part of our ongoing safety programs, we collaborate with MSHA and the New Mexico Bureau of Mine Safety to identify and implement accident prevention techniques and practices. A trained mine rescue team services our New Mexico facilities. This team is ready to respond to on-site incidents or assist in local incidents, if needed. In addition, our New Mexico 
facilities participate in a basin agreement with other natural resource and hazardous waste facilities to provide mine rescue support.
Our Utah and our HB mine and plant are subject to OSHA jurisdiction. We provide all OSHA required training and other certifications to our employees at these facilities. 
Remediation at Intrepid Facilities
    Many of our current facilities have been in operation for a number of years. Our and our predecessors' operations involved the historical use and handling of potash, salt, related potash and salt byproducts, process tailings, hydrocarbons and other regulated substances. Some of these operations resulted, or may have resulted, in soil, surface water, or groundwater contamination. At some locations, there are areas where process waste, building materials (including asbestos‑containing transite), and ordinary trash may have been disposed or buried, and have since been properly closed and maintained.
At some of our facilities, spills or other releases of regulated substances may have occurred or could potentially occur, possibly requiring us to undertake or fund cleanup efforts under CERCLA or state laws governing cleanup or disposal of hazardous and solid waste.
We work closely with government authorities to obtain the appropriate permits to address identified site conditions. For example, buildings located at our facilities in Utah and New Mexico have a type of siding that contains asbestos. We have adopted programs to encapsulate and stabilize portions of the siding through use of an adhesive spray and to remove the siding, replacing it with an asbestos-free material. We have trained asbestos abatement crews that handle and dispose of the asbestos‑containing siding and related materials. We have a permitted asbestos landfill in Utah and have worked closely with Utah officials to address asbestos‑related issues at our Moab mine.
Reclamation Obligations
Mining and processing of potash generates residual materials that must be managed both during the operation of the facility and upon facility reclamation and closure. Potash tailings, consisting primarily of salt and fine sediments that remain after potash is removed from ore during processing, are stored in surface disposal sites. Some of these tailing materials may also include other contaminants, such as lead, that were introduced as reagents during historic processing methods, which may require additional management and could result in the imposition of additional disposal and reclamation requirements. For example, at least one of our New Mexico mining facilities may have legacy issues regarding lead in a tailings pile that occurred from production methods utilized prior to our acquisition of these assets. During the life of the tailings management areas, we have incurred, and will continue to incur, significant costs to manage potash residual materials in accordance with environmental laws, regulations and permit requirements. Additional legal and permit requirements will take effect when these facilities are closed.
Our surface permits require us to reclaim property disturbed areas of our facilities. Our operations in Utah and New Mexico have specific obligations related to reclamation of the land after mining and processing operations are concluded. The discounted present value of our estimated reclamation costs for our facilities as of December 31, 2022, is approximately $26.9 million, which is reflected in our audited financial statements found elsewhere in this Annual Report. Various permits and authorization documents negotiated with or issued by the appropriate governmental authorities include these estimated reclamation costs on an undiscounted basis.
It is difficult to estimate and predict the potential actual costs and liabilities associated with remediation and reclamation. Additionally, it is possible that we could be identified in the future as a potentially responsible party for additional remediation and reclamation costs, either as a result of changes in existing laws and regulations or as a result of the identification of additional matters subject to remediation and/or reclamation obligations or liabilities.
Royalties
The potash, langbeinite, water, and byproducts we produce and sell from leased land may be subject to royalty payments. We produce and sell from leased land owned by the U.S., the States of New Mexico and Utah, and private landowners. The terms of the royalty payments are determined at the time of the issuance or renewal of leases. Some royalties are determined as a fixed percentage of revenue and others vary based upon ore grade. Additionally, some of our leases are subject to overriding royalty interest payments paid to various owners. In 2022, we paid $14.5 million in royalties and other taxes. The royalty rates on our state and federal leases in New Mexico are currently set at various rates from 2.0% to 5.0%. The royalty rates on our state and federal leases in Utah are currently set at rates from 3.0% to 5.0%. The royalty rates for the private leaseholds are between 5.0% and 8.0%. For certain water sales we pay an $0.11 per barrel sold royalty to the State of New Mexico.

A summary of our ESG goals under the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals framework is available on our website at intrepidpotash.com. An update on recent ESG highlights and initiatives is shown below. 
Commitment to the Environment
We rely on the environments, resources and ecosystems surrounding our locations in all segments of our business. We work closely with our communities and make it a priority to protect the natural resources surrounding our operations.
–Solar solution mining potash - All of our potash is currently produced at solar solution mines, one of the most environmentally friendly and energy efficient mining techniques. We inject a naturally occurring, salt saturated brine solution into underground caverns or previously shuttered mine workings. This brine selectively dissolves the remaining potash, which is then pumped back to the surface and into evaporation ponds. During the spring and summer months, the brine naturally evaporates, leaving only the salt and potash solids in the ponds, which we then process into the products we sell. By using solar energy, we do not need to burn natural gas or coal to evaporate our brine ponds.
–Salt laydown at the Bonneville Salt Flats - We are committed to helping maintain the environments in which we operate, one of which is the Bonneville Salt Flats near our Wendover, Utah mine. Since 2005, we have donated free of cost to the BLM nearly 7 million tons of salt that has been deposited on the racetrack to help preserve this unique attraction in northwest Utah. We drilled an additional brackish well in 2021 to increase the brine available for the salt laydown project. 
–We are the only OMRI-listed potash and langbeinite producer in the U.S. We became OMRI-listed in 2007 for our langbeinite, or Trio®, product, and in 2018 for our potash products at our Moab and Wendover operating facilities. We are also registered in the Organic Input Material Program through the California Department of Food and Agriculture, a program which registers fertilizers that can be used in organic crop and food production. 
–We work closely with the Bureau of Land Management ("BLM") and other government and regulatory agencies to preserve historical sites near our operations such as the Maroon Cliffs in Carlsbad, New Mexico and petroglyphs near our Utah operations. We also work with and have supported agencies dedicated to studying and protecting endangered species near our operations such as the sand dune lizards in New Mexico. 
Our Social Impact and Supporting our Communities
Our employees live and work in small, tight-knit communities and we are deeply involved in volunteering and being active community members.
Our New Mexico operations have partnered with the United Way of Carlsbad and South Eddy County since 2004, participating in a variety of community-focused events and activities such as United Way's annual Day of Caring event. We encourage all our employees to volunteer in their communities and we offer all our full-time employees three paid volunteer days each year to support either a charitable organization of their choosing or participate in an Intrepid sponsored volunteer project. 
Our Commitment to a Diverse Workforce
We are committed to a recruitment and hiring process that emphasizes and embraces diversity. We believe a diverse workforce leads to greater collaboration, innovation, and improves shareholder returns and we celebrate the great value the differences in our people bring to our organization. We support a variety of organizations within our communities including the Women's Leadership Foundation, a Colorado based organization with the goal of opening more board of director positions to women leaders in Colorado and beyond.
Our Commitment to Safety
Safety audits are conducted across all our locations to ensure a thoughtful approach can be taken that increases the safe execution of all tasks. Through our audits and dialogue, we educate ourselves and understand the potential hazards present, create best practices that can be shared, and address areas where improvements can be made. Prior to each task, employees are 
required to: assemble the proper personal protection equipment, tools, permits, etc., ensure the area is safe for employees and contractors, discuss the task with all stakeholders, and understand how the task is related to the overall business.
We conduct safety audits of our operations on a monthly basis. The data from these safety audits is collected to analyze where, what, and why gaps exist, and to provide meaningful information that results in safer work for our employees. 
Our East Mine operation in Carlsbad, New Mexico received the National 2020 and 2021 Sentinels of Safety Award in the large underground nonmetal category. The Sentinels of Safety Award is presented by the National Mining Association each year to recognize the outstanding safety achievements of mining operations across a variety of categories.
Business Ethics
Since inception, Intrepid has placed the highest emphasis on conducting its business with honesty and integrity. These standards are expected of management and employees alike, and we continuously strive to create a corporate culture of honesty, integrity, and trust.
