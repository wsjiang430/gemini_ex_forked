Item 1. Business
Company Overview 
 
Utilizing managements history and contacts in general contracting, coupled with our subject matter expertise and intellectual property (“IP”) knowledge of solar panels and other environmentally friendly technologies, Sun Pacific Holding (“the Company”) is focused on building a “Next Generation” green energy company. The Company offers competitively priced “Next Generation” solar panel and lighting products by working closely with design, engineering, integration and installation firms in order to deliver turnkey solar and other energy efficient solutions. We provide solar bus stops, solar trashcans and “street kiosks” that utilize advertising offerings that provide State and local municipalities with costs efficient solutions. We provide general, electrical, and plumbing contracting services to a range of both public and commercials customers in support of our goals of expanding our green energy market reach. In conjunction with these general contracting services and as part of our effort to expand our green energy marketplace, we have recently started the process to develop and build out a Waste to Energy plant in the State of Rhode Island. A facility that we believe may have the ability to handle medical waste in the Northeast Corridor of the United States of America.
 
Currently, the Company has six (6) subsidiary holdings. Sun Pacific Power Corp which was the initial company that specialized in solar, electrical and general construction, Bella Electric, LLC that in conjunction with the Company operates our electrical contracting work. Bella Electric, LLC is a Pennsylvania limited liability company. The Company also formed Sun Pacific Security Corp., a New Jersey corporation. Currently the Company has not begun operations in the security sector but is reviewing plans to provide residential and commercial security solutions, including installation and monitoring. The Company also formed National Mechanical Group Corp, a New Jersey corporation focused on plumbing operations in the New Jersey and Pennsylvania areas. The Company also formed Street Smart Outdoor Corp, a Wyoming corporation that acts as a holding company for the Company’s state specific operations in unique advertising through solar bus stops, solar trashcans and “street kiosks.” MedRecycler, LLC, is a wholly owned subsidiary duly formed in the state of Nevada. MedRecycler, LLC was created in 2018 to act as a holding company for potential waste to energy projects. MedRecycler, LLC, currently owns 51% of MedRecycler RI, Inc. a Rhode Island Corporation. MedRecycler RI, Inc. was created for the Medical Waste to Energy facility that the Company is attempting to finance and operate in West Warrick, Rhode Island.
 
As of today, our principal source of revenues is derived from Street Smart Outdoor Corp. operations in the outdoor advertising business with contracts in place in Rhode Island and Tallahassee, Florida, along with some other minor contracting work. We are currently in negotiations with a nationally known outdoor advertising firm to manage and expand our operations, either through a joint venture, partnership, and or a management arrangement as a result of the company’s insufficient working capital and as an option to allow for the expansion of our technologies and or contracts by working with other parties that can bring management expertise and or other resources that may allow us to further optimize our growth strategies.
 
Sun Pacific Power Corp. continues to make bids for construction projects throughout the Northeast region. However, as of today, we have limited operations in Sun Pacific Power Corp.
 
Bella Electric, LLC and Sun Pacific Security Corp. have generally ceased operations, but we maintain the subsidiaries in case we find opportunities to relaunch our operations.

MedRecycler, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Sun Pacific Holding Company currently holds fifty one percent (51%) of MedRecycler-RI, Inc., a corporation formed in the state of Rhode Island for the development of waste to energy projects in the state of Rhode Island. Currently, MedRecycler-RI, Inc. has entered into an Indenture of Trust in the amount of $6,025,000.00 as bridge financing for a project in West Warwick, Rhode Island (the “Rhode Island Project”). The original plan was for a facility in Johnston, Rhode Island, but through our negotiations, determined that the West Warwick location was more suitable. The Indenture of Trust has been secured by all equity holdings in MedRecycler-RI, Inc., all personal holdings of equity in the Company held by Nick Campanella, our CEO and member of the Board of Directors. Mr. Campanella has further pledged personal property located in Manapalan in excess of $1,000,000. Payment for the Indenture of Trust is further guaranteed by the Company and Street Smart Outdoor Corp. Currently, MedRecycler-RI, Inc. has entered into a lease agreement in West Warwick, Rhode Island, has taken preliminary steps to order the equipment and is beginning to engage specialists and staff for building out the Rhode Island Project. In order to secure actual operations of the Rhode Island Project, we estimate that MedRecycler-RI, Inc. must still secure a minimum of $14,500,000 in long term financing. MedRecycler-RI, Inc. is currently negotiating with the state of Rhode Island and potential bond financiers to secure the long financing for the Rhode Island Project. Although we anticipate, assuming the long-term financing is secured, the Rhode Island Project may be fully operation as early as the fourth quarter of 2019. Initially, all operational earnings will be earmarked for interest, principal repayment, and the fulfillment of other covenants of the long term financing, As we have not secured long term financing, we can make no statement regarding the long term success of the Rhode Island Project, though, even in a best case scenario, the Rhode Island Project may not be cash flow positive until fully operational and proceeds fulfill covenants under the terms of the yet to be finalized debt financing. Through MeRecycler, LLC, the Company owns fifty-one percent (51%) of MedRecycler-RI, Inc., which was pledged by the Company to Mr. Campanella pursuant to a forbearance agreement related to debts owed to Mr. Campanella. The remaining forty nine percent (49%) of MedRecycler-RI, Inc. is held by Nicholas Campanella, personally, Marmac Corporate Advisors, LLC, and Eilers Law Group, P.A., holding thirty nine percent (39%), eight percent (8%), two percent (2%), respectfully. Mr. Campanella received his ownership as consideration for his personal pledges securing the Indenture of Trust, Marmac Corporate Advisors, LLC and Eilers Law Group, P.A. received their respective ownership as consideration for efforts and services performed. One hundred percent (100%) of the ownership of MedRecycler-RI, Inc. has been pledged to bridge financing, including any pledge rights held by Mr. Campanella in MedRecycler, LLC.
 
Currently, the Company has been and is insolvent. Over its history and to augment the Company’s strategy, it has sought out partnerships and other arrangements with professionals and companies at the operating subsidiary level to counter its insolvent state. It will continue to look for opportunities that will allow it to partner with others in the form of debt and or equity and other contributions at the subsidiary level, and where possible attempt to keep control of at least fifty one percent (51%) of those subsidiaries. While it will also look for the means to correct its insolvent state at the holding company level, given its current negative economic condition, many parties continue to prefer to work with the Company at an operational subsidiary level. The Company is currently exploring other equity and or debt opportunities to correct its overall insolvent state. Although we continue operations through our subsidiary holdings, revenues generated do not produce cash flows sufficient to meet our basic capital requirements. In order to meet our reporting requirements alone, we will have to seek additional capital through debt or equity financing and/or request deferred payment or other in-kind payments for services. Street Smart Outdoor is undercapitalized making expansion of our advertising products highly unlikely. Neither the Company nor Street Smart Outdoor have secured additional financing to support operations. We are attempting to partner or otherwise develop a capital strategy to allow us to grow the outdoor advertising business that includes financing outdoor structures with other parties, in which we arrange financing arrangements, and we continue to look for other professional organizations that we can partner with in expanding our contracts. Our Rhode Island Project currently represents a liability of over $6,000,000 and has yet to commence. It will require additional financing, we estimate, of not less than $8,500,000 to complete the build out of phase one for the facility and $14,500,000 if you include consolidating the current $6,000,000 short term indenture. We have plans upon the successful launch of our phase one to double the capacity of the facility, which will require additional financing. MedRecycler-RI, Inc. has yet to secure any additional financing. Failure to be successful with Rhode Island Project could lead to bankruptcy of the Company.
 
Strategic Vision
 
Our objective is to grow our business profitably as a premier green energy-based provider of both product and services to the public and private sectors. We are working to deploy our strategy in building upon our general and other contracting expertise in conjunction with our intellectual property and subject matter expertise in green energy that may allow us to grow a group of profitable business lines in solar, waste to energy, efficient lighting, and other unique energy related areas.
 
Recent advances in a multitude of different yet converging technologies have significantly improved the ability to integrate energy efficient products and solutions into infrastructure related projects. These technological advances decrease the requirements needed to jointly operate a multitude of differing assets, devices, and tools that create new ways to integrate evolving new technologies. This technological change and convergence in energy efficient devices, integrated communications among devices, and societal needs to more effectively and environmentally friendly handle the removal of waste, we believe presents a significant opportunity for us in providing and supporting simple to complex integrated solutions.

Our challenges continue to be reaching critical mass in our solar shelter business, expanding into other green energy related projects, completion of the Rhode Island Project and securing operational capital. Except for the bridge financing for the Rhode Island Project, we do not have any existing financing arrangements in place. While the Company has never been adequately funded from inception, the Company has attempted to use debt, equity, and other opportunistic in-kind compensation to further the Company’s strategic vision.
 
Competition
 
Our competitive market is made up of a variety of small to large company’s depending upon the area that we are competing within. In the Contracting marketplace they range from a large number of small to large organizations, while in the solar and advertising shelter marketplace it is made up of a smaller amount of direct competitors including JC DeCaoux, Lamar, Clear Chanel, Signal Outdoor, and various others. While the Contractor marketplace we believe is not subject to rapid technological change driven in part by periodic introductions of new technologies we believe the Shelter marketplace and the new areas in Waste to Energy and other green energy marketplace may be subject to more technological change. Given this we believe that the major competitive factors in our marketplace are distinctive technical competencies, governmental certifications and approvals to operate within this space, successful past contract performance, price of services, reputation for quality, and key management personnel with domain expertise.
Marketing and Sales
 
We currently engage in a limited amount of marketing activities related to request for proposals for projects related to government contracts and or other contracting activities with commercial and private entities. We are developing a variety of new marketing activities designed to broaden our market awareness of our products, services and solutions, that may include e-mail and direct mail campaigns, co-marketing strategies designed to leverage developing strategic relationships, website marketing, topical webcasts, public relations campaigns, speaking engagements and forums and industry analyst visibility initiatives. We plan to participate in and sponsor conferences that cater to our target market and demonstrate and promote our products, services and solutions at trade shows targeted to green energy companies and executives. We also plan to publish white papers relating to green energy projects and develop customer reference programs, such as customer case studies, in an effort to promote better awareness of industry issues and demonstrate that our solutions can address many of the benefits of our solutions.
 
Our marketing strategy is to build our brand and increase market awareness of our products, services, and solutions in our target markets and to generate qualified sales leads that will allow us to successfully build strong relationships with key decision makers. We plan to use partnerships and other business arrangements to augment our marketing and sales reach in both our outdoor advertising, construction, and waste to energy business.
 
Clients
 
We derive a significant amount of our revenues from contracts funded by state governments and large organizations that we provide contracting services for which we act in capacity as the prime contractor, or as a subcontractor. Our client base is located predominantly in the North East region of the U.S. Historically, we have derived, and may continue to derive in the future, a significant percentage of our total revenues from a relatively small number of contracts. Due to the nature of our business and the relative size of certain contracts, which are entered into in the ordinary course of business, the loss of any single significant customer would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In future periods, we will continue to focus on diversifying our revenue by increasing the number of our customer contracts and seeking out partnerships that will allow us to increase our customer reach beyond our limited reach.
Intellectual Property
 
Our intellectual property rights are important to our business. We believe we will come to rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, service mark, trade secret and other rights in the United States and other jurisdictions, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology, processes and other intellectual property. We will protect our intellectual property rights in a number of ways including entering into confidentiality and other written agreements with our employees, customers, consultants and partners in an attempt to control access to and distribution of our documentation and other proprietary technology and other information. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, third parties may, in an unauthorized manner, attempt to use, copy or otherwise obtain and market or distribute our intellectual property rights or technology.

U.S. patent filings are intended to provide the holder with a right to exclude others from making, using, selling or importing in the United States the inventions covered by the claims of granted patents. Our patents, including our pending patents, if granted, may be contested, circumvented or invalidated. Moreover, the rights that may be granted in those issued and pending patents may not provide us with proprietary protection or competitive advantages, and we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing those patents. Therefore, the exact benefits of our issued patents and, if issued, our pending patents and the other steps that we have taken to protect our intellectual property cannot be predicted with certainty.
 
Currently, our intellectual property consists of the application for a patent filed by Sun Pacific Power Corp., our wholly owned subsidiary, for a frame-less encapsulated photo-voltaic solar panel construction and method and apparatus for making the same, filed on March 14, 2018.
 
MedRecycler, LLC has filed for trademark protection for its name and logo. The application is currently pending.
 
Seasonality
 
Our business is not seasonal. However, our revenues and operating results may vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter, due to revenues earned on contracts, the commencement and completion of contracts during any particular quarter; as well as the schedule of government agencies awarding contracts, the term of each contract that we have been awarded and general economic conditions. Because a portion of our expenses, such as personnel and facilities costs, are fixed in the short term, successful contract performance and variation in the volume of activity as well as in the number of contracts commenced or completed during any quarter may cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter.
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 10 full-time employees. We periodically engage additional consultants and employ temporary or full-time employees as needed. Potential employees possessing the unique qualifications required are readily available for both part-time and full-time employment. The primary method of soliciting personnel is through recruiting resources directly utilizing all known sources including electronic databases, public forums, and personal networks of friends and former co-workers.
 
We believe that our future success will depend in part on our continued ability to offer market competitive compensation packages to attract and retain highly skilled, highly motivated and disciplined managerial, technical, sales and support personnel. We generally do not have employment contracts with our employees, but we do selectively maintain employment agreements with key employees. In addition, confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements are in place with many of our customer, employees and consultants and such agreements are included our policies and procedures. None of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We believe that our relations with our employees are good.
