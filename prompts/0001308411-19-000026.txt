Item 1. Business
General
 
AuraSource, Inc. (“AuraSource” or “Company”) was incorporated on March 15, 1990. We have divided our activities into two divisions: AuraMetal and AuraMoto.
 
AuraMetalTM is focused on the development and production of environmentally friendly and cost-effective beneficiation process for complex ore, tailings and slimes materials as industrial application solutions. AuraSource’s core technology includes physical separation, hydrometallurgical and pyrometallurgy processes. We have developed seven patented technologies: 1) ultrafine grinding and 2) ultrafine separation. To date, we have not had any sustainable projects. As such, there can be no assurances that our efforts towards this line of business will succeed.
 
AuraMotoTM is focused on sourcing various vendors and customers in the automotive industry. We entered into the industry due to our various international sourcing contacts. We have been requested from various parties to source vendors and customers in the automotive industry. This business line is still in development. As this is a new enterprise for the Company, there can be no assurances that our efforts towards this line of business will succeed.
 
AuraMetal Business
 
AuraSource, Inc. developed the AuraMetal process based on its grinding and separation technologies. This technology separates commercially valuable minerals from other ores both economically and efficiently. It has a broad application in metal beneficiation such as hematite which cannot be concentrated by magnetic separation alone. AuraMetal process improves grade of ore at low cost and with minimal pollution. It is suitable for a multitude of low grade iron ore beneficiation. To date we have only pilot tested these processes. There can be no assurance that these processes will work on an industrialized scale.

AuraSource’s Key Technology
 
Ultrafine Grinding
 
Ultrafine grinding utilizes a fluid shock wave to grind slurry materials into ultrafine scale. The shock wave is generated when pressurized slurry (5-30 magapascal (Mpa)) goes through the grinding chamber. The shock wave carries energy and creates shear, collision and cavitation effects which cause particles in the slurry to reduce to an ultrafine size. As a result, when used in ore grinding, the ore can be pulverized and its fluidity improved.
Ultrafine Separation
 
Ultrafine separation separates different size particles with different densities in the slurry. The minimum particle size for conventional jigging and heavy media cycloning is 0.2 mm which makes it difficult to remove inorganic minerals. The settling velocity of particles in the slurry becomes very low under normal gravity when particles are fine. Particles settling may even stop due to interaction between particles and disturbance caused by other ultrafine particles in the slurry. Therefore, conventional separation equipment based on gravity is not effective. Our technology enables particles separation by applying 10-100 gravity which allows impurities and unwanted substances to be removed. 
 
There can be no assurance we will be able to carry out our plans for our technology. Our ability to pursue this strategy is subject to the availability of additional capital and further development of our technology.  We will also need to finance the cost of effectively protecting our intellectual property rights in the US and abroad where we intend to market our technology and products.
 
Competition
 
The mineral property exploration and development business, in general, is intensively competitive and there is not any assurance that even if commercial quantities of ore are discovered, a ready market will exist for sale of same. Numerous factors beyond the Company’s control may affect the marketability of any substances discovered. These factors include market fluctuations; the proximity and capacity of natural resource markets and processing equipment; and government regulations, including regulations relating to prices, taxes, royalties, land tenure, land use, importing and exporting of mineral and environmental protection. The exact effect of these factors cannot be accurately predicted, but the combination of these factors may make it difficult for the Company to receive an adequate return on investment.
 
The Company competes with many companies possessing greater financial resources and technical facilities for the acquisition of mineral concessions, claims, leases and other mineral interests as well as for the recruitment and retention of qualified employees
 
Patent and Trademarks
 
The Company currently relies on patents, unregistered trademarks, and confidentiality of trade secrets.  Our ability to compete effectively will depend on our success in protecting our proprietary technology, both in the US and abroad.  There are numerous patents or patent applications relating to HCF technology. We have filed for patent protection and taken the steps required to obtain international patent protection. Currently, we have received seven patents for our proprietary ultrafine grinding and separation technologies, from the State Intellectual Property Office of the People's Republic of China.

No assurance can be given that any patents relating to the AuraMetal technology will be issued by the US or any foreign patent offices.  Further, no assurance can be given that we will receive any patents in the future based on the continued development of the technology, or that the technology patent protection within and/or outside of the US will be sufficient to deter others, legally or otherwise, from developing or marketing competitive products utilizing our technology.  If patent protection is not available for our technology, we plan to treat it as a trade secret.  There can be no assurance we will be successful in this regard.
 
In addition to seeking patent protection, we will rely on trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological advancement to seek to achieve and thereafter maintain a competitive advantage in the HCF market.  Although we have entered into or intend to enter into confidentiality and invention agreements with our employees, consultants and advisors, no assurance can be given that such agreements will be honored or that we will be able to effectively protect our rights to our unpatented trade secrets and know-how.  Moreover, no assurance can be given that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets and know-how.
 
Employees
 
The Company currently has 4 full and part time employees and consultants. The Company engages the services of independent consultants to assist it with management and business development.  We plan to engage additional full-time employees as our business expands.
