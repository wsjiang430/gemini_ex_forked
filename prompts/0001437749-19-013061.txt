Overnight Air Cargo.
 
MAC and CSA have a relationship with FedEx spanning over 35 years and represent two of seven companies in the U.S. that have North American feeder airlines under contract with FedEx. MAC and CSA operate and maintain Cessna Caravan, ATR-42 and ATR-72 aircraft that fly daily small-package cargo routes throughout the eastern United States and upper Midwest. MAC and CSA’s revenues are derived principally pursuant to “dry-lease” service contracts with FedEx.
 
On June 1, 2015, MAC and CSA entered into new dry-lease agreements with FedEx which together cover all of the aircrafts operated by MAC and CSA and replaced all prior dry-lease service contracts.  These dry-lease agreements provide for the lease of specified aircraft by MAC and CSA in return for the payment of monthly rent with respect to each aircraft leased, which monthly rent was increased from the prior dry-lease service contracts to reflect an estimate of a fair market rental rate.  These dry-lease agreements provide that FedEx determines the type of aircraft and schedule of routes to be flown by MAC and CSA, with all other operational decisions made by MAC and CSA, respectively.  The current dry-lease agreements provide for the reimbursement by FedEx of MAC and CSA’s costs, without mark up, incurred in connection with the operation of the leased aircraft for the following: fuel, landing fees, third-party maintenance, parts and certain other direct operating costs. 
 
On June 1, 2016, the current dry-lease agreements were amended to extend the expiration date to May 31, 2020. The dry-lease agreements may be terminated by FedEx or MAC and CSA, respectively, at any time upon 90 days’ written notice and FedEx may at any time terminate the lease of any particular aircraft thereunder upon 10 days’ written notice. In addition, each of the dry-lease agreements provides that FedEx may terminate the agreement upon written notice if 60% or more of MAC or CSA’s revenue (excluding revenues arising from reimbursement payments under the dry-lease agreement) is derived from the services performed by it pursuant to the respective dry-lease agreement, FedEx becomes MAC or CSA’s only customer, or MAC or CSA employs fewer than six employees. As of the date of this report, FedEx would be permitted to terminate each of the dry-lease agreements under this provision. The Company believes that the short-term nature of its agreements with FedEx is standard within the airfreight contract delivery service industry, where performance is measured on a daily basis.
 
As of March 31, 2019, MAC and CSA had an aggregate of 79 aircraft under its dry-lease agreements with FedEx.  Included within the 79 aircraft, 6 Cessna Caravan aircrafts are considered soft-parked. Soft-parked aircraft remain covered under our agreements with FedEx although at a reduced administrative fee compared to aircraft that are in operation.  MAC and CSA continue to perform maintenance on soft-parked aircraft, but they are not crewed and do not operate on scheduled routes.
 
Revenues from MAC and CSA’s contracts with FedEx accounted for approximately 29% and 38% of the Company’s consolidated revenue for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The loss of FedEx as a customer would have a material adverse effect on the Company. FedEx has been a customer of the Company since 1980. MAC and CSA are not contractually precluded from providing services to other parties and MAC occasionally provides third-party maintenance services to other airline customers and the U.S. military.

MAC and CSA operate under separate aviation certifications. MAC is certified to operate under Part 121, Part 135 and Part 145 of the regulations of the FAA. These certifications permit MAC to operate and maintain aircraft that can carry a maximum cargo capacity of 7,500 pounds on the Cessna Caravan 208B under Part 135 and a maximum cargo capacity of 14,000 pounds for the ATR-42 and 17,800 pounds for the ATR-72 aircraft under Part 121. CSA is certified to operate and maintain aircraft under Part 135 of the FAA regulations. This certification permits CSA to operate aircraft with a maximum cargo capacity of 7,500 pounds.
 
MAC and CSA, together, operated the following FedEx-owned cargo aircraft as of March 31, 2019:
 

Type of Aircraft | Model Year | Form of Ownership | Number of Aircraft
----------------------------------------+------------+-------------------+-------------------
Cessna Caravan 208B (single turbo prop) | 1985-1996 | Dry lease | 61 
ATR-42 (twin turbo prop) | 1992 | Dry lease | 9 
ATR-72 (twin turbo prop) | 1992 | Dry lease | 9 
 | | | 79 

 
The Cessna Caravan 208B aircraft are maintained under an FAA Approved Aircraft Inspection Program (“AAIP”). The inspection intervals range from 100 to 200 hours. The current engine overhaul period on the Cessna aircraft is 8,000 hours.
 
The ATR-42 and ATR-72 aircraft are maintained under a FAA Part 121 continuous airworthiness maintenance program. The program consists of A and C service checks as well as calendar checks ranging from weekly to 12 years in duration. The engine overhaul period is 6,000 hours.
 
MAC and CSA operate in a niche market within a highly competitive contract cargo carrier market. MAC and CSA are two of seven carriers that operate within the United States as FedEx feeder carriers. MAC and CSA are benchmarked against the other five FedEx feeders based on safety, reliability, compliance with federal, state and applicable foreign regulations, price and other service-related measurements. The Company believes accurate industry data is not available to indicate the Company’s position within its marketplace (in large measure because all of the Company’s direct competitors are privately held), but management believes that MAC and CSA, combined, constitute the largest contract carrier of the type described immediately above.
 
FedEx conducts periodic audits of MAC and CSA, and these audits are an integral part of the relationship between the carrier and FedEx. The audits test adherence to the dry-lease agreements and assess the carrier’s overall internal control environment, particularly as related to the processing of invoices of FedEx-reimbursable costs. The scope of these audits typically extends beyond simple validation of invoice data against the third-party supporting documentation. The audit teams generally investigate the operator’s processes and internal control procedures. The Company believes satisfactory audit results are critical to maintaining its relationship with FedEx. The audits conducted by FedEx are not designed to provide any assurance with respect to the Company’s consolidated financial statements, and investors, in evaluating the Company’s consolidated financial statements, should not rely in any way on any such examination of the Company or any of its subsidiaries.
 
The Company’s overnight air cargo operations are not materially seasonal.
 
Ground Equipment Sales.
 
GGS is located in Olathe, Kansas and manufactures, sells and services aircraft deicers and other specialized equipment sold to domestic and international passenger and cargo airlines, ground handling companies, the United States Air Force (“USAF”), airports and industrial customers. GGS’s product line includes aircraft deicers, scissor-type lifts, military and civilian decontamination units, flight-line tow tractors, glycol recovery vehicles and other specialized equipment. In the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019, sales of deicing equipment accounted for approximately 76% of GGS’s revenues, compared to 77% in the prior fiscal year.

GGS designs and engineers its products. Components acquired from third-party suppliers are used in the assembly of its finished products. Components are sourced from a diverse supply chain. The primary components for mobile deicing equipment are the chassis (which is a commercial medium or heavy-duty truck), the fluid storage tank, a boom system, the fluid delivery system and heating equipment. The price of these components is influenced by raw material costs, principally high-strength carbon steels and stainless steel. GGS utilizes continuous improvements and other techniques to improve efficiencies and designs to minimize product price increases to its customers, to respond to regulatory changes, such as emission standards, and to incorporate technological improvements to enhance the efficiency of GGS’s products. Improvements have included the development of single operator mobile deicing units to replace units requiring two operators, a patented premium deicing blend system and a more efficient forced-air deicing system.
 
GGS manufactures five basic models of mobile deicing equipment with capacities ranging from 700 to 2,800 gallons. GGS also offers fixed-pedestal-mounted deicers. Each model can be customized as requested by the customer, including single operator configuration, fire suppressant equipment, open basket or enclosed cab design, a patented forced-air deicing nozzle, on-board glycol blending system to substantially reduce glycol usage, and color and style of the exterior finish. GGS also manufactures five models of scissor-lift equipment, for catering, cabin service and maintenance service of aircraft, and has developed a line of decontamination equipment, flight-line tow tractors, glycol recovery vehicles and other special purpose mobile equipment.
 
GGS competes primarily on the basis of the quality and reliability of its products, prompt delivery, service and price. The market for aviation ground service equipment is highly competitive and directly related to the financial health of the aviation industry, weather patterns and changes in technology.
 
GGS’s mobile deicing equipment business has historically been seasonal, with revenues typically being lower in the fourth and first fiscal quarters as commercial deicers are typically delivered prior to the winter season. The Company has continued its efforts to reduce GGS’s seasonal fluctuation in revenues and earnings by broadening its international and domestic customer base and its product line. In July 2009, GGS was awarded a new contract to supply deicing trucks to the USAF, which expired in July 2014. On May 15, 2014, GGS was awarded a new contract to supply deicing trucks to the USAF. This contract expired on July 13, 2018.
 
Last year, GGS sold one deicer, the pre-production unit for the ER 2875 model deicer under this contract, to the USAF under the above contract during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018 and the unit was accepted by the USAF. This year, GGS sold a total of 31 deicers under this contract including both GL 1800 and ER 2875 models, to the USAF under the above contract during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019 and all of the units were accepted by the USAF. Also, during this year, GGS has completed and delivered additional delivery orders from the USAF for both GL 1800 and ER 2875 models during the first quarter of fiscal year 2020.
 
Ground Support Services.

GAS provides aircraft ground support equipment, fleet, and facility maintenance services. At March 31, 2019, GAS was providing ground support equipment, fleet, and facility maintenance services to more than 145 customers at approximately 85 North American airports.
 
Approximately 18% and 24%, respectively, of GAS’s revenues in the fiscal years ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, were derived from services under a contract with LSG SkyChefs. The LSG SkyChefs contract was renegotiated as of January 1, 2019 from a fixed rate contract to a time and materials contract. The new contract includes a 60-day termination clause for either party. In addition, approximately 23% of GAS’s revenues for the fiscal years ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, were derived from services under a contract with Delta Airlines. In December 2016, Delta awarded GAS a five-year contract at 28 locations in connection with their periodic request-for-proposal (RFP) process. Most significantly, GAS was awarded the maintenance of the baggage handling system and passenger boarding bridges for Delta’s hub operation at the Minneapolis-St. Paul airport. At March 31, 2019, GAS had over 130 technicians serving Delta in 40 locations.
 
GAS competes primarily on the basis of the quality, reliability and pricing of its services. The market for ground support equipment and airport facility maintenance services is highly competitive and directly related to the financial health of the aviation industry. GAS’s maintenance service business is not materially seasonal.
 
Commercial Aircraft, Engines and Parts.
 
Contrail Aviation Support and Jet Yard, added during fiscal year 2017, AirCo, formed in May 2017 to acquire the business of the AirCo Sellers, and Worthington, added in May 2018, comprise the commercial aircraft, engines and parts segment of the Company’s operations. Contrail Aviation Support is a commercial aircraft trading, leasing and parts solutions provider. Its primary focus revolves around the CFM International CFM56-3/-5/-7 engines and the International Aero Engines V2500A5 engine, which power the two most prevalent narrow body, single aisle aircraft that are currently flown commercially—the Boeing 737 Classic / 737 NG and the Airbus A320 family. Contrail Aviation Support acquires commercial aircraft, jet engines and components for the purposes of trading, leasing and disassembly/overhaul. Contrail Aviation holds an ASA-100 accreditation from the Aviation Suppliers Association. Contrail Aviation’s operations are housed in a 21,000 square-foot office and warehouse facility in Verona, Wisconsin that is leased from an entity owned by the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of Contrail Aviation Support. As of March 31, 2019 and March 31, 2018, Contrail contributed approximately 38% and 15% of total consolidated revenue, respectively.

Jet Yard offers commercial aircraft storage, storage maintenance and aircraft disassembly/part-out services at facilities leased at the Pinal Air Park in Marana, Arizona. The prevailing climate in this area of Arizona provides conditions conducive to long-term storage of aircraft. Jet Yard is registered to operate a repair station under Part 145 of the regulations of the FAA and it leases approximately 48.5 acres of land under a lease agreement with Pinal County, Arizona. Jet Yard was organized in 2014, entered into the lease in June 2016 and had maintained de minimus operations from formation through the date it was acquired by the Company. The lease expires in May 2046 with an option to renew for an additional 30-year period (though the lease to a 2.6-acre parcel of the leased premises may be terminated by Pinal County upon 90 days’ notice). The lease provides for an initial annual rent of $27,000, which rental rate escalates based on a schedule in annual increments during the first seven years of the lease (at which time the annual rental rate would be $152,000) and increases by an additional five percent for each three-year period thereafter. Because the rental expense will be accounted for on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease, the rental expense in the initial years will exceed the corresponding cash payments. The lease agreement permits Pinal County to terminate the lease if Jet Yard fails to make substantial progress toward the construction of facilities on the leased premises in phases in accordance with a specified timetable, which includes, as the initial phase, the construction of a demolition pad to be completed by March 2017 and, as the final and most significant phase, the construction of an aircraft maintenance hangar large enough to house a Boeing B777-300 by the first quarter of 2021. The construction of the demolition pad specified under the lease has not been completed, and Jet Yard and Pinal County are in discussions with respect to improvements on the leased premises. As of the date of issuance, Pinal County is still working on the rezoning of Pinal Airpark, which prevents any tenant from construction on the Airpark.
 
AirCo operates an established business offering commercial aircraft parts sales, exchanges, procurement services, consignment programs and overhaul and repair services. Its repair station and support facility hold FAA and European Aviation Safety Agency certifications covering aircraft instrumentation, avionics and a range of accessories for civilian, military transport, regional/commuter and business/commercial jet and turboprop aircraft. Customers of AirCo include airlines and commercial aircraft leasing companies. AirCo operates at a 20,000 square-foot facility leased from a trust owned by 2 minority shareholders of the AirCo Seller. The trust is not involved in the conduct of AirCo business. The lease duration is one year with an option for AirCo to extend the lease up to four additional one-year periods at the same terms.
 
Worthington supplies spare parts, repair programs and aircraft maintenance services to the global aviation community. Worthington offers a globally networked infrastructure and 24/7 support, ensuring fast delivery of spare parts and service, with four locations strategically located in the United States, United Kingdom & Australia. In addition, Worthington provides composite aircraft structures, repair and support services. As a strategic resource for flight control, exhaust system and line replacement components, Worthington offers a wide array of services for complex operations.
 
Printing Equipment and Maintenance.

The Company determined that for accounting purposes, it had obtained control over Delphax in conjunction with the acquisition of the equity and debt interests on November 24, 2015 and has consolidated Delphax in Air T’s consolidated financial statements beginning on November 24, 2015. Delphax’s business has included the design, manufacture and sale of advanced digital print production equipment (including high-speed, high-volume cut-sheet and continuous roll-fed printers), maintenance contracts, spare parts, supplies and consumable items for these systems. The equipment, spare parts, supplies and consumable items have been manufactured, and maintenance and services have been provided by Delphax Canada Technologies Limited (“Delphax Canada”) and such products and services have been sold through Delphax, Delphax Canada and Delphax subsidiaries located in Canada, the United Kingdom and France. A significant portion of Delphax’s net sales has historically been related to service and support provided after the sale, including the sale of consumable items for installed printing systems. Delphax’s legacy consumables production business had been expected to generate cash flow while Delphax rolled-out its next generation elan® commercial inkjet printer.
 
Upon petition by the Company, on August 8, 2017 the Ontario Superior Court of Justice in Bankruptcy and Insolvency adjudged Delphax Canada to be bankrupt. As a result, Delphax Canada ceased to have capacity to deal with its property, which then vested in the trustee in bankruptcy of Delphax Canada subject to the rights of secured creditors. As of March 31, 2019, the bankruptcy proceedings were ongoing in accordance with Canadian law and, therefore, Delphax Canada was still the primary obligor of its liabilities.

Air T has contributed certain of the assets acquired in foreclosure to a subsidiary, Delphax Solutions, Inc. (“Delphax Solutions”), which has contracted with Delphax to make available for purchase legacy parts and consumables, as well as to serve as a temporary fulfilment provider to Delphax for logistics and sales order processing. In addition, Delphax Solutions intends to pursue market success for the elan® printer system, as Delphax is no longer actively selling its product lines. Delphax Solutions has entered into an agreement with Delphax for a license of intellectual property and rights to the elan® printing system and technologies in return for royalties based on sales. Delphax Solutions intends to pursue sales of the elan® printing system and related product lines both directly and through qualified resellers and agents. As of March 31, 2019 and March 31, 2018, revenue for this segment was approximately $0.7 million and $6.1 million, respectively.
 
Backlog.
 
GGS’s backlog consists of “firm” orders supported by customer purchase orders for the equipment sold by GGS. At March 31, 2019, GGS’s backlog of orders was $26.1 million, all of which GGS expects to be filled in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2020. At March 31, 2018, GGS’s backlog of orders was $13.3 million. Backlog is not meaningful for the Company’s other business segments.
Governmental Regulation.
 
The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to regulation by various governmental agencies.
 
The Department of Transportation (“DOT”) has the authority to regulate air service. The DOT has authority to investigate and institute proceedings to enforce its economic regulations, and may, in certain circumstances, assess civil penalties, revoke operating authority and seek criminal sanctions.
 
Under the Aviation and Transportation Security Act of 2001, as amended, the Transportation Security Administration (“TSA”), an agency within the Department of Homeland Security, has responsibility for aviation security. The TSA requires MAC and CSA to comply with a Full All-Cargo Aircraft Operator Standard Security Plan, which contains evolving and strict security requirements. These requirements are not static but change periodically as the result of regulatory and legislative requirements, imposing additional security costs and creating a level of uncertainty for our operations. It is reasonably possible that these rules or other future security requirements could impose material costs on us.
 
The FAA has safety jurisdiction over flight operations generally, including flight equipment, flight and ground personnel training, examination and certification, certain ground facilities, flight equipment maintenance programs and procedures, examination and certification of mechanics, flight routes, air traffic control and communications and other matters. The FAA is concerned with safety and the regulation of flight operations generally, including equipment used, ground facilities, maintenance, communications and other matters. The FAA can suspend or revoke the authority of air carriers or their licensed personnel for failure to comply with its regulations and can ground aircraft if questions arise concerning airworthiness. The FAA also has power to suspend or revoke for cause the certificates it issues and to institute proceedings for imposition and collection of fines for violation of federal aviation regulations. The Company, through its subsidiaries, holds all operating airworthiness and other FAA certificates that are currently required for the conduct of its business, although these certificates may be suspended or revoked for cause. The FAA periodically conducts routine reviews of MAC and CSA’s operating procedures and flight and maintenance records.
 
In September 2010, the FAA proposed rules that would significantly reduce the maximum number of hours on duty and increase the minimum amount of rest time for our pilots, and thus require us to hire additional pilots and modify certain of our aircraft. When the FAA issued final regulations in December 2011, all-cargo carriers, including MAC and CSA, were exempt from these new pilot fatigue requirements, and instead were required to continue complying with previously enacted flight and duty time rules. In December 2012, the FAA reaffirmed the exclusion of all cargo carriers from the new rule. It is reasonably possible, however, that future security or flight safety requirements could impose material costs on us.
 
The FAA has authority under the Noise Control Act of 1972, as amended, to monitor and regulate aircraft engine noise. The aircraft operated by the Company are in compliance with all such regulations promulgated by the FAA. Moreover, because the Company does not operate jet aircraft, noncompliance is not likely. Aircraft operated by us also comply with standards for aircraft exhaust emissions promulgated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) pursuant to the Clean Air Act of 1970, as amended.
 
Jet Yard and AirCo operate repair stations licensed under Part 145 of the regulations of the FAA. These certifications must be renewed annually, or in certain circumstances within 24 months. Certified repair stations are subject to periodic FAA inspection and audit. The repair station may not be relocated without written approval from the FAA.
 
Because of the extensive use of radio and other communication facilities in its aircraft operations, the Company is also subject to the Federal Communications Act of 1934, as amended.

Maintenance and Insurance.
 
The Company, through its subsidiaries, is required to maintain the aircraft it operates under the appropriate FAA and manufacturer standards and regulations.
 
The Company has secured public liability and property damage insurance in excess of minimum amounts required by the United States Department of Transportation.
 
The Company maintains cargo liability insurance, workers’ compensation insurance and fire and extended coverage insurance for owned and leased facilities and equipment. In addition, the Company maintains product liability insurance with respect to injuries and loss arising from use of products sold and services provided.
 
In March 2014, the Company formed SAIC, a captive insurance company licensed in Utah. SAIC insures risks of the Company and its subsidiaries that were not previously insured by the various Company insurance programs (including the risk of loss of key customers and contacts, administrative actions and regulatory changes); and may from time to time underwrite third-party risk through certain reinsurance arrangements. SAIC is included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
 
Employees.
 
At March 31, 2019, the Company and its subsidiaries had 769 full-time and full-time-equivalent employees. None of the employees of the Company or any of its subsidiaries are represented by labor unions. The Company believes its relations with its employees are good.
