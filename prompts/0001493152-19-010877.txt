Item 1. Description of Business.
 
History and Development of the Company
 
2050 Motors, Inc. has an agreement, subject to minimum sales requirements, to import, market and sell in the United States, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Territories and Peru, the “e-Go” lightweight carbon fiber all-electric vehicle (“EV”) design and electric light truck to be manufactured by Jiangsu Aoxin New Energy Automobile Co., Ltd. (“Aoxin Automobile”) located in the People’s Republic of China (“PRC”). Aoxin Automobile was a wholly owned subsidiary of Dongfeng Motor Corporation (“Dongfeng Motor”), which is one of the largest automobile manufacturers in China, producing over 3.76 million cars and trucks in 2012. Aoxin Automobile was funded by Dongfeng Motor to develop and manufacture a lightweight, efficient, carbon fiber e-Go EV electric car (“e-Go”). Dongfeng Motor, over a five-year period, invested a substantial amount of money to develop, with the support of Italian engineers, a new carbon fiber technology to produce auto parts at a significantly reduced cost. They also developed a lightweight aluminum racing frame for the e-Go.
 
In 2014, Yancheng Municipal State-Owned Asset Investment Group, Co. Ltd. (“YMSIG”), an investment and property development company founded by the Yancheng Municipal Government, purchased Aoxin Automobile from Dongfeng Motor, Co. Ltd. YMSIG made major investments in Aoxin, which funded on a fast track schedule the completion of the e-Go automobile manufacturing facility that culminated in a grand opening ceremony on January 20, 2015.
 
The e-Go is a five-passenger sedan that weighs only 1,450 pounds with its battery pack included. It was designed to be the first vehicle of its advanced type to be sold in the price range of less than $35,000. It will have a unique lightweight carbon fiber body built on an aluminum frame. It will be the only production line EV with a carbon fiber body manufactured by a new process that uses robotics to produce parts, which significantly reduces the production time and cost of carbon fiber components. The carbon fiber composite material is five times stronger than steel and one third the weight.
 
In accordance with the agreement signed with Aoxin Automobile, which was previously exclusive, in order to maintain rights for the United States, the Company is required to purchase and sell a certain number of e-Go vehicles per year for a certain period of time starting from the completion of the requirements established by the United States Department of Transportation’s (“US DOT”) protocols for the e-Go. The required number of vehicles that the company needs to sell per year are as follows: Year 1 - 2,000 vehicles; Year 2 - 6,000 vehicles; Year 3 - 12,000 vehicles; Year 4 - 24,000 vehicles and Year 5 - 48,000 vehicles.
 
The contract between 2050 Motors and Aoxin Automobile requires that 2050 Motors completes crash testing according to US DOT safety standards with a certified full-scale crash testing facility.
 
Two demonstration vehicles were received from Aoxin in the fourth quarter of 2015. One of the demonstration vehicles was showcased to the American public at the William Carr Gallery in Las Vegas, Nevada. This vehicle remained for public viewing at the gallery until April 30, 2016. 2050 Motors intends to eventually crash test eight (8) e-Go vehicles at a certified testing Facility. However, before this is done, design of the airbags must also be completed by Aoxin Automobile. Aoxin is currently designing an airbag system for the e-Go; however, 2050 Motors cannot predict at this time whether the airbag system will suffice for the U.S. market and/or may require additional airbags for successful crash testing. In addition, Aoxin Automobile has stated that the e-Go will be equipped with US DOT approved parts and equipment including windshields, tires, braking systems, and related. 2050 Motors does not know at the present time if all the equipment on the e-Go will be US DOT compliant, and 2050 Motors may or may not have to re-equip the parts, if any, either in China or the United States.
 
During the year 2013, both engineers in the United States and in China collaborated on many aspects of the e-Go to meet or surpass the US DOT’s standards. These modifications have been incorporated into the e-Go. One of these modifications was to specifically address a new crash test which is not yet required in the United States. This test, created by the leading insurance industry group IIHS, is called the “overlap test” which insurance companies are trying to adopt into the standard automobile crash test program. The crash test consists of a vehicle to be submitted under new safety standards for front-end collisions in which 25% of the front end, on the driver’s side, strikes a 5-foot-tall barrier at 40 mph. The overlap test has proven to be very difficult for present automobiles on the road to pass. In fact, thirteen automobiles produced by the top end manufacturers such as Mercedes, Audi and other market leaders have either failed or done very poorly in this crash test sequence.

2050 Motors intends to import components completely fabricated and manufactured in China from Aoxin Automobile and will set up an assembly plant to utilize American labor and OEM’s in the facility. All the e-Go’s parts and equipment must be DOT approved. Aoxin Automobile has made every effort to build the e-Go according to American standards; however, there is no certainty that all the parts will be US DOT approved. 2050 Motors may elect to secure replacement parts here in the United States or in China for manufacturing or installation of components either in the United States or in China, if required.
 
In October 2017, a delegation from 2050 Motors went to visit Aoxin Automobile to lay out the plans for assembly of the e-Go in the United States. 2050 decided to assemble the vehicles in the United States because of a delay by Aoxin in obtaining their license to export fully assembled electric vehicles to 2050 Motors in the United States according to our contract arrangements. While 2050 Motors was planning this relatively complex assembly plant, the United States and China entered a tariff battle which would require products from China to be taxed at a 25% rate. This development has put 2050 Motors plans on hold as it tries to evaluate how these new policies impact the end-price for the vehicles in the United States.
 
2050 Motors intends to initially sell the e-Go to a network of customers primarily in the Las Vegas area. 2050 Motors plans to establish a service and parts center which would be separate from the showroom. The showroom facility will be at an area with a high volume of people in Las Vegas, where visitors to the city can directly view the e-Go. 2050 Motors may also elect to sell the e-Go at selected distributors in the Las Vegas Area, which have already provided letters of interest. 2050 Motors’ initial plan is to sell the vehicles in large cities in the Southwest United States such as Las Vegas which has a metropolitan population of approximately 1.9 million people.
 
2050 Motors is a development stage company with no operating history and may never be able to carry out its business plan or achieve any revenues or profitability. 2050 Motors was established in October 2012 and has not generated any revenues, nor has the Company realized any profit from its operations to date and there is little likelihood that we will generate any revenues or realize any profits in the long term. Any profitability in the future from 2050’s business will be dependent upon the successful marketing and sales of the e-Go. Accordingly, 2050 Motors’ prospects must be considered in light of the risks, expenses, and difficulties frequently encountered in establishing a new business, especially one in the automobile industry, and therefore it is a highly speculative venture involving significant financial risk.
 
We are completely dependent on Aoxin Automobile to supply us with the e-Go and other trucks and automobiles and parts and components thereto. The inability of Aoxin Automobile to continue to deliver, or their refusal to deliver such vehicles and parts at prices and volumes acceptable to us, would have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects and operating results. Changes in business conditions, global financial instability, trade wars, governmental changes, and other factors beyond our control or which we do not presently anticipate, could also affect Aoxin Automobile’s ability to deliver vehicles and/or parts on a timely basis and cause material adverse consequences to 2050 Motors.
 
Subsequent to year-end 2018, the Company announced an expanded plan to incubate businesses in the electric vehicle, communications, power and lighting, and Internet markets. Please see subsequent events for additional information on developments announced after December31, 2018.
