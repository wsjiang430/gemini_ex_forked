DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
 
Overview
 
Infinity Energy Resources, Inc. (the “Company,” “we,” “ours,” and “us”) is an independent energy company whose principal business plan is pursuing an oil and gas exploration opportunity offshore of Nicaragua in the Caribbean Sea. On March 5, 2009, the Nicaraguan government granted us the concessions to explore approximately 1.4 million acres offshore Nicaragua. Since such point we have focused our efforts primarily on these Concessions. Previously we were engaged in the acquisition, exploration and development of natural gas and oil properties in the United States. We ceased all domestic oil and gas exploration and production in the United States by December 2009.
 
The Company is assessing various opportunities and strategic alternatives (the “Strategic Alternatives”) involving the acquisition, exploration and development of natural gas and oil properties in the United States, including the possibility of acquiring businesses or assets that provide support services for the production of oil and gas in the United States.
 
The Company must obtain new sources of debt and/or equity capital to fund the substantial needs enumerated above, as well as satisfying its existing debt obligations. It is attempting to obtain extensions of the maturity date for its outstanding debt; however, there can be no assurance that it will be able to do so or what the final terms will be if the lenders agree to such extensions. Further, the Company can provide no assurance that it will be able to obtain sufficient new debt/equity capital to pursue any Strategic Alternatives it may consider.
 
Nicaragua
 
We began pursuing an oil and gas exploration opportunity offshore Nicaragua in the Caribbean Sea in 1999. Since such time, we built relationships with the Instituto Nicaraguense de Energia (“INE”) and undertook the geological and geophysical research that helped us to become one of only six companies qualified to bid on offshore blocks in the first international bidding round held by INE in January 2003.
 
On March 5, 2009, we signed the contracts granting us the Perlas and Tyra concession blocks offshore Nicaragua (the “Nicaraguan Concessions” or “Concessions”). Since our acquisition of the Nicaraguan Concessions, we have conducted an environmental study and developed geological information from the reprocessing and additional evaluation of existing 2-D seismic data acquired over our Perlas and Tyra concession blocks. In April 2013, the Nicaraguan government formally approved our Environmental Impact Assessment, at which time we commenced significant activity under the initial work plan involving the acquisition of new seismic data on the two Nicaraguan Concessions. We undertook seismic shoots during late 2013 that resulted in the acquisition of new 2-D and 3-D seismic data and have reviewed it to select initial drilling sites for exploratory wells.
 
The Company has had a history of losses. It has a significant working capital deficit, notes payable that are in default and is experiencing substantial liquidity issues. In addition, the Company’s most significant asset and its business plan is focused on the exploration and development of the Nicaraguan Concessions, which are now in default and in risk of being terminated. The Company is now exploring domestic opportunities to utilize its expertise in oil and gas exploration and production including oil field services. The Company may direct its efforts and resources to developing a domestic oil and gas industry asset base through the acquisition of small oil and gas leases/properties and/or oil and gas services businesses in 2019 and beyond.

The Company has relied on raising debt and equity capital to fund its ongoing maintenance/expenditure obligations under the Nicaraguan Concession, its day-to-day operations and corporate overhead because it has generated no operating revenues or cash flows in recent years. The $1.0 million December 2013 Note (See Note 3) matured in April 2016 and is currently in default and five other notes payable with principal balances of $338,125 as of December 3, 2018 are now either due on demand or currently in default. The Company is seeking resolutions to these defaults, including extensions of the maturity date for these notes payable; however, there can be no assurance that it will be able to obtain such extensions or what the final terms will be if the lenders agree to such extensions.
 
The Company was in default of various provisions of the 30-year Concession for both Perlas and Tyra blocks as of December 31, 2018, including (1) the drilling of at least one exploratory well on the Perlas Block; (2) the shooting of additional seismic on the Tyra Block; (3) the provision of the Ministry of Energy with the required letters of credit in the amounts totaling $1,356,227 for the Perlas block and $278,450 for the Tyra block for exploration requirements on the leases; (4) payment of the 2016, 2017 and 2018 area fees required for both the Perlas and Tyra which total approximately $167,000; and (5) payment of the 2016, 2017 and 2018 training fees required for both the Perlas and Tyra totaling approximately $300,000. The Company is seeking to extend, renew and/or renegotiate the terms of the Nicaraguan Concessions with the Nicaraguan government to cure the defaults. The Company has encountered challenges in this regard because of the political situation in Nicaragua. There can be no assurance whether it will be able to extend, renew and/or renegotiate the Nicaraguan Concessions and whether any new terms will be favorable to the Company. The Company must raise substantial amounts of debt and equity capital from other sources in the immediate future in order to fund the requirements noted above plus finance (i) the shooting of additional seismic on the Tyra Block of the Nicaraguan Concessions if it is unable to negotiate a waiver of such requirement from the Nicaraguan government; (ii) normal day-to-day operations and corporate overhead; and (iii) outstanding debt and other financial obligations as they become due, including the $1.0 million December 2013 Note, and the five notes payable totaling $338,125, which are either due on demand or currently in default and the Replacement Note, if issued. These are substantial operational and financial issues that must be successfully addressed during 2019 or the Company’s ability to satisfy the conditions necessary to maintain its Nicaragua Concessions will be in significant doubt.
 
The Company is seeking new sources of debt and equity capital to fund the substantial needs enumerated above. The Company is attempting to obtain extensions of the maturity dates for its debt or compromises of the debt. There can be no assurance that it will be able to obtain such funding or extensions or what terms.
 
Due to the uncertainties related to these matters, there exists substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date the financials are issued. The financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of asset carrying amounts or the amount and classification of liabilities that might result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.
 
Senior Convertible Note and Warrant Private Placement
 
On May 7, 2015 we completed the private placement with an institutional investor of a $12.0 million principal amount Senior Convertible Note (the “Convertible Note”) and a Warrant (the “Warrant”) exercisable to purchase 1,800,000 shares of our common stock (the “May 2015 Private Placement”). The Convertible Note ranks senior to our existing and future indebtedness and is secured by all our assets, excluding the Nicaraguan Concessions. At the closing, such investor acquired the Convertible Note by paying $450,000 in cash and issuing a secured promissory note, secured by cash, with an aggregate initial principal amount of $9,550,000 (the “Investor Note”). Assuming all amounts payable to us under the Investor Note were paid without any offset or default, the May 2015 Private Placement would have resulted in gross proceeds of $10.0 million before Placement Agent fees and other expenses associated with the transaction, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. We used the initial proceeds from the closing to retire certain outstanding obligations, including delinquent 2015 area and training fees of approximately $155,000 owed to the Nicaraguan government relating to our Nicaragua Concessions, and to provide additional working capital.

On May 4, 2017, the Investor notified the Company that it elected to effect an Investor Optional Offset under Section 7(a) of the Investor Note of the full $9,490,000 principal amount outstanding under the Investor Note against $9,490,000 in aggregate principal outstanding under the Convertible Note. It did so by surrendering and concurrently cancelling $9,490,000 in aggregate principal of the Convertible Note in exchange for the satisfaction in full and cancellation of the Investor Note. The Convertible Note had an aggregate outstanding principal balance of $11,687,231 as of the date of the exchange. The Investor requested the Company to deliver a new convertible note (the “Replacement Note”) with respect to the remaining principal balance of $2,197,231 to replace the Convertible Note. The Replacement Note provides for a one-year maturity from May 7, 2017, a conversion price of $0.50 per share and is due in monthly installment payments through May 2018 either in cash or stock, among other terms. The Company continues to negotiate with the Investor regarding the issuance of the Replacement Note under the terms of the financing and taking into consideration that the Investor only funded $510,000 in the entire transaction, but there can be no assurance that it will be successful in this regard.
 
Business Strategy
 
Our principal objective is to create stockholder value through the development of our Nicaraguan Concessions. We commenced significant activity under the initial work plan and received formal governmental approval of the environmental study in 2013. We have used previously existing reprocessed 2-D seismic data to identify or evaluate the prospects. We had additional 2-D and 3-D seismic mapping done on the Concessions to provide additional data. We have reviewed the data to evaluate the potential oil and gas producing structures and select initial drilling sites for exploratory wells. We have not moved forward due to insufficient capital and necessary Nicaraguan government approvals. We are considering Strategic Alternatives in addition to the Nicaraguan Concessions.
 
We intend to finance our business strategy through external financing, which may include debt and equity capital raised in public and private offerings, joint ventures, sale of working or other interests, employment of working capital and cash flow from operations, if any. We completed the May 2015 Private Placement described below. We continue to seek new sources of debt and equity capital in order to fund the substantial needs enumerated above and are considering our Strategic Alternatives; however, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such capital or obtain it on favorable terms or within the timeframe necessary to cure the defaults existing on the Nicaraguan Concessions or to meet our requirements relative to drilling the exploratory wells or meet our other obligations or effect any transaction as part of our Strategic Alternatives. Finally, given the economic and political turmoil currently existing in Nicaragua we are not actively engaged with the Nicaraguan Government to negotiate a way to proceed with the planned exploration and development of the Nicaraguan Concessions. When the current turmoil is resolved and the unrest ceases in Nicaragua we plan to continue seeking joint venture or working interest partners for exploratory drilling operations on the Nicaraguan Concessions. In this connection we may seek offers from other industry operators for interests in the acreage in exchange for cash and a carried interest in exploration and development operations or other strategic partnership.
 
Exploration and Development - Nicaraguan Concessions
 
Preliminary analyses and interpretation of available 2-D seismic data by independent consultants has revealed that the Nica-Tinkham Ridge, the single most important structure in the basin, traverses both of the blocks (Tyra and Perlas) in the Concessions and controlled the deposition of Eocene and possibly younger reef systems. Such preliminary analyses have identified four prospects covering a total of over 547 square miles. Our consultants, Brazilian-based Consultoria em Geologia Geofísica e Informática do Petróleo LTDA (“CGGIP”) and its senior geological consultant, Luciano Seixas Chagas, working in concert with Thompson & Knight Global Energy Services LLC, are building a credible model suggesting that the Eocene geologic zone alone has a potential that hydrocarbons could be present, based upon certain assumptions involving porosity, saturation, recovery and other parameters. This model is also subject to the complex geology of the region and the fact that the reef system has never been drilled. The model is based upon preliminary conclusions and is subject to further analysis of our more recent 2-D and 3-D seismic data and interpretation, and various assumptions that cannot be confirmed or disproved until the prospects are drilled. We believe the model supports our long-held belief that the Nicaraguan Concessions have the potential for oil discoveries, although we can offer no assurances in this regard.

In April 2011, we filed with the Nicaraguan government an Environmental Impact Assessment (“EIA”) covering proposed seismic activities on our Nicaraguan Concessions. The filing of the EIA was followed by a comment period during which there was interaction between us the Ministerio del Ambiente y los Recursos Naturales de Nicaragua, an agency of the Nicaraguan government; and the autonomous regions of Nicaragua that are nearest to the Nicaraguan Concessions. In April 2013 the EIA was formally approved by the Nicaraguan government and we were cleared to commence 2-D and 3-D seismic mapping activities in the area. In late 2013 and early 2014 CGG Services (US) Inc. – NASA, a fully integrated Geoscience company that provides geological, geophysical and reservoir services to the global oil and gas industry, conducted 2-D and 3-D seismic data covering selected areas within the boundaries of the Nicaraguan Concessions. In March 2014 we opened a seismic data room at CGG’s Houston headquarters in order for potential strategic and/or financial partners to view the fully processed results of the seismic survey activities conducted by CGG.
 
The final approval of the EIA by the Nicaraguan government of our environment impact study on April 13, 2013, began Sub-Period 2 for both the Tyra and Perlas Blocks as defined in the Nicaraguan Concessions. The Company believes it has satisfied the acquisition, processing and interpretation of Seismic data required in Sub-Period 2 for both the Perlas and Tyra Blocks. Therefore, it is now in Sub-Period 3 of the exploration phase of the 30-year Concession for both Perlas and Tyra as of June 30, 2015. Sub-Period 3 of the Nicaraguan Concessions required the drilling of at least one exploratory well on the Perlas Block during 2016 and the shooting of additional seismic on the Tyra Block. The Company needs to identify at least one potential drilling site on the Perlas block as required in Sub-Period 3 and will have to perform supplemental EIA work prior to requesting and receiving the permit to drill from the Nicaraguan government. The work plan on the Tyra Block for Sub-Period 3 requires the Company to shoot additional seismic, which is estimated to cost approximately $2,500,000 prior to the commencement of exploratory drilling. The Company is negotiating with the Nicaraguan government to seek a waiver of the additional seismic mapping on the Tyra Block so that it can proceed with exploratory drilling. There can be no assurance whether it will be able to obtain such waiver of the requirement.
 
During late December 2013, we completed the 2-D seismic survey activities in the area as required under both Nicaraguan Concessions at that point. We believe that the newly acquired 2-D seismic data, together with the previously acquired reprocessed 2-D seismic, has helped us to further evaluate the structures that were previously identified with 2-D seismic in the Eocene Zone. Our geological consultants have estimated that these Eocene structures may contain recoverable hydrocarbons (principally oil) in place. In addition, the new 2-D seismic acquired in 2013 provided our first geological information regarding the potential for oil resources in the Cretaceous Zone, which we could not evaluate using less precise older 2-D seismic mapping. We have identified multiple promising sites on the Perlas Block for exploratory drilling and are planning the drilling of initial exploratory wells to determine the existence of commercial hydrocarbon reserves. We believe that we have performed all work necessary to proceed to Sub-Period 3 for the Perlas Block as defined in the Nicaraguan Concessions, which required the drilling of at least one exploratory well on the Perlas Block in 2016. We must first prepare and submit a supplemental EIA to the Nicaraguan government before the drilling permit can be issued on the Perlas Block.
 
The Nicaraguan Government has yet to receive the EIA supplement and may or may not issue the drilling permit; given the status of the Nicaraguan Concessions. The Company will likely have to negotiate with Nicaraguan government new terms and deadlines with regard to the Concessions. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to negotiate new terms and deadlines with the Nicaraguan Government in order to maintain the concessions.
 
The Company was in default of various provisions of the 30-year Concession for both Perlas and Tyra blocks as of December 31, 2018, as noted above, and must raise substantial amounts of debt and equity capital from other sources in the immediate future in order to fund expenses relating to the Concessions. These are substantial operational and financial issues that must be successfully addressed during 2019 or the Company’s ability to satisfy the conditions necessary to maintain and/or renegotiate its Nicaragua Concessions will be in significant doubt.

Costs incurred during the year ended December 31, 2018 in connection with the Company’s oil and gas acquisition, exploration and development activities are shown below.
 

 | Year ended December 31, 2018 | 
---------------------------------+------------------------------+--------
Property acquisition costs: | | 
Proved | $ | — 
Unproved | | 
Total property acquisition costs | | — 
Development costs | | — 
Exploration costs | | 155,584
Total costs | $ | 155,584

 
Exploration costs during the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily related to area Concession and training fees which are accrued to be paid to the Nicaraguan Government for 2018. All costs related to the Nicaraguan Concessions have been expensed as incurred during the year ended December 31, 2018 as the Concessions are in default status and the Nicaraguan Concession assets are considered to be impaired and fully reserved as of December 31, 2018 and 2017.
 
Aggregate capitalized costs relating to the Company’s oil and gas producing activities, and related accumulated depreciation, depletion, impairment and amortization are as follows:

Net capitalized costs | $ | — | | | $ | — | 

 
Management has performed its impairment tests on its oil and gas properties as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, has concluded that a full impairment reserve should be provided on the costs capitalized for its unproved oil and gas properties consisting solely of the Nicaraguan Concessions. Therefore, an impairment charge of $9,720,666 was charged to operations during the year ended December 31, 2015 which reduced the carrying amount of oil and gas properties to zero. The Nicaraguan Concessions remained fully impaired as of December 31, 2018 and 2017. The current environment for oil and gas development projects, especially discoveries in otherwise undeveloped regions of the world, is very challenging given the depressed commodity prices for oil and gas products and the resulting industry-wide reduction in capital expenditure budgets for exploration and development projects. This may provide substantial impediments for the Company and its ability to obtain adequate financing to fund the exploration and development of its Nicaraguan projects and the overall economic viability of the Concessions should hydrocarbons be discovered in commercial quantities.
 
The following charts set forth the minimum work programs required under for the Perlas and Tyra blocks comprising the Concessions in order for the Company to retain them unless it is successful in obtaining extensions, renewals or the renegotiation of the entire Concessions Agreements for the Perlas and Tyra blocks.

The Company is in default of the current minimum work plan and is attempting to extend or renegotiate the requirements in order to cure the defaults and maintain the Concessions. There can be no assurance that it will be successful in negotiating such extensions and/or renegotiate the Concessions.
 
Competition
 
We compete in virtually all facets of our businesses with numerous other companies in the oil and gas industry, including many that have significantly greater financial and other resources. Such competitors will be able to pay more for desirable oil and gas leases and to evaluate, bid for, and purchase a greater number of properties than our financial or personnel resources permit.

Our business strategy includes highly competitive oil and natural gas exploration, development and production. We face intense competition from a large number of independent exploration and development companies as well as major oil and gas companies in a number of areas such as obtaining the capital necessary to pursue our Nicaraguan Concessions and seeking to acquire the services, equipment, labor and materials necessary to explore, operate and develop those properties. Most of our competitors have financial and technological resources substantially exceeding those available to us. We cannot be sure that we will be successful in developing and operating profitable the Concessions in the face of this competition.
 
Government Regulation of the Oil and Gas Industry
 
General
 
Our business is affected by numerous laws and regulations, including, among others, laws and regulations relating to energy, environment, conservation and tax. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and/or criminal penalties, the imposition of injunctive relief or both. Moreover, changes in any of these laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business. In view of the many uncertainties with respect to current and future laws and regulations, including their applicability to us, we cannot predict the overall effect of such laws and regulations on our future operations.
 
If we commence operations in Nicaragua we will be subject to legal and regulatory oversight by its energy-related agencies, such as the Nicaraguan Energy Institute, with respect to its energy or hydrocarbons laws. In such case, from time to time, in varying degrees, political developments and federal and state laws and regulations affect our operations in Nicaragua. In particular, price controls, taxes and other laws relating to the crude oil and natural gas industry, changes in these laws and changes in administrative regulations have affected and in the future could affect crude oil and natural gas production, operations and economics. We cannot predict how Nicaraguan agencies or courts will interpret existing laws and regulations or the effect these adoptions and interpretations may have on our business or financial condition at that point.
 
Our business will also be subject to laws and regulations promulgated by federal and local authorities, including the Ministry of Energy and Mines, relating to the exploration for, and the development, production and marketing of, crude oil and natural gas, as well as safety matters. Legal requirements may be frequently changed and subject to interpretation and we are unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance with these requirements or their effect on our future operations in Nicaragua. In such event, we may be required to make significant expenditures to comply with governmental laws and regulations.
 
Further, future operations in Nicaragua will be subject to complex federal and local environmental laws and regulations. The discharge of natural gas, crude oil, or other pollutants into the air, soil or water may give rise to significant liabilities on our part to government agencies and third parties and may require us to incur substantial costs of remediation. In addition, in the future we may incur costs and penalties in addressing regulatory agency procedures involving instances of possible non-compliance.
 
The following discussion contains summaries of certain laws and regulations and is qualified as mentioned above.
 
Environmental and Land Use Regulation
 
Various federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment affect our operations and costs. The areas affected include:
 

● | unit production expenses primarily related to the control and limitation of air emissions, spill prevention and the disposal of produced water; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | capital costs to drill development wells resulting from expenses primarily related to the management and disposal of drilling fluids and other oil and natural gas exploration wastes; 
● | capital costs to construct, maintain and upgrade equipment and facilities; 


● | operational costs associated with ongoing compliance and monitoring activities; and 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | exit costs for operations that we are responsible for closing, including costs for dismantling and abandoning wells and remediating environmental impacts.

The environmental and land use laws and regulations affecting oil and natural gas operations have been changed frequently in the past, and in general, these changes have imposed more stringent requirements that increase operating costs and/or require capital expenditures to remain in compliance. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in civil and/or criminal fines and liability for non-compliance, clean-up costs and other environmental damages. It is also possible that unanticipated developments or changes in law could cause us to make environmental expenditures significantly greater than those we currently expect.
 
The following is a summary discussion of the framework of key environmental and land use regulations and requirements affecting oil and natural gas exploration, development, production and transportation operations.
 
Operating Hazards and Insurance
 
The oil and natural gas business involves a variety of operating risks. We were unable to maintain insurance against such potential risks and losses.
 
In addition, pollution and environmental risks are not insured. If a significant accident or other event occurs not covered by insurance, it could adversely affect us.
Employees
 
We have two employees, our CEO and CFO, whose salaries have been deferred. We also use outside contractors to perform services.
