  Company Overview
 
 ChromaDex is a science-based integrated nutraceutical company devoted to improving the way people age. ChromaDex scientists partner with leading universities and research institutions worldwide to discover, develop and create products to deliver the full potential of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide ("NAD") and its impact on human health.
 
 NAD is an essential coenzyme and a key regulator of cellular metabolism. Best known for its role in cellular adenosine triphosphate ("ATP") production, NAD is now thought to play an important role in healthy aging. Many cellular functions related to health and healthy aging are sensitive to levels of locally available NAD and this represents an active area of research in the field of NAD.
  
 NAD levels are not constant, and in humans, NAD levels have been shown to decline by more than 50% from young adulthood to middle age. NAD continues to decline as humans grow older. There are other causes of reduced NAD levels such as over-nutrition, alcohol consumption and a number of disease states. NAD may also be increased, including through calorie restriction and exercise. Healthy aging, mitochondria and NAD continue to be areas of focus in the research community. In 2018, there were over 160 studies on NAD. The areas of study include Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, neuropathy and heart failure.
  
 In 2013, ChromaDex commercialized NIAGEN® nicotinamide riboside ("NR"), a novel form of vitamin B3. Data from numerous animal studies, and confirmed in human clinical trials, show that NR is a highly efficient NAD precursor that significantly raises NAD levels. NIAGEN® is safe for human consumption with no adverse side effects. NIAGEN® has twice been successfully reviewed under FDA's new dietary ingredient (“NDI”) notification program, and has also been successfully notified to the FDA as generally recognized as safe (“GRAS”). Animal studies of NIAGEN® have demonstrated a variety of outcomes ranging from increased NAD levels, increased cellular metabolism and energy production to improvements in insulin sensitivity. NIAGEN® is the trade name for our proprietary ingredient NR, and is protected by patents to which we are the exclusive licensee.
 
 ChromaDex is the world leader in the emerging NAD space. ChromaDex has approximately 170 partnerships with leading universities and research institutions around the world including the National Institutes of Health, Cornell, Dartmouth, Harvard, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, University of Cambridge and the Mayo Clinic. Other relationships are currently being developed.
 
 Our scientific advisory board is led by Chairman Dr. Roger Kornberg, Nobel Laureate Stanford Professor, Dr. Charles Brenner, one of the world’s recognized experts in NAD and inventor of nicotinamide riboside, Dr. Rudi Tanzi, the co-chair of the department of neurology at Harvard Medical School and one of the world’s leading experts in food and nutrition, Sir John Walker, Nobel Laureate and Emeritus Director, MRC Mitochondrial Biology Unit in the University of Cambridge, England, Dr. Bruce German, Chairman of food, nutrition and health at the University of California, Davis, and Dr. Robert Beudeker, Vice President of Innovation, who leads the innovation program for human nutrition and health at DSM.
   
  STRATEGIC SHIFT TO GLOBAL CONSUMER PRODUCT COMPANY
  
 The acquisition in March 2017 of Healthspan Research LLC, a company that sold our TRU NIAGEN® branded product direct to consumers, marked our strategic shift from an ingredient and testing company to a global, science-based integrated nutraceutical company. ChromaDex made the strategic decision to commercialize TRU NIAGEN® as a consumer brand for the product containing NIAGEN® ingredient, launching in 2017.

 In connection with our strategic decision to grow our global consumer brand, we have reduced the number of NIAGEN® resellers to just a few. As expected, our ingredients segment net sales decreased 23% in 2018, from $11.1 million in 2017 to $8.6 million. However, our net sales of TRU NIAGEN® increased by $13.0 million, from $5.5 million in 2017 to $18.5 million in 2018, to more than offset the decrease in net sales of our ingredients segment.
 
 We believe the global market size for TRU NIAGEN® is substantial. According to Orbis Research, Global Anti-Aging Market Research Report and Forecast 2017-2021, June 19, 2017, over $250 billion was spent on the business of youth worldwide in 2016 on looking, acting and feeling younger, which included skin care, cosmetic surgery, hair restoration, fitness, vitamins and supplements. According to the same report from Orbis Research, the worldwide anti-aging market is expected to grow at a compounded average growth rate ("CAGR") of 5.8% through 2021 to about $330 billion.
 
 We began the international expansion of our TRU NIAGEN® brand with the launch in Hong Kong and Macau with our strategic partner, A.S. Watson Group, in 2017, followed by the launch in Singapore in the first quarter of 2018. In the third quarter of 2018, we launched TRU NIAGEN® in New Zealand with retail partner Matakana Superfoods. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we launched TRU NIAGEN® in Canada by making it available at www.truniagen.ca and to healthcare practitioners at Fullscript Canada after receiving regulatory approval for sale from Health Canada. We will continue to focus on obtaining additional regulatory approvals required to expand our marketing and distribution of our TRU NIAGEN® brand in new strategic international markets.
   
  INGREDIENTS AND ANALYTICAL REFERENCE STANDARDS AND SERVICES BUSINESS SEGMENTS
 
 Through our ingredients business segment, we will continue to sell NIAGEN® in ingredient form to our strategic partners, including Nestec Ltd. (“Nestlé”), a global leader pioneering quality science-based nutritional health solutions. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we entered into a supply agreement with Nestlé, pursuant to which Nestlé will be our exclusive customer for NIAGEN® for human use in the (i) medical nutritional and (ii) functional food and beverage categories in certain territories. As consideration for the rights granted to Nestlé, we received an upfront fee of $4 million. Following the launch of the products in certain territories, Nestlé will additionally pay us a one-time fee for a potential total aggregate payment of $6 million.
 
 We are a leading provider of research and quality-control products and services to the natural products industry. Through our analytical reference standards and services segment, customers worldwide in the dietary supplement, food and beverage, cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries use our products, which are small quantities of highly-characterized, research-grade, plant-based materials, to ensure the quality of their raw materials and finished products. We have conducted this analytical reference standards and services business since 1999.
 
 Our analytical reference standards and services business segment provides us with the opportunity to become aware of the results from research and screening activities performed on thousands of potential natural product candidates through our relationships with various universities and research institutions. By selecting the most promising ingredients leveraged from this market-based screening model, which is grounded by primary research performed through leading universities and institutions, followed by selective investments in further research and development, new proprietary ingredients can be identified and brought to various markets with a much lower investment cost and an increased chance of success. Through our regulatory consulting operations, we also provide our clients in the food, supplement and pharmaceutical industries with effective scientific solutions to manage their potential health and regulatory risks.
 
 For the fiscal years ended December 31, 2018 and December 30, 2017, our revenues were approximately $31.6 million and $21.2 million, respectively. The following table summarizes the Company’s total sales for each of the business segments in the last two years. Please refer to Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional financial information for each of the business segments.

  Government Regulation
 
 Some of our operations are subject to regulation by various United States federal agencies and similar state and international agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”), the Department of Commerce, the Department of Transportation, the Department of Agriculture and other state and international agencies. These regulators govern a wide variety of production activities, from design and development to labeling, manufacturing, handling, selling and distributing of products. From time to time, federal, state and international legislation is enacted that may have the effect of materially increasing the cost of doing business or limiting or expanding our permissible activities. We cannot predict whether or when potential legislation or regulations will be enacted, and, if enacted, the effect of such legislation, regulation, implementation, or any implemented regulations or supervisory policies would have on our financial condition or results of operations. In addition, the outcome of any litigation, investigations or enforcement actions initiated by state or federal authorities could result in changes to our operations being necessary and in increased compliance costs.

  U.S. FDA Regulation
 
 In the United States dietary supplements and food are subject to FDA regulations. For example, the FDA’s final rule on Good Manufacturing Practices (“GMPs”) for dietary supplements published in June 2007 requires companies to evaluate products for identity, strength, purity and composition. These regulations, in some cases, particularly for new ingredients, require a notification that must be submitted to the FDA along with evidence of safety. In addition, depending on the type of product, whether a dietary supplement, cosmetic, food, or pharmaceutical, the FDA, under the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the "FDCA"), can regulate:
    
  ● 
 product testing;


  ● 
 ingredient testing;


  ● 
 documentation process, batch records, specifications;


  ● 
 product labeling;


  ● 
 product manufacturing and storage;


  ● 
 NDI status;


  ● 
 health claims, advertising and promotion; and


  ● 
 product sales and distribution.


 The FDCA has been amended several times with respect to dietary supplements, most notably by the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (“DSHEA”). DSHEA established a new framework for governing the composition and labeling of dietary supplements. Generally, under DSHEA, dietary ingredients that were marketed in the United States before October 15, 1994, may be used in dietary supplements without notifying the FDA. However, an NDI (a dietary ingredient that was not marketed in the United States before October 15, 1994) is subject to NDI notification that must be submitted to the FDA unless the ingredient has previously been “present in the food supply as an article used for food” without being “chemically altered.” An NDI notification must provide the FDA with evidence of a “history of use or other evidence of safety” establishing that the use of the dietary ingredient “will reasonably be expected to be safe.” An NDI notification must be submitted to the FDA at least 75 days before the initial marketing of the NDI. There can be no assurance that the FDA will accept the evidence of safety for any NDIs that we may want to commercialize, and the FDA’s refusal to accept such evidence could prevent the marketing of such dietary ingredients. The FDA is in the process of developing guidance for the industry that will aim to clarify the FDA’s interpretation of the NDI notification requirements, and this guidance may raise new and significant regulatory barriers for NDIs.
 
 For any new ingredient developed by us to be used in conventional food or beverage products in the United States, the product either must be approved by the FDA as a food additive pursuant to a food additive petition ("FAP") or be generally recognized as safe ("GRAS"). The FDA does not have to approve a company’s determination that an ingredient is GRAS. However, a company can notify the FDA of its determination. There can be no assurance that the FDA will approve any FAP for any ingredient that we may want to commercialize, or agree with our determination that an ingredient is GRAS, either of which could prevent the marketing of such ingredient.
 
  U.S. Advertising Regulations
 
 In addition to FDA regulations, the FTC regulates the advertising of dietary supplements, foods, cosmetics, and over-the-counter ("OTC"), drugs. In recent years, the FTC has instituted numerous enforcement actions against dietary supplement companies for failure to adequately substantiate claims made in advertising or for the use of false or misleading advertising claims. These enforcement actions have often resulted in consent decrees and the payment of civil penalties, restitution, or both, by the companies involved. We may be subject to regulation under various state and local laws that include provisions governing, among other things, the formulation, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, advertising and distribution of dietary supplements, foods, cosmetics and OTC drugs.
  
 In addition, The National Advertising Division of the Council of Better Business Bureaus reviews national advertising for truthfulness and accuracy. The National Advertising Division of the Council of Better Business Bureaus uses a form of alternative dispute resolution, working closely with in-house counsel, marketing executives, research and development departments and outside consultants to decide whether claims have been substantiated.

  International Regulations
 
 Our international sales for the consumer products segment and ingredients segment are subject to foreign government regulations, which vary substantially from country to country. The time required to obtain approval by a foreign country may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval, and the requirements may differ. We may be unable to obtain on a timely basis, if at all, any foreign government approvals necessary for the marketing of our products abroad.
 
 Regulation in Europe is exercised primarily through the European Union, which regulates the combined market of each of its member states. Other countries, such as Switzerland, have voluntarily adopted laws and regulations that mirror those of the European Union with respect to dietary ingredients.
   
  Major Customers
  
 Major customers who accounted for more than 10% of the Company’s total sales were as follows:
  
 
 | Years Ended
----------------------------------+------------
Major Customers | 2018 | 2017 
A.S. Watson Group - Related Party | * | 19.4%
Thorne Research | * | 10.2%
Life Extension | 10.0% | * 
* Represents less than 10%. | | 



 Generally, we do not depend upon a single customer, or a few customers, and the loss of any one or more would not have a material adverse effect on the Company. However, due to the volume of consumer products and ingredients we are selling in relation to the overall Company’s sales, we do expect that at times one or more of our customers may account for more than 10% of the Company’s sales.
   
  Competitive Business Conditions
 
 For our consumer products segment, we are in direct competition with Elysium Health who offers a similar product to our TRU NIAGEN®. There are also few resellers of NIAGEN® as consumer products that are our customers. We believe these resellers are focused on specific channels that we believe are complementary to our business.
 
 For our ingredients segment, we face little direct competition as the ingredients we offer are backed by intellectual property exclusively licensed to us. We, however, face strong indirect competition from other ingredient suppliers who may supply alternative ingredients that may have similar characteristics to ingredients we offer. Below is a list of some of the competitors for our ingredients segment.

The success in winning and retaining clients is heavily dependent on the efforts and reputation of our consultants. We believe the barriers to entry in areas of our consulting expertise are low.
 Patents, Trademarks, Licenses, Franchises, Concessions, Royalty Agreements or Labor Contracts, Including Duration
 
 We currently protect our intellectual property through patents, trademarks, designs and copyrights on our products and services. Our business strategy is to use the intellectual property harnessed from our analytical reference standards and services segment as the basis for providing new proprietary ingredients to our customers. Our strategy is to develop these proprietary ingredients on our own as well as to license our intellectual property to companies who will commercialize it. We anticipate that the net result will be a long-term flow of intellectual property milestone and royalty payments to us.

  Manufacturing
 
 We currently utilize third-party manufacturers to produce and supply dietary supplement, ingredients, products, and services. Following the receipt of products or product components from third-party manufacturers, we currently inspect products as needed. We expect to reserve the right to inspect and ensure conformance of each product and product component to our specifications. We will also consider manufacturing certain products or product components internally, if our capacity permits, when demand or quality requirements make it appropriate to do so.
   
 We intend to work with manufacturing companies that can meet the standards imposed by the FDA, the International Organization for Standardization and the quality standards that we will require for our own internal policies and procedures. We expect to monitor and manage supplier performance through a corrective action program developed by us. We believe these manufacturing relationships can minimize our capital investment, help control costs, and allow us to compete with larger volume manufacturers of dietary supplements, phytochemicals and ingredients.
   
  Sources and Availability of Raw Materials
 
 For all three business segments, we believe that we have identified reliable sources and suppliers of ingredients, chemicals, phytochemicals and reference materials that will provide products in compliance with our guidelines.
 Research and Development
 
 We have completed the first human clinical trial on our proprietary ingredient NIAGEN® and the results demonstrated that a single dose of NIAGEN® resulted in statistically significant increases in the co-enzyme NAD+ in healthy human volunteers. In addition, no adverse events were observed. In 2015, NIAGEN® was recognized by the FDA as a “New Dietary Ingredient.”  NIAGEN® was also “Generally Recognized as Safe” by an independent panel of expert toxicologists and in August 2016, the FDA issued a GRAS No Objection Letter.
 
 In 2018, we completed a second human clinical trial on NR which evaluated the effect of repeated doses of NIAGEN® on NAD+ metabolite concentrations in blood, urine and muscle in healthy adults. This study evaluated the impacts of three dose levels of NIAGEN® compared to a placebo. One quarter of subjects received the low dose of NIAGEN® (100 mg), one quarter received the moderate dose of NIAGEN® (300 mg), one quarter received the higher dose of NIAGEN® (1,000 mg) and one quarter received the placebo. The results showed that NAD levels rose in response to the dose of NIAGEN® and the elevated blood NAD levels were sustained throughout the eight-week treatment period.
  
 Through our research and development laboratory in Longmont, Colorado, we intend to manufacture at a process scale for products that we are planning to take to market as well as explore cost saving processes for existing products.
 
 Research and development costs for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2018, and December 30, 2017, were approximately $5.5 million and $4.0 million, respectively.

  Environmental Compliance
 
 We will incur significant expense in complying with GMPs and safe handling and disposal of materials used in our research and manufacturing activities. We do not anticipate incurring additional material expense to comply with federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations.
 Working Capital
 
 The Company’s working capital at the end of years 2018 and 2017 was approximately $3.1 million and $7.4 million, respectively. The Company measures working capital by adding trade receivables and inventories, and subtracting accounts payable. Most of the working capital is consumed by our consumer products segment and ingredients segment as the operations require a large amount of inventory to be on hand. As the consumer products segment and ingredients segment grow, more working capital will likely be needed to support the operations.
 Backlog Orders
 
 For our consumer products segment where we ship products internationally to a distributor, we may have a backlog from time to time as the production of TRU NIAGEN® finished bottles require up to three months lead time by our third-party contract manufacturers. As of December 31, 2018, we did not have any backlog orders from the distributor as all orders received have been shipped. For products that are directly shipped to consumers, we have minimal backlog orders as we carry inventory on hand to ship upon the receipt of order.
 
 For our ingredients segment, we also have minimal backlog orders as we carry inventory on hand for most of the products we offer and we ship upon the receipt of customer’s order.
 
 For our analytical reference standards and services segment, we normally have a small backlog of orders for reference standards. These orders amount to approximately $25,000 or less. Because we list over 1,500 phytochemicals and 300 botanical reference materials in our catalog, we may not always have the items in stock at the time of customers’ orders. These backlog orders are normally fulfilled within 2 to 3 months.
   
  Facilities

  Employees
  
 As of December 31, 2018, ChromaDex (including Healthspan Research LLC and ChromaDex Analytics, Inc.) had approximately 100 employees, all of whom were full-time. We consider our relationships with our employees to be satisfactory. None of our employees is covered by a collective bargaining agreement.
