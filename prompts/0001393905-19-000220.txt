ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 Under our business plan launched in February 2018 we set out to build a cryptocurrency mining operation, operating specialized computers (also known as crypto-currency miners") that generate cryptocurrency (primarily Bitcoin). A bitcoin is an asset that can be transferred among parties via the Internet, but without the use of a central administrator or clearing agency. The term decentralized is often used in descriptions of bitcoin, in reference to bitcoins lack of necessity for administration by a central party.
 
Through our subsidiary, Power Blockchain LLC (Power Blockchain), we began operating a start-up venture in February 2018 that specializes in blockchain mining for the Bitcoin network, the computer intensive process required to verify and record the digital exchange of money for crypto-currency transactions. In exchange for processing these complex mathematical equations, we would be rewarded with digital currency. We have yet to commence meaningful operations and are currently performing a preliminary evaluation of our business plans going forward.

Our Operations
 
On February 14, 2018, we were granted permission from the Kingdom of Lesotho to conduct crypto-currency mining operations in Lesotho. As part of this permission, we were permitted to operate by the Lesotho Electricity Company and we negotiated an electric rate agreement. As of the date of this report, we owned 70 crypto-currency miners and Power Control Units (PCU), 50 of which have been installed in Lesotho, 10 of which are in customs in South Africa, and 10 of which are in storage in South Africa. We commenced mining operations in Lesotho but have not generated any revenues to date. 
 
Due to subsequent economic and market conditions, we decided to place the Companys cryptocurrency mining operations in the Kingdom of Lesotho on hold beginning around the middle of 2018. With the recent increase in the quoted market price of bitcoin, however, we are presently in the process of performing a preliminary evaluation of the feasibility of resuming our bitcoin mining operations in some capacity. We still maintain ownership and control of the miners and other equipment used in the cryptocurrency mining operations in that country (notwithstanding the fact that the cost associated with these assets has been fully reserved on the Companys Balance Sheet since March 31, 2018).
 
Corporate History
 
We were incorporated on February 22, 2013 as PowerMedChairs, a Nevada corporation. Since the time of our incorporation until February 2018, our plan of operation was to re-build primarily electric/power wheelchairs in disrepair. On June 2, 2017, we changed our name to Holly Brothers Pictures, Inc. In February 2018, we ceased this business and commenced our blockchain mining business through our acquisition of Power Blockchain described below.
 
On February 1, 2018, we entered into an exchange agreement pursuant to which we acquired 100% of the equity interests in Power Blockchain from the owners of Power Blockchain in exchange for the issuance for convertible notes in aggregate principal amount of $2.2 million. The notes: (i) mature five years from the date of issuance: (ii) accrue interest at 5% per annum; (iii) require repayment in four equal installments on the second, third, fourth and fifth anniversary dates after issuance; and (iv) are convertible at the option of the holder into our common stock at a conversion price of $0.13 per share. Upon consummation of the exchange agreement, Power Blockchain became our wholly owned subsidiary. Power Blockchain had outstanding debt obligations in aggregate principal amounts of $570,000, accruing interest at rates between 12-13% per annum, which obligations were overdue and in default. In March 2018, the Power Blockchain debt holders commenced a lawsuit against us in San Diego Superior Court, in connection with outstanding and overdue debt obligations. On March 22, 2018, we agreed to enter into a conditional settlement with the debt holders. The settlement agreement calls for the periodic issuance to the debt holders, subject to certain ownership and temporal limitations, of an aggregate of up to 3,078,000 and 3,157,000 shares respectively, exempted from registration pursuant to Section 3(a)(10) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the California Corporations Code Section 25017(f)(3), as amended, after a fairness hearing evaluating the relative merits of the proposed agreement, which was held and approved on April 2, 2018. 
 
Employees
 
As of March 31, 2019, we had no permanent employees and two part-time contractors/consultants.
