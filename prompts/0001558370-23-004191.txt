Item 1. Business.
Overview
We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development, manufacture, and commercialization of products that address unmet patient needs, with current focus directed towards the treatment of pulmonary hypertension (“PH”). We operate as a single entity through our two wholly owned operating subsidiaries, Liquidia Technologies and Liquidia PAH.
We currently generate revenue pursuant to a Promotion Agreement between Liquidia PAH and Sandoz Inc. (“Sandoz”) sharing profit derived from the sale of Sandoz’s substitutable generic treprostinil injection (“Treprostinil Injection”) in the United States. Liquidia PAH has the exclusive rights to conduct commercial activities to encourage the appropriate use of Treprostinil Injection. We employ a targeted sales force calling on physicians and hospital pharmacies in the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (“PAH”), as well as key stakeholders involved in the distribution and reimbursement of Treprostinil Injection. Strategically, we believe that our commercial presence in the field will enable an efficient base to expand from for the launch of YUTREPIA upon potential approval, leveraging existing relationships and further validating our reputation as a company committed to supporting PAH patients.
We conduct research, development, and manufacturing of novel products by applying our subject matter expertise in cardiopulmonary diseases and our proprietary PRINT® technology, a particle engineering platform that enables precise production of uniform drug particles designed to improve the safety, efficacy, and performance of a wide range of therapies. Through development of our own products and research with third parties, we have experience applying PRINT across multiple routes of administration and drug payloads including inhaled therapies, vaccines, biologics, nucleic acids and ophthalmic implants, among others.
Our lead product candidate is YUTREPIA for the treatment of PAH. YUTREPIA is an inhaled dry powder formulation of treprostinil designed with PRINT to improve the therapeutic profile of treprostinil by enhancing deep lung delivery while using a convenient, low resistance dry-powder inhaler (“DPI”) and by achieving higher dose levels than the labelled doses of current inhaled therapies. The United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) tentatively approved our New Drug Application (“NDA”) for YUTREPIA for the treatment of PAH in November 2021. The FDA also confirmed that the clinical data in the NDA would support our pursuit of a supplemental NDA to treat patients with pulmonary hypertension and interstitial lung disease (PH-ILD) upon the expiration of regulatory exclusivity for the nebulized form of treprostinil in March 2024.
About Pulmonary Hypertension (PH)
Diseases
PH is divided into five groups based on the criteria of the World Health Organization (“WHO”) as defined at the 5th World Symposium on Pulmonary Hypertension in Nice, France. WHO Group I is comprised of individuals with PAH. WHO Group III includes patients with pulmonary hypertension caused by hypoxia and/or lung diseases, mostly interstitial lung disease (“ILD”), COPD and sleep-disordered breathing. Our current products seek to address unmet needs to treating patients diagnosed with PAH and PH-ILD.
PAH is a rare, chronic, progressive disease caused by hardening and narrowing of the pulmonary arteries that can lead to right heart failure and eventually death, with an estimated diagnosed, treated prevalence in the United States of approximately 30,000 to 45,000 patients. There is currently no cure for PAH, so the goals of existing treatments are to alleviate symptoms, maintain or improve functional class, delay disease progression and improve quality of life.

PH-ILD is the second most prevalent form of Group 3 PH (precapillary PH due to lung disease). ILD is a diverse collection of up to 150 different pulmonary diseases, including interstitial pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis, connective tissue disease related ILD, and sarcoidosis among others. Current estimates of diagnosed and undiagnosed prevalence of PH-ILD range between 30,000 to 70,000, depending on the growth on the underlying lung diseases. The prevalence of PH in many of these underlying ILD diseases is not yet known due to factors including underdiagnosis and lack of approved treatments until recently.
Treatments
Drugs targeting the prostacyclin pathway are central to PAH and PH-ILD therapy. Prostacyclin analogs, like treprostinil, have been developed for continuous infusion, inhalation and oral administration. The maximal efficacy benefit of any one drug in the prostacyclin pathway is partially limited by its specific safety profile and the burden of administration.
Delivering prostacyclin analogs by inhalation has been effective and causes fewer systemic side effects than parenteral and oral formulations. Inhalation helps supplement the endogenous production of prostacyclin where it is normally synthesized, near the targeted pulmonary arteries. As a result, inhaled prostacyclin analogs help avoid side effects related to off-target tissues and takes advantage of binding key prostacyclin receptors that are preferentially expressed in the lung. The only inhaled prostacyclin analogs approved by the FDA are nebulized Ventavis® (iloprost), nebulized Tyvaso® (treprostinil), and Tyvaso DPI® (treprostinil), a dry powder inhaled formulation. With regard to PH-ILD, there is growing medical preference for inhaled therapies to avoid ventilation-perfusion mismatch resulting from systemic delivery of prostacyclins. In March 2021, the FDA approved Tyvaso® as the only treatment for PH-ILD, later adding Tyvaso DPI as a treatment option upon its approval by the FDA in May 2022.
Systemic delivery of prostacyclin has proven effective but challenging, especially in those patients who have progressed to more severe forms of PAH. Parenteral delivery of prostacyclin analogs by continuous infusion via intravenous or subcutaneous administration, like Remodulin® (treprostinil) and epoprostenol, are considered the most effective treatment for PAH; however, the burden of external pumps and side-effect profiles have limited their use to severely ill patients. Regardless, physicians have come to rely on these pump-delivered products to stabilize rapidly declining patients to slow disease progression and to ensure the mechanism of action is fully maximized. 
Oral tablet delivery of prostacyclin analogs two or three times a day, like Orenitram® (treprostinil), or agonists of the prostacyclin signaling pathway, like Uptravi® (selexipag), improve convenience compared to infusions, but does not address the off-target toxicities that limit optimal dosing. New patients to oral delivery may not be able to titrate to known therapeutic levels.
Market
In 2022, the total reported net revenue of branded therapies approved to treat PAH and PH-ILD in the United States exceeded $4.6 billion, of which $2.7 billion targeted the prostacyclin pathway. United Therapeutics reported that its class of branded treprostinil-based products generated net revenue of $1.7 billion in 2022, of which Tyvaso® contributed $873 million from predominately U.S. net sales, Orenitram contributed $325 million and Remodulin® contributed $500 million with $93 million in net revenue coming from non-U.S. sales. The growth in United Therapeutics’ total reported sales of 19% was primarily driven by the inhaled treprostinil products which grew 44% due to the addition of Tyvaso DPI and expansion into PH-ILD.
Our Products and Product Candidates
YUTREPIATM (treprostinil) Inhalation Powder to Treat PAH
Our lead investigational drug, YUTREPIA™ (treprostinil) inhalation powder was tentatively approved by the FDA in November 2021. YUTREPIA is an inhaled dry powder formulation of treprostinil designed to improve the therapeutic profile of treprostinil by enhancing deep lung delivery and achieving higher dose levels than current inhaled therapies while using a convenient, easy-to-use dry-powder inhaler, the RS00 Model 8 DPI. This device and its variants have been 

4



used in at least eight marketed products globally since 2001, including Novartis’s Foradil Aerolizer® for the treatment of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). 
We believe YUTREPIA can become the prostacyclin of first choice across the disease continuum in PAH and PH-ILD because of its convenience, low-resistance device and the ability to titrate to higher doses. 
Each particle of YUTREPIA has been designed using our PRINT technology to have uniform size and shape to achieve enhanced aerosolization and deposition in the lungs. As a result, our PRINT formulation does not require deagglomeration by a patient actuated breath and can be effectively delivered using of a low-resistance, patient-friendly device and minimal inspiratory effort. The RS00 Model 8 DPI device used to deliver YUTREPIA is robust with regard to position and accidental movements and has been used globally to deliver drugs to patients with compromised lung function, like asthma, COPD, and cystic fibrosis. These beneficial product characteristics are in contrast to the recently approved Tyvaso DPI (May 2022), which uses a high resistance device and has only been used previously in patients with diabetes.
The different combinations of YUTREPIA’s four proposed capsule-strengths, if approved, would allow customized dosing and easier titration based on a patient’s disease progression. YUTREPIA can be safely titrated to doses far beyond the target dose of nebulized Tyvaso (9-12 breaths) and the doses described in the label for Tyvaso DPI (up to 80 mcg QID). YUTREPIA has been studied up to 238.5 mcg QID, which is comparable to 27 breaths of nebulized Tyvaso. By expanding the dose range of inhaled treprostinil, YUTREPIA may be able to keep patients on therapy longer before transitioning to parenteral therapies. 
In clinical studies required for approval, YUTREPIA has proven to be safe, well-tolerated and effective regardless of a patient’s previous exposure to treprostinil. Prostacyclin-naïve patients achieved comparable dosing to the transition patients within first two months of treatment. Patients on a stable dose of Tyvaso successfully transition to YUTREPIA while maintaining or improving clinical outcomes as measured by exploratory endpoints. The combination of data form both patient groups provide confidence that a physician may prescribe YUTRPEIA across a continuum of PAH and PH-ILD patients.
We have developed YUTREPIA under the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway using the nebulized form of treprostinil, Tyvaso, as the reference listed drug. This regulatory pathway allows us to rely in part on the FDA’s previous findings of efficacy and safety of Tyvaso and the active ingredient treprostinil. We submitted the New Drug Application (“NDA”) for YUTREPIA in January 2020. The FDA conducted on-site pre-approval inspections of two U.S. manufacturing facilities: the Company’s Morrisville, North Carolina facility and the facility of the third-party provider of encapsulation and packaging services for YUTREPIA in August 2021 and October 2021, respectively. In November 2021, the FDA issued a tentative approval of YUTREPIA which indicated that the NDA had met all the requirements for final approval but cannot yet be marketed. 
Final FDA approval and launch of YUTREPIA are directly impacted by the Hatch-Waxman litigation commenced by United Therapeutics on June 4, 2020. As a result, the FDA cannot issue a final approval for the YUTREPIA NDA until the resolution of the outstanding litigation described further in Item 3 Legal Proceedings. The FDA’s tentative approval can be subject to change based on new information that may come to FDA’s attention between such time as the tentative and final approval. A new drug product may not be marketed until the date of final approval.
Our NDA submission was based in part upon the results of our pivotal, open-label Phase 3 clinical trial, Investigation of the Safety and Pharmacology of Dry Powder Inhalation of Treprostinil, for YUTREPIA (“INSPIRE”). The primary objective of the INSPIRE study was to evaluate the long-term safety of YUTREPIA with a primary endpoint to assess safety and tolerability through Month 2. The study enrolled patients who have either (a) been under stable treatment with Tyvaso (nebulizer-delivered treprostinil) for at least three months and transitioned to YUTREPIA under the protocol (“Transition patients”), or (b) patients who had been under stable treatment with no more than two non-prostacyclin oral PAH therapies for at least three months and then had their treatment regimen supplemented with YUTREPIA under the protocol (“Prostacyclin Naïve patients”). Transition patients started at a dose comparable to their prior nebulized treprostinil dose and were titrated to higher doses as warranted by their clinical disease. Prostacyclin Naïve patients started on a dose of 26.5 mcg of YUTREPIA, with most (>80%) titrating to a 79.5 mcg dose or higher within the first 

5



two months of treatment. Of the 121 patients enrolled in the study, 55 were Transition patients and 66 were Prostacyclin Naïve patients.
YUTREPIA was observed to be well-tolerated and treatment-emergent adverse events (“TEAEs”) were mostly mild to moderate in nature at Month 2 up to doses of 159 mcg, the highest dose studied for the primary endpoint. We continued to treat patients who chose to remain on YUTREPIA beyond the Month 2 timepoint. At the completion of the INSPIRE study, the patient with the longest duration of treatment had been on YUTREPIA therapy for 18 months and the highest dosing reached in the INSPIRE study was 212 mcg of treprostinil given four times per day. Patients from INSPIRE had the option of rolling into the LTI-302 extension study to remain on treatment. Patients in LTI-302 continued to titrate doses upwards as needed with no observed maximum tolerated dose and the highest dose delivered being 238 mcg. 
Our NDA submission also includes results from pharmacokinetic (PK) studies in healthy volunteers indicating that the single-capsule dose of 79.5 mcg YUTREPIA provides comparable PK with nine breaths of Tyvaso (54 mcg). For reference, the target dose of Tyvaso is 9 to 12 breaths per treatment session, 4 times daily. Clinical results from the PK and pivotal studies of YUTREPIA have been presented at various international scientific meetings such as the American Thoracic Society (ATS), International Society of Heart Lung Transplantation (ISHLT), Pulmonary Vascular Research Institute (PVRI), American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) in 2019 and 2020.
We are considering conducting other clinical trials to generate additional data to support the use of YUTREPIA, including a clinical trial in pediatric patients. We conducted a clinical study, known as LTI 201, at certain investigational sites in France and Germany to characterize the hemodynamic dose-response relationship to YUTREPIA. In December 2020, we decided to terminate the study earlier than planned due to challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic; however, we did observe acute, hemodynamic responses as expected with inhaled treprostinil.
Treprostinil Injection, a Generic Version of Remodulin®
Remodulin® is treprostinil administered through continuous intravenous and subcutaneous infusion, as approved by the FDA in 2002 and 2004, and marketed by United Therapeutics. Patients must use external pumps manufactured by third parties to deliver Remodulin. Smiths Medical ASD, Inc. (“Smiths Medical”) manufactured the pumps used by most patients in the United States to administer Remodulin, including the CADD-MS® 3 pump used to deliver subcutaneous Remodulin, and the CADD-Legacy® pump to deliver intravenous Remodulin. An estimated 3,000 patients are treated annually with parenteral, infused treprostinil split between the two routes of administration. Branded Remodulin generated U.S. revenue of approximately $408 million and $423 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively.
In August 2018, Sandoz partnered with Liquidia PAH (then known as RareGen) on an exclusive basis to market and commercialize its generic Treprostinil Injection, which was subsequently launched as the first-to-file, fully-substitutable generic treprostinil for parenteral administration in March 2019. Liquidia PAH promotes the appropriate use of Treprostinil Injection for the treatment of PAH in the United States and works jointly with Sandoz on commercial strategy for the product. Sandoz retains all rights in and to Treprostinil Injection. As the Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) holder, Sandoz maintains responsibility for compliance with FDA regulatory and healthcare laws including any regulatory communications with the FDA or any other regulatory authorities. In consideration for Liquidia PAH conducting certain responsibilities associated with the commercialization of Treprostinil Injection, Liquidia PAH receives a portion of the net profits generated from the sales of the product.
Treprostinil Injection contains the same active ingredient, same strength, same dosage forms and same inactive ingredient amounts as Remodulin, and at the same service and support, but at a lower price. The treprostinil is supplied in 20 mL multi-dose vials in four strengths — containing 20 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg, or 200 mg (1 mg/mL, 2.5 mg/mL, 5 mg/mL or 10 mg/mL) of treprostinil, respectively. Treprostinil Injection is available for intravenous and subcutaneous administration at the same specialty pharmacies that dispense the brand name medicine. 
When first launched in April 2019, Treprostinil Injection was only available for intravenous administration. The cartridges required to operate the CADD-MS 3 pump for subcutaneous administration were not available to patients using Treprostinil Injection due to restrictions imposed by other companies. On May 21, 2021, Liquidia PAH’s manufacturing partner, Chengdu Shifeng Medical Technologies LTD (“Chengdu”) began selling the RG 3ml Medication 

6



Cartridge, which now may be used to supply Treprostinil Injection to PAH patients with the CADD-MS 3 pump manufactured by Smiths Medical.
Smiths Medical no longer manufactures the CADD-MS 3 infusion pump and, under our Settlement Agreement with Smiths Medical, they are not obligated to support the existing inventory of CADD-MS 3 infusion pumps after January 1, 2025. We recently became aware of a shortage of a critical component of the CADD-MS 3 infusion pump that has caused the number of CADD-MS 3 infusion pumps available for the subcutaneous administration of Treprostinil Injection to be limited. Due to this limitation in the availability of pumps, specialty pharmacies are not currently placing new patients on to subcutaneous Treprostinil Injection therapy in order to preserve the available pumps for those patients already receiving subcutaneous administration of Treprostinil Injection. In March, 2023, we entered into an amendment to our agreement with Sandoz to attempt to alleviate the shortage of critical components for the CADD-MS 3 infusion pump. If successful, new components may be available in late 2023 or early 2024.
In addition, in December 2022, we entered a collaboration with Sandoz and Mainbridge Health Partners LLC (“Mainbridge”) to support the development of a new subcutaneous pump for infusion of Treprostinil Injection in order to alleviate the single-source dependence on the existing CADD-MS 3 system. Mainbridge will perform all development, validation and testing activities required for the pump and related consumables. We anticipate that Mainbridge will submit a 510(k) in 2023 for FDA clearance. Sandoz and Liquidia will split equally the development costs.
Separately, Smiths Medical has announced that it will discontinue support of the CADD Legacy pump, which is used to administer Treprostinil Injection intravenously, starting in 2028. We are working to identify alternative pumps that may be used for the intravenous administration of Treprostinil Injection.
PRINT Technology
Our proprietary PRINT particle engineering technology allows us to engineer and manufacture highly uniform drug particles with precise control over the size, three-dimensional geometric shape and chemical composition of the particles. By controlling these physical and chemical parameters of particles, PRINT enables us to engineer desirable pharmacological benefits into product candidates, including prolonged duration of drug release, increased drug loading, more convenient routes of administration, the ability to create novel combination products, enhanced storage and stability and the potential to reduce adverse side effects. Our manufacturing equipment and materials used in the production of our drug particles are proprietary and protected by our patent portfolio and trade secret know-how.
An example of the precise particle engineering enabled by PRINT is demonstrated in YUTREPIA. Each particle is designed to enhance delivery and deep-lung penetration with a precise size and highly uniform shape inspired by a naturally occurring pollen. YUTREPIA PRINT particles have a one micrometer trefoil-shape measured by an inscribed one micrometer circle as shown in the figure below. In vitro studies suggest that the uniformity of size and shape allow our inhaled particles to target delivery into the lungs with less deposition in the upper airways. The figures below depict

YUTREPIA, with the figure on the left showing size and shape consistency among particles and the figure on the right showing their trefoil shape:

Development, Regulatory and Commercial Strategy
We intend to develop and commercialize a pipeline of drugs by applying our expertise in the development of cardio-pulmonary medicines and leveraging the advantages of our proprietary PRINT technology. We believe that our PRINT technology can be applied to a wide range of therapeutic areas, molecule types, routes of administration and novel or generic products. To date, our internal pipeline has focused on the development of improved and differentiated drug products containing FDA-approved active pharmaceutical ingredients (“APIs”) with established efficacy and safety profiles, which we believe are eligible for the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway to seek marketing approval in the U.S. The 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway can be capital efficient and potentially enable a shorter time to approval, subject to certain risks associated with this regulatory pathway. If our product candidates receive marketing approval, we plan to commercialize them in the U.S. either by ourselves or through partnership or licensing arrangements with other pharmaceutical companies. Outside of the U.S., we may pursue regulatory approval and commercialization of our product candidates in collaboration with pharmaceutical companies with regional expertise. We intend to manufacture our product candidates using in-house capabilities. Where appropriate, we will rely on contract manufacturing organizations (“CMOs”) to produce, package and distribute our approved drug products on a commercial scale.
We intend to focus our commercial efforts initially on the U.S. market in the treatment of PAH and PH-ILD. We currently employ a small, targeted sales force for Treprostinil Injection calling on physicians involved in the treatment of PAH in the U.S., as well as key stakeholders involved in the distribution and reimbursement of Treprostinil Injection. Strategically, we believe that our commercial presence in the field will enable an efficient launch of YUTREPIA if and when we obtain final approval, leveraging existing relationships and further validating our reputation as a company committed to supporting PAH patients. If we have success increasing the utilization of Treprostinil Injection and advancing YUTREPIA to FDA approval, we will increase our efforts to pursue the highly concentrated target market of PAH centers of excellence and high prescribers of PAH therapies. Our physician call points within these sites of care will include cardiologists, pulmonologists and their supporting staff. We believe that we can effectively commercialize YUTREPIA, if approved, with an expanded specialty field team. We also expect to further develop our internal resources and functional areas to support other types of communication. For example, we may utilize medical science liaisons and reimbursement specialists to support the proper conveying of scientific and medical information, and healthcare economic information regarding, and utilization of, YUTREPIA.
Manufacturing and Supply
We operate from a 45,000 square foot facility in Morrisville, North Carolina in which we design, formulate and manufacture engineered drug particles using PRINT particle fabrication lines as well as supportive activity including research and development, analytical development, quality control and production of mold templates that enable our 

8



production processes. Our three operational PRINT particle fabrication lines are located within class ISO7 clean rooms that operate under applicable ISO and current good manufacturing practices (cGMP) air quality and environmental requirements. Our current operational fabrication lines are scaled and capable of producing the necessary materials to support our clinical trials and, if approved, commercial demand for our products. 
In August 2021, the FDA completed an on-site Pre-Approval Inspection (PAI) of our Morrisville, North Carolina facility in connection with the review of the YUTREPIA NDA. The 5-day PAI concluded with no Form 483 Inspectional Observations issued. This was our first inspection of the Morrisville site by the FDA. We utilize contract manufacturers to finish production and package our drug product for clinical and commercial use. 
We depend on third-party suppliers for commercial inventory and clinical supplies, including active pharmaceutical ingredients which are used in our product candidates. For example, we currently rely on a sole supplier, LGM Pharma, LLC, for treprostinil, the active pharmaceutical ingredient of YUTREPIA, and we currently rely on a sole supplier, Plastiape S.p.A (“Plastiape”), for RS00 Model 8 DPI, the device used to administer YUTREPIA. We also rely on a sole supplier, Lonza Tampa LLC, for encapsulation and packaging services. If and when we receive final marketing approval for our product candidates, we may, from time to time, rely on third-party CMOs to manufacture, package and distribute some or all of our approved drug products on a commercial scale.
Supply of Treprostinil Injection is managed directly by our partner Sandoz, who retains the ANDA, manages inventory and records gross revenue on product sales. Sandoz is either the manufacturer or contracted party for the entire supply chain. We collaborate with Sandoz on a regular basis to plan appropriate inventory production and management based on the demand for Treprostinil Injection and observations in the field. Additionally, we have contracted with our manufacturing partner Chengdu to supply the RG 3mL Medication Cartridge for use with CADD-MS® 3 (MS-3) ambulatory infusion pumps and enable subcutaneous administration of Treprostinil Injection.

Aerie Pharmaceuticals
We have exclusively licensed our PRINT technology to Aerie Pharmaceuticals, Inc., which in 2017 acquired most of the assets of Envisia Therapeutics, Inc., an entity which we formed in 2013, for broad usage in the design and commercialization of small molecule and biologic ophthalmic therapies. In November 2022, Alcon completed its acquisition of Aerie Pharmaceuticals to helps bolster Alcon’s presence in the ophthalmic pharmaceutical space and as a result, retains Aerie’s direct license to the use of PRINT.
GlaxoSmithKline
Previously, we had collaborated with GlaxoSmithKline plc (“GSK”) on the use of our PRINT technology in respiratory disease. In June 2012, we entered into an Inhaled Collaboration and Option Agreement (the “GSK ICO Agreement”) with GSK to collaborate on research regarding the application of our PRINT technology to specified inhaled therapies. Pursuant to the GSK ICO Agreement, we granted GSK exclusive options and licenses to further develop and commercialize such inhaled therapies using our PRINT technology. In September 2015, GSK exercised its option to obtain an exclusive, worldwide license to certain of our know-how and patents relating to our PRINT technology for the purpose of developing inhaled therapeutics. In connection with the grant of this license, we received a one-time option exercise fee and were also entitled to continued research and development funding, certain milestone payments, and tiered royalties on the worldwide sales of the licensed products. In February 2016, we received a payment from GSK upon the achievement of a clinical development milestone related to the development of an inhaled antiviral for viral exacerbations in COPD. However, in July 2018, GSK notified us of its plans to discontinue development of this compound after completion of the related Phase 1 clinical trial.
In June 2019, we and GSK executed an amendment to the collaboration agreement providing us with rights to develop and commercialize three specified molecular entities for application in inhaled programs using our PRINT technology at our sole expense. This amendment also provides a mechanism for us to acquire rights to develop and commercialize further molecular entities for inhaled applications. New inhaled programs developed under this amendment would carry milestone and royalty payments due to GSK upon initiation of Phase 3 studies and subsequent commercialization, respectively.
In January 2020, we notified GSK of our intent to terminate the GSK ICO Agreement based upon GSK’s lack of continued performance under the original agreement, which we believe constitutes a material breach of the agreement. In 

11



February 2020, we received a letter from GSK disputing our basis for termination. The parties are currently attempting to resolve the dispute pursuant to the terms of the GSK ICO Agreement and are discussing a possible amendment to this agreement.
Intellectual Property
The proprietary nature and protection of our product candidates, their methods of use and our platform technology that enables our product candidates are an important part of our business strategy of rapidly developing and commercializing new medicines that address areas of significant unmet medical needs.
Our policy is to seek patent protection of our proprietary product candidates and technology by filing U.S., international and certain foreign patent applications covering certain of our proprietary technology, inventions, improvements and product candidates that are important to the growth and protection of our business. We also rely on a combination of trade secrets, know-how, trademarks and contractual restrictions to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to patent protection or where we do not consider patent protection to be adequate or applicable.
Our success depends, in part, on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other protection for our product candidates, enabling technology, inventions and know-how and our ability to defend and enforce these patents, preserve the proprietary nature of our trade secrets and trademarks and operate our business without infringing valid and enforceable patent and other proprietary rights of third parties. Where possible, we pursue both composition-of-matter patents and method-of-use patents for our product candidates. We are also pursuing patents covering our proprietary PRINT micro- and nano-particle fabrication technology.
We are the owner or exclusive licensee of patents and applications relating to our proprietary technology platform and our product candidates and are pursuing additional patent protection for these and for our other product candidates and technology developments.
We have a total of 145 patents and pending patent applications in our patent portfolio which protect our PRINT technology and drug products in development. As of December 31, 2022, we were the sole owner of 16 patents in the United States and 41 patents in foreign jurisdictions, as well as 12 additional pending patent applications, including provisional patent applications, in the United States, Europe, Japan and other jurisdictions. In addition to the patents and patent applications owned solely by us, our patent portfolio also includes 72 patents and 3 patent applications licensed from third parties. As of December 31, 2022, we had an exclusive, worldwide license from UNC to 19 U.S. patents and 52 foreign patents, as well as three additional patent applications in the United States or selected foreign jurisdictions. Five of the patents in the portfolio licensed from UNC are jointly owned by us. We also jointly own one patent application with Glaxosmithkline Intellectual Property (No. 2) Limited. YUTREPIA is specifically protected by 15 issued patents in the United States, the longest-lived of which will expire in 2037.
We hold multiple U.S. trademark registrations and have numerous pending trademark applications. Issuance of a federally registered trademark creates a rebuttable presumption of ownership of the mark; however, it is subject to challenge by others claiming first use in the mark in some or all the areas in which it is used. Federally registered trademarks have a perpetual life so long as they are maintained and renewed on a timely basis and used properly as trademarks, subject to the rights of third parties to seek cancellation of the trademarks if they claim priority or confusion of usage. We believe our patents and trademarks are valuable and would provide us certain benefits in marketing our products.
Competition
The pharmaceutical industry is intensely competitive, subject to rapid and significant technological change and places emphasis on the value of proprietary products. While we believe that our technologies and experience provide us with a competitive advantage, our competitors include organizations such as major multinational pharmaceutical companies, established biotechnology companies, biopharmaceutical companies and generic drug companies. Many of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we have, such as more commercial resources, larger research and development staffs and more extensive marketing and manufacturing organizations. As a result, these companies 

12



may obtain marketing approval more rapidly than we are able and may be more effective in selling and marketing their products. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaboration arrangements with large, established companies.
Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. Our competitors may succeed in developing, acquiring or licensing, on an exclusive basis, technologies and drug products that are more effective or less costly than products that we are currently developing or that we may develop, which could render our products obsolete and non-competitive. We expect any products that we develop and commercialize to compete on the basis of, among others, efficacy, safety, convenience of administration and delivery, price and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors. We also expect to face competition in our efforts to recruit and retain qualified personnel, establish clinical trial sites and secure patient enrollment in our clinical trials, and identify appropriate collaborators to help commercialize any approved products in our target commercial markets.
Competition in PAH
Our products and development programs directed toward the treatment of PAH compete with several approved classes of drugs that target the prostacyclin pathway, the nitric oxide pathway and the endothelin pathway. We also expect continued development by competitors of new mechanisms of action that may be approved during the period of time that our products are being commercialized. Drugs targeting each of the clinically validated pathways may be used alone or in combination with each other to treat patients with PAH. Drugs targeted to the prostacyclin pathway, like Treprostinil Injection and YUTREPIA, are usually added to oral therapies targeting different mechanisms and their use could be impacted by changes in pricing or medical information Specifically, PDE-5 inhibitors, such as tadalafil, marketed by United Therapeutics, and sildenafil, marketed by Pfizer Inc., now compete with generic versions of both tadalafil and sildenafil; endothelin receptor antagonists, such as bosentan and macitentan, both marketed by Actelion Pharmaceuticals Ltd (“Actelion”) and ambrisentan, marketed by Gilead Sciences, Inc, compete with generic version of bosentan and ambrisentan; and soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) stimulator, such as riociguat marketed by Bayer, has seen increased since its U.S. approval in 2013.
Competition with prostacyclin-targeted treatments
Within the prostacyclin pathway, our products face competition from specific products and development programs described below.
The Treprostinil Injection product faces competition primarily from the continued use of the branded Remodulin® sold by United Therapeutics as well as additional generic treprostinil products offered by Teva, Par Pharmaceutical, Dr. Reddy’s and Alembic. Generic drug prices may decline dramatically as competitors seek to secure preferential utilization though the specialty pharmacy and hospital distribution channels in which parenteral prostacyclin products are sold. Other parenteral agents that utilize the prostacyclin pathway include parenteral epoprostenol, which is marketed by multiple companies as generic and branded products.
We expect United Therapeutics to continue to defend its leadership position vigorously through, among other actions, life cycle management, marketing agreements with third-party payors, and pharmacy benefits managers. In February 2021, United Therapeutics announced the commercial launch of the Remunity® pump for Remodulin®, which uses a small subcutaneous pump for patients starting or on a stable dose of Remodulin and can use prefilled Remodulin cassettes. The Remunity pump also has a water-resistant casing, which may be considered more convenient than the CADD-MS3 currently used to deliver treprostinil subcutaneously. United Therapeutics is also developing RemoPro™, a prodrug of treprostinil designed to be inactive in the subcutaneous tissue and activated once metabolized in the blood, decreasing site pain currently associated with subcutaneous Remodulin (treprostinil).
In addition to continuously infused treprostinil products, use of Treprostinil Injection may face competition from other orally delivered products in the prostacyclin pathway, including Orenitram®, sold by United Therapeutics, and Uptravi®, a selective IP agonist sold by Janssen Pharmaceuticals/Actelion. These oral products are perceived to be more convenient than infused products, although their use is targeted earlier in a patient’s disease progression.

13



Systemically delivered treatments also compete with localized, inhaled treatments
In addition to oral and parenteral options, we expect that YUTREPIA will face competition from the following inhaled treprostinil therapies that are either currently marketed or in clinical development.

● | Tyvaso, marketed by United Therapeutics, has been approved for the treatment of PAH in the United States since 2009. Tyvaso is the reference listed drug in our NDA for YUTREPIA. Following patent litigation, United Therapeutics and Watson Pharmaceuticals reached a settlement whereby Watson Pharmaceuticals will be permitted to enter the market with a generic version of Tyvaso beginning on January 1, 2026. In April 2021, United Therapeutics announced that Tyvaso was approved by FDA to include treatment of patients with PH-ILD. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Ventavis®, marketed by Actelion, a division of Johnson & Johnson, has been approved for the treatment of PAH in the United States since 2004.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Tyvaso DPI, licensed from MannKind by United Therapeutics, is a dry-powder formulation of treprostinil that was approved for the treatment of PAH and PH-ILD in the United States in May 2022.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Treprostinil Palmitil Inhalation Powder (TPIP), is a dry-powder formulation of a treprostinil prodrug being developed by Insmed. Insmed announced the completion of an initial Phase 1 study in February 2021 which demonstrated that TPIP was generally safe and well tolerated, with a pharmacokinetic profile that supports once-daily dosing. Insmed initiated Phase 2 trials studying patients diagnosed with PAH and PH-ILD in May 2021 and December 2022, respectively. If the TPIP clinical program is successful in demonstrating less frequent dosing with similar efficacy and safety to YUTREPIA and Tyvaso DPI, then TPIP has the potential to be viewed as a more attractive option and may take market share rapidly.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | L606 is a nebulized, liposomal formulation of treprostinil for treatment of PAH being developed by Pharmosa Biopharm Inc. (“Pharmosa”). In 2021, Pharmosa initiated a Phase 3 open-label study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of L606 in subjects with PAH that have been stabilized on Tyvaso. The intended product profile seeks reduce the daily dosing frequency of treprostinil.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are also a variety of investigational PAH therapies in the later stages of development that target new or clinically-validated mechanism of actions (MOAs) that may benefit patients. The approval of some or any of these could change the treatment paradigm and impact the utilization of treprostinil products and the prostacyclin pathway at large. We believe that new MOAs may slow or reverse the disease progression of PAH having the net impact of increasing the diagnosed prevalent population by extending patient lives and increasing the potential addressable population for treprostinil-based therapies. For example, Merck & Co’s injectable sotatercept is an investigational, potential first-in-class molecule that targets the proliferation of cells in the pulmonary vasculature and is being reviewed by the FDA for approval in 2023. If approved, we currently expect that the drug will be used as it was studied: on-top of dual and triple background therapy that included prostacyclin analogs.
​
Human Capital
As of March 2, 2023, we employed 59 salaried and four hourly employees, all of whom are located in the United States. We have no collective bargaining agreements with our employees, and we have not experienced any work stoppages. We consider our relations with our employees to be good.
We believe that our future success largely depends upon our continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled employees. We provide our employees with competitive salaries and bonuses, opportunities for equity ownership, development programs that enable continued learning and growth and a robust employment package that promotes well-being across all aspects of their lives, including health care, retirement planning and paid time off. Much of our success is rooted in the diversity of our teams and our commitment to equity and inclusion. We value diversity at all levels.

Government Regulation
Government Regulation and Product Approval
Government authorities in the United States at the federal, state and local level and in other countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, (including manufacturing changes), quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, marketing, export and import of products such as those we are developing. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
U.S. Drug Development Process
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the United States Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) and the FDA’s implementing regulations.
Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, untitled or warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties. The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:

● | completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies according to Good Laboratory Practices regulations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug application (IND) which must become effective before human clinical studies may begin;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | approval by an independent IRB at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical studies according to Good Clinical Practice (GCP), regulations, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for its intended use;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

15




● | preparation and submission to the FDA of an NDA, containing the results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the drug product, proposed labeling and other relevant information, to request approval to market the drug product;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the drug product, or components thereof, are produced to assess compliance with cGMP to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | satisfactory completion of FDA audits of clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCPs and the integrity of clinical data;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | FDA review and approval of the NDA;
--+------------------------------------


● | payment of fees, including annual program fees for each drug product on the market; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | ongoing compliance with any post approval requirements, including risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) and post approval studies required by the FDA.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.
Once a pharmaceutical product candidate is identified for development, it enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity, formulation and stability, as well as animal studies. When a sponsor wants to proceed to test the product candidate in humans, it must submit an IND in order to conduct clinical trials.
An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature, to the FDA as part of the IND. The sponsor must also include a protocol detailing, among other things, the objectives of the initial clinical study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated if the initial clinical study lends itself to an efficacy evaluation. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions related to a proposed clinical study and places the study on a clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical study can begin. Clinical holds also may be imposed by the FDA at any time before or during clinical studies due to safety concerns or non-compliance, and may be imposed on all product candidates within a certain pharmaceutical class. The FDA also can impose partial clinical holds, for example, prohibiting the initiation of clinical studies of a certain duration or for a certain dose.
All clinical studies must be conducted under the supervision of one or more qualified investigators in accordance with GCP regulations. These regulations include the requirement that all research subjects provide informed consent in writing before their participation in any clinical study. Further, an IRB must review and approve the plan for any clinical study before it commences at any institution, and the IRB must conduct continuing review and reapprove the study at least annually. An IRB considers, among other things, whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical study are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the information regarding the clinical study and the consent form that must be provided to each clinical study subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical study until completed.
Each new clinical protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be submitted for FDA review, and to the IRBs for approval. Protocols detail, among other things, the objectives of the clinical study, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety.

16



Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for public dissemination on their ClinicalTrials.gov website.
Human clinical studies are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:

● | Phase 1. The product is initially introduced into a small number of healthy human subjects or patients and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product is suspected or known to be unavoidably toxic, the initial human testing may be conducted in patients.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 2. Involves clinical studies in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage and schedule.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 3. Clinical studies are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical study sites. These clinical studies are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit relationship of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical studies must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 testing may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical study at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical study at its institution if the clinical study is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
There are FDA-imposed limitations on communications about investigational drugs. The FDA prohibits companies from making promotional claims of safety or effectiveness of the drug for a use for which it is under investigation, and from “commercialization” of the drug before it is approved for commercial marketing and distribution, and otherwise regulates communications about products in clinical trials. FDA law prohibits “misbranding” of drugs and establishes related rules and policies on communications about promotional and non-promotional (educational, scientific) communications. Interactions with or communications directed to healthcare professionals (HCPs), patients or patient- or disease-advocates or advocacy groups, and payors, are subject to heightened scrutiny by the FDA. Relative to non-promotional communications, for example, there are specific and limited FDA accommodations for non-promotional, truthful and non-misleading sharing of information regarding products in development and off-label uses including dissemination of peer-reviewed reprints, support of independent continuing medical education (CME) and healthcare economic discussions with payors. In a competitive environment, a company’s communications about products in development may also be subject to heightened scrutiny.
Concurrent with clinical studies, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the product and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
U.S. Review and Approval Processes
Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical studies, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the drug, proposed labeling and other relevant information, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA for a new drug, requesting approval to market the product.

17



The submission of an NDA is subject to the payment of a substantial application user fee although a waiver of such fee may be obtained under certain limited circumstances. For example, the agency will waive the application fee for the first human drug application that a small business or its affiliate submits for review. The sponsor of an approved NDA is also subject to annual program user fees.
In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003 (PREA) an NDA application (or a supplement to an application) for a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration must contain a Pediatric Assessment. If so, the submission must contain data from pediatric studies that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective, unless the applicant has obtained a waiver or deferral. PREA applies only to products developed for diseases that occur in both adult and pediatric populations, and generally does not apply to products with Orphan Drug Designation or to ANDAs for generic drugs.
A sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a drug product that is subject to the PREA requirements must submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan (PSP). The FDA encourages all applications to submit the PSP as soon as possible in the drug development process, and to discuss the plan with FDA at critical points in the development process. For products intended for life-threatening or severely debilitating illnesses, applicants are encouraged to discuss the PSP at the Pre-IND meeting and End-of-Phase 1 meeting. For products not intended for such illnesses, the FDA recommends that sponsors submit and discuss the PSP no later than the End-of-Phase 2 (EOP2) meeting. The initial PSP must include an outline of the pediatric study or studies that the sponsor plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, age groups, relevant endpoints and statistical approach, or a justification for not including such detailed information. The FDA and the sponsor must reach agreement on the PSP. A sponsor can submit amendments to an agreed-upon initial PSP at any time if changes to the pediatric plan need to be considered based on data collected from preclinical studies, early phase clinical studies or other clinical development programs. The sponsor may submit a request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the requirement to provide data from pediatric studies along with supporting information. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers. It is critical that sponsors are in compliance with the PREA, as non-compliance may result in the FDA considering the drug product misbranded solely on that basis.
The FDA also may require submission of a REMS to mitigate any identified or suspected serious risks. The REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans and elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries or other risk minimization tools.
The FDA reviews all NDAs submitted to ensure that they are sufficiently complete for substantive review before it accepts them for filing. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an application for filing. In this event, the application must be re-submitted with the additional information. The re-submitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review.
The FDA reviews an NDA to determine whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use, which includes assessment of preclinical and clinical data; proposed labeling; CMC data; and an assessment of whether the manufacturing processes and facilities meet the appropriate requirements and comply with the applicable regulations (including cGMP requirements and adequate assurance for consistent commercial production of the product within required specifications). There are numerous FDA personnel assigned to review different aspects of an NDA, exercising judgment, discretion, and interpretation of data relative to the review process.
The FDA may approve an NDA only if, among other things, the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture processing, packing and testing of the product are adequate to ensure and preserve its identity, strength, quality and purity.
Before approving an NDA, the FDA often will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is or will be manufactured.

18



The FDA may refer the NDA to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. An advisory committee is a panel of experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, who provide advice and recommendations when requested by the FDA. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations when making decisions.
Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure clinical data supporting the submission were developed in compliance with GCP.
The approval process is lengthy and difficult, and the FDA may refuse to approve an NDA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, or may require additional preclinical, clinical or CMC data or other data and information. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical studies, as well as other types of supporting data, are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than an applicant interprets the same data.
After the FDA’s evaluation of an application, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter to indicate that the review cycle is complete and that the application is not ready for approval. A complete response letter generally contains a statement of specific conditions that must be met to secure final approval of the application and may require additional clinical or preclinical testing for the FDA to reconsider the application. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical studies. Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the application, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application, or request an opportunity for a hearing.
Even with submission of additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA will typically issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications.
If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. In addition, the FDA may require post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical studies, to further assess safety and effectiveness after approval and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.
New Drug Applications
Most drug products obtain FDA marketing approval pursuant to an NDA (described above) for innovator products, or an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, for generic products. Relevant to ANDAs, the U.S. Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, as amended (the “Hatch-Waxman Act”), amendments to the FDCA established a statutory procedure for submission and FDA review and approval of ANDAs for generic versions of branded drugs previously approved by the FDA (such previously approved drugs are also referred to as listed drugs). Because the safety and efficacy of listed drugs have already been established by the brand company (sometimes referred to as the innovator), the FDA does not require new human clinical trials to establish safety and efficacy of generic products. Rather, a generic manufacturer is typically required to conduct bioequivalence studies of its test product against the listed drug. The bioequivalence studies for orally administered, systemically available drug products assess the rate and extent to which the active pharmaceutical ingredient is absorbed into the bloodstream from the drug product and becomes available at the site of action. Bioequivalence is established when there is an absence of a significant difference in the rate and extent for absorption of the generic product and the listed drug. For some drugs, including locally acting drugs such as topical anti-fungals, other means of demonstrating bioequivalence may be required by the

FDA, especially where rate and/or extent of absorption are difficult or impossible to measure. In addition to the bioequivalence data, an ANDA must contain patent certifications and chemistry, manufacturing, labeling and stability data.
A third alternative is a special type of NDA, commonly referred to as a 505(b)(2) NDA, which enables the applicant to rely, in part, on the FDA’s findings of safety and efficacy of an existing product, or published literature, in support of its application. 505(b)(2) NDAs often provide an alternate path to FDA approval for new or improved formulations or new uses of previously approved products. Section 505(b)(2) permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. The applicant may rely upon the FDA’s findings with respect to certain preclinical or clinical studies conducted for an approved product. The FDA may also require companies to perform additional studies or measurements to support the change from the approved product. The FDA may then approve the new product candidate for all or some of the label indications for which the referenced product has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the 505(b)(2) applicant.
In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, including a 505(b)(2) NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA certain patents of the applicant or that are held by third parties whose claims cover the applicant’s product. Upon approval of an NDA, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations (the “Orange Book”). Any subsequent applicant who files an ANDA seeking approval of a generic equivalent version of a drug listed in the Orange Book or a 505(b)(2) NDA referencing a drug listed in the Orange Book must make one of the following certifications to the FDA concerning patents: (1) the patent information concerning the reference listed drug product has not been submitted to the FDA; (2) any such patent that was filed has expired; (3) the date on which such patent will expire; or (4) such patent is invalid, unenforceable or will not be infringed upon by the manufacture, use or sale of the drug product for which the application is submitted. This last certification is known as a paragraph IV certification. A notice of the paragraph IV certification must be provided to each owner of the patent that is the subject of the certification and to the holder of the approved NDA to which the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application refers. The applicant may also elect to submit a “section viii” statement certifying that its proposed label does not contain (or carves out) any language regarding the patented method-of-use rather than certify to a listed method-of-use patent.
If the reference NDA holder or patent owners assert a patent challenge directed to one of the Orange Book listed patents within 45 days of the receipt of the paragraph IV certification notice, the FDA is prohibited from approving the application until the earlier of 30 months from the receipt of the paragraph IV certification expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the applicant. The ANDA or 505(b)(2) application also will not be approved until any applicable non-patent exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for the branded reference drug has expired as described in further detail below. Thus approval of a 505(b)(2) NDA or ANDA can be prevented until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired, until any non-patent exclusivity, such as exclusivity for obtaining approval of a new chemical entity, listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired, and, in the case of a Paragraph IV certification and subsequent patent infringement suit, until the earlier of 30 months, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant.
The FDA may issue tentative approval of an application if the application meets all conditions for approval but cannot receive effective approval because the listed patents, the 30-month stay or another period of regulatory exclusivity, as applicable, has not expired. If tentative approval is granted, then once such listed patents, 30-month stay or other regulatory exclusivity have expired or, in the case of patents that are subject to a patent infringement suit, been found to be invalid or not infringed, the applicant may seek final approval by submitting an amendment that, among other things, includes a safety update and any other changes, if any, in the conditions under which the product was tentatively approved. Prior to granting final approval, the FDA must review and approve any changes reflected in the amendment and may consider any other new information that has come to its attention. An amendment requesting final approval is generally subject to either a 2-month or 6-month review cycle, depending on the information submitted in the amendment.

Combination Products
Medical products containing a combination of new drugs, biological products, or medical devices are regulated as “combination products” in the United States. A combination product generally is defined as a product comprised of components from two or more regulatory categories, such as drug/device, device/biologic or drug/biologic. The term combination product includes: (i) a product comprised of two or more regulated components (i.e., drug/device, biologic/device, drug/biologic or drug/device/biologic, that are physically, chemically or otherwise combined or mixed and produced as a single entity); (ii) two or more separate products packaged together in a single package or as a unit and comprised of drug and device products, device and biological products or biological and drug products; (iii) a drug, device or biological product packaged separately that according to its investigational plan or proposed labeling is intended for use only with an approved individually specified drug, device or biological product where both are required to achieve the intended use, indication or effect and where upon approval of the proposed product the labeling of the approved product would need to be changed, such as to reflect a change in intended use, dosage form, strength, route of administration, or significant change in dose; or (iv) any investigational drug, device or biological product packaged separately that according to its proposed labeling is for use only with another individually specified investigational drug, device, or biological product where both are required to achieve the intended use, indication or effect.
Each constituent part of a combination product is subject to the requirements established by the FDA for that type of constituent part, whether a new drug, biologic or device. In order to facilitate pre-market review of combination products, the FDA designates one of its centers to have primary jurisdiction for the pre-market review and regulation of the overall product based upon a determination by FDA of the primary mode of action of the combination product, and typically one application, such as for a drug/device combination product assigned to the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) an NDA, will be made.
A device with the primary purpose of delivering or aiding in the delivery of a drug and distributed containing a drug (i.e., a “prefilled delivery system”) is typically evaluated by CDER using drug authorities and device authorities, as necessary.
A device with the primary purpose of delivering or aiding in the delivery of a drug and that is distributed without the drug (i.e., unfilled) is typically evaluated by the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health and CDER, respectively, unless the intended use of the two products, through labeling, creates a combination product.
The FDA has indicated that dry powder inhalers, such as our lead product candidate, YUTREPIA, are drug/device combination products.
Post-Approval Requirements
Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to extensive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping (including certain electronic record and signature requirements), periodic reporting, drug supply chain security surveillance and tracking requirements, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of certain adverse experiences, deviations and other problems with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There are also, under The Prescription Drug User Fee Act, continuing, annual FDA “program fee” requirements for products once they are approved, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data.
The FDA strictly regulates labeling, advertising, promotion and other types of information on products that are placed on the market. Products may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. Further, manufacturers must continue to comply with cGMP requirements, which are extensive and require considerable time, resources and ongoing investment to ensure compliance. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented and other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval.

21



Manufacturers and certain other entities involved in the manufacturing and distribution of approved products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. The cGMP requirements apply to all stages of the manufacturing process, including the production, processing, sterilization, packaging, labeling, storage and shipment of the product. Manufacturers must establish validated systems to ensure that products meet specifications and regulatory standards and test each product batch or lot prior to its release. Combination products are subject to FDA regulation to ensure the quality of both the constituent parts and the finished product.
Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.
The FDA may impose a number of post-approval requirements as a condition of approval of an application. For example, the FDA may require post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization.
The FDA may withdraw a product approval if compliance with regulatory requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, problems with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market.
Potential implications include required revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:

● | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


● | refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising, and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. As a compliance best practice and risk mitigation measure, pharmaceutical companies typically train their sales force regarding the limitations on promotion of products relative to their approved indications for use and concerns regarding potential “off-label promotion.” However, a physician may use products off-label when, in the physician’s independent professional medical judgment, he or she deems it appropriate. Recent court decisions have impacted FDA’s enforcement activity regarding off-label promotion in the light of First Amendment considerations; however, there are still significant risks in this area in part due to the potential for False Claims Act exposure. Further, the FDA as not materially changed its position on off-label promotion following legal setbacks on First Amendment grounds and the U.S. Department of Justice has consistently asserted in False Claims Act briefings that “speech serves as a conduit for violations of the law is not constitutionally protected.”

22



The distribution of commercial prescription drugs is subject to the Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCSA), which regulates the distribution of the products at the federal level, and sets certain standards for federal or state registration and compliance of entities in the supply chain and regulation of manufacturers and repackagers, wholesale distributors, third-party logistics providers, and dispensers. The DSCSA preempts certain previously enacted state pedigree laws and upon taking effect superseded the pedigree requirements of the Prescription Drug Marketing Act (PDMA). Trading partners within the drug supply chain must now ensure certain product tracing requirements are met, and are required to exchange transaction information, transaction history, and transaction statements. Product identifier information (an aspect of the product tracing scheme) is also now required. The DSCSA requirements, development of standards, and the system of product tracing have been and will continue to be phased in over a period of years through 2023, and subject companies will need to continue their implementation efforts. Many states still have in place licensure and other requirements for manufacturers and distributors of drug products. The distribution of product samples continues to be regulated under the PDMA, and some states also impose regulations on drug sample distribution.
From time to time, legislation is drafted, introduced and passed in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the approval, manufacturing and marketing of products regulated by the FDA. In addition to new legislation, FDA regulations, guidance and policies are often revised or reinterpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and our product candidates. It is impossible to predict whether further legislative or FDA regulation or policy changes will be enacted or implemented and what the impact of such changes, if any, may be.
Patent Term Restoration
Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of the use of our product candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited PTE under the Hatch-Waxman Act. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term effectively lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application, except that the review period is reduced by any time during which the applicant failed to exercise due diligence. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension. Extensions are not granted as a matter of right and the extension must be applied for prior to expiration of the patent and within a sixty-day period from the date the product is first approved for commercial marketing. The USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any PTE or restoration. In the future, we may apply for PTEs, defined as the length of the regulatory review of products covered by our granted patents, for some of our currently owned or licensed applications and patents to add patent life beyond their current expiration dates. Such extensions will depend on the length of the regulatory review; however, there can be no assurance that any such extension will be granted to us.
Marketing Exclusivity
Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA can also delay the submission or the approval of certain applications. The specific scope varies, but fundamentally the FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an ANDA or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, for new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions of use associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving applications for drugs containing the original active agent. This three-year exclusivity does not preclude submission of the ANDA or Section 505(b)(2) NDA for such a product but prevents the FDA from giving final approval to such product. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not 

23



delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical studies necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
Pediatric exclusivity is another type of exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, provides an additional six months to the term of any existing regulatory exclusivity, including the non-patent exclusivity periods described above. This six-month exclusivity may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric clinical study that “fairly responds” to an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a clinical study.
Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
In the United States, sales of any products for which we may receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors include government authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations.
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any products for which we may obtain regulatory approval. Some of the additional requirements and restrictions on coverage and reimbursement levels imposed by third-party payors influence the purchase of healthcare services and products. The process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for establishing the reimbursement rate that such a payor will pay for the product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific drugs on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drugs for a particular indication, or place drugs at certain formulary levels that result in lower reimbursement levels. Moreover, a payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage and reimbursement for the product, and the level of coverage and reimbursement may differ significantly from payor to payor as there is no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug products among third-party payors.
Reimbursement may also impact the demand for drug products that obtain marketing approval. If coverage for a drug product is obtained by a third-party payor, the resulting reimbursement payment rates may not be adequate or may require co-payments that patients find unacceptably high. Further, third party payors require onerous prior approvals or implement other forms of restricted access that make it difficult for patients to utilize our drug products. Patients who are prescribed medications for the treatment of their conditions, and their prescribing physicians, generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the costs associated with their prescription drugs. Prescribing physicians are unlikely to use or prescribe drug products unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover all or a significant portion of the cost of those drug products. If reimbursement is not available, or is available only to limited levels, a drug product which has obtained marketing approval may not be successfully commercialized.
Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. In order to obtain and maintain coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of any products, in addition to the costs required to obtain regulatory approvals. Our product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. If third-party payors do not consider a product to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover the product after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow a company to sell its products at a profit.
The U.S. government and state legislatures have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid healthcare costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and coverage and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs. There has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to drug pricing practices. For example, U.S. federal prosecutors have issued subpoenas to pharmaceutical companies seeking information about pricing practices in connection with an investigation into pricing practices being conducted by the DOJ. Several state attorneys general also 

24



have commenced drug pricing investigations and filed lawsuits against pharmaceutical companies, and the U.S. Senate has publicly investigated a number of pharmaceutical companies relating to price increases and pricing practices. Proposed legislation has been designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. Federal budget proposals have included measures to permit Medicare Part D plans to negotiate the price of certain drugs under Medicare Part B, to allow some states to negotiate drug prices under Medicaid, and to eliminate cost sharing for generic drugs for low-income patients. It is possible that President Biden may issue Executive Orders with the potential to change a number of prior executive branch actions on drug pricing. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Adoption of government controls and measures, and tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could exclude or limit our drugs and product candidates from coverage and limit payments for pharmaceuticals. We continue to monitor the potential impact of proposals to lower prescription drug costs at the federal and state level, and anticipate that current and future U.S. federal and state legislative proposals may result in additional downward pressure on drug pricing and reimbursement, which could have a significant impact on our business.
The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the “IRA”), which includes certain new tax measures, was signed into law in August 2022. The IRA contains two main tax provisions, a new corporate alternative minimum tax imposed on certain corporations meeting average annual financial statement income of more than $1 billion during a three-year tax period, and an excise tax imposed upon share repurchases by certain publicly traded corporations. The IRA is effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2022; we are evaluating the provisions of the IRA but currently do not believe these provisions will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Among other things, the IRA requires manufacturers of certain drugs to engage in price negotiations with Medicare (beginning in 2026), imposes rebates under Medicare Part B and Medicare Part D to penalize price increases that outpace inflation (first due in 2023), and replaces the Part D coverage gap discount program with a new discounting program (beginning in 2025). Failure to comply with requirements under the drug price negotiation program or pay the identified rebates is subject to an excise tax and/or a civil monetary penalty. The IRA permits the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to implement many of these provisions through guidance, as opposed to regulation, for the initial years. For that and other reasons, it is currently unclear how the IRA will be effectuated and the impact of the IRA on the pharmaceutical industry and on generic drug pricing cannot yet be fully determined.
In addition, we expect that the increased emphasis on managed care and cost containment measures in the United States by third-party payors and government authorities to continue and will place pressure on pharmaceutical pricing and coverage. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
Healthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors often play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any drug products for which we may obtain marketing approval, or for which we may provide contracted promotional services to third parties. Our current and future arrangements with healthcare providers, physicians, third-party payors and customers, and our sales, marketing and educational activities, may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations (at the federal and state level) that may constrain our business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we market, sell, or distribute drug products.
Among the laws and regulations that may affect our ability to operate and may present risk to our business are those, at the federal and state level, on topics including: anti-kickback, false claims, and other healthcare fraud, waste, and abuse matters; drug pricing and price reporting; advertising, promotion, and other types of communications regarding pharmaceutical products; limitations on and transparency regarding financial relationships with healthcare professionals; and data privacy and security. See Item 1A. Risk Factors – General Risks Related to Healthcare Regulation.

25



Healthcare Reform
A primary trend in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. There have been a number of federal and state proposals during the last few years regarding the pricing of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical products, limiting coverage and reimbursement for drugs and other medical products, government control and other changes to the healthcare system in the United States including the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA).
In the future, there may continue to be additional proposals relating to the reform of the U.S. healthcare system, some of which could further limit the prices we will be able to charge for our product candidates, or the amounts of reimbursement available for our product candidates. If future legislation were to impose direct governmental price controls or access restrictions, it could have a significant adverse impact on our business. Managed care organizations, as well as Medicaid and other government agencies, continue to seek price discounts. Some states have implemented, and other states are considering, measures to reduce costs of the Medicaid program, and some states are considering implementing measures that would apply to broader segments of their populations that are not Medicaid-eligible. Due to the volatility in the current economic and market dynamics, we are unable to predict the impact of any unforeseen or unknown legislative, regulatory, payor or policy actions, which may include cost containment and healthcare reform measures. Such policy actions could have a material adverse impact on our profitability.
These and other healthcare reform initiatives may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial operations. We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our product candidates or additional pricing pressures.
Foreign Regulation of Drugs
In order to market any product outside of the United States, we will need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding development, approval, commercial sales and distribution of our products, and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of our products, if approved. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies between countries and jurisdictions and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries and jurisdictions might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction may negatively impact the regulatory process in others.
