  Overview 
         We are a forward-thinking women's healthcare company dedicated to fulfilling the unmet health needs of today's women. Twirla® and our other current potential product candidates are designed to provide women with contraceptive options that offer greater convenience and facilitate compliance. Our lead product candidate, Twirla, also known as AG200-15, is a once-weekly prescription combination hormonal contraceptive patch that is at the end of Phase 3 clinical development. We plan to resubmit our new drug application, or NDA, for Twirla to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and seek FDA approval of the NDA in 2019. 
   Twirla and the Contraceptive Market 
         Our short-term goal is to establish a market-leading franchise in the multi-billion-dollar U.S. hormonal contraceptive market built on the planned initial approval of Twirla in the U.S. Over half of those sales were generated by branded products. Contraceptive methods, other than sterilization, can be divided into non-hormonal and hormonal alternatives. Non-hormonal contraceptive products available in the United States include the diaphragm, male condom and female condom. There are several methods of hormonal contraception available in the United States, including oral contraceptives, vaginal rings, intrauterine contraceptive devices, or IUDs, subcutaneous implants, injectables and a transdermal patch that is available in branded and generic versions. Over the years, the doses of ethinyl estradiol, or EE, most commonly included in combined hormonal contraceptives, or CHCs, have steadily decreased to 35 micrograms per day or below, due to associated safety risks of higher EE doses. Currently, there is only one other contraceptive patch available in the United States, and it delivers EE at a level that is 60% higher than that delivered with low-dose oral contraceptives containing 35 micrograms of EE. As a result, the currently approved patch carries a boxed warning describing safety risks associated with this higher level of EE. Before these issues were identified with the first marketed patch, it achieved rapid market uptake and quickly captured approximately 10% of the CHC market. Twirla is designed to address the limitations associated with the dose and physical characteristics of the currently approved contraceptive patch. We have developed a proprietary transdermal patch technology, called Skinfusion®, which is designed to provide advantages over the currently available patch and is intended to optimize patch adhesion with patient wearability. We believe there is an unmet market need for a low-dose contraceptive patch that is designed to address the limitations of the existing patch, while increasing patient convenience and compliance in a non-invasive fashion. 
         Twirla is a CHC patch that contains the active ingredients EE, which is a synthetic estrogen, and levonorgestrel, or LNG, which is a type of progestin, a synthetic steroid hormone, both of which have an established history of efficacy and safety in currently marketed combination low-dose, oral contraceptives. Twirla delivers approximately 30 micrograms of EE per day, a dose of EE consistent with low-dose oral contraceptives. The daily delivery of EE from Twirla is lower than the levels of EE delivered by the currently approved patch products, as reported in that patch's label. Twirla is designed using our proprietary Skinfusion technology to deliver both hormones over a seven-day period at levels comparable to currently marketed low-dose oral contraceptives. By delivering these active ingredients over seven days, in a comfortable, convenient and easy-to-use weekly patch, Twirla is designed to promote ease of use and enhanced patient compliance. The patch is applied once-weekly for three weeks, followed by a week without a patch. If approved, Twirla will be packaged with three individually-wrapped patches per carton to provide for one 28-day cycle of therapy. 
         Twirla is round and made of a soft, flexible fabric, designed to flex with the movement of a woman's body. Twirla is a matrix patch consisting of several layers of material which contain the active ingredients EE and LNG, inactive ingredients to assist in transport of EE and LNG across the skin, 
 3

   and adhesives that allow adherence to the skin. There is a barrier formed between the inner portion of the patch, which contains the active ingredients, and the outer portion of the patch, which only contains the adhesive. This barrier is intended to prevent the active and inactive ingredients from migrating to the peripheral portion of the patch, and from breaking down the adhesive in that portion of the patch. Twirla is also designed to help prevent seepage of the adhesives from around the edges of the patch where it could collect dirt and leave a sticky black ring on the skin. The six layers of the patch are integrated to create a patch which has a slim profile, less than one millimeter, and is designed to be unobtrusive when applied. 
   Twirla Clinical Development Program and Regulatory History 
         We have conducted a comprehensive clinical program, with completed Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3 trials enrolling over 4,100 women, over 3,500 of whom received Twirla. Most recently, in December 2016, we completed a Phase 3 trial, the SECURE clinical trial, in which we enrolled over 2,000 women for up to one year of treatment. In the Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials, we demonstrated that Twirla delivers levels of both EE and LNG to the blood stream that are consistent with those delivered by current low-dose oral contraceptives. Prior to the SECURE clinical trial, we completed two Phase 3 clinical trials that enrolled over 1,900 women in the aggregate for up to 12 months, and we demonstrated that Twirla generally had comparable efficacy and tolerability to an approved low-dose oral contraceptive. However, these studies were not designed as non-inferiority studies and, as such, the comparative conclusions that may be drawn from these studies are limited. In the SECURE clinical trial, we observed positive evidence of efficacy for Twirla based on use for up to one year. In our completed Phase 3 trials to date, over 1,000 women have received Twirla for 12 months. Across all completed clinical trials, Twirla was generally well tolerated and had a favorable safety profile. 
         In our Phase 3 trials, the primary measure of efficacy is the Pearl Index, or PI, which is a measure of the rate of unintended pregnancies experienced by women in the study. Specifically, the PI is expressed as the number of pregnancies per 100 woman-years of use. In the SECURE clinical trial, the overall intent to treat population of subjects 35 years of age and under was 4.80 with an upper bound of the 95% confidence interval of 6.06, but in the obese subpopulation of subjects 35 years of age and under, the PI was 6.42 with an upper bound of the 95% confidence interval of 8.88. If we were to exclude the data on the obese subpopulation, our PI for non-obese patients was 3.94 with an upper bound of the 95% confidence interval of 5.35. The highest bound PI for a hormonal contraceptive product approved by the FDA to date was 3.19 and the highest upper bound of the 95% confidence interval was 5.03. The FDA has indicated that it anticipates reviewing the safety and efficacy of Twirla during an Advisory Committee meeting to obtain input on whether the benefits of Twirla outweigh the risks, which would include a consideration of the PI for Twirla. 
         We have had a long and complicated history seeking regulatory approval for Twirla in the U.S., which has included the submission of our NDA for Twirla twice (first in 2012 and again in 2017), the issuance of two complete response letters, or CRLs, from the FDA in 2013 and 2017, and the need to pursue formal dispute resolution with the FDA after the 2017 CRL. We expect to face significant challenges as we continue to pursue regulatory approval for Twirla, including a likely Advisory Committee review of the safety and efficacy of Twirla, including a discussion regarding the Pearl Index from our SECURE Phase 3 clinical trial that the FDA noted is substantially higher than other previously approved CHCs, and a likely pre-approval inspection of our third party manufacturer's facility, which must be successfully completed prior to approval. 
         We plan to resubmit our Twirla NDA responding to the 2017 CRL in the second quarter of 2019. Our planned resubmission is intended to be a complete response to the 2017 CRL and will include the results from the comparative wear study, additional information on our manufacturing process, and other analyses responding to the 2017 CRL. Consistent with our previous NDA resubmission in 2017, 
 4

   we currently expect that our resubmission will be categorized as a Type 2 resubmission and receive a review period of six months from the date of resubmission of the NDA. Following the resubmission, we anticipate that FDA will likely re-inspect our contract manufacturer, Corium, and hold an Advisory Committee meeting to review of the safety and efficacy of Twirla. 
   Manufacturing and Commercialization Strategy for Twirla 
         Our Skinfusion technology makes Twirla the first patch capable of delivering a contraceptive dose of LNG across the skin, allowing weekly application using a patch that is soft and flexible and is designed to adhere well with low levels of skin irritation. We, along with Corium, our manufacturing partner, have made a significant investment in a proprietary process to manufacture Twirla. We believe we have developed a robust process to reliably manufacture Twirla on a commercial scale. The materials produced for our clinical trials were manufactured using the same process that we expect will be used for our commercial-scale manufacturing, and we have made a significant investment in equipment for commercial-scale manufacturing if Twirla is approved. Along with Corium, we are enhancing our quality-control test methods in a way that we believe will address the issues identified by the FDA in both the 2017 CRL and the Corium facility inspection and that will allow us to continue to use our current commercial manufacturing process for Twirla. We believe that the technical challenges and know-how involved in manufacturing, including proprietary chemistry, production to scale and use of custom equipment and reproducibility, present significant barriers to entry for other pharmaceutical companies who might potentially want to replicate our Skinfusion technology. 
         In January 2018, following our receipt of the 2017 CRL, we significantly scaled back our preparations for commercialization of Twirla, which resulted in the halting of all substantive activities at Corium, including running of our equipment. Accordingly, we do not expect commercial pre-launch and manufacturing validation activities to resume until we are able to address the 2017 CRL and receive approval of Twirla. If Twirla is approved, we would need to recommence scale-up activities, which would include qualification of our manufacturing equipment and validation of the manufacturing process. 
         However, if Twirla is approved, we intend to commercialize Twirla in the United States through a direct sales force. Obstetricians and gynecologists, or ObGyns, Nurse Practitioners, or NPs, and Physician Assistants, or PAs, combine to write most CHC prescriptions, with ObGyns primarily driving prescriptions in the category. We anticipate that a targeted sales force focused initially on ObGyns, NPs, PAs and primary care providers who comprise the top prescribers of contraceptives will be highly effective. We believe that we can address this market with a specialty sales force of approximately 70 to 100 representatives. We also intend to augment our sales force through digital marketing and other techniques to market directly to patients. We will require additional capital to fully implement our commercialization plan for Twirla, if approved. 
   Intellectual Property 
         Our intellectual property represents an additional barrier to potential competitors. We have thirteen issued U.S. patents, eight of which cover Twirla and that we intend to list in the Orange Book, the first of which expires in 2021 and the last of which expires in 2028, and five that provide additional coverage for other potential product candidates in our pipeline. The Orange Book lists drug products, including related patent and exclusivity information, approved by the FDA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. If a patent is listed in the Orange Book, potential competitors seeking approval of drug products under an Abbreviated New Drug Application, which provides for the marketing of a generic drug product that has the same active ingredients, dosage form, strength, route of administration, labeling, performance characteristics and intended use, among other things, of a previously approved product, or a 505(b)(2) application, for which the listed drug is a reference product, must provide a patent certification in their application stating either that (1) no patent 
 5

   information on the drug product has been submitted to the FDA; (2) such patent has expired; (3) the date on which such patent expires; or (4) such patent is invalid or will not be infringed upon by the manufacture, use or sale of the drug product for which the application is submitted. In addition, we continue to prosecute additional patent applications relating to Twirla, as well as our other potential product candidates, both in the United States and internationally. The intellectual property behind all of our potential product candidates in the pipeline and our Skinfusion technology consists of patent families developed and wholly-owned by us. There are no royalties or payments owed to third parties on our Skinfusion technology or any of our product candidates. 
   Potential Pipeline 
         Twirla is our lead product candidate. In addition to Twirla, we have a potential pipeline of other new transdermal contraceptive products, including AG200-ER, which is a regimen designed to allow a woman to extend the length of her cycle, AG200-SP, which is a regimen designed to provide shorter lighter periods, AG200-ER (SmP), which is a regimen designed to allow a woman to extend the length of her cycle and experience shorter, lighter periods, and AG890, which is a progestin-only contraceptive patch intended for use by women who are unable or unwilling to take estrogen. Substantially all of our resources are currently dedicated to developing and seeking regulatory approval for Twirla. We have halted all further work on our pipeline except for Twirla. We will require additional capital should we choose to advance the development of our other potential product candidates. 
 Background 
   Hormonal Contraception Overview 
         A woman is biologically capable of pregnancy from the time of her first menstrual cycle, at the average age of 12.6 years, to natural menopause, at the average age of 51.3 years. This is nearly half of a typical woman's lifespan and, for the typical woman, the majority of this time frame is spent trying to avoid pregnancy or is characterized by no desire to become pregnant. Nearly half of the pregnancies that occur each year in the United States are unplanned. The United States was the first country to approve a hormonal contraceptive, with the approval of the first contraceptive pill in 1960. Data from 2011 to 2013 from the Centers for Disease Control, or CDC, indicate that approximately 28% of women aged 15 to 44 use some form of hormonal contraception, which amounts to approximately 17 million U.S. women. 
         Hormonal contraceptives are typically composed of synthetic estrogens and progestins. Contraceptives containing both estrogen and a progestin are referred to as CHCs, and contraceptives containing only progestin are referred to as P-only. There are three synthetic estrogens approved in the United States for use in contraceptive products: EE, mestranol, and estradiol valerate. EE has been available for over 40 years and is the estrogen component in nearly all CHCs today. There are 10 different progestins that have been used in contraceptives sold in the United States. The progestin component provides most of the contraceptive effect, while the estrogen component primarily provides cycle control, for example, minimizing bleeding or spotting between cycles. The progestin exerts its contraceptive effect by inhibiting ovulation, or release of an egg from the ovary, and by thickening cervical mucus. Thickening cervical mucus helps to prevent sperm entry into the upper genital tract. The estrogen component, in addition to providing cycle control, makes a small contribution to contraception by decreasing the maturation of the egg in the ovary. 
         Hormonal contraceptives are generally well-tolerated and are generally safer than pregnancy. A risk associated with hormonal contraceptives is a rare but serious adverse event called venous thromboembolism, or VTE, which involves the formation of a blood clot in a vein. VTEs can be life-threatening, and typically present as either deep vein thrombosis, or DVT, or pulmonary embolism, or PE. Evidence supports that the increased risk of VTE in CHC users is related to the estrogen dose 
 6

   and duration of use, with higher doses of estrogen being associated with a potentially increased risk of VTE. Estrogen increases formation of clotting factors in the liver and decreases production of elements that promote breakdown of blood clots. Most experts believe that progestins on their own have minimal to no impact on the clotting system, but some progestins, when combined with estrogen, can increase estrogen's effect on the clotting system. 
         The likelihood of a woman spontaneously developing a VTE is extremely low and the use of combination oral contraceptives, or COCs, increases the incidence only slightly, and less than pregnancy. Epidemiologic studies evaluated by the FDA have demonstrated the incidence of VTE in women based on pregnancy or use of COCs as follows: 
      Incidence of VTE Based on Pregnancy Status or use of COCs 
   
Population | VTE incidence (cases per 10,000 woman-years*)
Non-pregnant woman who does not use a COC | 1 to 5 
COC users | 3 to 12 
Pregnant women | 5 to 20 
Postpartum women (in the 12 weeks following delivery) | 40 to 65 


  *
One woman-year is one woman using a contraceptive for one year, which is either 12 months or 13 cycles 


        The available progestins are commonly categorized into generations, based on their history of introduction in the United States. The first and second generation progestins, including LNG, have been available in contraceptive formulations in the United States for over 30 years. The third and fourth generation progestins, for example desogestrel and drospirenone, respectively, were developed to help reduce androgenic side effects, such as oily skin and acne. Epidemiologic data suggest that CHCs containing third and fourth generation progestins are associated with an increased risk of VTE as compared to those containing the second-generation progestin, LNG. 
   Effectiveness of Hormonal Contraceptives 
         For the purpose of FDA approval, contraceptive effectiveness is measured by a calculation called the Pearl Index, or PI, and its associated 95% confidence interval, or CI. The PI is a measure of the rate of pregnancies over a specific period of time in a clinical trial and is expressed as the number of pregnancies per 100 woman-years, or WY, of use. Each cycle lasts 28 days, so there are approximately 13 cycles in one year. The PI calculation typically includes all pregnancies for which conception is estimated to have occurred while the subject was using the drug (i.e., on-treatment pregnancies), but only includes cycles where the woman did not use backup contraception, such as a condom. The PI values from clinical trials are affected by several factors, including differences in study design, increased sensitivity of early pregnancy tests, weight and body mass index, or BMI, of the study population, user experience and inconsistent or incorrect use of the contraceptive method. In addition, there has been an observable trend in PIs for approved CHCs demonstrating an increase in the PIs over time, believed to be related to changes in study design and study populations. The FDA has not established any regulatory guidance on specific parameters for an acceptable PI or CI to support approval. 
         The contraceptive failure rates observed in clinical trials are generally lower than those seen once a CHC is approved and in use by a broad population, referred to as typical use, without the close monitoring of a clinical trial setting. There is a large difference in pregnancy rates under conditions of perfect use, where the method is used following the directions exactly, and typical use. For example, for CHCs, including oral contraceptives, the vaginal ring and the transdermal patch, the percent of women 
 7

   experiencing an unintended pregnancy during the first year of use is 0.3% for perfect use and 9.0% for typical use. 
   U.S. Hormonal Contraceptive Market Background 
         Contraceptive methods, other than sterilization, can be divided into non-hormonal and hormonal alternatives. Examples of non-hormonal products available in the United States include the diaphragm, male condom, female condom, and non-hormonal intrauterine device, or IUD. There are several categories of hormonal contraception products available in the United States, including:


 oral contraceptive; 
 vaginal ring; 
 transdermal patch; 
 hormonal IUD; 
 subcutaneous implant; and 
 injectable. 

         The U.S. hormonal contraceptive market is a multi-billion-dollar market. The CHC portion of the market, consisting of pills, a transdermal patch and a vaginal ring (not including the Annovera ring, which was approved in August 2018), generates significantly greater prescription volume and sales compared to the P-only portion of the market, consisting of IUDs, injectables, implants, and P-only pills. Twirla is a CHC and, if approved, we believe it will compete primarily with products in the CHC market. 
         The U.S. hormonal contraceptive market is a mature market, with many branded and generic products available. Historically over the last decade, the market growth was flat to declining as measured by prescription volume, with the exception of a 4.8% increase in 2013 compared to 2012. Compared to 2016, prescriptions for hormonal contraceptives decreased by 3.7% in 2017. Gross sales have increased minimally over recent years for both the total hormonal contraceptive market and the CHC market. Market growth in gross sales is primarily due to price increases amongst branded products. 
         We believe there are two possible factors primarily affecting prescription volume in the contraceptive market. First, according to U.S. Census Bureau data and projections, the population of women aged 15 to 44 years has been growing at a rate of approximately 0.4% to 0.5% per year since 2011, increasing this population by 250,000 to 300,000 women per year.

        Contraceptive Population (Total women aged 15-44 yrs)

         Second, in 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Healthcare and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively, the ACA, was signed into law, which, among other things, requires all health plans, with limited exceptions, to cover certain preventive services for women with no cost-sharing, which means no deductible, no co-insurance and no co-payments by the patient, effective August 1, 2012. These services include those set forth in the Guidelines for Women's Preventive Services, or HRSA Guidelines, and adopted by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Health Resources and Services Administration. Contraceptive methods and counseling, including all FDA approved contraceptive methods as prescribed, are included in the HRSA Guidelines. Since these new ACA provisions went into effect in August 2012, quarterly prescription volume growth for the CHC market rose from negative growth year-on-year to positive growth between 4.0% and 5.0% for each of the six quarters following implementation. However, this appears to be a one-time phenomenon, as the market volume has declined on average 0.4% annually from 2014 to 2017. 
         During the period following enactment of the ACA, generic oral contraceptives have shown the greatest growth, primarily at the expense of branded oral contraceptives. This is likely due to the policies that were implemented by many managed care plans, which generally only provided generic oral contraceptives with no cost-sharing to the patient. The effect on non-oral products is less clear, but prescription volume for the vaginal ring showed a 10.0% decline from 2013 to 2017, while the prescription volume for the patch increased by 30.0% over the same time period. In May 2015, several government agencies, such as the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, the Department of Labor, or DOL, and the U.S. Department of Treasury, or Treasury, issued a clarification in the form of an FAQ which clarified the requirements for coverage of contraceptives under the ACA. The FAQ states that plans and issuers must cover without cost-sharing at least one form of contraception in each of the 18 current methods that the FDA has identified for women in its current Birth Control Guide. The patch is identified as a specific method in the FDA Birth Control Guide, and therefore insurers must cover at least one patch product with no cost-sharing to the patient. Because this clarifying guidance is applied for plan years (or in the individual market, policy years) beginning on 
 9

   or after 60 days from the date of publication of the FAQs, patients did not have the benefit of this clarification until their new plan year, which generally started in January 2016. 
         On January 20, 2017, the administration signed an Executive Order directing federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the ACA to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the ACA that would impose a fiscal or regulatory burden on states, individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices, among others. Congress also could consider subsequent legislation to repeal and replace elements of the ACA that are repealed. Additionally, in October 2017, the Department of Health and Human Services, jointly with the Department of Labor and the Treasury, issued two interim rules outlining exemption processes for employers not wanting to offer contraceptive coverage based on their religious beliefs or sincerely held moral convictions. While there is an injunction against the administration prohibiting it from implementing these rules, the ultimate outcome of that litigation cannot be predicted. Therefore, it is difficult to determine the full effect of the ACA or any other healthcare reform efforts on our business. We will continue to monitor the healthcare reform efforts and agency implementation. We believe the CHC market will maintain a long-term neutral annual growth rate. 
         Despite the availability of generic contraceptives for over 25 years, branded products have maintained a significant, though declining, share of the CHC market. Branded contraceptives in the CHC market have driven significant increases in the value of branded total prescriptions, or TRx. In the five years ended December 2018, the average annual price increase among the top branded products was 10.8%. The average price per cycle, referred to as the wholesale acquisition cost, or WAC, for a single 28-day cycle of the top branded products was $41.53 in 2006 and rose to $152.94 by December 2018. As of October 2014, the branded CHC transdermal patch (Ortho Evra) has been discontinued, and the generic CHC transdermal patch (Xulane) is currently priced at $122.15 per cycle. The other non-oral form of CHC, the vaginal ring, is currently priced at $162.63 per cycle. We cannot predict whether the manufacturers of branded products will continue to increase prices going forward, but we believe we will be able to set a WAC price for Twirla, if approved, that is comparable to other branded CHC products at the time of launch. 
   Contraceptive Pills 
         Based on 2014 data from the CDC, of women who choose to use a hormonal contraceptive, approximately 64% use the contraceptive pill, vaginal ring or patch, the majority of which use the contraceptive pill. The remaining 36% of women using hormonal contraception are split between using injectables, implants, or IUDs. Based on this information, we believe that contraceptive pills are the most popular choice because:


 patients and physicians are familiar with pills; 
 pills were the first to market and have been aggressively promoted for a long period of time; 
 historically, pills have been a covered benefit with good reimbursement in private and public healthcare plans; and 
 pills are a non-invasive option. 

         However, compliance remains a significant draw-back with pills. Published studies have shown that the average woman who uses oral contraceptives misses approximately two to four pills per month, which increases the potential for unintended pregnancies. We believe that a patch can offer greater convenience than a pill, as it does not require daily administration and, for certain women, could lead to greater compliance and ease of use. 
 10

     Contraceptive Patch Market Experience 
         The Ortho Evra® contraceptive patch, or Evra, was introduced in early 2002 and was the first FDA-approved contraceptive patch. The initial approved labeling for Evra indicated that it delivered a daily EE dose of 20 micrograms. Evra had rapid uptake in the contraceptive market and achieved a 10% share of the CHC market by September 2003. Following FDA approval of Evra, users of Evra began to report thrombotic and thromboembolic events to the FDA. Johnson & Johnson, the manufacturer of Evra, revised the Evra labeling in November 2005 to include information that EE exposure with Evra is 60% higher than that of an oral contraceptive containing EE of 35 micrograms, based on area under the curve, a commonly-used metric for measuring EE exposure in contraceptives. This information was ultimately included in an addition to the boxed warning that was unique to the Evra label. The Evra market share declined rapidly following the labeling changes, from a peak share of 11% in 2005, to 4% by the end of 2006, to 1.4% by the end of 2013, where it stabilized, with a 1.5% share of the market based on combined prescriptions for Evra and its generic equivalent (Xulane®) in 2014. In more recent years, the Xulane share of the CHC market grew slightly, with a 1.7% TRx share in 2016 and 1.8% TRx share in 2017. 
         In April 2014, Mylan Inc. announced the launch of Xulane®, a generic version of Evra. Generic pharmaceutical products are the chemical and pharmaceutical equivalents of the brand or a reference listed drug, or RLD. Generic drugs are bioequivalent to their reference brand name counterparts. Bioequivalence studies compare the bioavailability of the proposed drug product with that of the RLD product containing the same active ingredients. Bioavailability is a measure of the rate and extent to which the active ingredient is absorbed from a drug product and becomes available at the site of action. Under pharmacy dispensing rules governed by state law, depending on the state, if an automatic generic substitute is introduced, the pharmacist may dispense either the prescribed product, or they may replace it with an equivalent generic without being required to inform the patient or healthcare professional. In addition, the FDA offers a 180-day exclusivity period for generic products in specific cases. The first generic applicants to submit a substantially complete Abbreviated New Drug Application containing a paragraph IV certification to a listed patent are protected from competition from other generic versions of the same drug for the 180 days. As of December 2018, no other generic equivalents to Evra have been introduced. 
         The FDA has maintained, in spite of the wording in the labeling for Evra and its approved generic, that none of the epidemiologic studies provides a definitive answer regarding the relative risk of VTE with Evra compared to combined oral contraceptive use or whether the increased risk that some studies demonstrated is directly attributable to Evra. An advisory committee for the FDA stated that the benefits of Evra outweigh the risks. In its 2012 denial of a Citizen's Petition calling for the withdrawal of Evra, the FDA followed the committee's recommendations stating that the increased VTE risk does not warrant removal from the market, and that the labeling revisions to the Evra label provide a sufficient update and guidance on the interpretation of the epidemiologic data about the risk of VTE with Evra. In spite of the labeling changes, and Johnson & Johnson ceasing promotion of Evra in 2007, Evra and its generic equivalent continue to generate significant sales. 
         We believe that the rapid uptake and acceptance of Evra upon its introduction and its (and Xulane's) continued sales over the past several years demonstrate that there is an unmet market need for multiple choices in transdermal contraceptive patches. Also, the epidemiologic data on VTE risk suggest that there is an unmet need for a contraceptive patch that delivers both a low dose of EE similar to oral contraceptives and a first or second generation progestin.

  Our Product Candidates 
         Twirla is our lead product candidate, and substantially all of our resources are currently dedicated to seeking regulatory approval for Twirla. We have halted all further work on our pipeline except for Twirla. We will require additional capital, should we choose to advance the development of our other potential product candidates. 
         Twirla and each of our other potential product candidates utilize our proprietary Skinfusion technology, which is designed to provide advantages over the currently available patch. Skinfusion is designed to deliver contraceptive levels of hormones to the blood stream through the skin over a seven-day period. It is also designed to optimize patch adhesion and patient wearability. Twirla is a prescription CHC patch which contains both EE and LNG and is designed to deliver a low dose of EE and LNG comparable to the total dose delivered with low-dose oral contraceptives. In addition to Twirla, we have plans to develop a potential pipeline of other new transdermal contraceptive products, including AG200-SP, which is a regimen designed to provide shorter, lighter periods; AG200-ER, which is a regimen designed to allow a woman to extend the length of her cycle; AG200-ER (SmP), which is a regimen designed to allow a woman to extend the length of her cycle and experience shorter, lighter periods; and AG890, which is a progestin-only contraceptive patch intended for use by women who are unable or unwilling to take estrogen. AG200-SP, AG200-ER, and AG200-ER (SmP) are intended to be Twirla line extensions that would expand the use of Twirla beyond its initial, approved use. Based upon a number of factors, including, but not limited to, our available capital resources and feedback from the FDA, we continue to review the clinical path and budgetary requirements for each of AG200-SP, AG200-ER and AG890. 
         The current status of our potential product candidate pipeline is summarized in the graphic below:

     Twirla Product Overview 
         Twirla is a CHC patch which contains both EE and LNG. Twirla is designed to address an unmet medical need for increased compliance and improved ease of use as compared to oral contraceptives. A single Twirla patch delivers the active ingredients LNG and EE over a seven-day dosing interval, and thereby eliminates the need to take a daily pill as is necessary with an oral contraceptive. Twirla uses a traditional 28-day contraceptive regimen, where one patch is applied weekly for three consecutive weeks and then there is a fourth, patch-free week in each 28-day time period. In clinical trials Twirla was applied to the buttock, abdomen or upper torso, but not the breast. Women in our trials most frequently chose the buttock and abdomen for patch placement. The patch location should be rotated with each patch change. Twirla has demonstrated a therapeutically equivalent pharmacokinetic profile when worn on the buttock, abdomen or upper torso. A drug's pharmacokinetic profile refers to the specific way in which a given drug is handled by the body over time, reflecting the particular patterns of absorption, distribution and elimination of the drug in the body. 
 
        Twirla is designed to be highly appealing to patients as a method of contraception. The patch is round and made of a soft, flexible fabric, designed to flex with the movement of a woman's body. Twirla is a matrix patch consisting of several layers of material that contain the active ingredients EE and LNG, as well as the inactive ingredients Dimethylsulfoxide, Ethyl Lactate, Capric Acid and Lauryl Lactate, which are ingredients to assist in the transport of EE and LNG across the skin, and adhesives that enable adherence to the skin. The final top layer is the one seen when placed on the skin, and consists of a thin, cloth-like material consisting only of adhesive. There is a barrier formed between the inner portion of the patch, which contains the active ingredients, and the outer portion of the patch, which only contains the adhesive. This barrier is intended to prevent the active and inactive ingredients from migrating to the peripheral portion of the patch, and from breaking down the adhesive in that portion of the patch. Twirla is also designed to help prevent seepage of the adhesives from around the edge of the patch where it could collect dirt and leave a sticky black ring on the skin. The six layers of the patch are integrated to create a patch which has a slim profile and is unobtrusive when applied. The results of multiple clinical trials suggest that Twirla delivers the active ingredients needed for 
 13

   contraception over a seven-day period and that it remains adhered to the skin of most subjects for the full seven-day period, even under conditions of heat, humidity, showering, exposure to water and vigorous exercise.

Most common treatment emergent adverse events related to Twirla in three Phase 3 clinical trials. 


        Twirla employs our Skinfusion patch technology, resulting in a unique appearance and feel of the patch. Evra/Xulane does not utilize Skinfusion technology; its active ingredients and adhesives are dispersed to the edges of the patch. One frequent complaint about patches that do not utilize Skinfusion is that they collect dirt and lint and may leave a sticky black ring of residue on the skin which can be difficult to remove. We do not have any direct comparison of the appearance of the patch on the skin at the end of seven days between Twirla and Evra/Xulane, but we believe, based on anecdotal feedback from our clinical trial investigators, as well as on the differences in the design of the patches, that Twirla may have an advantage in this regard. 
         We have not performed a head-to-head pharmacokinetic comparison of Twirla to Evra/Xulane, however, a study that we conducted with Twirla was similar in design to the pharmacokinetic study conducted with Evra that provided the information regarding the daily amount of EE delivered that is currently in the Evra/Xulane package insert. The figure below combines the results for average EE concentrations from these two studies and suggests a comparison of the observed blood concentration of EE for Twirla versus Evra versus observed and estimated data for the pill. The lower amount of EE delivered from Twirla as compared to Evra can be observed. If Twirla is approved by the FDA, we will not be able to make direct comparative claims regarding the safety, efficacy or pharmacokinetics of Twirla and Evra/Xulane, since none of our completed clinical trials studied Twirla in a head-to-head comparison with Evra/Xulane.

        EE Concentrations (pg/ml) 

        The Evra curve presented in the graphic above was estimated based on the graph provided in the Evra label. In the legend to the figure above, "OC" refers to an oral contraceptive containing 35 micrograms of EE. The OC data prior to Day 21 are estimated steady-state data based on Day 21 EE concentrations observed during our pharmacokinetic study. 
         Twirla contains LNG, which is the progestin used as the reference standard when comparing risk of VTE between progestins. Evra/Xulane contains the progestin norelgestromin, which is a prodrug of norgestimate, a third-generation progestin that has not demonstrated an increased risk of VTE independent of EE. We do not expect any meaningful clinical differences between Twirla and Evra/Xulane based on the progestin component, but our market research with ObGyns has demonstrated that they perceive LNG to be one of the safest progestins available. 
   Twirla Product Profile 
         Assuming approval of our marketing application by the FDA based on the results of the SECURE trial, we believe a number of factors, including clinical trial data from SECURE, support our future marketing of Twirla:


 Twirla is a once-weekly contraceptive patch, designed to offer convenience and compliance. 
 Twirla is designed to meet the contraceptive needs and the busy lifestyles of today's women. 
 Twirla contains the active ingredients EE and LNG, both of which have been used in contraceptives for over 25 years. 
 Twirla delivers the low daily dose of EE of approximately 30 micrograms, comparable to low-dose oral contraceptives. 
 Twirla is designed to demonstrate efficacy comparable to other approved prescription contraceptives. 
 Twirla has a favorable safety and tolerability profile. 

 16

   

 Twirla was designed with Skinfusion technology, which has demonstrated adhesion over the seven-day wear period, even under conditions of heat,
humidity, showering, exposure to water and vigorous exercise. 
 Because Twirla contains the progestin LNG, we believe that the final approved label for Twirla will be consistent with the class labeling for
other contraceptives containing EE and LNG, including the class boxed warning. 
 Based on the results of the SECURE clinical trial, we believe it is possible the final approved label for Twirla may contain language on the
use of Twirla in women based on weight. 

 Twirla Clinical Development Program and Regulatory History 
         Our clinical program includes three Phase 1 studies, one Phase 2 study, and three Phase 3 studies, as well as other supporting studies. In December 2016, we completed our third Phase 3 clinical trial, SECURE, in response to FDA comments and guidance. 
   Clinical Trials Completed prior to SECURE 
         In Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials, we demonstrated that Twirla delivers levels of both EE and LNG to the blood stream that are consistent with currently marketed low-dose oral contraceptives. In our Phase 3 clinical trials completed prior to SECURE, we demonstrated that Twirla was comparable to an approved low-dose oral contraceptive in two randomized studies, one that enrolled over 1,500 women over 12 months and the other that enrolled over 400 women over six months. However, these studies were not designed as non-inferiority studies and, as such, the comparative conclusions that may be drawn from these studies are limited. Across all completed clinical trials, Twirla was generally well-tolerated and had a favorable safety profile. Because we relied, in part, on the FDA's findings of safety and efficacy from investigations for approved products containing EE and LNG and published scientific literature for which we have not obtained a right of reference, we were not required to conduct preclinical studies. In the pharmacokinetic study comparing Twirla to an approved low-dose oral contraceptive, results demonstrated that Twirla delivers a daily dose of EE that results in estrogen exposure similar to low-dose oral contraceptives containing approximately 30 micrograms. 
         Our two Phase 3 trials completed prior to SECURE enrolled over 1,900 subjects to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Twirla. Each of these studies included an active comparator arm with an approved low-dose oral contraceptive. The results of these studies demonstrated that Twirla was generally well-tolerated, with levels of adverse events generally comparable to those of low-dose oral contraceptives. In these studies, subjects had a higher rate of self-reported compliance when using the patch as compared with the group using oral contraceptives. However, as discussed further below, the FDA issued a CRL in response to our original marketing application for Twirla and requested an additional Phase 3 study and additional chemistry manufacturing and control, or CMC, information. The results of our prior clinical trials demonstrated that the patch generally remained adhered to the skin even when exposed to normal daily activities and conditions such as showering, swimming and other forms of exercise, heat and humidity. 
         More specifically, our safety population included subjects who received at least one dose of Twirla or COC. In this combined safety population of our two Phase 3 trials completed prior to SECURE, there were a total of 22 serious adverse events, or SAEs, of which 16 were from the Twirla cohort, which had approximately 2.3 times as many subjects as the oral contraceptive comparator cohort. Three of these SAEs (0.2% of the overall Twirla safety population) were considered to be possibly related to the study drug and included one drug overdose with Benadryl®, one case of uncontrollable nausea and vomiting and one instance of upper extremity deep vein thrombosis. In addition to the SAEs described above, some subjects taking Twirla experienced non-serious adverse events, such as nausea, headache, application site irritation and breast tenderness. Subjects receiving the oral contraceptive comparator 
 17

   also generally experienced similar non-serious adverse events such as nausea, headache, and breast tenderness, though at different rates. We believe that Twirla will have a label consistent with all marketed low-dose CHC products, which include class labeling that warns of risks of certain serious conditions, including venous and arterial blood clots, such as heart attacks, thromboembolism and stroke, as well as liver tumors, gallbladder disease and hypertension, and a boxed warning regarding risks of smoking and CHC use, particularly in women over 35 years old who smoke. 
         The primary measure of efficacy for contraceptive trials is the Pearl Index. The pooled PI value in the previously completed Phase 3 trials for the Twirla patch was 5.76 and for the combined oral contraceptive control arms was 6.72, which were higher than the range of 1.34 to 3.19 in pivotal studies conducted on products approved by the FDA in the previous ten years. In addition, the upper bound of the associated 95% confidence intervals were higher than those seen in clinical trials used for registration of other approved combination hormonal contraceptives. 
         We believe that the results for both the patch and oral contraceptive control arms in the two Phase 3 trials completed prior to SECURE were affected primarily by issues with study conduct at several study sites, including rapid enrollment, which led to the inability to manage the study population, poor subject compliance, and high rates of loss to follow-up. In the larger of our Phase 3 trials completed prior to SECURE, 96 sites enrolled subjects, 60 of which had no on-treatment pregnancies. Nineteen percent of the on-treatment pregnancies reported during this trial came from one site. This site represented approximately 8% of the randomized subject population. Thirty-six percent of on-treatment pregnancies were reported at four of the 96 sites. These four sites represented approximately 15% of the randomized subject population. 
         Experts agree that the characteristic most likely to impact contraceptive failure and pregnancy rates is the subject's likelihood of using a method inconsistently or incorrectly. Consistent with expert opinions, our analyses have suggested that the results for both the patch and oral contraceptive control arms in the two Phase 3 trials completed prior to SECURE were also affected in part by the study population, which comprised a disproportionately higher number of new users and minority subjects, known to be at higher risk of noncompliance and pregnancy, as compared to the majority of other recent CHC clinical trials for products that have gained approval in the United States. 
   2013 CRL and FDA Interactions 
         In February 2013, we received a CRL, or the 2013 CRL, from the FDA indicating that the results from our two completed Phase 3 trials would not be sufficient for approval, and the FDA proposed that we conduct an additional Phase 3 trial. Among the comments expressed in the letter were some regarding the PI values seen in the studies. Specifically, the FDA indicated that the PI values and the upper bound of the associated confidence intervals in the studies, in both the subjects using the Twirla patch and the control arm using oral contraceptives, were higher than seen in clinical trials used for registration of other approved hormonal contraceptives. The confidence interval is a range around a measurement that conveys how precise a measurement is. The FDA recommended that we conduct an additional Phase 3 trial with a simplified clinical trial design and improved study conduct, including enhanced site monitoring and data collection procedures. The FDA also requested that we study Twirla in a representative sample of U.S. women who are seeking hormonal contraception, without enrollment restrictions based on demographic characteristics such as contraceptive user status, age, race, ethnicity, and body mass index, or BMI. The FDA also required additional information relating to the laser etching of label information on each patch and required that the patch used in the new trial utilize the same etching as will be used for the commercial product, in order to demonstrate that it does not adversely affect the performance of the patch. Furthermore, the FDA also requested in the CRL additional information on controls and release specifications related to the patch, and manufacturing and control information related to the Drug Master File of one of the raw materials in Twirla. 
 18

           In October 2013, we met with the FDA and received further guidance on requirements for our planned Phase 3 trial. In addition, we had a follow-up written interaction with the FDA in February 2014 and received substantial written comments from the FDA in subsequent interactions. We enrolled the first subject in the SECURE clinical trial in the third quarter of 2014 and completed the clinical trial in December 2016. The patches studied in the SECURE trial were laser etched using the same process as we anticipate for commercialization of Twirla, if approved. We also continued to interact with the FDA on its CMC questions and continued additional supportive testing in order to respond to the FDA's CMC questions in the 2013 CRL. 
   The SECURE trial, our third Phase 3 Clinical Trial 
         SECURE, our third Phase 3 clinical trial, was a multicenter, single-arm, open-label, 13-cycle trial that evaluated the safety, efficacy and tolerability of Twirla in 2032 healthy women, aged 18 and over, at 102 experienced investigative sites across the United States. The design and execution of SECURE was intended to address a number of issues identified in the 2013 CRL, including but not limited to, improved clinical trial conduct and demonstration of efficacy as measured by an acceptable Pearl Index and related 95% confidence interval in a representative sample of U.S. women who are seeking hormonal contraception, without enrollment restrictions based on demographic characteristics, such as contraceptive user status, age, race, ethnicity, and BMI. The trial was designed in consultation with the FDA, and comprised a number of stringent trial design elements, including exclusion of treatment cycles not only for use of back-up contraception but also for lack of sexual activity. SECURE had broad entry criteria, placed no limitations on body mass index, or BMI, or other demographic factors during enrollment, and enrolled a large and diverse population from the United States in order to allow for efficacy to be assessed across different groups, as requested by the FDA. These entry criteria resulted in the inclusion of a substantial number of women with high BMI, who have frequently been under-represented in past contraceptive studies. The efficacy measure for SECURE was the Pearl Index in an intent-to-treat population of subjects 35 years of age and under. The FDA also requested inclusion of pre-specified efficacy analyses related to BMI and body weight. 
         We began enrollment for the SECURE clinical trial in the fourth quarter of 2014, completed the clinical trial in December 2016, and announced top-line results in January 2017. A summary of the final SECURE clinical trial results are as follows:
 

 Consistent with its broad entry criteria, the SECURE clinical trial population was representative of the population of women in the United
States with respect to key demographic criteria, including: 


 Race (66.9% of subjects were white, 24.3% black and 8.8% other); 
 Ethnicity (19.7% were Hispanic, 80.3% non-Hispanic); and 
 BMI (39.4% of subjects had a normal baseline weight (BMI of under 25 kg/m2), 25.3% of subjects were overweight (BMI
of at least 25 kg/m2 but less than 30 kg/m2), and 35.3% were obese (BMI 30 kg/m2 or more). When classified as obese (BMI 30 kg/m2 or more) or
non-obese (BMI less than 30 kg/m2), 35.3% of subjects were obese and 64.7% were non-obese). 

 Both new and experienced hormonal contraceptive users were enrolled (9.4% of subjects were new users). 
 51.4% of subjects discontinued prematurely from the study, which is a lower discontinuation rate than our previous Phase 3 clinical
trials and in line with other Phase 3 clinical trials for approved hormonal contraceptives. The main reasons for subject discontinuation from the trial were subject decision (15.3%), adverse
event (10.9%), and loss to follow-up. The most common (>1%) adverse reactions leading to discontinuation were bleeding irregularities (2.2%) and any 

 19

   

application
site reaction (1.1%); all others were less than 1%. The loss to follow-up rate was 11.3%, which is in line with loss to follow-up rates observed in previous clinical trials of combined
hormonal products and substantially better than the 20% loss to follow-up rate observed in the larger of our previous Phase 3 trials. 


 The Pearl Index for the overall intent to treat population of subjects 35 years of age and under was 4.80 with an upper-bound of the 95%
confidence interval of 6.06. As with all hormonal contraceptive trials, the number of pregnancies included in our calculation of the Pearl Index is subject to review by the FDA as part of its overall
review of the NDA for Twirla. 
 Twirla was generally well-tolerated and had an overall favorable safety profile, consistent with publicly available information relating to
other low-dose combined hormonal products. The most frequent hormone-related adverse events, none of which were experienced by more than 5% of subjects, were generally in line with those events
observed in other low dose combined hormonal products and included: 


Adverse Event | SECURE Trial | | Prior Agile Phase 3 Trial* | Ortho Evra Trials** | | Quartette Trial** | 
Total in Safety Population | | 2,032 | | 1,043 | | | 3,322 | | 3,597 |

***
2.2% of subjects in the SECURE trial discontinued due to a bleeding-related adverse event 




 The percent of subjects reporting bleeding-related adverse events was low, 2.6%, and only 2.2% of women discontinued for bleeding issues. 
 Overall serious adverse events, or SAEs, were observed in 2.0% of the SECURE trial study population, which is generally in line with those
observed in clinical trials for other low-dose combined hormonal products. For example, the rate in the Phase 3 clinical trial for Quartette was 1.6%. 0.6% of subjects in the SECURE trial had
SAEs that were considered potentially study drug related, including DVT or PE, gallbladder disease, ectopic pregnancy, and depression. In the combined safety database for our three Twirla
Phase 3 trials (n >3,000), there were 5 subjects with potentially study drug related DVTs or PEs, 4 of whom were obese
(BMI ³ 30kg/m2). 
 Overall, patch-related irritation and itching rates were low. Of reported patches worn, 83% had no patch site irritation and 65% had no
itching. Generally, reported irritation and itching was mild. Severe itching or irritation were observed in 2.3% and 1.5% of patches worn, respectively. 
 The patch adhesion profile was favorable with a low rate of detachment. Of reported patches worn, the range of detachments was 10% in cycle 1
and reduced to 2% by cycle 13. 

 20

           We believe that the efficacy results observed in SECURE were a reflection of the study population and the clinical trial design. As recommended by the FDA, we had broad entry criteria for the trial and placed no limitations on BMI or other demographic factors during our enrollment. These entry criteria resulted in the inclusion of a substantial number of women with overweight and obese BMI, who have frequently been under-represented in past contraceptive studies. As noted above, we observed that BMI had an effect on the efficacy results for Twirla. We believe these observations require further analysis of whether there are other important factors at work here, such as race/ethnicity, user profile and compliance rates, which we believe may have impacted the results of our prior Phase 3 studies. 
         In 2015, a meta-analysis entitled "Effect of Obesity on the Effectiveness of Hormonal Contraceptives: an Individual Participant Data Meta-Analysis," was published by several FDA authors and focused on the issue of obesity and effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives, or HC, by showing a relationship between obesity and efficacy was observed among subjects 35 years of age and under. We believe that the below results observed in SECURE are consistent with this observation: 

   
BMI Category | | BMI (kg/m2) | | % of Trial Population | | Pearl Index | | Upper Bound of 95% CI | 
Normal | | < 25 | | | 39 | % | | 3.03 | | | 4.62 | 
Overweight | | 25 - < 30 | | | 25 | % | | 5.36 | | | 7.98 | 
Obese* | | ³ 30 | | | 35 | % | | 6.42 | | | 8.88 | 
​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​
Non-Obese* | | £ 30 | | | 65 | % | | 3.94 | | | 5.35 | 
Obese* | | ³ 30 | | | 35 | % | | 6.42 | | | 8.88 | 


  *
In its 2015 meta-analysis, the FDA examined the effect of obesity on two populations: non-obese (< 30 kg/m2) and obese (³ 30 kg/m2). Non-obese includes subjects in the normal and overweight categories. 


        Furthermore, the FDA's Individual Participant Data meta-analysis of pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials of CHCs suggested a 44% higher pregnancy rate during use of combined oral contraceptives for obese women after adjusting for age and race. The authors of the paper highlighted the limitations of currently available prospective data due to historical exclusion of obese women from contraceptive studies, calling for more data and additional analyses on obese women from Phase 3 clinical trials to allow further assessment of the effect of weight on the probability of unintended pregnancy in women using HC. We believe our results from the SECURE clinical trial are consistent with the conclusions from the paper by the FDA scientists. 
         Additionally, the observed PI values were not only impacted by the number of pregnancies that occurred in the study, but also by the number of cycles included in the analysis, which affects the denominator of the PI calculation. Cycles in which a subject was not sexually active, or in which a subject used a back-up method of contraception were not counted toward the number of cycles included in the calculation of the PI. Many contraceptive clinical trials have not historically included these stringent requirements, in particular the exclusion of cycles for lack of sexual activity, in the clinical trial design. As a result, we believe that the SECURE results reflect evidence of efficacy in a population representative of women who seek to use contraception in the United States. 
         The highest PI for a hormonal contraceptive product approved by the FDA is 3.19 and the highest upper-bound of the 95% confidence interval of 5.03. As with all products, ultimate approvability of a hormonal contraceptive is based on a risk/benefit assessment of the overall safety and efficacy profile of a product, not only a specific PI. For hormonal contraceptive trials, the FDA generally evaluates safety and efficacy results of each individual study in the unique context of the study population and trial design. PIs for approved hormonal contraceptives have steadily risen over time as study design and populations have changed. Numerous factors have likely contributed to these increases, including more frequent pregnancy testing with more sensitive tests, and decreases in study-drug adherence among 
 21

   study populations. As experts have noted, with the growing enrollment of more diverse populations that appear to be increasingly representative of the likely actual users once the product is marketed, contraceptive trials are yielding efficacy results that are ever closer to actual use contraceptive failure rates for methods requiring adherence. 
         In SECURE, we employed several measures to improve study conduct and, in particular, improve upon the loss to follow up rate. These measures included selecting a highly experienced contract resource organization, or CRO, selecting experienced sites, increasing and improving monitoring and training, and the use of electronic diaries for subjects. We engaged Parexel International Corporation, or Parexel, a CRO with substantial experience in contraception studies and excellent site monitoring capabilities, as the CRO for the SECURE trial. We actively participated in site selection and in monitoring subject recruitment, and actively participated in site monitoring and oversight of Parexel's activities throughout the length of the trial. 
         An independent Pregnancy Review Committee composed of experts in early ultrasound was selected to review all pregnancies and determine on or off-treatment status, which affects the numerator of the PI calculation. Accurate and timely pregnancy adjudication is critically important in order to reduce the likelihood that pregnancies which occur off treatment will be included by the FDA during the review process. In order to avoid pre- or post-treatment pregnancies being included, every pregnancy was assessed via ultrasound as soon as possible and full data was collected regarding the relationship of the pregnancy to the subject's use of Twirla. We did not have an independent Pregnancy Review Committee for our previous clinical trials. 
         In December 2016, we completed the SECURE clinical trial, in which we enrolled over 2,000 women for up to one year of treatment. We announced top-line data in early January 2017. In March 2017, at our request, we met with the FDA to share preliminary data from the SECURE clinical trial, including key safety data and BMI-related efficacy findings, and to seek FDA input as to whether the SECURE clinical trial results constituted a basis for addressing the clinical deficiencies cited in the 2013 CRL. We also requested feedback on whether the proposed Twirla NDA content would meet the FDA's requirements for submission. While the FDA did provide us with feedback on our proposed submission, the Agency did not provide any feedback on whether the results of the SECURE clinical trial and the contents of the planned, resubmitted NDA would be sufficient to obtain regulatory approval of Twirla. In June 2017, we resubmitted our NDA for Twirla, which was assigned a target Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, goal date of December 26, 2017. 
   2017 CRL 
         On December 21, 2017, after completion of its review of our Twirla NDA, the FDA issued the 2017 CRL and informed us that our resubmitted NDA could not be approved in its present form. The FDA's reasons for issuing the 2017 CRL related to cited deficiencies in the manufacturing process for Twirla and questions about our clinical  in vivo adhesion properties. More specifically, the 2017 CRL identifies deficiencies relating to:


 quality control adhesion test methods for the Twirla manufacturing process; 
 observations identified during an inspection of a facility of our third-party manufacturer, Corium, for the Twirla NDA that must be resolved;
and 
 questions on the in vivo adhesion properties of Twirla and their potential relationship to the
SECURE clinical trial results.

           The 2017 CRL also contains recommendations on addressing the cited deficiencies including recommendations that the Company:
 

 develop manufacturing in-process tests for ensuring the quality and in vivo adhesion of the
commercial scale product as well as the finished drug specifications and release test method for adhesion; 
 assess the in vivo adhesion properties demonstrated in the SECURE clinical trial; and 
 address the implications of clinical trial subject patch compliance and the withdrawal and dropout rates. 

         In addition, the FDA also identified additional pregnancies, many of which were in women who had delays in applying patches, which they argued should be added to the Pearl Index calculation. FDA expressed concern in the CRL regarding the implication of delays in patch application for real-world use. The 2017 CRL does not identify any specific issues relating to the safety of Twirla. 
         At our request, DBRUP had a Type A meeting with us on April 16, 2018 to discuss the deficiencies in the Twirla NDA identified in the 2017 CRL and the regulatory path for approval of Twirla. In its official minutes, the FDA informed us that to address concerns surrounding in vivo adhesion we needed to reformulate the transdermal system, conduct a formal in vivo adhesion study with the new formulation, and demonstrate bioequivalence to the data and information in the original formulation. The FDA also said it anticipates discussing the safety and efficacy of Twirla at an Advisory Committee meeting to obtain input on whether the benefits of Twirla outweigh the risks. The FDA also provided guidance on the path forward for addressing the manufacturing quality control test method issues related to Twirla, and informed us that whether these issues have been adequately addressed would be subject to review by the FDA when we resubmit our Twirla NDA 
   Formal Dispute Resolution and Planned Resubmission 
         We disagreed with the FDA's conclusions regarding the in vivo adhesion properties of Twirla and the need for product reformulation, and we submitted a formal dispute resolution request, or FDRR, to the FDA. In October 2018, the FDA's Office of New Drugs, or OND, formally denied our appeal, but provided a path forward for resubmission of the NDA for Twirla that may not require that we reformulate Twirla or conduct a bioequivalence study between formulations, as previously suggested by DBRUP. Specifically, OND suggested that we conduct a wear study to evaluate whether Twirla demonstrates a generally similar adhesion performance to Xulane, the generic version of the previously marketed Ortho Evra® contraceptive patch, a product the FDA considers to have acceptable adhesion. If this result were demonstrated, OND stated that the study would support the conclusion of adequate Twirla adhesion. 
         As recommended by OND, we met with DBRUP to discuss the specific design and success criteria of the comparative wear study . DBRUP agreed that Twirla would be considered statistically non-inferior to Xulane if the upper 95% confidence limit of the mean difference was less than +0.15. As agreed with DBRUP, we conducted a randomized, open-label, crossover adhesion study in healthy women aged 18 to 35 years with a Body Mass Index of less than 35 kg/m2. Subjects were randomized to wear either Twirla or Xulane for the first week and then switched to the patch not initially worn for the second week. The study design followed the 2018 ANDA Guidance for Assessment of Adhesion entitled Assessing Adhesion With Transdermal and Topical Delivery Systems for ANDAs. 
 23

           On February 11, 2019, we announced the top-line results of the comparative wear study. The study met the non-inferiority criterion set forth by the FDA by demonstrating an upper 95% confidence limit of 0.16. Additional analyses pertaining to secondary endpoints and safety data are ongoing: 
      Primary endpoint: mean adhesion scores for Twirla and Xulane 
   
 | | | | | | | | Difference (TwirlaXulane)
 | Twirla | | Xulane 
 | | | One-sided upper 95% CL | Non-inferiority criterion met
 | N | | Mean (SD) | N | | Mean (SD) | | Mean (SD) 
Adhesion score in the Per protocol population | | 77 | | 0.14 (0.28 | ) | | 77 | | 0.39 (0.40 | ) | 0.25 (0.23 | ) | 0.16 | Yes

     Non-inferiority Scale 

        We plan on resubmitting our Twirla NDA in the second quarter of 2019. Our planned resubmission is intended to be a complete response to the 2017 CRL and will include the results from the comparative wear study, additional information on our manufacturing process, and other analyses responding to the 2017 CRL. Following the resubmission, we anticipate that FDA will likely re-inspect our contract manufacturer, Corium, and hold an Advisory Committee meeting to review of the safety and efficacy of Twirla. 
 Twirla Line Extensions and Other Potential Product Candidates 
         In addition to Twirla, our potential product pipeline consists of two classes of product candidates: Twirla line extensions and other transdermal contraceptive product candidates. These potential product candidates are designed to address market needs and offer additional non-daily contraceptive options. Based on the results of our market research on line extension regimen concepts conducted in December 2016, we believe that our potential line extension product candidates are commercially viable and could garner a share of the contraceptive market. 
         The hormonal contraceptive market has a long history of manufacturers successfully using line extensions to extend the lifecycle of a brand, often by gaining additional exclusivity periods for the product extension under the provisions of the Hatch-Waxman Act and/or with additional patents. Our lifecycle strategy with Twirla is to introduce line extensions that will have exclusivity for some time period, either due to our intellectual property estate, or due to Hatch-Waxman exclusivity. The line extensions in our pipeline include using our Skinfusion technology to allow a 28-day regimen where women will experience shorter, lighter withdrawal bleeding, as well as extending the cycle beyond the typical 28-day regimen to allow women to experience fewer withdrawal bleeds each year. In addition, the potential line extension product candidates in our pipeline will utilize a unique aspect in the regimen, where a smaller patch, or SmP, that delivers a lower dose of both EE and LNG will be worn during the final seven days of each cycle, rather than having a patch-free week, to allow for withdrawal bleed while minimizing hormonal fluctuations and potentially the side effects that accompany changes in hormone levels. These regimens are protected by patents issued to us in 2015. A study to examine 
 24

   the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the SmP will be required prior to advancing the potential line extension product candidates through clinical development. 
         Our Twirla line extensions include the following:
 

 AG200-ER is an extended cycle regimen utilizing our current patch product designed to allow a woman to extend the time between her episodes of
withdrawal bleeding and thus have fewer periods per year. There are several currently approved oral contraceptives that provide an 84- or 91-day extended cycle regimen. However, there is no approved
contraceptive patch product offering an extended cycle regimen. AG200-ER is a contraceptive patch which is designed to address the limitations of the currently approved extended regimen oral
contraceptives by providing a more convenient, weekly dosing schedule. AG200-ER utilizes the same drug product as Twirla during the active phase of the cycle. We are currently evaluating the optimal
cycle length to advance into Phase 3 clinical development. 
 AG200-SP is a 28-day regimen designed to provide users with shorter, lighter withdrawal bleeds and potentially improve contraceptive efficacy.
AG200-SP may also provide benefit in patients with sensitivity to abrupt changes in hormone levels. Oral contraceptives that use a shortened hormone-free interval, or SHFI, by delivering hormones
beyond 21 days comprise a significant share of U.S. branded TRx volume, demonstrating high acceptability among patients and providers. AG200-SP is designed to provide a simplified 28-day
regimen through use of the same drug product as Twirla for the first three weeks of the cycle, and a smaller lower-dose patch, or SmP, in the fourth week, which will allow patients to continuously
apply patches without interruption. AG200-SP requires additional patch development work on the SmP prior to potentially conducting a pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetic study. 
 AG200-ER (SmP) is an extended cycle regimen utilizing our current patch product and the SmP that is designed to allow a woman to extend the
time between her episodes of withdrawal bleeding and experience shorter, lighter periods. By adjusting the length of the contraceptive cycle, AG200-ER (SmP) is designed to potentially minimize
breakthrough bleeding and spotting, which is a commonly reported concern with patients using an extended regimen contraceptive product. AG200-ER (SmP) utilizes the same drug product as Twirla during
the active phase of the cycle and will utilize the SmP during the final week of the cycle. AG200-ER (SmP) requires additional patch development work on the SmP prior to potentially conducting a
pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetic study. 

         Our other potential product candidate is a P-only contraceptive patch described below:
 

 AG890 is an LNG-only contraceptive patch, intended for use by women who are unable or unwilling to take estrogen, including those who are
breastfeeding or who are at greater risk of VTE, such as women who smoke, are over 35 years of age, or who are obese. Currently, the P-only market consists of pills and several non-oral
options, including IUDs, implants, and injections. AG890 is intended to fulfill an unmet medical need for a non-daily, easily reversible form of contraception in the P-only market. We have conducted a
Phase 1 clinical trial with AG890. In addition, the National Institutes of Health, through a clinical trial agreement with us, conducted a Phase 1/2 trial with AG890. The Phase
1/2 study was a multicenter study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety, and mechanisms of potential contraceptive efficacy of AG890. The trial is complete, and we continue to
evaluate the findings. Once we have completed our analysis of the data, it is possible that additional patch development work for dose selection may be required, including additional Phase 1
and Phase 2 studies to determine the optimal formulation and dose to advance to Phase 3. 

 25

          
        We do not expect to be required to conduct preclinical studies for any of these potential product candidates. Based upon a number of factors, including, but not limited to, our available capital resources and feedback from the FDA, we continue to review the clinical path and the budgetary requirements for each of these three potential product candidates. Substantially all of our resources are currently dedicated to developing and seeking regulatory approval for Twirla. We have halted all further work on our pipeline except for Twirla. We will require additional capital should we choose to advance the development of our other potential product candidates. 
   Sales and Marketing 
   Twirla Commercialization Strategy 
         In January 2018, following our receipt of the 2017 CRL, we significantly scaled back our preparations for commercialization of Twirla, including commercial pre-launch and manufacturing validation activities, pending our ability to address the 2017 CRL and receive approval of Twirla. However, if Twirla is approved, we expect to build a sales and marketing infrastructure in the United States to support the launch of Twirla for contraception. We anticipate that a targeted sales force focused initially on ObGyns, NPs, PAs and primary care providers who comprise the top prescribers of contraceptives will be highly effective. Outside the United States, in the future we may decide to commercialize Twirla, if approved, by entering into third-party collaboration agreements with pharmaceutical partners. We will require additional capital to fully implement our commercialization plan for Twirla, if approved. 
 Twirla Promotion Strategy 
         We have employed several key strategies during the development of Twirla to prepare us for the launch of Twirla. These include:
 

 Seeking advice and input from key opinion leaders, or KOLs, in women's health and contraception; 
 Establishing relationships with women's health advocacy groups; 
 Conducting extensive market research to better understand the market dynamics and identify product positioning and messages for Twirla with
prescribers and consumers; 
 Assuring that data from our clinical trials are presented in a timely manner at clinical congresses and published in appropriate peer-reviewed
medical journals; and 
 Developing and registering the trademark Twirla and developing key branding elements, including packaging design for submission with the NDA. 

         ObGyns, NPs and PAs combine to write most CHC prescriptions, with ObGyns primarily driving prescriptions in the category. We plan to focus the promotion of Twirla on these key prescribers and other key customer groups, including consumers and commercial managed care plans. We believe that we can deploy a focused sales force effort targeting the approximately 22,000 prescribers responsible for 80% of branded CHC prescriptions. We believe that this universe of branded prescribers can be covered adequately by a specialty sales force of between 70 and 100 total representatives. In areas of the country where it is not efficient to deploy a sales representative, remote promotion can be used to reach these prescribers. 
         We plan to deploy patient promotion at the launch of Twirla, both in the physician's office, and through targeted media campaigns. We plan to use both branded and unbranded campaigns to create awareness of Twirla among consumers. We believe there are cost-effective means to reach our target demographic of females aged 18 to 34 years, primarily the so-called Millennials, who engage in online activities to a high degree and are more likely to seek health information online and through social 
 26

   networks. Traditional mass-market direct-to-consumer advertising on television may not be required to reach these consumers. Marketing tactics aimed at today's female consumer need to be optimized for mobile technology, because smartphones and text messaging are the preferred means of communication. We believe that a focused consumer promotion plan that uses digital media and other mass-market advertising vehicles will generate consumer awareness and demand for Twirla if approved. 
         Managed care plans have traditionally used differential co-pays to attempt to drive patients to use either generic products or products for which they have a contract with the manufacturer. Many plans encourage patients to obtain their branded contraceptives through mail-order, incentivizing them with a 90-day co-pay that is often less on a per-month basis than that for a 30-day supply. Most manufacturers of contraceptive brands offer a coupon to patients covered by non-governmental payors to offset the difference in co-pay between a generic and Tier 2 or Tier 3 for their promoted brands. These co-pay coupons are a useful tactic to overcome barriers to initiating therapy in such patients. When used in conjunction with product samples given out by the physician, a co-pay coupon often allows the patient to then fill their first prescription for free or at a steep discount and limits the out of pocket expenditure for the patient for several months. This co-pay assistance creates brand loyalty, particularly for a brand where there is no generic alternative. We believe that we will be able to use free product samples and co-pay coupons or vouchers at the time of Twirla's launch to drive use of the product by patients covered by non-governmental payors while we are negotiating contracts with select commercial health plans and awaiting formulary review. In addition, we believe the enactment of the ACA, and specifically the requirements for contraceptive coverage required by the ACA, provides a favorable managed care environment for Twirla. The ACA requires all insurers to provide at least one product in each of the 18 methods referenced in the FDA Birth Control Guide with no cost-sharing to the patient, including no co-pays, coinsurance, or deductibles. The FDA Birth Control Guide lists "Patch" as a unique method, therefore insurers must provide access to at least one contraceptive patch product with no cost-sharing to the patient. Currently, there is only one other patch product available on the market, Xulane (the generic version of Ortho Evra). We believe Twirla will be well-positioned to be the no-cost patch option on formulary, either based on its clinical profile, or based upon negotiated rebates and discounts. In addition, we expect to be able to provide co-pay assistance in the form of a coupon for patients on plans where Twirla requires a co-pay. 
         On January 20, 2017, the administration signed an Executive Order directing federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the ACA to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the ACA that would impose a fiscal or regulatory burden on states, individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices, among others. Congress also could consider subsequent legislation to repeal and replace elements of the ACA that are repealed. Additionally, in October 2017, the Department of Health and Human Services, jointly with the Department of Labor and the Treasury, issued two interim rules outlining exemption processes for employers not wanting to offer contraceptive coverage based on their religious beliefs or sincerely held moral convictions. While there is an injunction against the administration prohibiting it from implementing these rules, the ultimate outcome of that litigation cannot be predicted. Therefore, it is difficult to determine the full effect of the ACA or any other healthcare reform efforts on our business. We will continue to monitor the healthcare reform efforts and agency implementation. While there is uncertainty about the specific effects of healthcare reform, we expect to be able to compete in either a managed care environment that maintains elements of the ACA that require contraceptive coverage or an environment that requires negotiated rebates and discounts. 
   Market Research 
         We have conducted market research with healthcare professionals (HCPs), consumers and managed care decision-makers to determine market drivers, unmet needs and the reaction to the Twirla 
 27

   product profile. A total of over 800 healthcare professionals and over 3,300 consumers have participated in our market research on Twirla and the contraceptive market. We also had an independent third-party commercial consulting firm confirm our market research. The main findings of our market research conducted in December 2016 and confirmed in June 2017 are discussed below. 
   Topline Summary of Our ObGyn/NP Market Research: 
 

 HCPs are extremely influential in driving women's choice of hormonal contraceptive 


 HCPs admit to presenting oral contraceptives first, ostensibly because of their long history of safety and the HCPs own comfort
with the pill 

 Patient ability to comply drives hormonal contraceptive choice 


 HCPs believe patient engagement in the choice increases personal investment in her birth control and enhances adherence 
 Determinants of choice are willingness/ability to be responsible to take/apply birth control, desire to control menses, and
tolerance for insertion or injection 

 The Pearl Index, or PI, is not cited as an important factor driving contraceptive choice and it is not a well understood measure. Efficacy is a
given and all hormonal contraceptives are expected to be efficacious 
 HCPs consider BMI in their prescribing, however one third of HCPs consider efficacy in women with high BMI a least important attribute 
 Young women with busy lives, susceptible to "forgetting" daily contraceptives, are a strong target audience for the Agile patch portfolio 

         Two of our market research studies have included an allocation exercise to estimate the potential uptake of Twirla and peak market share. In both of these studies, ObGyns and NPs indicated their allocation of contraceptive prescriptions before and after reviewing a product profile like Twirla that reflects the safety and efficacy results from our SECURE clinical trial. In the 2010 study, which was conducted prior to the implementation of the ACA, ObGyns estimated use of a product like Twirla in 17% of their CHC patients. A proprietary calibration model developed by the research firm was applied to the peak share estimate, to adjust for physician overstatement, resulting in an estimated peak market share of 9% of the CHC market. In the most recent study completed in December 2016, ObGyns and NP/PAs estimated use of Twirla in 22% of their CHC patients, which was also calibrated to adjust for overstatement, resulting in an estimated peak market share of 14% of the CHC market. 
         Even with the evolving healthcare landscape, we continue to believe a peak CHC market share of 6-9% can be achieved with Twirla within seven years of launch, allowing us time to establish a presence in the CHC market and to overcome any perceptions or barriers among prescribers due to the past history of Evra and to account for potential changes in the ACA and overall healthcare landscape. 
   Topline Summary of Our Consumer Market Research: 
 

 Familiarity and availability sway hormonal contraceptive selection initially toward the pill. Few explore choices extensively through dialogue
with HCP, and/or research of their own. Thus, HCP recommendation can be very influential. However, with time and experience, many become disenchanted with the pill because it ties them to a daily
schedule. 
 Among those who least prefer the contraceptive patch option, their strong impressions, despite extremely limited exposure to the contraceptive
patch, were based on issues such as skin irritation from adhesive, blood clots, and weight gain. 

 28

   

 Several mention a desire to have a hormonal contraceptive, or HC, method that fits in with their busy lifestyle while still offering control
over the HC-taking experience (i.e., unlike implant/IUD which is inserted and forgotten). 
 Twirla offers a convenient, less-frequent form of HC that women are interested in trialing for themselves 


 Potential downsides are patch cleanliness/appearance and adhesion (particularly while showering or exercising), but women admit
they couldn't gauge this without trying the patch first. 

 Based solely on the Twirla product profile that reflects the safety and efficacy results from our SECURE clinical trial, approximately 15% of
women surveyed in the 2016 Adelphi study indicated they would be "extremely likely" to ask their doctor for a prescription for Twirla. 

 Topline Summary of Our Managed Care Market Research: 
         The managed care research summarized below was conducted with medical and pharmacy directors in September 2016. In regard to forward-looking questions, subjects were asked to assume that the ACA and Contraceptive Mandate would still be in effect. 


 Payers are not highly focused on the prescription contraceptive market, and knowledge of individual prescription products was low. 
 The category is mainly managed by tier and, to a smaller degree, by closed formularies. 
 20% of plans abandoned all management efforts in the category and allowed coverage of all generics and all unique brands at a $0 cost share. 
 All respondents indicated they would consider working with a manufacturer to make one product preferred in a contraceptive category. However,
preferred status could be in "name only", as many of the preferred products had the same $0 co-pay as non-preferred products. 
 Net cost is the most important pricing baseline, but rebates for many plans are still considered a profit center. Most plans would entertain
preferred or co-preferred status in return for a modest contract. 
 7 of the 10 respondents reacted to the Twirla product profile positively, while 3 responses were neutral. Most indicated the comparator was
Xulane, and that a comparable price with an improved safety profile would result in equivalent coverage. 

 Competition 
         The industry for contraceptive products is characterized by intense competition and strong promotion of proprietary products. While we believe that our Skinfusion technology provides us with a competitive advantage, we face potential competition from many different sources, including large pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical and generic drug companies, and medical device companies. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing products and new products that may become available in the future. 
         We face competition from a variety of non-permanent birth control products. There are non-hormonal barrier methods, such as the contraceptive sponge, diaphragm, cervical cap or shield and condoms. Then, there are hormonal methods, which is the category for our potential product candidates, such as oral contraceptives, injections, implants, hormonal IUDs and vaginal ring and transdermal contraceptive products. 
 29

           The following table is the 2016 FDA Birth Control Chart, which outlines the 18 unique forms of birth control and compares the effectiveness of each method. 
 
30

           Although there are over 200 CHC products, including brands and generics, just eight branded products, make up approximately half of total market sales. Our potential competitors include large, well-established pharmaceutical companies, and specialty pharmaceutical sales and marketing companies. The branded products with established market presence include, Nuvaring®, marketed by Merck, the only contraceptive vaginal ring available on the market, the Loestrin® franchise, marketed by Allergan (formerly known as Actavis), consisting of three oral contraceptives, Minastrin® 24, LoLoestrin® and Taytulla®, and Beyaz®, Yaz®, Yasmin® and Natazia® marketed by Bayer. Although not a branded product, Xulane, the generic to Ortho Evra and the only patch currently available on the market, generated $233 million in sales for Mylan in 2017. Additionally, several generics manufacturers currently market and continue to introduce new generic contraceptives, including Sandoz, Glenmark, Lupin, Amneal and Mylan. Based on the market experience of other non-oral CHC dosage forms, including Evra and Nuvaring, we believe there is a continuing demand for an innovative transdermal contraceptive patch that can provide convenience in a low-dose transdermal format. 
         There are other hormonal contraceptive products, recently approved or in development that may compete with Twirla and our other potential product candidates. Annovera, a vaginal ring from the Population Council, Inc., was approved on August 10, 2018. The Population Council also has a transdermal gel contraceptive in Phase 2, developed in collaboration with Antares Pharma, Inc. Other companies that have new hormonal contraceptive products in various stages of development include Bayer, with a contraceptive patch and a P-only vaginal ring, both in Phase 3 development. Allergan has a P-only ring for which they received a CRL from the FDA. In November 2018, the FDA accepted Exeltis' filing for a progestin-only oral contraceptive. Mithra Pharmaceuticals SA announced Phase 3 data for a combination oral contraceptive in January 2019. In the past few years, some of the large pharmaceutical companies such as Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer, and Teva have dissolved their women's health specialty marketing and sales teams, and Bayer has shifted their focus away from their CHC products to their IUD franchise. 
         We are aware of only one other CHC transdermal patch in development. This patch is being developed by Bayer, and contains the active ingredients EE and gestodene, a third-generation progestin. Bayer has stated that their gestodene patch is small, round, and transparent, and delivers a daily EE dose comparable to a 20 microgram EE oral contraceptive. Phase 3 studies of the Bayer gestodene patch began in 2004, and they completed a Phase 3 efficacy trial in the United States in December 2010. Bayer also completed Phase 3 efficacy trials in the European Union, or E.U., and Latin America in September 2011, submitted a marketing application to the E.U. in September 2012, and received approval to market the gestodene patch in the E.U. in February 2014. At the time of the E.U. submission, Bayer reported that they were in talks with the FDA regarding a U.S. submission, but there has been no further public information regarding a U.S. submission or approval, and the most recent Bayer pipeline information does not list the gestodene patch. 
         To date, there are no contraceptives containing gestodene available in the United States. We are aware that Wyeth was developing oral contraceptives containing gestodene in the late 1980s, with an NDA filed for an oral contraceptive containing gestodene and EE in 1988, and Wyeth planned filing an NDA for a second oral contraceptive containing gestodene in 1991. These products were never approved, and in a Wyeth pipeline report from 1996, there was no mention of any gestodene-containing product candidates among its contraceptives in development. Although not available in the United States, gestodene has been widely used outside the United States for a number of years. As with other third generation progestins, epidemiologic studies have reported a two-fold increase in risk of VTE with contraceptives containing gestodene compared to those containing LNG. We believe that if Bayer were to obtain FDA approval for the gestodene patch, the approved labeling may contain the same language that products containing third generation progestins have, which states that these contraceptives have a two-fold increase in risk of VTE as compared with contraceptives containing second generation progestins. 
 31

     Manufacturing 
         We do not own any manufacturing facilities. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on a third party for the manufacture of our product candidates for clinical trials, as well as for commercial manufacture if any of our potential product candidates receive marketing approval. In 2006, we entered into an exclusive agreement with Corium to develop Twirla using our Skinfusion technology, and also for AG890, which is a P-only contraceptive patch in Phase 1/2 of clinical development. Our Corium agreement is an exclusive arrangement until Corium has commercially produced a significant, agreed-upon quantity of patches, currently projected to occur no earlier than five years following commercial launch of Twirla. Pursuant to the terms of our agreement, Corium is required to use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain sufficient manufacturing capabilities to supply the quantities of Twirla required for its initial commercial launch and commercial sales thereafter. Corium needs to complete the validation of the commercial manufacturing process for Twirla, if approved, and potentially further expand its manufacturing capabilities to be capable of supplying projected commercial quantities of Twirla, if approved. In 2018 Corium was acquired by Gurnet Holding Company, or GHC. Following completion of the transaction, Corium became a private company, wholly owned by GHC. Corium has announced that it plans to continue its operations in Grand Rapids, Michigan, where Twirla is expected to be commercially manufactured, if approved, and where clinical Twirla supply is manufactured. 
         As discussed in more detail above, the 2017 CRL identified deficiencies relating to quality control adhesion test methods which are part of the manufacturing process for Twirla. The 2017 CRL also noted that observations identified during a pre-approval inspection, or PAI, of Corium's facility for the Twirla NDA must be resolved. On November 20, 2017 and December 1, 2017, Corium provided the FDA with responses to each of the observations made during the FDA's facility inspection, which included a PAI for Twirla. Along with Corium, we are continuing to enhance our quality control test methods that were submitted in December 2017 in a way that we believe will address the issues identified by the FDA in both the 2017 CRL and the Corium facility inspection and that will allow us to continue to use our current commercial manufacturing process for Twirla. The sufficiency of Corium's responses to each of the observations made during the FDA's facility inspection in 2017, as well as our responses concerning the quality control adhesion test methods and specifications, will be evaluated by the FDA after we resubmit the NDA for Twirla. We expect the validation and expansion of the commercial-scale manufacturing process to be completed in coordination with our other planned commercialization activities. Corium is responsible for all aspects of Twirla manufacturing. 
   Strategic Agreements 
   Agreement with Corium 
         Pursuant to our manufacturing agreement, Corium's exclusive right to manufacture Twirla and AG890 extends until Corium has commercially produced a significant, agreed-upon quantity of patches, currently projected to occur no earlier than five years following commercial launch of Twirla, at which point the agreement will expire. Under the terms of our agreement, we will pay Corium a defined price per finished patch, whether used for samples or commercial sale. We will owe no royalties to Corium in connection with the production of finished patches. The contract may be terminated by either party for the other party's uncured material breach. Following the end of the exclusivity period, if we were to seek a second source of supply, we would be required to obtain FDA approval through an NDA supplement for an additional manufacturing site(s). The process of acquiring a second source of supply and obtaining FDA approval generally takes two years or more and would require us to make substantial investments in new facilities and equipment. 
         Under our agreement, Corium has performed process development and manufacturing of Twirla for each of our clinical trials. For the development work performed, we paid Corium for time and 
 32

   materials related to the achievement of certain development goals. To date, we have made approximately $1.7 million of milestone payments to Corium, all of which were paid between the years 2006 and 2009. Corium is not eligible for any milestone payments in the future. During 2012, we paid Corium an aggregate of $3.5 million towards leasehold improvements incurred by Corium to its facilities to provide for adequate manufacturing space for our product candidates. 
         In order to accommodate our anticipated commercial launch of Twirla, if approved, Corium has completed a substantial build-out of its facilities in Grand Rapids, Michigan, and it has installed over $10.0 million of equipment we purchased. This additional equipment and these facilities may require FDA pre-notification, pre-approval or inspection before being used to manufacture commercial product. 
   Reimbursement 
         Managed care plans have traditionally used differential co-pays to attempt to drive patients to use either generic products or products for which they have a contract with the manufacturer. Typically, a managed care plan's formulary is organized into between three and six tiers. Each tier is then associated with a set range of co-pay amounts, with products in the lower tiers having a lower co-pay. Many plans encourage patients to obtain their branded contraceptives through mail-order, incentivizing them with a 90-day co-pay that may be less on a per-month basis than that for a 30-day supply. Contraceptive brands are generally placed on Tier 2 only if there is a contract with the plan, although there are a few plans that place several branded products on Tier 2. 
         Prior to May 2015, managed care plans have individually interpreted the requirement for coverage of contraceptives under the ACA. Some plans have designated that all contraceptives containing the same progestin are equivalent, and therefore only cover a select few products containing each progestin, usually the least expensive generics, with no co-pay. Other plans have defined contraceptive methods into categories such as "hormonal", "emergency contraception", and "barrier methods", and they cover just one product for each method with no co-pay. In May 2015, a clarification in the form of an FAQ was issued by the applicable government agencies (HHS, DOL, and Treasury) which clarified the requirements for coverage of contraceptives under the ACA. The FAQ states that plans and issuers must cover without cost-sharing at least one form of contraception in each of the 18 methods the FDA has identified for women in its current Birth Control Guide. The patch is identified as a specific method in the FDA Birth Control Guide, and therefore insurers must cover at least one patch product with no cost-sharing to the patient. Because this clarifying guidance is applied for plan years (or in the individual market, policy years) beginning on or after 60 days from the date of publication of the FAQs, patients did not have the benefit of this clarification until their new plan year, which generally started in January 2016. 
         On January 20, 2017, the administration signed an Executive Order directing federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the ACA to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the ACA that would impose a fiscal or regulatory burden on states, individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices, among others. Congress also could consider subsequent legislation to repeal and replace elements of the ACA. Additionally, in October 2017, the Department of Health and Human Services, jointly with the Department of Labor and the Treasury, issued two interim rules outlining exemption processes for employers not wanting to offer contraceptive coverage based on their religious beliefs or sincerely held moral convictions. While there is an injunction against the administration prohibiting it from implementing these rules, the ultimate outcome of that litigation cannot be predicted. Therefore, it is difficult to determine the full effect of the ACA or any other healthcare reform efforts on our business. We will continue to monitor the healthcare reform efforts and agency implementation.

     Government Regulation 
         Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, import and export of pharmaceutical products such as those we are developing. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. 
   FDA Regulation 
         In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and its implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as the FDA's refusal to approve pending NDAs, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold or termination, issuance of Warning, Untitled, or Cyber Letters, requests for product recalls, product seizures or detention, total or partial suspension or restriction of production, marketing or distribution, injunctions, fines, debarment, refusal to allow the import or export of product, adverse publicity, modification of promotional materials or labeling, refusals of government contracts, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, restitution, disgorgement, imprisonment, consent decrees and corporate integrity agreements, or civil or criminal penalties. 
         The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
 

 Completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA's Good Laboratory Practice, or
GLP, regulations; 
 Submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug Application, or IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin; 
 Approval by an independent Institutional Review Board, or IRB, for each clinical site before each trial may be initiated; 
 Performance of human clinical trials, including adequate and well- controlled clinical trials, in accordance with cGCPs to establish the safety
and efficacy of the proposed drug product for each indication; 
 Submission to the FDA of an NDA; 
 Satisfactory completion of a FDA advisory committee review, if applicable; 
 Satisfactory completion of a FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance
with FDA requirements for product manufacturing and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug's identity, strength, quality and purity, as well as the
potential for completion of a FDA inspection of selected clinical sites to determine cGCP compliance; and 
 FDA review and approval of the NDA. 

 34

     Preclinical Studies and IND Submission 
         Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of drug substance chemistry, pharmacology, toxicity and drug product formulation, as well as animal studies to assess potential safety and efficacy. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests and preclinical literature, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND, unless the sponsor is relying on prior FDA findings of safety or efficacy of the drug product, in which case, some of the above information may be omitted. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence. 
   Clinical Trials 
         Clinical trials involve the administration of an investigational new drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with cGCP requirements, which includes the requirements that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial, and the review and approval of the study by an IRB. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial, the trial procedures, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the efficacy criteria to be evaluated and a statistical analysis plan. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, an IRB for each clinical trial site participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences, and the IRB must continue to oversee the clinical trial while it is being conducted, including any changes. 
         Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined. In Phase 1, the drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or subjects with the target disease or condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an initial indication of its effectiveness. In Phase 2, the drug typically is administered through controlled studies to a limited subject population with the target disease or condition to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the drug for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage. In Phase 3, the drug is administered to an expanded subject population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, in two adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to generate enough data to statistically evaluate the efficacy and safety of the product candidate for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product candidate and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product candidate. In the case of a 505(b)(2) NDA, which is a marketing application in which sponsors may rely on investigations that were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use from the person by or for whom the investigations were conducted, some of the above-described studies and preclinical studies may not be required or may be abbreviated. Bridging studies may be needed, however, to demonstrate the applicability of the studies that were previously conducted by other sponsors to the drug that is the subject of the marketing application. In addition to the above traditional kinds of data required for the approval of an NDA, the 21st Century Cures Act, provides for FDA acceptance of new kinds of data such as such as patient experience data, real world evidence for already approved products, and, for appropriate indications sought through supplemental marketing applications, data summaries. 
         In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, an NDA or supplement to an NDA for a new active ingredient, indication, dosage form, dosage regimen or route of administration must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and efficacy of the drug for the claimed 
 35

   indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. We have obtained a waiver from the conduct of a PREA study. 
         The manufacture of investigational drugs for the conduct of human clinical trials is subject to FDA product manufacturing requirements. Investigational drugs and active pharmaceutical ingredients imported into the United States are also subject to regulation by the FDA relating to their labeling and distribution. Further, the export of investigational drug products outside of the United States is subject to regulatory requirements of the receiving country as well as U.S. export requirements under the FDCA. 
         Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and the IRB and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. Information about certain clinical trials, including a description of the study and study results, must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, for public dissemination on their ClinicalTrials.gov website. Failure to submit the required information to ClinicalTrials.gov can result in monetary penalties. Marketing application applicants must also report certain investigator financial interests to FDA. 
         Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. Furthermore, the FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB's requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to subjects. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group regularly reviews accumulated data and advises the study sponsor regarding the continuing safety of trial subjects, potential trial subjects, and the continuing validity and scientific merit of the clinical trial. We may also suspend or terminate a clinical trial based on evolving business objectives or competitive climate. 
   U.S. Marketing Approval 
         Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical and clinical studies, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product's chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. In most cases, the submission of an NDA is subject to a substantial application user fee. These user fees must be filed at the time of the first submission of the application, even if the application is being submitted on a rolling basis. A user fee for the Twirla contraceptive patch was submitted with the original NDA. Application resubmissions by the same applicant do not require a new application fee. Under the PDUFA, guidelines that are currently in effect, the FDA has agreed to certain performance goals regarding the timing of its review of an application. The FDA's standard review goal is to act on 90% of all Non-New Molecular Entity applications within ten months of FDA receipt of the application. These time periods may be extended by the FDA should an applicant submit new information to the agency during the course of FDA's review of the marketing application. The time period is also only a goal and may not be met by the FDA. 
         The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all original NDAs within the first 60 days after submission, before accepting them for filing, to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to 
 36

   permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be submitted again with the additional information and is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. 
         Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review to determine, among other things, whether the drug is safe and effective and whether the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packaged or held, as well as the manufacturing processes and controls, meet standards designed to ensure the product's continued safety, quality and purity. 
         The FDA may refer a marketing application to an external advisory committee for questions pertaining to issues such as clinical trial design, safety and efficacy, and public health questions. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it typically follows such recommendations and considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. 
         Before approving an NDA, the FDA will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured, referred to as a Pre-Approval Inspection. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with FDA's requirements for product manufacturing and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications by the manufacturer and all of its subcontractors and contract manufacturers. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with cGCP. Also, as part of its regulatory review, the FDA verifies the data contained in the NDA. 
         The testing and approval process for a drug product requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and may take several years to complete. Data obtained from preclinical and clinical testing are not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. The FDA may not grant approval of a marketing application on a timely basis, or at all. 
         After evaluating the NDA and all related information, including the advisory committee recommendation, if any, and inspection reports regarding the manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites, the FDA may issue an approval letter, or, in some cases, a CRL. A CRL indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete, and the application is not ready for approval. A CRL generally contains a statement of specific conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the drug product and may require additional clinical or preclinical testing, or other information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. 
         If an application receives a CRL, the applicant may resubmit the application, addressing all of the FDA cited deficiencies, withdraw the application, or request the opportunity for a hearing. If the applicant resubmits the application, the application is subject to an initial FDA review. Within 30 days of receipt, the FDA will review a resubmission to determine whether it constitutes a complete response that addresses all deficiencies identified in a complete response letter. The agency then issues a letter to the applicant, stating whether the agency agrees that the resubmission is a complete response. If the FDA does not agree that the resubmission is a complete response, the review clock will not start until a complete response is received. If the agency agrees that the resubmission is a complete response, the FDA will classify the resubmission as either Class 1 or 2. FDA aims to review Class 1 resubmissions within two months of receipt or Class 2 resubmissions within six months of receipt. Class 1 resubmissions are resubmissions of an NDA following a complete response letter, which include minor updates or data reanalysis. Class 2 resubmissions include more complex or extensive updates to the NDA. As with the PDUFA timelines for original submissions, these are also subject to extension if the sponsor submits new information. Resubmitted applications may also be subject to FDA inspection of 
 37

   clinical and manufacturing sites, as well as review by FDA Advisory Committees. Following its review of a resubmitted NDA, FDA may issue an approval letter or another CRL. 
         Even if we resubmit with the required additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA's satisfaction, the FDA may issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. 
         Even if the FDA approves a product candidate, it may limit the approved indications for use of the product candidate and require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, including a black box warning. The FDA also may not approve the inclusion of labeling claims necessary for successful marketing. Moreover, the FDA may require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess certain aspects of a drug's safety and efficacy after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms. For example, the FDA may require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, as a condition of approval or following approval to mitigate any identified or suspected serious risks and ensure safe use of the drug. The REMS plan could include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans, and elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries or other risk minimization tools. A REMS could materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing studies or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes, and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements, submission of a supplemental application, and FDA review and approval. Further, should new safety information arise, additional testing, product labeling or FDA notification may be required. 
   Hatch-Waxman Act 
         Section 505 of the FDCA describes three types of marketing applications that may be submitted to the FDA to request marketing authorization for a new drug. A Section 505(b)(1) NDA is an application that contains full reports of investigations of safety and efficacy. A 505(b)(2) NDA is an application that contains full reports of investigations of safety and efficacy but where at least some of the information required for approval comes from investigations that were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use from the person by or for whom the investigations were conducted. This regulatory pathway enables the applicant to rely, in part, on the FDA's prior findings of safety and efficacy for an existing product, or published literature, in support of its application. Section 505(j) establishes an abbreviated approval process for a generic version of approved drug products through the submission of an Abbreviated New Drug Application, or ANDA. An ANDA provides for marketing of a generic drug product that has the same active ingredients, dosage form, strength, route of administration, labeling, performance characteristics and intended use, among other things, to a previously approved product. ANDAs are termed "abbreviated" because they are generally not required to include preclinical (animal) and clinical (human) data to establish safety and efficacy. Instead, generic applicants must scientifically demonstrate that their product is bioequivalent to, or performs in the same manner as, the innovator drug through in vitro, in vivo, or other testing. The generic version must deliver the same amount of active ingredients into a subject's bloodstream in the same amount of time as the innovator drug and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the reference listed drug. In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA each patent with claims that cover the applicant's drug or a method of using the drug. Upon approval of a drug, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the FDA's Approved Drug 
 38

   Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be cited by potential competitors in support of approval of an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA. 
         Upon submission of an ANDA or a 505(b)(2) NDA, an applicant must certify to the FDA that (1) no patent information on the drug product that is the subject of the application has been submitted to the FDA; (2) such patent has expired; (3) the date on which such patent expires; or (4) such patent is invalid or will not be infringed upon by the manufacture, use or sale of the drug product for which the application is submitted. Generally, the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA cannot be approved until all listed patents have expired, except where the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant challenges a listed patent through the last type of certification, also known as a paragraph IV certification. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents or indicate that it is not seeking approval of a patented method of use, the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA application will not be approved until all of the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired. 
         If the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders within a specified timeframe. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the paragraph IV certification. If the paragraph IV certification is challenged by an NDA holder or the patent owner(s) asserts a patent challenge to the paragraph IV certification, the FDA may not make an approval effective until the earlier of 30 months from the receipt of the notice of the paragraph IV certification, the expiration of the patent, when the infringement case concerning each such patent was favorably decided in the applicant's favor or settled, or such shorter or longer period as may be ordered by a court. This prohibition is generally referred to as the 30-month stay. In instances where an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA applicant files a paragraph IV certification, the NDA holder or patent owner(s) regularly take action to trigger the 30-month stay, recognizing that the related patent litigation may take many months or years to resolve. Thus, approval of an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA could be delayed for a significant period of time depending on the patent certification the applicant makes and the reference drug sponsor's decision to initiate patent litigation. 
         The Hatch-Waxman Act establishes periods of regulatory exclusivity for certain approved drug products, during which the FDA cannot approve (or in some cases accept) an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application that relies on the branded reference drug. For example, the holder of an NDA, including a 505(b)(2) NDA, may obtain five years of exclusivity upon approval of a new drug containing new chemical entities, or NCEs, that have not been previously approved by the FDA. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the therapeutic activity of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an ANDA or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company that contains the previously approved active moiety. However, an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. 
         The Hatch-Waxman Act also provides three years of marketing exclusivity to the holder of an NDA (including a 505(b)(2) NDA) for a particular condition of approval, or change to a marketed product, such as a new formulation for a previously approved product, if one or more new clinical studies (other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies) was essential to the approval of the application and was conducted/sponsored by the applicant. This three-year exclusivity period protects against FDA making an ANDA and 505(b)(2) NDA approval effective for the condition of the new drug's approval. As a general matter, the three-year exclusivity does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs or 505(b)(2) NDAs for generic versions of the original, unmodified drug product. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA; however, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and efficacy. 
 39

          
        Our NDA for Twirla was submitted under Section 505(b)(2), and we expect that some of our other drug candidates will utilize the Section 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway. Even though several of our drug products utilize active drug ingredients that are commercially marketed in the United States in other dosage forms, we need to establish safety and efficacy of those active ingredients in the formulation and dosage forms that we are developing. All approved products, both innovator and generic, are listed in the FDA's Orange Book. 
   Combination Drug/Device Regulation 
         Our product candidates may be considered to be drug-device combination products by the FDA. While our product candidates, as a whole, are subject to the NDA approval process, drug-device combination products require compliance with additional FDA regulations. For instance, drug-device combination products must comply with the drug cGMPs, as well as some of the device Quality System Regulations, or QSRs. These dual requirements will require additional effort and monetary expenditure to ensure that our product candidates comply with all applicable regulatory requirements. 
   U.S. Post-Approval Requirements 
         Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to manufacturing recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion, reporting of adverse experiences with the product and drug shortages, and compliance with any post-approval requirements imposed as a condition of approval, such as Phase 4 clinical trials, REMS and surveillance to assess safety and efficacy after commercialization. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There are also continuing, annual prescription drug program user fee requirements for any approved products. In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, list drugs manufactured at their facilities with the FDA, and are subject to periodic announced and unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with FDA and state requirements for product manufacturing and other requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented, or FDA notification. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from FDA requirements for product manufacturing and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain FDA requirements for product manufacturing compliance. 
         Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. 
         Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in mandatory revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
 

 Restrictions on the marketing, distribution or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or requests for
product recalls; 

 40

   

 Fines, or Untitled, Cyber or Warning Letters or holds on or termination of post-approval clinical trials; 
 Refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals; 
 Product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; 
 Injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties including disgorgement, restitution, fines and imprisonment; 
 Consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements or exclusion from federal healthcare programs; 
 Debarment; 
 Mandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and the issuance of corrective information; or 
 The FDA or other regulatory authorities may issue safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases or other communications
containing warnings or other safety information about the product. 

         The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Although physicians, in the practice of medicine, may prescribe approved drugs for unapproved indications, pharmaceutical companies are prohibited from marketing or promoting their drug products for uses outside the approved label, a practice known as off-label promotion. The FDA and other agencies enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability, including criminal and civil penalties under the FDCA and False Claims Act, exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs, mandatory compliance programs under corporate integrity agreements, debarment and refusal of government contracts. 
         In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products, including samples, is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, which regulates the distribution of drugs and drug samples at the federal level. Both the PDMA and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution. 
         Moreover, the Drug Quality and Security Act imposes obligations on manufacturers of pharmaceutical products related to product tracking and tracing. Among the requirements of this legislation, manufacturers are required to provide certain information regarding the drug product to individuals and entities to which product ownership is transferred, are required to label drug product with a product identifier and are required to keep certain records regarding the drug product. The transfer of information to subsequent product owners by manufacturers is also required to be done electronically. Manufacturers must also verify that purchasers of the manufacturers' products are appropriately licensed. Further, under this legislation, manufactures have drug product investigation, quarantine, disposition, and FDA and trading partner notification responsibilities related to counterfeit, diverted, stolen and intentionally adulterated products, as well as products that are the subject of fraudulent transactions or which are otherwise unfit for distribution such that they would be reasonably likely to result in serious health consequences or death. Other persons and entities within the drug supply chain are also subject to Drug Quality and Security Act requirements. 
   U.S. Fraud and Abuse, Data Privacy and Security and Transparency Laws and Regulations 
         In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, federal and state fraud and abuse laws restrict business practices in the biopharmaceutical industry. These laws include, among 
 41

   other things, anti-kickback, physician payment transparency and false claims laws and regulations as well as data privacy and security laws and regulations. 
         The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person or entity, from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease, or order of any item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term "remuneration" has been interpreted broadly to include anything of value. Additionally, the intent standard under the Anti-Kickback Statute and criminal healthcare fraud statutes was also amended by the ACA to a stricter standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the ACA provided that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases, or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances. 
         The federal civil False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment to, or approval by, the federal government or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. A claim includes "any request or demand" for money or property presented to the U.S. government. The civil False Claims Act has been used to assert liability on the basis of kickbacks and other improper referrals, improperly reported government pricing metrics such as Best Price or Average Manufacturer Price, improper promotion of off-label uses not expressly approved by the FDA in a drug's label, and allegations as to misrepresentations with respect to the services rendered. Additionally, the civil monetary penalties statute, which, among other things, imposes fines against any person who is determined to have presented, or caused to be presented, claims to a federal healthcare program that the person knows, or should know, is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent. The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, also created federal criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud or to obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, any healthcare benefit program, including private third party payors and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by trick, scheme or device a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services relating to healthcare matters. Also, many states have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, that apply regardless of the payor. 
         In addition, we may be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, including the final omnibus rule published on January 25, 2013, imposes specified requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable 
 42

   health information. Among other things, HITECH makes security standards and certain privacy standards directly applicable to business associates. HITECH also created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys' fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws may govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. 
         Additionally, federal physician payment transparency laws, including the federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act created under Section 6002 of the ACA and its implementing regulations, require that manufacturers of drugs for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program, with certain exceptions, report annually to the government information related to payments or other "transfers of value" made or distributed to physicians, which is defined to include doctors of medicine, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors, generally, with some exceptions, and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, physicians and teaching hospitals. Additionally, applicable manufacturers and group purchasing organizations are required to report annually to the government certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Manufacturers must submit reports by the 90th day of each calendar year. Disclosure of such information is made on a publicly available website. 
         There are also an increasing number of analogous state laws that regulate price increases, require manufacturers to file reports with states on pricing and marketing information, and to track and report gifts, compensation, other remuneration and items of value provided to healthcare professionals and healthcare entities. Many of these laws contain ambiguities as to what is required in order to comply with such laws. For example, several states have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical companies to, among other things, establish and implement commercial compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state, make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials and other activities, or register their sales representatives. Certain state laws also regulate manufacturers' use of prescriber-identifiable data. These laws may affect our future sales, marketing and other promotional activities by imposing administrative and compliance burdens. In addition, given the lack of clarity with respect to these laws and their implementation, our reporting actions once we commercialize could be subject to the penalty provisions of the pertinent state and federal authorities. 
         If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws or regulations described above or any other laws that apply to us, we may be subject to a variety of penalties, depending upon the law found to have been violated, potentially including criminal and significant civil monetary penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, corporate integrity agreements, refusal of government contracts, contract debarment and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. To the extent that any of our products are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws, and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or transfers of value to healthcare professionals. 
   Coverage and Reimbursement Generally 
         The commercial success of Twirla and our other potential product candidates and our ability to commercialize any approved product candidates successfully will depend in part on the extent to which governmental payor programs at the federal and state levels, including Medicare and Medicaid, private health insurers and other third-party payors provide coverage for and establish adequate coverage of 
 43

   and reimbursement levels for our product candidates. Government authorities, private health insurers and other organizations generally decide which drugs they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels for healthcare. In particular, in the United States, private health insurers and other third-party payors often provide reimbursement for products and services based on the level at which the government provides reimbursement through the Medicare or Medicaid programs for such products and services. In the United States, the E.U. and other potentially significant markets for our product candidates, government authorities and third-party payors are increasingly attempting to limit or regulate the price of medical products and services, particularly for new and innovative products and therapies, which often has resulted in average selling prices lower than they would otherwise be. Further, the increased emphasis on managed healthcare in the United States and on country and regional pricing and reimbursement controls in the E.U. will put additional pressure on product pricing, reimbursement and utilization, which may adversely affect our future product sales and results of operations. These pressures can arise from rules and practices of managed care groups, judicial decisions and governmental laws and regulations related to Medicare, Medicaid and healthcare reform, pharmaceutical coverage and reimbursement policies and pricing in general. Patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Sales of our product candidates will therefore depend substantially, both domestically and abroad, on the extent to which the costs of our products will be paid by health maintenance organizations, managed care, pharmacy benefit and similar healthcare management organizations, or reimbursed by government health administration authorities, such as Medicare and Medicaid, private health insurers and other third-party payors. 
         Third-party payors are increasingly imposing additional requirements and restrictions on coverage and limiting reimbursement levels for medical products, including pharmaceuticals. For example, federal and state governments reimburse covered prescription drugs at varying rates generally below average wholesale price. These restrictions and limitations influence the purchase of healthcare services and products. Third-party payors are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling healthcare costs. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drug products for a particular indication. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our products, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA approvals. Our product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. Moreover, a payor's decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in drug development for a product candidate. Legislative proposals to reform healthcare or reduce costs under government insurance programs may result in lower reimbursement for our product candidates or exclusion of our product candidates from coverage. The cost containment measures that healthcare payors and providers are instituting and any healthcare reform could significantly reduce our revenues from the sale of any approved product candidates. We cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to obtain and maintain third-party coverage or adequate reimbursement for our product candidates in whole or in part. 
   Healthcare Reform 
         Legislative proposals to reform healthcare or reduce costs under government healthcare programs may result in lower reimbursement for our product candidates or exclusion of our product candidates from coverage. There have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system that could affect our ability to profitably sell our product candidates, if approved. Among policy 
 44

   makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives. 
         In March 2010, the ACA was enacted, which included provisions on comparative clinical effectiveness research extended the initiatives of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, also known as the stimulus package, which provided $1.1 billion in funding to study the comparative effectiveness of healthcare treatments. This funding was designated for, among other things, conducting, supporting or synthesizing research that compares and evaluates the risks and benefits, clinical outcomes, effectiveness and appropriateness of products. The ACA also appropriated additional funding to comparative clinical effectiveness research. Although Congress has indicated that this funding is intended to improve the quality of healthcare, it remains unclear how the research will impact current Medicare coverage and reimbursement or how new information will influence other third-party payor policies. 
         It is possible that comparative effectiveness research demonstrating benefits in a competitor's product could adversely affect the sales of our product candidates. If third-party payors do not consider our product candidates to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our product candidates, once approved, as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our product candidates on a profitable basis. 
         In addition, in August 2011, President Obama signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011, as amended, which, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend proposals in spending reductions to Congress. The Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction did not achieve its targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, triggering the legislation's automatic reductions to several government programs. These reductions include aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013 and will stay in effect through 2024 unless additional Congressional action is taken. In November 2015, the Bipartisan Budget Act was enacted into law, which, among other things, extended sequestration through 2025. These and other healthcare reform initiatives may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial operations. We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could further limit the prices we are able to charge, or the amounts of reimbursement available, for our product candidates if they are approved. 
         On January 20, 2017, the new administration signed an Executive Order directing federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the ACA to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the ACA that would impose a fiscal or regulatory burden on states, individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices among others. Additionally, in October 2017, the Department of Health and Human Services, jointly with the Department of Labor and the Treasury, issued two interim rules outlining exemption processes for employers not wanting to offer contraceptive coverage based on their religious beliefs or sincerely held moral convictions. While there is an injunction against the administration prohibiting it from implementing these rules, the ultimate outcome of that litigation cannot be predicted. Congress also could consider subsequent legislation to repeal and replace elements of the ACA that are repealed. Therefore, it is difficult to determine the full effect of the ACA or any other healthcare reform efforts on our business.

     The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act 
         The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring the company to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations. Activities that violate the FCPA, even if they occur wholly outside the United States, can result in criminal and civil fines, imprisonment, disgorgement, oversight and debarment from government contracts. 
 Foreign Regulation 
         We currently have no plans to seek approval for Twirla outside of the United States. In order to market any product outside of the United States, we would need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries regarding safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may negatively impact the regulatory process in others. 
 Research and Development 
         Conducting research and development is central to our business model. We have invested and expect to continue to invest significant time and capital in our research and development operations. Our research and development expenses were $9.8 million, $14.4 million, and $20.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. In 2019, we expect our research and development expenses to remain relatively consistent with 2018 expenses. Research and development expenses in 2019 will consist primarily of those costs associated with the continued development and refinement of our commercial manufacturing process, preparation and resubmission of the NDA for Twirla, and responding to information requests expected to be received from the FDA as part of their review of our NDA resubmission. We have significantly scaled back equipment qualification and validation of our commercial manufacturing process and resumption and completion of these activities will require additional capital. 
 Intellectual Property 
         We strive to protect the proprietary technologies that we believe are important to our business, including seeking and maintaining patent protection intended to cover our Skinfusion® technology, its methods of use, related technologies and other inventions that are important to our business. As more fully described below, our patents and patent applications are directed to our Skinfusion technology or aspects thereof including certain transdermal delivery systems having an active adhesive matrix and methods of using such transdermal delivery systems for controlling fertility. We also rely on manufacturing trade secrets and careful monitoring of our proprietary information to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection. 
 46

           Our success will depend significantly on our ability to obtain new patents and maintain existing patents and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business, defend and enforce our patents, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets and operate without infringing valid and enforceable patents and other proprietary rights of third parties. 
         A third party may hold intellectual property, including patent rights, which are important or necessary to the development of our product candidates. It may be necessary for us to use the patented or proprietary technology of third parties to commercialize our product candidates, in which case we would be required to obtain a license from these third parties on commercially reasonable terms. If we were not able to obtain a license on commercially reasonable terms, our business could be harmed, possibly materially. 
         We plan to continue to expand our intellectual property estate by filing patent applications directed to novel and nonobvious transdermal contraceptive products. The active pharmaceutical ingredients, or API, in our potential product candidates are generic and therefore our patents do not include claims directed solely to the API. We anticipate seeking additional patent protection in the United States and internationally for additional transdermal delivery systems and their methods of use. 
         The patent positions of pharmaceutical companies like us are generally uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued, and the patent's scope can be modified after issuance. Consequently, we do not know whether any of our product candidates will remain protected by enforceable and valid patents. We cannot predict whether the patent applications we are currently pursuing will issue as patents in any particular jurisdiction or whether the claims of any issued patents will provide sufficient proprietary protection from competitors. Any patents that we hold may be challenged, circumvented or invalidated by third parties. 
         Because patent applications in the United States and certain other jurisdictions generally are maintained in secrecy for 18 months, and since publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature often lags behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain of our entitlement to patent rights in the inventions covered in our issued patents and pending patent applications. Moreover, we may have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, USPTO, to determine priority of invention, or in post-grant challenge proceedings in the USPTO or foreign patent offices such as oppositions, reexamination, inter-partes review, post grant review, or a derivation proceeding, that challenge our entitlement to an invention or the patentability of one or more claims in our patent applications or issued patents. Such proceedings could result in substantial cost, even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us. 
         More specifically, Twirla® is a transdermal contraceptive hormone delivery system. The system is a patch for application to the skin and contains two API, the hormones LNG, which is a synthetic progestin, and EE, a synthetic estrogen. The API are formulated with a combination of skin penetration enhancers, which promote penetration through the dermis and into the bloodstream, such that effective blood levels of the active agents are achieved to suppress ovulation and thereby prevent pregnancy. One of our other potential product candidates, AG890, is similar to Twirla, except that it contains only a single API, LNG. 
         In both our Twirla product candidate line and in AG890, the active adhesive system consists of the active ingredients in a polyacrylate adhesive polymer matrix comprising the permeation enhancers dimethylsulfoxide, ethyl lactate, capric acid and lauryl lactate. The active blend is coated onto a release liner, and a backing layer is added on top of the active blend. The peripheral adhesive system, also called the overlay, comprising three layers is added onto the backing layer. The overlay comprises a polyisobutylene adhesive layer, an acrylic adhesive layer, and an overlay covering. The overlay covering is a commercially available silk-like polyester fabric. The adhesive components of the overlay, in 
 47

   addition to their adhesive function, create an in situ seal with the disposable release liner, trapping evaporable solvents in the active blend, thereby extending the usable shelf life of the product candidate and contributing to the comfort and effectiveness of the transdermal system during use. Prior to use of any of our product candidates, the release liner is removed by the user and discarded. The patch is then applied to the skin. 
         Eight U.S. patents, issuing from two patent families, have been or are being submitted to the FDA for listing in the Orange Book upon approval of Twirla. These patents include claims directed to transdermal delivery systems having an active adhesive matrix and claims directed to methods of controlling fertility by applying such transdermal delivery systems, and in all cases including a skin permeation enhancer. One of our eight issued U.S. patents will expire November 22, 2020. Four will expire March 14, 2021. Two will expire July 10, 2028. The eighth will expire August 26, 2028. 
         U.S. Patent No. 7,045,145 is directed to the adhesive matrix of the transdermal delivery system used in Twirla and expires in March 2021; product-by-process claims cover patches manufactured by drying wet formulations of the active adhesive matrix. U.S. Patent No. 7,384,650, U.S. Patent No. 8,221,784, and U.S. Patent No. 8,221,785 are all directed to the dry final product formulation of the transdermal delivery system used in Twirla and expire in March 2021. U.S. Patent No. 8,221,784 covers both Twirla and AG890. Foreign counterparts to these patents have been granted in Australia, China, India, Israel, and Mexico. U.S. Patent No. 8,883,196 is directed to a method of controlling fertility by applying Twirla or AG890 once each week for three weeks followed by a one-week rest interval, or in an extended regimen without a rest interval for a selected number of weeks and expires November 22, 2020. 
         U.S. Patent Nos. 8,246,978, 8,747,888, and 9,050,348 are directed to structural features of the transdermal delivery system used in Twirla and AG890 patch design for transdermal delivery of hormones or of other drugs. As such, these patents protect a platform technology for delivery of LNG, EE, other hormones, and other drugs. These patents expire in July and August 2028. Foreign counterparts have been granted in Australia, Canada, China, Spain, France, Netherlands, Italy, UK, Ireland, Germany, Switzerland, Japan, Russia and New Zealand and one counterpart remains pending in India. 
         U.S. Patent Nos. 9,198,876, 9,192,614, 9,198,919 and 9,198,920 and related patents and patent applications are directed to various novel dosing regimens, each of which employs transdermal delivery of contraceptive doses of EE and LNG during a "treatment interval" and transdermal delivery of low dose EE and low dose LNG during a "withdrawal interval". Foreign counterparts are pending or granted in Europe and Canada. We expect these patents will be relevant to two of the products in our pipeline, AG200-SP and AG200-ER, as well as other new potential regimens. 
         U.S. Patent No. 9,364,487 is directed to a composition and device for transdermal delivery of LNG for P-only therapy. The composition contains an anti-oxidant to protect the progestin against oxidative degradation caused by other components of the composition. Foreign counterparts are pending or granted in Canada, Europe, India, Japan and Mexico. We expect this patent to be relevant to at least one product in our pipeline, AG890. 
   Regulatory Exclusivity 
         Our NDA for Twirla was submitted under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA. Even though Twirla utilizes API that were previously approved in the United States, Twirla utilizes LNG in a new dosage form, specifically a transdermal patch, and we provided new clinical data essential to approval in our NDA to establish the safety and efficacy of Twirla. Therefore, if approved by the FDA, we expect to receive three years of U.S. marketing exclusivity for Twirla. The exclusivity will prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs and 505(b)(2) NDAs for the conditions of the Twirla approval. We will consider whether we are going to pursue patent term restoration, however, we do not expect to receive patent term restoration because, as explained above, Twirla will not be the first approval of the API.
