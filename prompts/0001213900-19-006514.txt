Item 1. | Business.
--------+----------

 
We are principally engaged in the fertilizer processing and distribution business in the People’s Republic of China (“PRC”).
 
Through our patented technology, we process crop straw (including corn, rice, wheat, cotton, and other crops) into high quality organic nutritious fertilizer rich in small molecules, easily absorbed by crops in 3 hours. Straws are common agricultural by-product. In PRC, farmers usually burn the straw down to remove the straws efficiently in order to continue farming on the same land. These activities have resulted in serious air pollution and damage the surface structure of the soil. We change waste into treasure by recycling the straws into organic fertilizer, and effectively reduced air pollution. The straw organic fertilizer we produce does not contain the heavy metals, antibiotics, and harmful bacteria that is common in the traditional manure fertilizer. The organic matter content in our organic fertilizer is also much higher than the national standard. It can effectively reduce the use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides and reduce the penetration of large chemical fertilizers and pesticides into the soil and thus avoid water pollution. Therefore, our fertilizer can effectively improve soil, improve soil fertility, and improve the quality and safety of agricultural products.
 
Currently, all our production takes place in Weihai City, Shandong Province, PRC, including two completed new fertilizer plants, which have been in operations since August 2015. All our fertilizer plants in Weihai City produced the straw organic fertilizer, which is our main product currently and in the future. We decided to make technological improvement for our existing straw organic fertilizer production lines in the following aspects: (1) adopt more advanced automatic control technology for raw material feed to shorten the feeding time of raw material, and (2) manufacture powdered organic fertilizer instead of granular organic fertilizer production in order to avoid the drying and cooling process. We estimated we would be able to increase our production capacity significantly through the technical improvement.
 
Due to the increased demand and unique advantage of organic fertilizer products, we plan to expand our business by establishing a new organic fertilizer with a capacity of over 100 thousand tons per year, located in Suihua City, Heilongjiang Province, PRC.
 
In addition, in 2014, we rented 350 mu (about 57.66 acres) of mountainous land as apple farm and use our own fertilizer, to demonstrate the advantages of our straw organic fertilizer in Weihai city, Shandong Province, PRC. We have revenue of $2,486 and $6,501 for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 respectively. Our apple trees will not become commercially productive until 2019.
 
While concentrating resources on the development of bio-organic fertilizers, we are actively developing the agricultural food business. Currently we invested in the construction of a deep-processing slaughterhouse project for slaughtering 200,000 black goats in Chuxiong City, Yunnan Province, PRC.
 
Our assets mainly include: (1) 42,895 square meters of industrial land and 28,549 square meters of factory and office space located in Jinshan District, Shanghai City. (2) 22,511 square meters of industrial land and 10,373 square meters of plant area and straw organic fertilizer production line in Weihai City, Shandong Province. (3) More than $2 million investment of land use right and building for black goat slaughtering and processing project located in Shuangbai County, Chuxiong City, Yunnan Province, PRC
 
As the factory area in Jinshan District, Shanghai City is too close to the urban area to produce straw organic fertilizer, some factory buildings, office buildings and spare land in Jinshan District, Shanghai City, have been leased to three third parties.
 
Our products are sold under our brand names “Zongbao,” “Fukang,” and “Muliang.” Our customers are mainly located in Guangdong, Jilin, and Shandong provinces.

The Status and Market Demand of Straw Organic Fertilizer Industry in China
 
The straw in China is in large quantity, has wide variety and broad distribution, and the annual output of straw of is more than 700 million tons. The straw contains more than 3 million tons of nitrogen, more than 700,000 tons of phosphorus and nearly 7 million tons of potassium, equivalent to more than a quarter of China’s current fertilizer amount of use and equivalent to 300 million tons of standard coal. However, nearly 100 million tons of straw are burned directly in the fields every year, which not only damages the beneficial bacteria in the soil surface seriously, but also directly leads to severe air pollution and increases the greenhouse effect. With the significant amount of production of straws in China, so long as part of the straw can be recycled every year, it will bring huge sustainable recycling resources to the fertilizer industry. On November 25, 2015, the National Development and Reform Commission, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Environmental Protection jointly issued a notice, requiring the utilization rate of straw to exceed 85% by 2020.
 
Market demand in China for organic fertilizer is significant. In 2015, the China national sales volume of organic fertilizers was 90 million tons. According to the current policy of encouraging less use of chemical fertilizer, improving the quality of agricultural products and restoring land, it is estimated that the demand of organic fertilizers will increase to 180 million tons by 2020. At the same time, according to a governmental advocate of increasing proportion of organic fertilizer to 50% of the total use of fertilizer, the demand in China for organic fertilizer will reach more than 500 million tons.
 
Straw organic fertilizer industry is an industry of ecological production and recycling economic.
 
The Environmental Considerations of Promoting Straw Organic Fertilizer
 
1. Less Air Pollution. Even if each county area builds a 100,000 tons of straw disposal factory, 100 counties in total can approximately reduce 10 million tons of straw burning, reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 15 million tons, and reduce a large number of carbon monoxide, volatile organic particles (PM), nitrogen oxides, benzene, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and other harmful gases.
 
2. Less soil pollution, more environment restoration. Straw is a circulating agricultural resource and the best organic fertilizer resource. Straw organic fertilizer is also the main measure to convert wasteland, tidal flat and saline-alkali land into arable land, transform barren land into medium-low yield field and upgrade medium-low yield field to high-quality fertile field.
 
3. Less water pollution. The utilization rate of traditional chemical fertilizers is generally below 30%, and 70% of the dissolved chemical fertilizers directly enter the underground water bodies and flow into rivers, resulting in eutrophication of water bodies. Increasing the application of organic fertilizer is one of the important methods to reduce water pollution.
 
Technology and Production Process of Straw Organic Fertilizer
 
1. Technology of Producing Straw Organic Fertilizer
 
The straw contains the stalk, root, leaf, pod shell and rattan. The main components are cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin and a small amount of minerals. Because straw belongs to coarse fiber and has trace wax and lignification, the process of straw microbial fermentation and composting organic fertilizer is relatively long (usually from 15 to 60 days), which is a difficulty for large-scale and rapid production of straw fertilizer.
 
Our technology disposes the straw into the organic fertilizer matrix with rich nutritional value in the closed container through the acidification and hydrolysis technology of low pressure and medium temperature.

--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. Manufacturing Process
 
After the straw is collected, they are packed with block making machine and piled in the warehouse. The straw is transported to the factory when there is production need. In the factory, first, the straw is crushed to 3 cm to 5 cm in the pretreatment room. Second, the straw is transferred to the hydrothermal degradation tank, and will be further processed in the tank for 2 to 3 hours. The hydrothermal degradation tank will separate the cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin in the straw, break the hydrogen bond in the straw, degrade the fiber crystallization zone, convert the fiber crystallization zone into non-crystallization zone, and degrade the macromolecule into small molecule. Third, through the automatic batching system, we add auxiliary materials to the straw product to make organic fertilizer matrix, and then produce organic fertilizer products according to the different demand of fertilizer products.
Research and Development
 
We have 12 patents and 5 registered trademarks on sludge and straw technology, and we are a pilot company of technology in Jinshan District, Shanghai. Among the patents we now own, “microwave induced catalytic hydrolysis treatment sludge” was reviewed by Chinese Academy of Sciences Shanghai Technology Chaxin Consulting Centre (report no. 200921C0703709, 200821C0701507). According to the review by the Centre, there is no public report of the same kind of research, and therefore, the project is innovative and is advanced at the international level.
 
Our hydrothermal degradation technology can convert straw and other organic materials into organic fertilizer matrix with high organic matter and rich organic acid that can be directly applied into the field within 2-3 hours. This technology has been applied in our Shandong Weihai production line.
