ITEM 1. Business
Overview
Green Dot Corporation is a financial technology leader and bank holding company with a mission to reinvent banking for the masses. Our company’s long-term strategy is to create a unique, sustainable and highly valuable fintech ecosystem, in part through the continued evolution of Green Dot’s innovative “Banking as a Service” platform, that’s intended to fuel the engine of innovation and growth for Green Dot and its many business partners for many years to come. 
Enabled by proprietary technology, our wholly-owned commercial bank charter and our high-scale program management operating capability, our “Banking as a Service,” or "BaaS" platform is used by a growing list of America’s most prominent consumer and technology companies to design and deploy their own bespoke financial services solutions to their customers and partners, while we use that same integrated platform to design and deploy our own leading collection of banking and financial services products directly to consumers through what we believe to be the most broadly distributed, omni-channel branchless banking platforms in the United States. Our products are marketed under brand names such as Green Dot, GoBank, RapidPay and several other consumer brands and can be acquired through more than 100,000 retailers nationwide, thousands of corporate paycard partners, several “direct-2-consumer” branded websites, thousands of tax return preparation offices and accounting firms, thousands of neighborhood check cashing locations and both of the leading app stores. We are headquartered in Pasadena, California, with additional facilities throughout the United States and in Shanghai, China.
As the regulated entity and issuing bank for substantially all products and services we provide, whether our own or on behalf of a BaaS platform partner, we are directly accountable for all aspects of each program’s integrity, inclusive of ensuring the program’s compliance with all applicable banking regulations, applicable state and federal law and our various internal governance policies and procedures related to all areas of risk and compliance, in addition to deploying enterprise-class risk management practices and procedures to ensure each program’s initial and ongoing safety and soundness.
Acquisitions
In February 2017, we acquired of all the membership interests of UniRush, LLC to expand our online direct-to-consumer channel and our emergent corporate payroll card business. The fair value of the total consideration in connection with the acquisition was approximately $163.7 million, which included cash and contingent consideration in the form of an earn-out. Additional information regarding the acquisition is included in the information set forth in Note 4 — Business Acquisitions of the consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
Our products and services
We offer consumers a broad collection of financial products and services managed through several diverse business lines which are then made available to consumers through a widely-available “branchless" distribution network in the United States. Many of the products and services we internally create and distribute are marketed under the Green Dot brand name, which we believe is both a well-known and highly trusted brand name for millions of consumers. Our branchless network consists of:

• | distribution arrangements with more than 100,000 mostly major chain retail locations, which we refer to as “retail distributors” and thousands of neighborhood Financial Service Center locations;


• | several differently branded, Green Dot-owned and operated direct-to-consumer online and direct mail customer acquisition platforms;


• | corporate distribution partnerships with businesses that provide payroll cards to their employees to receive wage disbursements;


• | more than 25,000 small and large tax preparation companies and individual tax preparers, which are sometimes referred to as electronic return originators, or “EROs”, who are able to offer our products and services to their customers through the use of various tax preparation industry software packages with which our products are integrated;


• | apps compatible with the iOS and Android operating systems downloaded through the corresponding app store; and

1


• | platform partners’ distribution channels that those partners use to acquire customers for their bespoke products and services that are powered by our BaaS Platform.

Our products and services include several deposit account programs, such as network-branded reloadable prepaid debit cards marketed under several leading consumer brand names, which we collectively refer to as "GPR cards," consumer checking accounts, small business checking accounts, network-branded gift cards (known as open-loop), secured credit cards and other financial services.
We also offer several products and services that specialize in facilitating the movement of cash on behalf of consumers and businesses. These products and services include: our proprietary swipe reload system for crediting cash onto an enabled payment card by swiping the payment card at the point-of-sale at any Green Dot Network participating retailer; MoneyPak, a product that allows a consumer to add funds to accounts we issue or accounts issued by other United States chartered and regulated third party banks; and e-cash remittance services, a service that allows a consumer to transfer funds to a smartphone for fulfillment at a Green Dot participating retailer. We refer to these services collectively as our cash transfer products. We also provide disbursement services through our Simply Paid platform that enables a payment solution for companies to pay their workforce and customers in the time and manner they desire and provide tax refund transfers that provide the processing technology to facilitate receipt of a taxpayers' refund proceeds.
Our BaaS Platform
Our BaaS Platform, which is used by several of America’s largest retail, consumer, technology and financial services companies, includes the following products, services and bespoke capabilities: 

• | Mobile banking;


• | Loan disbursement accounts;


• | Mobile P2P services;


• | Money transfer services;


• | GPR cards;


• | Network branded "open loop" gift cards;


• | Instant payment and wage disbursements;


• | Small business checking accounts and debit cards; and


• | Consumer checking accounts.

Our Segments and Distribution Channels
Our products and services and BaaS Platform are divided among our two reportable segments: Account Services and Processing and Settlement Services. Each segment is comprised of multiple “revenue divisions” that each focus on a distinct set of products or distribution channels, as follows:
Account Services    
Consumer Accounts
We offer several deposit account programs that can be acquired through our omni-channel distribution platform. These products include:

• | Network-branded reloadable prepaid debit cards marketed under several leading consumer brand names, collectively referred to as GPR cards;


• | Innovative consumer and small business checking account products, such as our GoBank product, that allow customers to acquire and manage their checking account entirely through a mobile application available on smartphone devices; and


• | Network-branded gift cards (known as open-loop) that are sold at participating retail stores.

Green Dot Direct
We also offer GPR cards, checking accounts products and secured credit cards directly to consumers through several different online direct-to-consumer websites. Our direct-to-consumer websites include: greendot.com; walmartmoneycard.com; rushcard.com; accountnow.com; achievecard.com; gobank.com; and ReadyDebit.com. 
2

Consumer Credit Card
We offer a secured credit card nationwide on a direct-to-consumer basis via both greendot.com/platinum and securedcardchoice.com. Our secured credit cards are designed to help people establish or rehabilitate their national credit bureau score. The credit line offered to the customer is backed by the customer's own security deposit held on deposit at Green Dot Bank or other banks in accounts held under our control. As such, we have no risk of material loss resulting from the customer's non-payment of their obligation. As the customer successfully uses their credit card and repays their obligations in accordance with the card’s terms and conditions, that successful repayment history is reported to the national credit bureaus which, in turn, can help improve the customer’s overall credit score. Customers have the option of funding their security deposits with cash and making monthly payments at Green Dot Network retail locations.
PayCard and Corporate Disbursement
We offer payroll cards and other wage disbursement services to over 2,500 corporate customers, such as Einstein Bagels, Nordstrom and Rite Aid. Our solutions address both the W-2 and 1099 work force.
Green Dot Bank
Through our subsidiary bank, Green Dot Bank, we offer issuing, settlement and capital management services principally to support those applicable products across all six revenue divisions in both reporting segments. Our banking services include:

• | Issuing services as the payment network member bank and settlement bank for our GPR card, spend-based P2P programs, gift card and checking account products;


• | Credit card issuing and capital lending services for our Green Dot Platinum Visa Secured Credit Card; and


• | Settlement bank for our reload and tax refund services within our Processing and Settlement Services segment.

Green Dot Bank also generates interest income through the investment of funds from its capital and the increasing deposits it receives in respect of our products and services as well as the products and services we enable for our BaaS platform partners.
Products within our Account Services segment are generally issued by Green Dot Bank. As a result of acquisitions over the past few years, we also manage programs issued by third-party issuing banks.
Processing and Settlement Services    
Money Processing
We offer several products and services that all specialize in facilitating the movement of funds on behalf of consumers and businesses. These products and services include:

• | Our “Reload@TheRegister” swipe reload service allows consumers to add funds to accounts we issue or manage and accounts issued by any third-party bank or program manager, which we refer to as network acceptance members, that has enabled its cards to accept funds through our processing system.


• | Our MoneyPak PIN product provides consumers the ability to add funds to accounts we issue or manage and accounts issued by any third party bank or program manager that has enabled its cards to accept funds through our processing system.


• | Our e-cash remittance service enables consumers to add funds to accounts we issue or manage and accounts issued by any third party bank or program manager that has enabled its accounts to accept funds through our processing system. Consumers can also cash-out money sent to them by a business through the use of our e-cash remittance service when Green Dot sends a unique barcode to the customer’s smartphone, which is then presented to a cashier at a participating retailer who then scans the barcode to fulfill the transfer.


• | Our Simply Paid Disbursement service that enables wages and any type of authorized funds disbursement to be sent to accounts we issue or manage and accounts issued by any third-party bank or program manager that has enabled its cards to accept funds through our processing system.

Tax Processing
We offer several services designed for participants in the tax industry. Those services include:

• | Tax refund transfers that provide the processing technology to facilitate receipt of a taxpayers' refund proceeds. When a customer of a third-party tax preparation provider chooses to pay their tax preparation fees using our

3

processing services, we deduct the tax preparation service fee and our processing service fee from the customer's refund and remit the remaining balance to the customer's account;

• | Small business lending to independent tax preparation providers that seek small advances in order to help provide working capital prior to generating income during the tax filing season;


• | GPR card offerings that are integrated into the tax preparation software that enables a tax preparation provider to offer its customers a Green Dot Bank-issued GPR card for the purpose of receiving tax refunds more rapidly and securely than check disbursements; and


• | Fast Cash Advance, a consumer-friendly loan that enables tax refund recipients utilizing our tax processing services the opportunity to receive a portion of their expected tax refund amount in advance of receiving their actual tax refund.

Our Relationship with Walmart
Walmart is our largest retail distributor. Green Dot Corporation has been the provider of Walmart-branded GPR cards sold at Walmart since the initiation of the Walmart MoneyCard pilot program in 2006 and that product's national launch in 2007, and Green Dot Bank has been the issuer of those card accounts since early 2014. Pursuant to our agreement with Walmart, Green Dot designs and delivers the Walmart MoneyCard product and provides all ongoing program support, including network IT, regulatory and legal compliance, website functionality, customer service and loss management. Walmart provides us with shelf space to display and offer the card accounts to consumers. As the issuing bank, Green Dot Bank holds the associated FDIC-insured deposits. All Walmart MoneyCard products are reloadable exclusively on the Green Dot Network. In addition to Walmart MoneyCards, we offer our Green Dot-branded cards and our GoBank checking account product at Walmart, providing consumers the choice to purchase either Green Dot-branded products or Walmart MoneyCard products. Our operating revenues derived from the several products and services we offer through Walmart stores and other Walmart distribution avenues in aggregate represented approximately 37%, 40%, and 45% of our total operating revenues for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. 
Seasonality
In the industries for prepaid financial services and tax refund processing, companies commonly experience seasonal fluctuations in revenue. For example, in recent years, our results of operations for the first half of each year have been favorably affected by large numbers of taxpayers electing to receive their tax refunds via direct deposit on our cards, which caused our operating revenues to be typically higher in the first half of those years than they were in the corresponding second half of those years. Additionally, our tax refund processing services business is highly seasonal as it generates the substantial majority of its revenue in the first quarter, and substantially all of its revenue in the first half of each calendar year. We expect our revenue to continue to fluctuate based on seasonal factors that affect the prepaid financial services and tax refund processing industries as a whole.
Competition
Our core businesses include the offering of several deposit account programs, including prepaid cards of various types and for various purposes, demand deposit or "checking" accounts and debit cards, and various types of financial technology and transaction processing services to a wide range of consumers through a broad-based, national distribution platform. We also provide program management and other capabilities to our platform partners utilizing our BaaS platform. Consequently, we compete against companies and financial institutions across the retail banking, financial services, transaction processing, consumer technology and financial technology services industries and may compete with others in the market who may in the future provide offerings similar to ours. Furthermore, many of our competitors are entities substantially larger in size, more highly diversified in revenue and substantially more established with significantly more broadly known brand awareness than ours. As such, many of our competitors can leverage their size, robust networks, financial wherewithal, brand awareness, pricing power and technological assets to compete with us. Additionally, some of our current and potential competitors are subject to fewer regulations and restrictions than we are and thus may be able to respond more quickly in the face of regulatory and technological changes.
Our tax refund processing services compete directly with similar processing technologies and settlement capabilities offered by companies such as Refundo, Refund Advantage, Republic Bank and others. Furthermore, other entities, like Jackson Hewitt and H&R Block, have either fully or partially internally-developed processing and settlement capabilities to self-provide services similar to ours. It is possible that our current or potentially new distribution partners may seek to develop their own internal capabilities that compete with our tax refund processing services.
We compete primarily on the basis of the following: 

• | breadth of distribution;

4


• | speed and quality of innovation;


• | reliability of system performance and security;


• | scalability of platform services;


• | quality of service;


• | compliance and regulatory capabilities;


• | brand recognition and reputation; and


• | pricing

We believe our products or platform services compete favorably with respect to these factors.
Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of patent, trademark and copyright laws and trade secret protections in the United States, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions, to protect the intellectual property rights related to our products and services.
We own several trademarks, including Green Dot and GoBank. Through agreements with our network acceptance members, retail distributors and customers, we authorize and monitor the use of our trademarks in connection with their activities with us.
Our patent portfolio currently consists of 11 issued patents and 7 patent applications pending. The term of the patents we hold is, on average, 20 years. We feel our patents and applications are important to our business and help to differentiate our products and services from those of our competitors.
The industries in which we compete are characterized by rapidly changing technology, a large number of patents, and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. There can be no assurance that our patents and other proprietary rights will not be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented; that others will not assert intellectual property rights to technologies that are relevant to us; or that our rights will give us a competitive advantage. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. The risks associated with patents and intellectual property are more fully discussed in “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” including the risk factors entitled “We may be unable to adequately protect our brand and our intellectual property rights related to our products and services or third parties may allege that we are infringing their intellectual property rights.”
Regulation and Supervision
General
Our business is heavily regulated by both federal and state agencies. We and our subsidiaries are subject to supervision, regulation and examination by various federal and state regulators, including the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve”), the Utah Department of Financial Institutions (the “Utah DFI”) and various other state regulatory agencies. The statutory and regulatory framework that governs us is generally intended to protect depositors and customers, the FDIC’s Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”), the U.S. banking and financial system, and financial markets as a whole.
Banking statutes, regulations and policies are continually under review by Congress, state legislatures and federal and state regulatory agencies. In addition to laws and regulations, federal and state bank regulatory agencies may issue policy statements, interpretive letters and similar written guidance applicable to Green Dot Corporation and its subsidiaries. Any change in the statutes, regulations or regulatory policies applicable to us, including changes in their interpretation or implementation, could have a material effect on our business.
Both the scope of the laws and regulations and the intensity of the supervision to which BHCs such as Green Dot Corporation are subject increased in response to the global financial crisis of 2008, as well as other factors such as technological and market changes. Regulatory enforcement and fines have also increased across the banking and financial services sector. Many of these changes occurred as a result of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protect Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) and its implementing regulations, most of which are now in place. While the regulatory environment has entered a period of tailoring and rebalancing of the post financial crisis framework, we expect that our business will remain subject to extensive regulation and supervision.
We are also subject to the disclosure and regulatory requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, both as administered by the SEC, as well as the rules of the New York Stock Exchange that apply to companies with securities listed on the New York Stock Exchange.
5

The following discussion describes certain elements of the comprehensive regulatory framework applicable to us. This discussion is not intended to describe all laws and regulations applicable to Green Dot Corporation, Green Dot Bank and our other subsidiaries. Any changes in applicable laws, regulations or the interpretations thereof could have a material adverse effect on our business.
Regulatory Agencies
In 2011 we completed our acquisition of Bonneville Bancorp and became a bank holding company (“BHC”) registered with the Federal Reserve under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (“BHC Act”). As a BHC, Green Dot Corporation is subject to the requirements of the BHC Act as well as supervision, regulation and examination by the Federal Reserve, which serves as the primary federal banking regulator of our consolidated organization.
As an FDIC-insured commercial bank that is chartered under the laws of Utah and a member of the Federal Reserve System, Green Dot Bank and its subsidiaries are subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the Federal Reserve and the Utah DFI.
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) has broad rulemaking authority over a wide range of federal consumer protection laws applicable to the business of Green Dot Bank. Because Green Dot Bank currently has less than $10 billion in total consolidated assets, Green Dot Bank is subject to regulations adopted by the CFPB, but the Federal Reserve is primarily responsible for examining Green Dot Bank’s compliance with federal consumer financial laws and those CFPB regulations. The Utah DFI is responsible for examining and supervising Green Dot Bank’s compliance with state consumer protection laws and regulations.
Permissible Activities for Green Dot Corporation as a Financial Holding Company
In general, the BHC Act limits the business of BHCs to banking, managing or controlling banks and other activities that the Federal Reserve has determined to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto. Under the BHC Act, BHCs that have qualified and elected to be treated as a financial holding company (“FHC”) generally may engage in a broader range of additional activities that are (i) financial in nature or incidental to such financial activities or (ii) complementary to a financial activity and do not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally. A BHC qualifies to become an FHC if it and its subsidiary depository institutions are “well capitalized” and “well managed” and its subsidiary depository institutions have a rating under the Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”) of at least “Satisfactory” at their most recent examination. We have qualified and elected to be an FHC under the BHC Act, although all the activities we currently conduct are permissible for a BHC.
If at any time we or Green Dot Bank fail to be “well capitalized” or “well managed,” the Federal Reserve may impose limitations or conditions on the conduct of our activities and we may not commence, or acquire any shares of a company engaged in, any activities only permissible for an FHC, without prior Federal Reserve approval. The restriction on our ability to commence, or acquire any shares of a company engaged in, any activities only permissible for an FHC, without prior Federal Reserve approval would also generally apply if Green Dot Bank received a CRA rating of less than “Satisfactory.”
In connection with our acquisition of Bonneville Bancorp in 2011 and our subsequent acquisition of certain assets and certain deposit liabilities of GE Capital Retail Bank in 2013, we submitted business plans to the Federal Reserve. Under commitments made to the Federal Reserve and the Utah DFI, we must obtain prior approval from the Federal Reserve for any major deviation or material change from the business plan we submitted in 2013. Accordingly, commitments made in connection with our business plan may limit our activities.
Permissible Activities for Banks
The activities of Green Dot Bank are limited to those specifically authorized under Utah banking laws and Utah DFI regulations and permissible under applicable federal law and Federal Reserve regulations.
Supervision, Examination and Enforcement
Bank regulators regularly examine the operations of BHCs and banks. Examination results are confidential and generally may not be disclosed. In addition, BHCs and banks are subject to periodic reporting and filing requirements. The Federal Reserve and Utah DFI have broad supervisory and enforcement authority with regard to BHCs and banks, including the power to conduct examinations and investigations, impose nonpublic supervisory agreements, issue cease and desist orders, impose fines and other civil and criminal penalties, terminate deposit insurance and appoint a conservator or receiver.
Bank regulators have various remedies available if they determine that the financial condition, capital resources, asset quality, earnings prospects, management, liquidity or other aspects of a banking organization’s operations are 
6

unsatisfactory. The regulators may also take action if they determine that the banking organization or its management is violating or has violated any law or regulation. The regulators have the power to, among other things, prohibit unsafe or unsound practices, require affirmative actions to correct any violation or practice, issue administrative orders that can be judicially enforced, direct increases in capital, direct the sale of subsidiaries or other assets, limit dividends and distributions, restrict growth, assess civil monetary penalties, remove officers and directors, and terminate deposit insurance.
Engaging in unsafe or unsound practices or failing to comply with applicable laws, regulations and supervisory agreements could subject Green Dot Corporation, its subsidiaries, including Green Dot Bank, and their respective officers, directors and institution-affiliated parties to the remedies described above and other sanctions. In addition, the FDIC may terminate a bank’s deposit insurance upon a finding that the bank’s financial condition is unsafe or unsound or that the bank has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices or has violated an applicable rule, regulation, order or condition enacted or imposed by the bank’s regulatory agency.
Bank and BHC Acquisitions and Mergers
The BHC Act, the Bank Merger Act, Utah’s Financial Institutions Act and other federal and state statutes regulate acquisitions of banks and other FDIC-insured depository institutions. Green Dot Corporation must obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve before (i) acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting shares of any bank or BHC, if after such acquisition, it will directly or indirectly own or control 5% or more of any class of voting shares of the institution, (ii) acquiring all or substantially all of the assets of any bank (other than directly through Green Dot Bank) or (iii) merging or consolidating with any other BHC. Under the Bank Merger Act, the prior approval of the Federal Reserve is required for Green Dot Bank to merge with another bank or purchase all or substantially all of the assets or assume any of the deposits of another FDIC-insured depository institution. In reviewing applications seeking approval of merger and acquisition transactions, bank regulators consider, among other things, the competitive effect and public benefits of the transactions, the capital position and managerial resources of the combined organization, the risks to the stability of the U.S. banking or financial system, the applicant's performance record under the CRA, the applicant's compliance with fair housing and other consumer protection laws and the effectiveness of all organizations involved in combating money laundering activities. In addition, failure to implement or maintain adequate compliance programs could cause bank regulators not to approve an acquisition where regulatory approval is required or to prohibit an acquisition even if approval is not required.
Acquisitions of Ownership of Green Dot Corporation
The ability of a third party to acquire our stock is also limited under applicable U.S. banking laws, including regulatory approval requirements.
Federal Banking Law. The BHC Act requires any BHC to obtain the approval of the Federal Reserve before acquiring, directly or indirectly, more than 5% of our outstanding common stock. Any “company,” as defined in the BHC Act, other than a BHC is required to obtain the approval of the Federal Reserve before acquiring "control" of us. "Control" generally means (i) the ownership or control of 25% or more of a class of voting securities, (ii) the ability to elect a majority of the directors or (iii) the ability otherwise to exercise a controlling influence over management and policies. An entity that controls us for purposes of the BHC Act is subject to regulation and supervision as a BHC under the BHC Act. In addition, under the Change in Bank Control Act of 1978, as amended (the “CIBC Act”), and the Federal Reserve’s regulations thereunder, any person, either individually or acting through or in concert with one or more persons, is required to provide notice to the Federal Reserve prior to acquiring control, directly or indirectly, of a BHC such as Green Dot Corporation. For purposes of the CIBC Act, a rebuttable presumption of control applies to acquisitions of more than 10% of any class of a BHC’s voting stock under certain circumstances including if, as is the case with Green Dot Corporation, the issuer has registered securities under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
Utah Change in Control Restrictions. Utah’s Financial Institutions Act generally requires prior approval of the Utah DFI before a person or entity may acquire, directly or indirectly, control of a depository institution or a depository institution holding company subject to its jurisdiction. The Utah DFI defines control to include, among other things, the power, directly or indirectly, or through or in concert with one or more persons, to vote more than 10% of any class of voting securities by a person other than an individual or to vote 20% or more of any class of voting securities by an individual.
Capital and Liquidity Requirements
In General. The U.S. banking agencies have adopted regulatory capital rules to implement the Basel III regulatory capital framework developed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and related provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act (“U.S. Basel III Rules”). Under the U.S. Basel III Rules, Green Dot Corporation and Green Dot Bank are required to maintain minimum risk-based and leverage capital ratios. Green Dot Corporation and Green Dot Bank 
7

must also maintain a capital conservation buffer of 2.5% to avoid becoming subject to restrictions on capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments to management. For a discussion of applicable regulatory minimum and well-capitalized minimum capital ratios, as well as a description of relevant definitions related to capital amounts and ratios, see “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations--Capital Requirements for Bank Holding Companies” and Note 22 — Regulatory Requirements to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein, which are incorporated by reference in this Item 1. 
The Federal Reserve may require BHCs, including us, to maintain capital substantially in excess of mandated minimum levels, depending upon general economic conditions and a BHC’s particular condition, risk profile and growth plans. The Federal Reserve may also require BHCs or their subsidiaries to make other capital or liquidity commitments. For example, in addition the above generally applicable requirements, Green Dot Bank is subject to commitments that it and Green Dot Corporation have made to the Federal Reserve and the Utah DFI. These commitments require Green Dot Bank to maintain cash and/or cash equivalents in an amount equal to no less than 100 percent of insured deposits generated by Green Dot Bank related to GPR cards.
Failure to be well-capitalized, to meet minimum capital requirements or to comply with the other commitments to which we and Green Dot Bank are subject could result in certain mandatory and possible additional discretionary actions by regulators, including restrictions on our and Green Dot Bank’s ability to pay dividends or otherwise distribute capital or to receive regulatory approval of applications, or other restrictions on growth.
As of December 31, 2018, our and Green Dot Bank’s regulatory capital ratios were above the well-capitalized standards and met the then-applicable capital conservation buffer. Based on current estimates, we believe that Green Dot Corporation and Green Dot Bank will continue to exceed all applicable well-capitalized regulatory capital requirements and the capital conservation buffer, on a fully phased-in basis.
FDICIA and Prompt Corrective Action
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (“FDICIA”) requires the federal bank regulatory agencies to take “prompt corrective action” in respect of FDIC-insured depository institutions that do not meet certain capital adequacy standards. FDICIA establishes five capital categories ("well-capitalized", "adequately capitalized", "undercapitalized", "significantly undercapitalized" and "critically undercapitalized"), with a depository institution’s categorization for purposes of the prompt corrective action provisions depending upon its level of capitalization and certain other factors. An institution that fails to remain well-capitalized becomes subject to a series of restrictions that increase in severity as its capital condition weakens. Such restrictions may include a prohibition on capital distributions, restrictions on asset growth or restrictions on the ability to receive regulatory approval of applications. FDICIA also provides for enhanced supervisory authority over undercapitalized institutions, including authority for the appointment of a conservator or receiver for the institution. In certain instances, a BHC may be required to guarantee the performance of an undercapitalized subsidiary bank’s capital restoration plan.
Brokered Deposits
As discussed above under “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors,” current FDIC guidance classifies the majority of Green Dot Bank’s deposits as brokered. Under FDIC regulations, only banks that are well-capitalized may accept brokered deposits without restriction. A bank that is adequately capitalized may not accept, renew or roll over any brokered deposit unless it has been granted a waiver by the FDIC. If such waiver is granted, the bank may not pay an interest rate on any deposit in excess of 75 basis points over certain prevailing market rates. Undercapitalized banks may not accept, renew or roll over any brokered deposits. Because a majority of Green Dot Bank’s deposits are brokered deposits, failure by Green Dot Bank to remain well-capitalized could negatively affect our operations or financial condition.
In December 2018, the FDIC released an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking seeking comment on its regulatory approach to brokered deposits and the interest rate caps that apply to banks that are not well-capitalized (“Brokered Deposit ANPR”). The Brokered Deposit ANPR is part of the FDIC’s comprehensive review of its brokered deposit and interest rate regulations in light of significant changes in technology, business models, the economic environment, and products since those regulations were initially adopted. We cannot predict whether the Brokered Deposit ANPR will result in any changes to the FDIC’s brokered deposit regulations or what the effects of any changes will be.
Safety and Soundness Guidelines
The federal banking agencies have adopted guidelines prescribing safety and soundness standards relating to internal controls, risk management, information systems, internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth and compensation, fees and benefits. These guidelines in general require appropriate systems and practices to identify and manage specified risks and exposures. The guidelines also 
8

prohibit excessive compensation as an unsafe and unsound practice and characterize compensation as excessive when the amounts paid are unreasonable or disproportionate to the services performed by an executive officer or employee, director or principal shareholder. In addition, the agencies have adopted regulations that authorize but do not require an agency to order an institution that has been given notice by the agency that it is not in compliance with any of the safety and soundness standards to submit a compliance plan. If after being so notified, an institution fails to submit an acceptable compliance plan, the agency must issue an order directing action to correct the deficiency and may issue an order directing other actions of the types, including those that may limit growth or capital distributions. If an institution fails to comply with such an order, the bank regulator may seek to enforce such order in judicial proceedings and to impose civil money penalties.
Dividend and Share Repurchase Restrictions
Green Dot Corporation is a legal entity separate and distinct from Green Dot Bank and its other subsidiaries. There are limitations on the payment of dividends by Green Dot Bank to Green Dot Corporation, as well as by Green Dot Corporation to its shareholders, under applicable banking laws and regulations. In addition, under the U.S. Basel III Rules we must obtain prior approval from the Federal Reserve before we may redeem or repurchase our common stock.
Federal banking regulators are authorized to determine, under certain circumstances relating to the financial condition of a BHC or a bank, that the payment of dividends would be an unsafe or unsound practice and to prohibit payment thereof. In particular, federal banking regulators have stated that paying dividends that deplete a banking organization's capital base to an inadequate level would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice and that banking organizations should generally pay dividends only out of current operating earnings.
Under Utah’s Financial Institutions Act, Utah-chartered commercial banks, such as Green Dot Bank, may, subject to certain conditions, declare and pay dividends out of their net profits, after providing for all expenses, losses, interest, and taxes accrued or due from the bank.
Green Dot Corporation and Green Dot Bank must maintain the applicable capital conservation buffer to avoid becoming subject to restrictions on capital distributions, including dividends and share repurchases. The capital conservation buffer is currently at its fully phased-in level of 2.5%. 
In addition, Federal Reserve policy provides that BHC, such as Green Dot Corporation, should generally pay dividends to shareholders only if (i) the organization’s net income available to common shareholders over the past year has been sufficient to fully fund the dividends; (ii) the prospective rate of earnings retention appears consistent with the organization’s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition and (iii) the organization will continue to meet minimum capital adequacy ratios. The policy also provides that a BHC should inform the Federal Reserve reasonably in advance of declaring or paying a dividend that exceeds earnings for the period for which the dividend is being paid or that could result in a material adverse change to the BHC’s capital structure. BHCs also are required to consult with the Federal Reserve before materially increasing dividends and must receive approval before redeeming or repurchasing capital instruments. In addition, the Federal Reserve could prohibit or limit the payment of dividends by a BHC if it determines that payment of the dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice.
Source of Strength
Green Dot Corporation is required to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to Green Dot Bank and, under appropriate conditions, to commit resources to support Green Dot Bank. This support may be required by the Federal Reserve at times when we might otherwise determine not to provide it or when doing so is not otherwise in the interests of Green Dot Corporation or our shareholders or creditors. The Federal Reserve may require a BHC to make capital injections into a troubled subsidiary bank and may charge the BHC with engaging in unsafe and unsound practices if the BHC fails to commit resources to such a subsidiary bank or if it undertakes actions that the Federal Reserve believes might jeopardize the BHC’s ability to commit resources to such subsidiary bank.
Under these requirements, Green Dot Corporation may in the future be required to provide financial assistance to Green Dot Bank should it experience financial distress. Capital loans by Green Dot Corporation to Green Dot Bank, if any, would be subordinate in right of payment to deposits and certain other debts of Green Dot Bank. In the event of Green Dot Corporation’s bankruptcy, any commitment by Green Dot Corporation to a federal banking regulator to maintain the capital of Green Dot Bank would be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment.
Receivership or Conservatorship of Green Dot Bank
Upon the insolvency of an insured depository institution, such as Green Dot Bank, the FDIC may be appointed as the conservator or receiver of the institution. Acting as a conservator or receiver, the FDIC would have broad powers to transfer any assets or liabilities of the institution without the approval of the institution’s creditors or shareholders.

Separately, the Commissioner of the Utah DFI also has the authority to take possession of or appoint a receiver or liquidator of any Utah state-chartered bank, such as Green Dot Bank, under specified circumstances, including where the bank (i) is not in a safe and sound condition to transact its business, (ii) has failed to maintain an adequate level of capital or (iii) is conducting its business in an unauthorized or unsafe manner.
Depositor Preference
The Federal Deposit Insurance Act provides that, in the event of the liquidation or other resolution of an insured depository institution, including Green Dot Bank, the claims of depositors of the institution (including the claims of the FDIC as subrogee of insured depositors) and certain claims for administrative expenses of the FDIC as a receiver would have priority over other general unsecured claims against the institution. If Green Dot Bank were to fail, insured and uninsured depositors, along with the FDIC, would have priority in payment ahead of unsecured, non-deposit creditors, including Green Dot Bank if it were a creditor at that time, with respect to any extensions of credit they have made to such insured depository institution.
Transactions between a Bank and its Affiliates
Federal banking laws and regulations impose qualitative standards and quantitative limitations upon certain transactions between a bank, such as Green Dot Bank, and its affiliates, including between a bank and its holding company and companies that control the BHC or that the BHC may be deemed to control for these purposes. Transactions covered by these provisions must be on terms that are at least as favorable to the bank as those that it could obtain in a comparable transaction with a non-affiliate, and cannot exceed certain amounts that are determined with reference to the bank’s regulatory capital. Moreover, if the transaction is a loan or other extension of credit, it must be secured by collateral in an amount and quality expressly prescribed by statute, and if the affiliate is unable to pledge sufficient collateral, the BHC may be required to provide it.
Federal banking laws also place similar restrictions on loans and other extensions of credit by FDIC-insured banks, such as Green Dot Bank, and their subsidiaries to their directors, executive officers and principal shareholders, as well as to entities controlled by such persons. 
Community Reinvestment Act
Under the CRA, an insured depository institution, such as Green Dot Bank, has a continuing and affirmative obligation to help meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low and moderate-income neighborhoods. The CRA does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for insured depository institutions, nor does it limit an insured depository institution’s discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community, consistent with the CRA. However, insured depository institutions are rated on their performance in meeting the needs of their communities.
The CRA requires the appropriate federal banking agency to take an insured depository institution’s CRA record into account when evaluating certain applications by the insured depository institution or its holding company, including applications for charters, branches and other deposit facilities, relocations, mergers, consolidations, acquisitions of assets or assumptions of liabilities, and bank and savings association acquisitions. An unsatisfactory record of performance may be the basis for denying or conditioning approval of an application by an insured depository institution or its holding company. The CRA also requires that all institutions publicly disclose their CRA ratings.
Green Dot Bank’s CRA compliance is currently evaluated under a CRA strategic plan. Green Dot Bank’s strategic plan for 2018 through 2020 focuses on supporting the credit needs of its defined assessment area primarily through direct community development lending, small business lending, and investments and services in Green Dot Bank’s designated Metropolitan Statistical Area of Utah and Juab Counties and the state of Utah.
Leaders of the federal banking agencies recently have indicated their support for revising the CRA regulatory framework, and on August 28, 2018, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking to solicit ideas for building a new CRA framework. We cannot predict whether any changes will be made to applicable CRA requirements.
Insurance of Deposit Accounts
The deposits of Green Dot Bank are insured by the DIF up to the standard maximum deposit insurance amount of $250,000 per depositor. Green Dot Bank is subject to deposit insurance assessments based on the risk it poses to the DIF, as determined by the capital category and supervisory category to which it is assigned. Brokered deposits are subject to an assessment rate adjustment of up to 10 basis points, and therefore are generally assessed at a higher rate. The FDIC has authority to raise or lower assessment rates on insured deposits in order to achieve statutorily required reserve ratios in the DIF and to impose special additional assessments. There is a risk that Green Dot Bank’s deposit insurance premiums will increase if failures of insured depository institutions deplete the DIF or if the FDIC 
10

changes its view of the risk Green Dot Bank poses to the DIF or increases the assessment rate adjustment applicable to Green Dot Bank’s brokered deposits.
Relationships with Third-Party Issuing Banks
While Green Dot Bank acts as our banking partner for most of our products and services, we offer some products and services through arrangements with federally- or state-chartered third-party banks. We are subject to contractual requirements with those banks and are indirectly subject to the oversight of our banking partners’ regulators with respect to the laws and regulations that apply to each such product or service. These types of third-party relationships are subject to increasingly demanding regulatory requirements and attention by federal banking regulators. Regulatory guidance requires financial institutions to enhance their due diligence, ongoing monitoring and control over their third party vendors and other ongoing third party business relationships.
As a result, our relationships with third-party banks may require us to undertake compliance actions similar to those that we or Green Dot Bank must perform for the products and services issued by Green Dot Bank.
Anti-Money Laundering Rules
The Bank Secrecy Act (“BSA”), the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 and other laws and regulations require financial institutions, among other duties, to institute and maintain an effective anti-money laundering (“AML”) program and file suspicious activity and currency transaction reports when appropriate. Among other things, these laws and regulations require Green Dot Corporation and Green Dot Bank to take steps to prevent the use of Green Dot Bank to facilitate the flow of illegal or illicit money, to report large currency transactions and to file suspicious activity reports. We also are required to develop and implement a comprehensive AML compliance program and must also have in place appropriate “know your customer” policies and procedures. We have adopted policies and procedures to comply with these requirements.
The bank regulatory agencies have increased the regulatory scrutiny of the BSA and anti-money laundering programs maintained by financial institutions. Significant penalties and fines, as well as other supervisory orders may be imposed on a financial institution for non-compliance with BSA/AML requirements. 
Office of Foreign Assets Control Regulation
OFAC is responsible for administering economic sanctions that affect transactions with designated foreign countries, nationals and others, as defined by various Executive Orders and Acts of Congress. OFAC-administered sanctions take many different forms. OFAC also publishes lists of persons, organizations and countries suspected of aiding, harboring or engaging in terrorist acts, known as Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons. Blocked assets (e.g., property and bank deposits) cannot be paid out, withdrawn, set off or transferred in any manner without a license from OFAC. Failure to comply with these sanctions could have serious legal and reputational consequences.
Privacy and Data Security Laws
Green Dot Bank is subject to a variety of federal and state privacy and data security laws, which govern the collection, safeguarding, sharing and use of customer information, and require that financial institutions have in place policies regarding information privacy and security. For example, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (“GLBA”) requires all financial institutions offering financial products or services to retail customers to provide such customers with the financial institution’s privacy policy and practices for sharing nonpublic information with third parties, provide advance notice of any changes to the policies and provide such customers the opportunity to “opt out” of the sharing of certain personal financial information with unaffiliated third parties. It also requires banks to safeguard personal information of consumer customers.
Some state laws also protect the privacy of information of state residents and require adequate security for such data, and certain state laws may, in some circumstances, require Green Dot Bank to notify affected individuals of security breaches of computer databases that contain their personal information. These laws may also require Green Dot Bank to notify law enforcement, regulators or consumer reporting agencies in the event of a data breach, as well as businesses and governmental agencies that own data.
Data privacy and data security are areas of increasing state legislative focus. For example, in June of 2018, the Governor of California signed into law the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”). The CCPA, which becomes effective on January 1, 2020, applies to for-profit businesses that conduct business in California and meet certain revenue or data collection thresholds. The CCPA will give consumers the right to request disclosure of information collected about them, and whether that information has been sold or shared with others, the right to request deletion of personal information (subject to certain exceptions), the right to opt out of the sale of the consumer’s personal information and the right not to be discriminated against for exercising these rights. The CCPA contains several exemptions, including an exemption applicable to information that is collected, processed, sold or disclosed pursuant 
11

to the GLBA. The California Attorney General has not yet proposed or adopted regulations implementing the CCPA, and the California State Legislature has amended the Act since its passage. Because we have a physical footprint in California, we will be required to comply with the CCPA. The impact of the CCPA on our business is yet to be determined. In addition, laws similar to the CCPA may be adopted by other states where we do business and the federal government may also pass data privacy or data security legislation.
Like other lenders, Green Dot Bank and other of our subsidiaries use credit bureau data in their underwriting activities. Use of such data is regulated under the Fair Credit Reporting Act (“FCRA”), and the FCRA also regulates reporting information to credit bureaus, prescreening individuals for credit offers, sharing of information between affiliates and using affiliate data for marketing purposes. Similar state laws may impose additional requirements on Green Dot Corporation and Green Dot Bank.
Consumer Protection Laws
The CFPB has broad rulemaking authority over a wide range of federal consumer protection laws that apply to banks and other providers of financial products and services, including the authority to prohibit “unfair, deceptive or abusive” acts and practices. For example, our deposit operations are subject to the following federal laws, among others:

• | the Truth in Savings Act and Regulation DD issued by the CFPB, which require disclosure of deposit terms to consumers;


• | Regulation CC issued by the Federal Reserve, which relates to the availability of deposit funds to consumers;


• | the Right to Financial Privacy Act, which imposes a duty to maintain the confidentiality of consumer financial records and prescribes procedures for complying with administrative subpoenas of financial records; and


• | the Electronic Fund Transfer Act and Regulation E issued by the CFPB, which govern automatic deposits to and withdrawals from deposit accounts and customers’ rights and liabilities arising from the use of automated teller machines and other electronic banking services.

The CFPB has also adopted amendments to Regulation E and Regulation Z to add protections for prepaid accounts (“CFPB Prepaid Rule”). The CFPB Prepaid Rule includes requirements related to treatment of funds on lost or stolen cards, error resolution and investigation, upfront fee disclosures, access to account information, and overdraft features if offered in conjunction with prepaid accounts. The CFPB Prepaid Rule becomes effective April 1, 2019.
Because it has less than $10 billion in total consolidated assets, the Federal Reserve, and not the CFPB, is responsible for examining and supervising Green Dot Bank’s compliance with these and other federal consumer financial laws and regulations. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act authorizes state attorneys general and state regulators to enforce consumer protection rules issued by the CFPB. State authorities have recently increased their focus on and enforcement of consumer protection rules.
Money Transmission Licensing and Regulation
Regulations promulgated by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network of the U.S. Department of the Treasury (“FinCEN”) require certain persons to register at the federal level as a money services business (“MSB”) and comply with anti-money laundering laws and regulations. In addition, most U.S. states require licenses for persons engaged in the business of money transmission. These U.S. state licensing laws may subject money transmitters to periodic examinations and may require them and their agents to comply with federal and/or state anti-money laundering laws and regulations.
We have registered with FinCEN as an MSB and have obtained licenses to operate as a money transmitter in all U.S. jurisdictions in which such a license is required for us to conduct our business.
Payment Networks
In order to provide our products and services, we, as well as Green Dot Bank, are contracted members with Visa and MasterCard. Therefore, we and Green Dot Bank are subject to Visa and MasterCard’s respective payment network rules and standards. These rules and standards implicate a variety of our activities and services, including by imposing data security obligations, allocating liability for certain acts or omissions (including liability in the event of a data breach) and providing rules governing how consumers and merchants may use their cards. Payment networks may, and routinely do, modify these rules and standards as they determine in their sole discretion and with or without advance notice to us. These modifications may impose additional costs and expenses on, or may otherwise be disadvantageous to, our business. In addition, we are subject to audit by various payment networks. The payment networks may fine or penalize us or suspend our registration if those audits find that we have failed to comply with applicable rules and standards.

Escheatment Laws
Unclaimed property laws of every U.S. jurisdiction require that we track certain information on our card products and services and that, if customer funds are unclaimed at the end of an applicable statutory abandonment period, the proceeds of the unclaimed property be remitted to the appropriate jurisdiction. We manage escheatment law compliance with respect to our card products and services and have an ongoing program to comply with those laws. Statutory abandonment periods applicable to our card products and services typically range from three to seven years.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 1,100 employees globally. None of our employees is represented by a labor union or is covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have never experienced any employment-related work stoppages and consider relations with our employees to be good.
