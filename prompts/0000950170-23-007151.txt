 Item 1. Business
 General
 Forrester Research, Inc. is a global independent research and advisory firm. We help leaders across technology, customer experience, marketing, sales and product functions use customer obsession to accelerate growth. Through Forrester’s proprietary research, consulting, and events, leaders from around the globe are empowered to be bold at work, navigate change, and put their customers at the center of their leadership, strategy, and operations. Our unique insights are grounded in annual surveys of more than 700,000 consumers, business leaders, and technology leaders worldwide, rigorous and objective research methodologies, over 100 million real-time feedback votes, and the shared wisdom of our clients.
 Our common stock is listed on Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol "FORR".
 Market Overview
 We believe that market dynamics — from empowered customers to the COVID-19 pandemic — have fundamentally changed business and technology. These dynamics continue to change stakeholder expectations.
 Consumers and buyers have new demands and requirements. To win, serve, and retain customers in this environment, we believe that companies require a higher level of customer obsession. Customer obsessed firms put their customers at the center of their leadership, strategy, and operations. Our research has shown that customer-obsessed firms grow faster and are more profitable.
 Organizations and leaders require a continuous stream of guidance and analysis to adapt to these ever-changing behaviors and realities. We believe that there is an increasing need for objective external sources of this guidance and analysis, fueling what we call the “golden age of research.”
Forrester’s Strategy and Business Model
 The foundation of our business model is our ability to help business and technology leaders tackle their most pressing priorities and drive growth through customer obsession. Forrester helps clients solve problems, make decisions, and take action to deliver results. With our proprietary research, consulting, and events, our business model provides multiple sources of value to our clients and creates a system to expand contract value ("CV"), which we view as our most significant business metric.
 Generally speaking, we define CV products as those services that our clients use over a year’s time and that are renewable periodically, usually on an annual basis. Our CV products primarily consist of our subscription research products, while our non-CV businesses, consulting and events, play critical complementary roles in driving our CV growth.
 With respect to our clients, we believe that it has become difficult for large companies to run multi-year strategy and change management projects on their own as customers are changing faster and competitors are increasingly aggressive. Multi-year CV product relationships enable us to help our clients formulate their vision for the future and then translate those plans into implementation and outcomes over time. For our investors, we believe that CV growth will result in predictable and profitable revenue streams.
 Our business model is built on the premise that an increase in CV generates more cash which can then be invested in improving our go-to-market structure (activities including sales, product, marketing and acquisitions) and creating CV products that clients renew year after year—repeating the cycle and driving the model forward. We refer to this model as our "CV growth engine."

Our Products and Services
 We strive to be an indispensable source that business and technology leaders across functions, including technology, customer experience, digital, marketing, sales, and product, worldwide turn to for ongoing guidance to plan and operate more effectively.
 We deliver our products and services globally through three business segments – Research, Consulting and Events.
 Research
 For 40 years, Forrester has been providing objective, independent and data-driven research insights utilizing both qualitative and quantitative data. We adhere to rigorous, unbiased research methodologies that are transparent and publicly available to ensure consistent research quality across markets, technologies, and geographies.
 Our primary subscription research services include Forrester Decisions, Forrester Research, and SiriusDecisions Research. This portfolio of research services is designed to provide business and technology leaders with a proven path to growth through customer obsession. Key content available via online access includes:
 •future trends, predictions, and market forecasts; 
 •deep consumer and business buyer data and insights; 
 •curated best practice models and tools to run business functions; 
 •operational and performance benchmarking data; and 
 •technology and service market landscapes and vendor evaluations. 
 Our research services also include time with our analysts to apply research to their context.
 Launched in 2021, Forrester Decisions is a portfolio of standardized research services combining key features of Forrester Research with key features of SiriusDecisions Research. We intend to migrate our existing clients that purchase Forrester Research and SiriusDecisions Research products to the Forrester Decisions products, and as of January 1, 2023, Forrester Decisions will be our only subscription research product that will be available for most new clients. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 32% of our CV was composed of Forrester Decisions products.
 Consulting
Our Consulting business includes consulting projects and advisory services. We deliver focused insights and recommendations to assist clients in developing and executing their technology and business strategies. Our consulting projects help clients with challenges addressed in our published research. Our consulting projects include conducting maturity assessments, prioritizing best practices, developing strategies, building business cases, selecting technology vendors, structuring organizations, developing content marketing strategies and collateral, and sales tools. Consulting plays an important role in supporting our CV growth, as we have found that clients that purchase consulting projects from us renew their CV contracts at higher rates compared to clients that do not purchase consulting.
Events
 We host multiple events across North America, Europe, and the Asia-Pacific region throughout the year. Forrester Events are thoughtfully designed and curated experiences to provide clients with insights and actionable advice to achieve accelerated business growth. Forrester Events focus on business imperatives of significant interest to clients, including business-to-business marketing, sales and product leadership, customer experience, security and risk, new technology and innovation, and data strategies and insights. One of the primary purposes of our Events business is to help drive our CV growth, and we have found that prospective clients that have attended one of our events convert into clients at higher rates compared to those that have not attended an event.
 Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, in 2020 and 2021 we began offering our events as live virtual experiences. These virtual events allowed us to offer added attendee benefits such as on demand sessions, more networking opportunities and more content, leading to higher attendee engagement. In 2022 we held all of our events as hybrid events, consisting of both in-person and virtual experiences. We currently plan to hold all of our events in 2023 and beyond as hybrid events.
Sales and Marketing
 We believe we have a strong alignment across our sales, marketing and product functions.


We sell our products and services through our direct sales force in various locations in North America, Europe and the Asia Pacific region. Our sales organization is organized into groups based on client size, geography, and market potential. Our Premier groups focus on our largest vendor and end user clients across the globe while our Core group focuses on small to mid-sized vendor clients. Our European and Asia Pacific groups focus on both end user and vendor clients in their respective geographies. Our International Business Development group sells our products and services through independent sales representatives in select international locations. We also have a group dedicated to event sales.
We employed 709 sales personnel as of December 31, 2022 compared to 637 sales personnel employed as of December 31, 2021.
 We also sell select Research products directly online through our website.
 Our marketing activities are designed to elevate the Forrester brand, differentiate and promote Forrester’s products and services, improve the client experience, and drive growth. We achieve these outcomes by combining the value of reputation, demand generation, customer engagement, and sales and customer success enablement programs to deliver multichannel campaigns and high-quality digital experiences. Our customer success organization conducts post-sale engagement activities that are designed to align to client outcomes, accelerate time to value, and drive higher retention.
 As of December 31, 2022, our products and services were delivered to more than 2,700 client companies. No single client company accounted for more than 4% of our 2022 revenues. 
 Pricing and Contracts
 We report our revenue from client contracts in three categories of revenue: (1) research, (2) consulting, and (3) events. We classify revenue from subscriptions to, and licenses of, our research products and services as research revenue. We classify revenue from our consulting projects and standalone advisory services as consulting revenue. We classify revenue from tickets to and sponsorships of events as events revenue.
 Contract pricing for annual subscription-based products is principally a function of the number of licensed users at the client. Pricing of contracts is a fixed fee for the consulting project or shorter-term advisory service. We periodically review and increase the list prices for our products and services.
 We track contract value as a significant business indicator. Contract value is defined as the value attributable to all of our recurring research-related contracts. Contract value is calculated as the annualized value of all contracts in effect at a specific point in time, without regard to how much revenue has already been recognized. Contract value increased 3% to $353.4 million at December 31, 2022 from $343.0 million at December 31, 2021.
 Competition
 We believe our focus on helping business and technology leaders use customer obsession to drive growth sets us apart from our competition. In addition, we believe we compete favorably due to:
 •our ability to offer forward-looking research, tools and frameworks as well as hands-on guidance;
 •our focus on providing teams within our clients' organizations with the confidence to execute effectively with end-to-end guidance, valuable knowledge, know-how, and a shared vocabulary;
 •our use of rigorous research methodologies to offer objective insights; and
 •our brand promise to be “on your side and by your side,” meaning that we strive to be obsessed about our clients' needs and priorities and aligned to their strategies. 
 Our principal direct competitors include other independent providers of research and advisory services, such as Gartner, as well as marketing agencies, general business consulting firms, survey-based general market research firms, providers of peer networking services, and digital media measurement services. In addition, our indirect competitors include the internal planning and marketing staffs of our current and prospective clients, as well as other information providers such as electronic and print publishing companies. We also face competition from free sources of information available on the Internet, such as Google. Our indirect competitors could choose to compete directly against us in the future. In addition, there are relatively few barriers to entry into certain segments of our market, and new competitors could readily seek to compete against us in one or more of these market segments. Increased competition could adversely affect our operating results through pricing pressure and loss of market share. There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to compete successfully against existing or new competitors.


Intellectual Property
Our proprietary research, methodologies and other intellectual property play a significant role in the success of our business. We rely on a combination of copyright, trademark, trade secret, confidentiality, and other contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property. We actively monitor compliance by our employees, clients and third parties with our policies and agreements relating to confidentiality, ownership, and the use and protection of Forrester’s intellectual property.
Employees
 Attracting, retaining, and developing the best and brightest talent around the globe is critical to the ongoing success of our company. As of December 31, 2022, we employed a total of 2,033 persons. Of these employees, 1,487 were in the United States and Canada; 298 in Europe, Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”); and 248 in the Asia Pacific region.
Culture. Our culture emphasizes certain key values — including client, courage, collaboration, integrity, and quality — that we believe are critical to deliver Forrester’s unique value proposition of helping business and technology leaders use customer obsession to drive growth. In addition, we seek to foster a culture where employees can be creative, feel supported and empowered, and are encouraged to think boldly about new ideas. As a reflection of these efforts, in 2022, for the fifth time in six years, Forrester was honored with a Glassdoor Employees’ Choice Award, recognizing the Best Places to Work in 2022.
Diversity and Inclusion (D&I). We focus on attracting, hiring, and the inclusion of all backgrounds and perspectives, with the goals of improving employee retention and engagement, strengthening the quality of our research, and improving client retention and customer experience. We field regular all-employee surveys to measure our progress against our goals. In 2022, in addition to the ongoing activities of our D&I Council and regional D&I Networks, examples of our efforts with respect to D&I included:
 •launching companywide inclusion training for employees and managers; 
 •expanding our global and regional D&I events and celebrating diversity heritage and awareness months through events and discussions; and
 •our continuation of various partnerships to attract and access more talent from underrepresented groups. 
 Learning and Development. We have a robust learning and development program and celebrate and enrich the Forrester culture through frequent recognition of achievements. To keep employees and teams connected and inspired to do their best work in a distributed work environment, we have enhanced the learning and development opportunities for our employees across a broad range of initiatives including new hire and onboarding, D&I, and leadership training.
