Significant Contracts
 
Some of our significant contracts are as follows:
 
Military Aircraft - Subcontracts with Prime Contractors
 NGC E-2D “Advanced Hawkeye” The NGC E-2 is an all-weather, carrier-based tactical airborne early warning aircraft. The twin turboprop aircraft was designed and developed in the 1950s by the Grumman Aircraft Company for the U.S. Navy as a replacement for the E-1 Tracer. The U.S. Navy aircraft has been progressively updated with the latest variant, the NGC E-2D, first flying in 2007. In 2008, we received an initial $7.9 million order from NGC to provide structural kits used in the production of Outer Wing Panels (“OWP”) for the NGC E-2D. We initially valued the long-term agreement at approximately $98 million over an eight-year period, with the potential to be in excess of $195 million over the life of the aircraft program. In November 2014, we received a second multi-year contract worth approximately $86.1 million through 2021 from NGC for OWP kits for use in the manufacture of complete wings for the NGC E-2D and the NGC C-2A Greyhound aircraft. The cumulative orders we have received on this program through January 2019 exceed $150 million.
 In addition, we announced in January 2016 that we won an award to supply structural components and kits for the OWP on the NGC E-2D that will be manufactured for Japan. We will be responsible for component source selection, supply chain management, delivery of kits, and will provide manufacturing engineering services to NGC during the integration of the components into the OWP. The contract from NGC is valued at between $25 million and $30 million through 2019, depending on the number of aircraft ordered by Japan. To date, we have received orders totaling $10.4 million.
 Sikorsky UH-60 “BLACK HAWK®” The Sikorsky UH-60 helicopter is the leader in multi-mission-type aircraft. Among the mission configurations it serves are troop transport, medical evacuation, electronic warfare, attack, assault support, and special operations. More than 3,000 Sikorsky UH-60 helicopters are in use today, operating in 29 countries. We have been producing gunner window and fuel panel assemblies for Sikorsky since 2010, and have long-term agreements from Sikorsky to manufacture gunner window assemblies, fuel panel assemblies, and perform MRO services on stabilators for the Sikorsky UH-60 helicopter through 2022.
 In 2017, we signed long-term supply agreements with Sikorsky to manufacture fuel panel and gunner window assemblies for the Sikorsky UH-60M helicopter, valued at up to approximately $21 million and $8.2 million for a period of five years, respectively. In September 2018, the Company received a series of purchase orders from Sikorsky totaling more than $8 million for the manufacture of Hover Infra Red Suppression Systems (“HIRSS”) in support of older model BLACK HAWK® helicopters.
 Bell / Textron AH-1Z “Viper” Attack Helicopter The Bell AH-1Z is a twin-engine attack helicopter used by the U.S. Marine Corps, which began full-rate production in December 2010. In January 2017, we received an indefinite-delivery / indefinite-quantity (“IDIQ”) contract from Bell for the manufacture of engine cowl and support assemblies, with a potential value of $14.8 million. In March 2018, we received an amendment to the IDIQ contract which extended the period of performance by one year and is valued at $3.8 million. This increased the total potential value of the IDIQ contract to $18.6 million through 2021.
 Sikorsky MH-53E “Sea Dragon” The Sikorsky MH-53E is the U.S. Navy’s primary airborne mine countermeasures aircraft. In May 2017, we received a contract from Sikorsky to provide MRO services for an initial quantity of 15 tow hook assemblies through 2022, with a potential value of $1 million, depending on the level of repair that is required. We have previously manufactured new tow hook assemblies under a spares contract awarded by Sikorsky in 2010.
 Raytheon Next Generation Jammer Mid-Band (“NGJ”) The Raytheon NGJ is an external jamming pod that will disrupt and degrade enemy aircraft and ground radar and communication systems and will replace the ALQ-99 system on the U.S. Navy’s EA-6B Growler carrier-based electronic warfare aircraft. Raytheon received a $1 billion sole source contract from the U.S. Navy in April 2016 for the engineering and manufacturing development (“EMD”) phase. CPI Aero has contracts with Raytheon valued at more than $19 million to assemble the NGJ pod structural housing and air management systems required during the EMD phase. After a successful development program, the U.S. Navy plans to install Raytheon NGJ pods on 138 EA-18G Growlers during the Raytheon NGJ pod production phase. There are two pods per aircraft. We estimate that the total value to CPI Aero of the production phase could be in excess of an additional $150 million through 2030.
 Collins DB-110 “Reconnaissance Pod” CPI Aero has a contract with Collins to manufacture pod structures for the DB-110 reconnaissance system, which is used primarily on exported F-16 aircraft.
 Collins “TacSAR” Pod The Collins TacSAR pod is a long-range synthetic aperture radar system designed for overland and maritime reconnaissance and surveillance, and is being developed by Collins with Selex ES, now Leonardo, S.p.A. Collins awarded CPI Aero a sole-source one-year development contract valued at under $1 million, to begin engineering and design support in 2017. CPI Aero expects to receive an initial production order in early 2019. The work being performed by CPI Aero is similar to work performed by CPI Aero during the pre-production phase of the DB-110. The TacSAR pod system complements the DB-110 to provide all-weather reconnaissance and surveillance and will contain some structural components common to the DB-110.
 Lockheed F-35 “Lightning II” The Lockheed F-35 Lightning II, also known as the Joint Strike Fighter, is a family of single-seat, single-engine, all-weather stealth multirole fighters designed to perform ground attack, aerial reconnaissance, and air defense missions. The DoD plans to acquire over 2,400 F-35’s by 2034 and 11 other countries also have plans to acquire the aircraft. We are a Tier 1 supplier to Lockheed and manufacture four different door lock assemblies for the F-35. In 2015, CPI Aero was awarded a multi-year contract to supply lock assemblies for the arresting gear door on the F-35A Conventional Takeoff and Landing variant aircraft, estimated at up to $10.6 million through 2021. We made our first delivery under the contract in May 2017. In November 2017, we announced an additional $15.8 million multi-year contract to manufacture canopy actuation drive shaft assemblies through 2022 for the F-35A, F-35B, and F-35C aircraft.
 Sikorsky CH-148 “Cyclone” The Sikorsky CH-148, a military variant of the Sikorsky S-92®, is a twin-engine, multi-role shipboard helicopter being manufactured by Sikorsky for the Royal Canadian Air Force (“RCAF”). The Sikorsky CH-148 is to be operated by the RCAF and will conduct anti-submarine warfare, surveillance, and search and rescue missions from Royal Canadian Navy warships. In 2016, Sikorsky awarded CPI Aero purchase orders valued at approximately $6.5 million to manufacture the weapon pylons. CPI Aero will produce weapon pylons for 28 aircraft with deliveries through 2018.

Commercial Aircraft - Subcontracts with Prime Contractors
 
Gulfstream G650 In March 2008, Spirit Aerosystems, Inc. (“Spirit”) awarded us a contract to provide leading edges for the Gulfstream G650 business jet, a commercial program that Spirit was supporting. In December 2014, Spirit transferred its work-scope on this program to Triumph. We continue to provide leading edges for the Gulfstream G650 as our purchase orders and long-term agreement have been transferred to Triumph.
 HondaJet Elite In July 2018, we received a long-term agreement from Honda to manufacture the noise attenuating engine inlet for its recently debuted HondaJet Elite business jet. CPI Aero has manufactured engine inlet assemblies for the original HondaJet aircraft since 2011. We have received approximately $36.5 million in orders on this program through December 2018. We estimate the potential value of this program to be approximately $70 million.
 Sikorsky S-92® Helicopter The Sikorsky S-92® performs search and rescue missions, heads of state missions, and a variety of transport missions for offshore oil and gas crews, utility, and airline passengers. Sikorsky has delivered more than 275 Sikorsky S-92® helicopters since 2004. In June 2017, CPI Aero announced a follow-on contract with Sikorsky to provide 15 different deliverable items for the Sikorsky S-92®, including door assemblies, cover assemblies, and various installation kits used by Sikorsky to complete the final assembly of the Sikorsky S-92®.
 Embraer Phenom 300 In May 2012, Embraer awarded us a contract to manufacture engine inlets for the Embraer Phenom 300. We have received approximately $34 million in orders on this program through June 2018. We estimate the potential value of the program to be in excess of $40 million.
 Embraer E175-E2 The E-Jet E2 family of aircraft was launched by Embraer in 2013 and included three new airplanes, the E175-E2, the E190-E2, and the E195-E2. We were selected by Embraer to supply various structural components used in the manufacture of engine pylon fairings for the Embraer E175-E2 aircraft, valued at approximately $16 million. The Embraer E175-E2 is scheduled for entry into service in 2021.
Sales and Marketing
 
We are recognized within the aerospace industry as a Tier 1 or Tier 2 supplier to major aircraft suppliers. Additionally, we may bid for military contracts set aside specifically for small businesses.
 
We are awarded contracts for our products and services through the process of competitive bidding. This process begins when we first learn, formally or otherwise, of a potential contract from a prospective customer and concludes after all negotiations are completed upon award. When preparing our response to a prospective customer for a potential contract, we evaluate the contract requirements and determine and outline the services and products we can provide to fulfill the contract at a competitive price. Each contract also benefits from various additional services that we offer, including program management, engineering, and global supply chain program management, which streamlines the vendor management and procurement process and monitors the progress, timing, and quality of component delivery.
 
Our average sales cycle, which generally commences at the time a prospective customer issues a request for proposal and ends upon delivery of the final product to the customer, varies widely.
 
Because of the complexities inherent in the aerospace industry, the time from the initial request for proposal to award ranges from as little as a few weeks to several years. Additionally, our contracts have ranged from six months to as long as ten years. Also, repeat and follow-on jobs for current contracts frequently provide additional opportunities with minimal start-up costs and rapid rates to production.
 
The Market
 
We have positioned our Company to take advantage of opportunities in the military aerospace market but to a broad customer base thereby reducing the impact of direct government contracting limitations. Our success as a subcontractor to defense prime contractors has provided us with opportunities to act as a subcontractor to prime contractors in the production of commercial aircraft structures, which also reduced our exposure to government spending decisions.
 
 5

 

Over time, our Company has expanded both in size and capabilities, with growth in our operational and global supply chain program management. These expansions have allowed us the ability to supply more complex aerostructure assemblies and aerosystems and structures in support of our government-based programs as well as to pursue opportunities within the commercial and business jet markets. Our capabilities have also allowed us to acquire MRO and kitting contracts.
 
Approximately $4.3 million and $3.1 million of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, was from customers outside the U.S. All other revenue for each of the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 has been attributable to customers within the U.S. We have no assets outside the U.S. Government-based contracts that are subject to national defense budget and procurement funding decisions which, accordingly, drives demand for our business in that market. Government spending and budgeting for procurement, operations and maintenance are affected not only by military action, but also by the related fiscal consequences of these actions, as well as the political process.
 
Backlog
 
We produce custom assemblies pursuant to long-term contracts and customer purchase orders. Backlog consists of aggregate values under such contracts and purchase orders, excluding the portion previously included in operating revenues on the basis of cost-to-cost input method accounting, and including estimates of future contract price escalation. Substantially all of our backlog is subject to termination at will and rescheduling, without significant penalty. Funds are often appropriated for programs or contracts on a yearly or quarterly basis, even though the contract may call for performance that is expected to take a number of years. Therefore, our funded backlog does not include the full value of our contracts. Our total backlog as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 was as follows:

Backlog(Total) | December 31, 2018 | | December 31, 2017 | 
---------------+-----------------------+-------------+-----------------------+--
Funded | $ | 94,474,000 | | $ | 71,059,000 
Unfunded | | 362,906,000 | | | 317,667,000
Total | $ | 457,380,000 | | $ | 388,726,000

 
Approximately 80% of the total amount of our backlog at December 31, 2018 was attributable to government contracts. Our backlog attributable to government contracts at December 31, 2018 and 2017 was as follows:
 

Backlog(Government) | December 31, 2018 | | December 31, 2017 | 
--------------------+-------------------+-------------+-------------------+--
Funded | $ | 80,812,000 | | $ | 58,919,000 
Unfunded | | 305,582,000 | | | 242,367,000
Total | $ | 386,394,000 | | $ | 301,286,000

 
Our backlog attributable to commercial contracts at December 31, 2018 and 2017 was as follows:
 

Backlog(Commercial) | December 31, 2018 | | December 31, 2017 | 
--------------------+-------------------+------------+-------------------+--
Funded | $ | 13,662,000 | | $ | 12,140,000
Unfunded | | 57,324,000 | | | 75,300,000
Total | $ | 70,986,000 | | $ | 87,440,000

 
Our unfunded backlog is primarily comprised of the long-term contracts that we received from Spirit and NGC during 2008, Honda and Bell during 2011, Cessna, Sikorsky and Embraer during 2012 and Raytheon during 2016. These long-term contracts are expected to have yearly orders which will be funded in the future.
 
Approximately 81% of the funded backlog at December 31, 2018 is expected to be recognized as revenue during 2019.
 
Material and Parts
 
We subcontract production of substantially all parts incorporated into our products to third-party manufacturers under firm fixed price orders. Our decision to purchase certain components generally is based upon whether the components are available to meet required specifications at a cost and with a delivery schedule consistent with customer requirements. From time to time, we are required to purchase custom made parts from sole suppliers and manufacturers in order to meet specific customer requirements.
 
 6

 

We obtain our raw materials from several commercial sources. Although certain items are only available from limited sources of supply, we believe that the loss of any single supplier would not have a material adverse effect on our business.
 
Competition
 
We face competition in our role as both a prime contractor to the U.S. Government and as a Tier 1 or Tier 2 subcontractor to military and commercial aircraft manufacturers. For certain unrestricted contracts for the U.S. Government, we may compete against well-established prime contractors, including NGC, Lockheed and Boeing. All of these competitors possess significantly larger infrastructures, greater resources and the capabilities to respond to much larger contracts. We believe that our competitive advantage lies in our ability to offer large contractor capabilities with the flexibility and responsiveness of a small company, while staying competitive in cost and delivering superior quality products. While larger prime contractors compete for significant modification awards, they generally do not compete for awards in smaller modifications, spares and replacement parts, even for aircraft for which they are the original manufacturer. In certain instances, the large prime contractors often subcontract much of the work they win to their Tier 1 suppliers so we also may act as a subcontractor to some of these major prime contractors. Further, in some cases, these companies are not permitted to bid, for example when the U.S. Government designates a contract as a Small Business Set-Aside. In these restricted contracts for the U.S. Government, CPI Aero typically competes against numerous small business competitors. We believe we compete effectively against the smaller competitors because smaller competitors generally do not have the expertise we have in responding to requests for proposals for government contracts, nor will they typically have the more than 35 years of past performance in conducting more than 2000 contracts for the U.S. Government.
 
We also compete at the Tier 1 and Tier 2 levels for work for major subcontracts with OEMs in both the military and commercial markets. We often compete against much larger Tier 1 suppliers, such as Triumph Group, Spirit AeroSystems, Kaman Aerospace, GKN, Ducommun, LMI Aerospace, and Precision Castparts Corp. We believe that we can compete effectively with these larger companies by delivering products with the same level of quality and performance at a better value for our customer.
 
Government Regulation
 
Environmental Regulation
 
We are subject to regulations administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration, various state agencies and county and local authorities acting in cooperation with federal and state authorities. Among other things, these regulatory bodies impose restrictions to control air, soil and water pollution, to protect against occupational exposure to chemicals, including health and safety risks, and to require notification or reporting of the storage, use and release of certain hazardous chemicals and substances. The extensive regulatory framework imposes compliance burdens and risks on us. Governmental authorities have the power to enforce compliance with these regulations and to obtain injunctions or impose civil and criminal fines in the case of violations.
 
The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (“CERCLA”) imposes strict, joint and several liability on the present and former owners and operators of facilities that release hazardous substances into the environment. The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (“RCRA”) regulates the generation, transportation, treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous waste. In New York State, the handling, storage and disposal of hazardous substances are governed by the Environmental Conservation Law, which contains the New York counterparts of CERCLA and RCRA. In addition, the Occupational Safety and Health Act, which requires employers to provide a place of employment that is free from recognized and preventable hazards that are likely to cause serious physical harm to employees, obligates employers to provide notice to employees regarding the presence of hazardous chemicals and to train employees in the use of such substances.
 
Our operations require the use of a limited amount of chemicals and other materials for painting and cleaning, including solvents and thinners, which are classified under applicable laws as hazardous chemicals and substances. We have obtained a permit from the Town of Islip, New York, Building Division in order to maintain a paint booth containing flammable liquids.
 
Federal Aviation Administration Regulation
 
We are subject to regulation by the Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”) under the provisions of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as amended. The FAA prescribes standards and licensing requirements for aircraft and aircraft components. We are subject to inspections by the FAA and may be subjected to fines and other penalties (including orders to cease production) for noncompliance with FAA regulations. Our failure to comply with applicable regulations could result in the termination of or our disqualification from some of our contracts, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations.

Government Contract Compliance
 
Our government contracts and sub-contracts are subject to the procurement rules and regulations of the U.S. Government. Many of the contract terms are dictated by these rules and regulations. Specifically, cost-based pricing is determined under the Federal Acquisition Regulation (“FAR”), which provide guidance on the types of costs that are allowable in establishing prices for goods and services under U.S. Government contracts. For example, costs such as those related to charitable contributions, advertising, interest expense, and public relations are unallowable, and therefore not recoverable through sales. During and after the fulfillment of a government contract, we may be audited in respect of the direct and allocated indirect costs attributed thereto. These audits may result in adjustments to our contract costs. Additionally, we may be subject to U.S. Government inquiries and investigations because of our participation in government procurement. Any inquiry or investigation can result in fines or limitations on our ability to continue to bid for government contracts and fulfill existing contracts. We believe that we are in compliance with all federal, state and local laws and regulations governing our operations and have obtained all material licenses and permits required for the operation of our business.
 
The U.S. Government generally has the ability to terminate our contracts, in whole or in part, without prior notice, for convenience or for default based on performance. If a U.S. Government contract were to be terminated for convenience, we generally would be protected by provisions covering reimbursement for costs incurred on the contract and profit on those costs, but not the anticipated profit that would have been earned had the contract been completed. In the unusual circumstance where a U.S. Government contract does not have such termination protection, we attempt to mitigate the termination risk through other means. Termination resulting from our default may expose us to liability and could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete for other contracts. The U.S. Government also has the ability to stop work under a contract for a limited period of time for its convenience. In the event of a stop work order, we generally would be protected by provisions covering reimbursement for costs incurred on the contract to date and for costs associated with the temporary stoppage of work on the contract. However, such temporary stoppages and delays could introduce inefficiencies for which we may not be able to negotiate full recovery from the U.S. Government, and could ultimately result in termination for convenience or reduced future orders on certain contracts. Additionally, we may be required to continue to perform for some period of time on certain of our U.S. Government contracts, even if the U.S. Government is unable to make timely payments.
 
Insurance
 
We maintain a $2 million general liability insurance policy, a $100 million products liability insurance policy and a $5 million umbrella liability insurance policy. Additionally, we maintain a $10 million director and officers’ insurance policy. We believe this coverage is adequate for the types of products presently marketed because of the strict inspection standards imposed on us by our customers before they take possession of our products. Additionally, the FAR generally provides that we will not be held liable for any loss of or damage to property of the U.S. Government that occurs after the U.S. Government accepts delivery of our products and that results from any defects or deficiencies in our products unless the liability results from willful misconduct or lack of good faith on the part of our managerial personnel.
Proprietary Information
 
None of our current assembly processes or products is protected by patents. We rely on proprietary know-how and information and employ various methods to protect the processes, concepts, ideas and documentation associated with our products. These methods, however, may not afford complete protection and there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop such processes, concepts, ideas and documentation.
 
CPI Aero® is a registered trademark of the Company.
 
Employees
 
As of March 28, 2019, we had 281 full-time employees. We employ temporary personnel with specialized disciplines on an as-needed basis. None of our employees are members of a union. We believe that our relations with our employees are good.
