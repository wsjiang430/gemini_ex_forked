General Overview
 
The Company, then known as Robotech Inc., entered into negotiations with Zhen Ding Resources Inc., a Nevada entity (“Zhen Ding NV”). Zhen Ding NV indirectly owns 70% of a Chinese Joint Venture entity, Zhen Ding Mining Co. Ltd. (“Zhen Ding JV” or “JXZD”) through a 100% owned subsidiary in California, Zhen Ding Corporation (“Z&W CA”). During 2012 and 2013, total issued and outstanding common stock of Zhen Ding NV were tendered to our Company. On October 28, 2013, our Company dissolved Zhen Ding NV by merging it into our Company and we changed our name from Robotech Inc. to Zhen Ding Resources Inc.
 
Our Company, now through Zhen Ding NV’s wholly owned subsidiary, Z&W CA, participates in a joint venture with Jing Xian Xinzhou Gold Co., Ltd. (“Xinzhou Gold”), a company organized under the laws of the People’s Republic of China (“PRC”). The joint venture company JXZD is 70% held by our Company through Z&W CA who has the mineral exploration, mineral mining and gold mining rights to a property located in the southwestern part of Anhui province in China, near the town of Jing Xian. Xinzhou Gold, the other 30% partner of JXZD is the actual named owner of the various licenses used by JXZD and transferred all rights emanating from these licenses as part of the joint venture agreement between Z&W CA and Xinzhou Gold.
 
Our Company’s primary activity, through JXZD, is ore processing and production in China. We are engaged in seeking business partnership opportunities with companies that are in the field of exploration and extraction of precious and/or base metals, primarily in China, which are in need of funding and improved management.  We seek to provide the necessary management expertise and assist in financing efforts of these mining operations.  In exchange, we seek to acquire metal ores produced by these mines and process the ores in our ore milling plant and sell the ore concentrates to metal refineries.  Our only operating company is Zhen Ding Mining Co. Ltd., which engages in the processing of metal ore and the selling of ore concentrates of gold, silver, lead, zinc and copper at purity levels ranging from 65% to 80%. Zhen Ding Mining Co. Ltd. purchases metal ore in rock form from its joint venture partner Jing Xian Xinzhou Gold Co., Ltd, which has rights to explore and mine ore from a property located in the southwestern part of Anhui province in China.

At the beginning of fiscal 2015, we idled our mineral processing plant due to an overall downturn in the demand and market prices for our concentrates. At the beginning of fiscal 2017, we shut down the mineral processing plant in China due to insufficient working capital. Our principal office is located at 353 St. Nicolas, Suite 205, Montreal, Quebec H2Y 2P1.   Our operational offices are located at:  Zhen Ding Mining Co. Ltd., Wuxi County, Town of Langqiao, Jing Xian, Anhui Province, China, Tel: 86-6270-9018.
 
The following illustrates our corporate and share ownership structure:
 


Our Current Business
 

Current Operations
 
Presently, we conduct our operations exclusively through Zhen Ding JV, our joint venture company. However, we continue to look for other attractive potential acquisition targets in the mining industry.
 
Our joint venture, Zhen Ding JV, is equipped to process ore mined by our joint venture partner Xinzhou Gold when in operation.  Zhen Ding JV purchases the ore in rock form from Xinzhou Gold and processes the ore into our final product, which is a gold, silver, lead, zinc and copper ore concentrate. We estimate that our processed product is 65% to 80% pure. The product is then sold to refineries which further purify and separate the concentrate.  Zhen Ding JV also arranges all exploration, mining process and operations, and financial and administrative support for Xinzhou Gold’s mine, known as the Wuxi Gold Mine.

We purchase all of our raw material from Xinzhou Gold for our ore processing operation and rely solely on Xinzhou Gold for our supply of ores. The veins most recently excavated by Xinzhou Gold in the permitted areas of our mines are very low grade and, as such, the production is minimal. The higher yielding and therefore more profitable veins run outside Xinzhou Gold’s permitted mining area boundaries under its current license. Xinzhou Gold applied for an extension of the permitted mining area, however, the application was rejected by the government in December 2016 due to Xinzhou Gold’s insufficient working capital. Xinzhou Gold intends to reapply for an extension of the permitted mining area when it is able to demonstrate sufficient working capital to drill the extended area. However, if sufficient working capital is unavailable, or should the application be denied on other grounds, we would not be able to secure another source with higher grade ores for our processing plant, which would severely limit our ability to execute our plan of operation and our potential profitability.
 
At the beginning of fiscal 2015, we idled our mineral processing plant due to an overall downturn in the demand and market prices for our concentrates. This downturn coincided with an overall economic recession in China and downturn in the global commodities market during fiscal 2015 through 2016.
 
Summary of the 12 Months Ended December 31, 2018
 
During the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, we actively sought an investment of approximately $3,000,000, which we believe is required to expand Xinzhou Gold’s mining permit, and which would allow us to resume our ore extraction and refinery activities. However, as at the date of this report we have not successfully secured any financing commitment.
 
On May 9, 2018, De Gang Wei resigned as Chairman, Chief Financial Officer and Director of the Company and Zhou Zhi Bin resigned as a director of the Company.  The resignations did not result from any disagreement with our company regarding our operations, policies, practices or otherwise.
 
Due to our continued inability to raise sufficient financing to expand Xinzhou Gold’s mining permit, Xinzhou Gold elected to reapply for a new drilling permit based on a scaled-down drilling plan. The resulting new permit application, which was submitted to the Anhui Province Land & Resources Bureau for approval on March 8, 2017, seeks renewed permission to continue drilling in the areas directly adjacent to our concentration plant.
 
We intend to resume selling processed ore concentrate as soon as possible in order to supply Zhen Ding JV with the cash flow needed to keep its plant running and to maintain a viable work force for future expansion. However, we are not able to predict at this time when economic conditions will allow us to resume our ore refinery operation.
 
As at the date of this report, Xinzhou Gold and we continue to seek investment of approximately $3,000,000, which would allow Xinzhou Gold to resume drilling under its anticipated permit, and allow us to resume refinery activities. In anticipation of financing and permit approval, our joint venture engaged contractors during the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 to conduct safety inspections and repairs, and to plan anticipated drilling locations. We also engaged Mr. Dai Honglin as Chief Engineer and general manager of Xinzhou Gold’s and our gold mining operations.
 
Mr. Dai brings over thirty years’ experience to our company in the evaluation, development and exploration of gold, copper, zinc, and lithium projects throughout China and South Africa. He completed training in mineral exploration at the Heilongjiang Institute of Mines in 1983. Mr. Dai also currently holds the position of the chairman of Beijing Hongbang Pile Geotechnical Engineering Co., Ltd.
 
Going forward, we will continue to seek sufficient financing to re-establish our mineral extraction and refining operations. We will also seek to identify and evaluation businesses opportunities and other strategic transactions on an ongoing basis with a view toward diversifying our business and optimizing shareholder value.

Competition
 
The mining industry is intensely competitive. We compete with numerous individuals and companies, including many major mining companies, which have substantially greater technical, financial and operational resources and staffs. Accordingly, there is a high degree of competition for access to funds. There are other competitors that have operations in the area and the presence of these competitors could adversely affect our ability to compete for financing and obtain the service providers, staff or equipment necessary for the exploration and exploitation of our properties.
Compliance with Government Regulation
 
The following summary discusses all regulations that materially affect the business of our Company.
 
Chinese Regulations Affecting Our Company
 
Environmental Regulations
 
We are subject to a variety of governmental regulations related to environmental protection. The major PRC environmental regulations applicable to us include the Environmental Protection Law and the Environmental Impact Appraisal Law.
 
The Environmental Protection Law sets out the legal framework for environmental protection in the PRC. The Ministry of Environmental Protection (“MEP”) of the PRC is primarily responsible for the supervision and administration of environmental protection work nationwide and formulating national waste discharge limits and standards. Local environmental protection authorities at the county level and above are responsible for the environmental protection in their jurisdictions.
 
Companies that discharge contaminants must report and register with the MEP or the relevant local environment protection authorities. Companies discharging contaminants in excess of the discharge limits prescribed by the central or local authorities must pay discharge fees for the excess in accordance with applicable regulations, and are also responsible for the treatment of the excessive discharge. Government authorities can impose different penalties on individuals or companies in violation of the Environmental Protection Law, depending on the individual circumstances of each case and the extent of contamination. Such penalties include warnings, fines, impositions of deadlines for remedying the contamination, orders to stop production or use, orders to re-install contamination prevention and treatment facilities which have been removed without permission or left unused, administrative actions against relevant responsible persons or companies, or orders to close down those enterprises. Where the violation is serious, the persons or companies responsible for the violation may be required to pay damages to victims of the contamination. Where serious environmental contamination occurs in violation of the provisions of the Environmental Protection Law which results in serious loss of public and private property, persons or enterprises directly responsible for such contamination may be held criminally liable.
 
Restriction on Foreign Ownership
 
The principal regulation governing foreign ownership of our business in the PRC is the Foreign Investment Industrial Guidance Catalogue, effective as of April 10, 2015 (the “Catalogue”). Investment activities in the PRC by foreign investors are principally governed by the Catalogue, which was promulgated and is amended from time to time by the Ministry of Commerce and the National Development and Reform Commission (“NDRC”). The Catalogue divides industries into three categories: encouraged, restricted and prohibited. Industries not listed in the Catalogue are generally deemed as constituting a fourth “permitted” category and open to foreign investment unless specifically restricted by other PRC regulations.  Our Company, in consultation with its PRC legal advisor, the Guizhou Zhonggong Law Office, has determined that the business of Zhen Ding JV, ore processing, is not listed in the Catalogue or otherwise restricted by other PRC regulations.  As a result, our business is deemed to be a “permitted” industry.  This status has effectively been confirmed by the PRC State Administration for Industry and Commerce (“SAIC”), which has issued a business license for Zhen Ding JV, as a foreign invested joint venture, to engage in ore milling activities.

The NDRC and MOFCOM periodically jointly revise the Catalogue. As such, there is a possibility that our company’s business may fall outside the scope of the definition of a permitted industry in the future. Should this occur, we would face a limit or restriction on foreign investment, the likes of which we are currently not subject to.  However, based on our observation of past practices of the Chinese government, any new guidelines or changes to foreign ownership restrictions will likely be applied prospectively, and companies such as our Company with existing foreign investments are unlikely to be affected by such changes. Also, we are not aware of any reason why ore processing would in the future be considered a sensitive industry justifying its inclusion in the restricted or prohibited categories.
 
Draft Law on Foreign Investment
 
In January 2015, MOFCOM issued a draft Law on Foreign Investment which is expected to be finalized in the near future without major changes.  The draft Law on Foreign Investment would liberalize foreign investment in PRC businesses by reducing or eliminating the need for administrative approvals of the form of such investments, provided such investments do not involve investment in a restricted or prohibited industry.  Because our Company is engaged in a permitted industry, and after consultation with our PRC counsel, we do not expect any adverse consequences resulting from the final passage of the Law on Foreign Investment.
Regulation of Foreign Currency Exchange and Dividend Distribution
 
Foreign Currency Exchange
 
The principal regulations governing foreign currency exchange in China are the Foreign Exchange Administration Regulations (1996), as amended, and the Administration Rules of the Settlement, Sale and Payment of Foreign Exchange (1996). Under these regulations, Renminbi are freely convertible for current account items, including the distribution of dividends, interest payments, trade and service-related foreign exchange transactions, but not for most capital account items, such as direct investment, loan, repatriation of investment and investment in securities outside China, unless the prior approval of SAFE or its local counterparts is obtained. In addition, any loans to an operating subsidiary in China that is a foreign invested enterprise, cannot, in the aggregate, exceed the difference between its respective approved total investment amount and its respective approved registered capital amount. Furthermore, any foreign loan must be registered with SAFE or its local counterparts for the loan to be effective. Any increase in the amount of the total investment and registered capital must be approved by MOFCOM or its local counterpart. We may not be able to obtain these government approvals or registrations on a timely basis, if at all, which could result in a delay in the process of making these loans.
 
The dividends paid by the subsidiary to its shareholder are deemed shareholder income and are taxable in China. Pursuant to the Administration Rules of the Settlement, Sale and Payment of Foreign Exchange (1996), foreign-invested enterprises in China may purchase or remit foreign exchange, subject to a cap approved by SAFE, for settlement of current account transactions without the approval of SAFE. Foreign exchange transactions under the capital account are still subject to limitations and require approvals from, or registration with, SAFE and other relevant PRC governmental authorities.
 
Dividend Distribution
 
The principal regulations governing the distribution of dividends by foreign holding companies include the Wholly Foreign Owned Enterprise Law (1986), as amended, and the Administrative Rules under the Wholly Foreign Owned Enterprise Law (1990), as amended.
 
Under these regulations, WFOEs in China may pay dividends only out of their retained profits, if any, determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. In addition, WFOEs in China are required to allocate at least 10% of their respective retained profits each year, if any, to fund certain reserve funds unless these reserves have reached 50% of the registered capital of the enterprises. These reserves are not distributable as cash dividends.

M&A Regulations and Overseas Listings
 
On August 8, 2006, six PRC regulatory agencies, including the Ministry of Commerce, the State Assets Supervision and Administration Commission, the State Administration for Taxation, the State Administration for Industry and Commerce, CSRC and SAFE, jointly issued the Regulations on Mergers and Acquisitions of Domestic Enterprises by Foreign Investors, or the M&A Rules, which became effective on September 8, 2006 and were amended in 2009. This M&A Rules, among other things, include provisions that purport to require that an offshore special purpose vehicle formed for purposes of overseas listing of equity interests in PRC companies and controlled directly or indirectly by PRC companies or individuals obtain the approval of CSRC prior to the listing and trading of such special purpose vehicle’s securities on an overseas stock exchange.
 
On September 21, 2006, CSRC published on its official website procedures regarding its approval of overseas listings by special purpose vehicles. The CSRC approval procedures require the filing of a number of documents with the CSRC and it would take several months to complete the approval process. The application of this new PRC regulation remains unclear with no consensus currently existing among leading PRC law firms regarding the scope of the applicability of the CSRC approval requirement.
 
Our company is not an offshore special purpose vehicle under current PRC laws and regulations, as we currently control our Chinese operating entity through a joint venture arrangement which is permitted under Chinese regulations regarding foreign ownership. As a result, we are not required to obtain the approval of CSRC prior to the listing and trading of our securities on an overseas stock exchange.
 
Our company, in consultation with our PRC legal advisor, the Guizhou Zhonggong Law Office, has determined that we are not required to obtain PRC approvals and registrations in connection with the CSRC, SAFE, and SAIC for our joint venture arrangement under PRC regulations regarding foreign ownership, and that our company is not an offshore special purpose vehicle under PRC regulations.
 
This is the case because Zhen Ding JV was established as a joint venture enterprise in 2005 with the approval of the relevant PRC government agencies, with 70% of the joint venture owned by Zhen Ding CA, a California entity with foreign ownership, and 30% of the joint venture owned by Xinzhou Gold, a domestic PRC company.  In connection with the formation of Zhen Ding JV, the Anhui Provincial People’s Government issued a Certificate of Approval for Foreign Investment in China in 2005 and a business license was subsequently issued by the SAIC for the period from 2005 to 2025.  In connection with the formation of Zhen Ding JV, Zhen Ding CA did not acquire any existing PRC domestic company or equity or assets, but rather established a new joint venture entity with foreign and domestic partners with funds contributed by Zhen Ding CA (70%) and Xinzhou Gold (30%).  Zhen Ding CA did not acquire an interest in Xinzhou Gold, but rather established a new joint venture company with Xinzhou Gold as the other partner.  Hence there was no acquisition of a PRC domestic company or assets that would implicate the relevant rules on foreign ownership.
 
The M&A Rules include provisions that purport to require that an offshore special purpose vehicle formed for the purpose of an overseas listing of securities in a PRC company obtain the approval of the CSRC prior to the listing and trading of such special purpose vehicle’s securities on an overseas stock exchange.  However, CSRC approval is not required in the context of the current offering covered by this Registration Statement because when our company acquired Zhen Ding CA, it acquired the previously established foreign ownership in a government approved joint venture and not an interest in a PRC domestic company.  Accordingly, our Company is not an “offshore special purpose vehicle” and the relevant PRC agencies are not concerned with a change of ownership in a foreign owned joint venture partner.
 
Our company’s PRC legal advisor, the Guizhou Zhonggong Law Office, also made inquiries with official representatives of each of the CSRC, SAFE, and SAIC and those official representatives all confirmed that there was no requirement for our company to obtain the approval of or register with such agency.
 
For the foregoing reasons, our company is not required to obtain PRC approvals and registrations in connection with the CSRC, SAFE, and SAIC for its joint venture arrangement under PRC regulations regarding foreign ownership.

Regulations on Offshore Parent Holding Companies’ Direct Investment in and Loans to Their PRC Subsidiaries
 
An offshore company may invest equity in a PRC company, which will become the PRC subsidiary of the offshore holding company after investment. Such equity investment is subject to a series of laws and regulations generally applicable to any foreign-invested enterprise in China, which include the Wholly Foreign Owned Enterprise Law, the Sino-foreign Equity Joint Venture Enterprise Law, the Sino-foreign Contractual Joint Venture Enterprise Law, all as amended from time to time, and their respective implementing rules; the Tentative Provisions on the Foreign Exchange Registration Administration of Foreign-Invested Enterprise; and the Notice on Certain Matters Relating to the Change of Registered Capital of Foreign-Invested Enterprises.
 
Under the aforesaid laws and regulations, the increase of the registered capital of a foreign-invested enterprise is subject to the prior approval by the original approval authority of its establishment. In addition, the increase of registered capital and total investment amount shall both be registered with SAIC and SAFE.
 
Shareholder loans made by offshore parent holding companies to their PRC subsidiaries are regarded as foreign debts in China for regulatory purposes, which are subject to a number of PRC laws and regulations, including the PRC Foreign Exchange Administration Regulations, the Interim Measures on Administration on Foreign Debts, the Tentative Provisions on the Statistics Monitoring of Foreign Debts and its implementation rules, and the Administration Rules on the Settlement, Sale and Payment of Foreign Exchange.
 
Under these regulations, the shareholder loans made by offshore parent holding companies to their PRC subsidiaries shall be registered with SAFE. Furthermore, the total amount of foreign debts that can be borrowed by such PRC subsidiaries, including any shareholder loans, shall not exceed the difference between the total investment amount and the registered capital amount of the PRC subsidiaries, both of which are subject to the governmental approval.
 
U.S. Regulations Affecting Our Company
 
FCPA Policy
 
The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or the FCPA, prohibits companies and individuals subject to FCPA jurisdiction from providing to foreign officials any “corrupt payments” (i.e., bribes, kickbacks, and similar benefits) in order to obtain any unfair advantage with respect to government contracts, regulatory approvals, licenses, and other government actions for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA applies to: (1) “issuers” – U.S. and foreign companies subject to SEC jurisdiction; (2) “domestic concerns” – individuals who are citizens, nationals or residents of the United States and companies with a principal place of business in the United States or organized under U.S. law; and (3) “other persons” – foreign companies or persons who act in the United States to further a corrupt payment. The term “other persons” has been interpreted broadly to include foreign entities that send an email in furtherance of a corrupt act to a U.S. recipient, or that clear a corrupt payment through a U.S. bank. The FCPA requires issuers to maintain accurate books and records that do not misrepresent their payments or expenses. Issuers are also liable for the accuracy of their majority-owned subsidiaries’ books and records and are required to act in good faith to encourage their minority-owned subsidiaries to adopt reasonable internal accounting controls intended to avoid corrupt payments. Issuers, domestic concerns and other persons may be liable for the actions of their foreign subsidiaries and agents if they know or should know that a subsidiary or agent is likely to make a corrupt payment to a foreign official.
 
Issuers, domestic concerns and other persons subject to the FCPA are subject to severe criminal and civil penalties for violations of the FCPA. Entities that make corrupt payments may be fined as much as $2 million per violation, or twice the amount of the benefit sought in return for the payment. Individuals may be fined up to $100,000 and/or imprisoned for up to five years. Issuers who violate the FCPA’s books and records requirements are subject to fines up to $25 million, and individuals can be fined up to $5 million and/or imprisoned for up to 20 years. Companies may not indemnify their officers or employees for FCPA violations.
