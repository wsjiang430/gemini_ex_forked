ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview

We are a leading global investment firm that manages multiple alternative asset classes including private equity, energy, infrastructure, real estate and credit, with strategic partners that manage hedge funds. We aim to generate attractive investment returns for our fund investors by following a patient and disciplined investment approach, employing world-class people, and driving growth and value creation with our portfolio companies. We invest our own capital alongside the capital we manage for fund investors and provide financing solutions and investment opportunities through our capital markets business.
Our business offers a broad range of investment management services to our fund investors and provides capital markets services to our firm, our portfolio companies and third parties. Throughout our history, we have consistently been a leader in the private equity industry, having completed more than 350 private equity investments in portfolio companies with a total transaction value in excess of $600 billion as of December 31, 2018. We have grown our firm by expanding our geographical presence and building businesses in areas such as leveraged credit, alternative credit, hedge funds, capital markets, infrastructure, energy, real estate, growth equity and core investments. Our balance sheet has provided a significant source of capital in the growth and expansion of our business, and has allowed us to further align our interests with those of our fund investors. Building on these efforts and leveraging our industry expertise and intellectual capital have allowed us to capitalize on a broader range of the opportunities we source. Additionally, we have increased our focus on meeting the needs of our existing fund investors and in developing relationships with new investors in our funds.
We seek to work proactively and collaboratively as one-firm across business lines, departments, and geographies, as appropriate, to achieve what we believe are the best results for our funds and the firm. Through our offices around the world, we have a pre-eminent global integrated platform for sourcing transactions, raising capital and carrying out capital markets activities. Our growth has been driven by value that we have created through our operationally focused investment approach, the expansion of our existing businesses, our entry into new lines of business, innovation in the products that we offer investors in our funds, an increased focus on providing tailored solutions to our clients and the integration of capital markets distribution activities.
As a global investment firm, we earn management, monitoring, transaction and incentive fees and carried interest for providing investment management, monitoring and other services to our funds, vehicles, CLOs, managed accounts and portfolio companies, and we generate transaction-specific income from capital markets transactions. We earn additional investment income by investing our own capital alongside that of our fund investors, from other assets on our balance sheet and from the carried interest we receive from our funds and certain of our other investment vehicles. A carried interest entitles the sponsor of a fund to a specified percentage of investment gains that are generated on third-party capital that is invested.
Our investment teams have deep industry knowledge and are supported by a substantial and diversified capital base; an integrated global investment platform; the expertise of operating consultants, senior advisors and other advisors; and a worldwide network of business relationships that provide a significant source of investment opportunities, specialized knowledge during due diligence and substantial resources for creating and realizing value for stakeholders. These teams invest capital, a substantial portion of which is of a long duration and not subject to redemption. As of December 31, 2018, approximately 78% of our fee paying assets under management are not subject to redemption for at least 8 years from inception, providing us with significant flexibility to grow investments and select exit opportunities. We believe that these aspects of our business will help us continue to expand and grow our business and deliver strong investment performance in a variety of economic and financial conditions.
Our Firm
With offices around the world, we have established ourselves as a leading global investment firm. We have multilingual and multicultural investment teams with local market knowledge and significant business, investment, and operational experience in the countries in which we invest. We believe that our global capabilities and "one-firm" philosophy have helped us to raise capital, capture a greater number of investment opportunities, and assist our portfolio companies in their increasing reliance on global markets and sourcing, while enabling us to diversify our operations.
Though our operations span multiple continents and asset classes, our investment professionals are supported by an integrated infrastructure and operate under a common set of principles and business practices that are monitored by a variety of committees. The firm operates with a single culture that rewards investment discipline, creativity, determination and patience 
5

and emphasizes the sharing of information, resources, expertise and best practices across offices and asset classes. When appropriate, we staff transactions across multiple offices and businesses in order to take advantage of the industry-specific expertise of our investment professionals, and we hold regular meetings in which investment professionals throughout our offices share their knowledge and experiences. We believe that the ability to draw on the local cultural fluency of our investment professionals while maintaining a centralized and integrated global infrastructure distinguishes us from other investment firms and has been a substantial contributing factor to our ability to raise funds, invest internationally and expand our businesses.
Since our inception, one of our fundamental philosophies has been to align the interests of the firm and our principals with the interests of our fund investors, portfolio companies and other stakeholders. We achieve this by putting our own capital behind our ideas. As of December 31, 2018, we and our employees and other personnel have approximately $17.1 billion invested in or committed to our own funds and portfolio companies, including $9.1 billion funded from our balance sheet, $5.3 billion of additional commitments from our balance sheet to investment funds, $1.8 billion funded from personal investments and $0.9 billion of additional commitments from personal investments.
Our Business
Our Business Lines
We operate our business in four business lines: (1) Private Markets, (2) Public Markets, (3) Capital Markets, and (4) Principal Activities. Information about our business lines below should be read together with "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.
Private Markets

Through our Private Markets business line, we manage and sponsor a group of private equity funds that invest capital for long-term appreciation, either through controlling ownership of a company or strategic minority positions. In addition to our traditional private equity funds, we sponsor investment funds that invest in growth equity and core equity investments. We also manage and sponsor investment funds that invest capital in real assets, such as infrastructure, energy, and real estate. Our Private Markets business line includes separately managed accounts that invest in multiple strategies, which may include our credit strategies as well as our private equity and real assets strategies. These funds and accounts are managed by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. L.P., an SEC-registered investment adviser. As of December 31, 2018, our Private Markets business line had $103.4 billion of AUM and FPAUM of $66.8 billion, consisting of $44.0 billion in private equity (including growth equity and core investments), $18.4 billion in real assets (including infrastructure, energy, and real estate) and $4.4 billion in other related strategies.

Assets Under Management (1)
($ in billions)


(1) | For the years 2006 through 2008, AUM are presented pro forma for the acquisition of the assets and liabilities of KKR & Co. (Guernsey) L.P. (formerly known as KKR Private Equity Investors, L.P.) ("KPE") on October 1, 2009 (the "KPE Transaction"), and therefore exclude the net asset value of KPE and its former commitments to our investment funds. In 2015, our definition of AUM was amended to include capital commitments for which we are eligible to receive fees or carried interest upon deployment of capital and our pro rata portion of the AUM managed by strategic partners in which we hold a minority ownership interest. AUM for all prior periods have been adjusted to include such changes.

Performance
We take a long-term approach to Private Markets investing and measure the success of our investments over a period of years rather than months. Given the duration of these investments, the firm focuses on realized multiples of invested capital and internal rates of return ("IRRs") when deploying capital in these transactions. We have nearly doubled the value of capital that we have invested in our Private Markets investment funds, turning $97.0 billion of capital into $190.7 billion of value from our inception in 1976 to December 31, 2018.
Amount Invested and Total Value for
Private Markets Investment Funds
As of December 31, 2018
From our inception in 1976 through December 31, 2018, our investment funds with at least 24 months of investment activity generated a cumulative gross IRR of 25.6%, compared to the 11.7% and 8.7% gross IRR achieved by the S&P 500 Index and MSCI World Index, respectively, over the same period, despite the cyclical and sometimes challenging environments in which we have operated. The S&P 500 Index and MSCI World Index are unmanaged indices and such returns assume reinvestment of distributions and do not reflect any fees or expenses. Our past performance, however, may not be representative of performance in any period other than the period discussed above and is not a guarantee of future results. For example, as of March 31, 2009, the date of the lowest aggregate valuation of our private equity funds during the 2008 and 2009 market downturn, the investments in certain of our private equity funds at the time were marked down to 67% of original cost. For additional information regarding impact of market conditions on the value and performance of our investments, see "Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Difficult market and economic conditions can adversely affect our business in many ways, including by reducing the value or performance of the investments that we manage or by reducing the ability of our funds to raise or deploy capital, each of which could negatively impact our net income and cash flow and adversely affect our financial prospects and condition" and "Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Assets We Manage—The historical returns attributable to our funds, including those presented in this report, should not be considered as indicative of the future results of our funds or our balance sheet investments, of our future results or the performance of our common stock."
The tables below present information as of December 31, 2018, relating to the historical performance of certain of our Private Markets investment vehicles since inception, which we believe illustrates the benefits of our investment approach. This data does not reflect additional capital raised since December 31, 2018, or acquisitions or disposals of investments, changes in investment values, or distributions occurring after that date. However, the information presented below is not intended to be representative of any past or future performance for any particular period other than the period presented below. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

(3) | The gross IRR, net IRR and gross multiple of invested capital are calculated for our investment funds that made their first investment at least 24 months prior to December 31, 2018. None of the Americas Fund XII, Real Estate Credit Opportunity Partners, Asian Fund III, Real Estate Partners Americas II, our Core Investment Vehicles, Global Infrastructure Investors III or European Fund V has invested for at least 24 months as of December 31, 2018. We therefore have not calculated gross IRRs, net IRRs and gross multiples of invested capital with respect to those funds.


(4) | An investment is considered realized when it has been disposed of or has otherwise generated disposition proceeds or current income that has been distributed by the relevant fund. In periods prior to the three months ended September 30, 2015, realized proceeds excluded current income such as dividends and interest.


(5) | IRRs measure the aggregate annual compounded returns generated by a fund's investments over a holding period. Net IRRs are calculated after giving effect to the allocation of realized and unrealized carried interest and the payment of any applicable management fees and organizational expenses. Gross IRRs are calculated before giving effect to the allocation of realized and unrealized carried interest and the payment of any applicable management fees and organizational expenses.

The gross multiples of invested capital measure the aggregate value generated by a fund's investments in absolute terms. Each multiple of invested capital is calculated by adding together the total realized and unrealized values of a fund's investments and dividing by the total amount of capital invested by the fund. Such amounts do not give effect to the allocation of realized and unrealized carried interest or the payment of any applicable management fees or organizational expenses.
KKR's Private Markets funds may utilize third-party financing facilities to provide liquidity to such funds. The above net and gross IRRs are calculated from the time capital contributions are due from fund investors to the time fund investors receive a related distribution from the fund, and the use of such financing facilities generally decreases the amount of time that would otherwise be used to calculate IRRs, which tends to increase IRRs when fair value grows over time and decrease IRRs when fair value decreases over time. KKR's Private Markets funds also generally provide in certain circumstances, which vary depending on the relevant fund documents, for a portion of capital returned to investors to be restored to unused commitments as recycled capital. For KKR's Private Markets funds that have a preferred return, we take into account recycled capital in the calculation of IRRs and multiples of invested capital because the calculation of the preferred return includes the effect of recycled capital. For KKR's Private Markets funds that do not have a preferred return, we do not take recycled capital into account in the calculation of IRRs and multiples of invested capital. The inclusion of recycled capital generally causes invested and realized amounts to be higher and IRRs and multiples of invested capital to be lower than had recycled capital not been included. The inclusion of recycled capital would reduce the composite net IRR of all Included Funds by 0.1% and the composite net IRR of all Legacy Funds by 0.5% and would reduce the composite multiple of invested capital of Included Funds by less than 0.1 and the composite multiple of invested capital of Legacy Funds by 0.4.

Private Equity
We are a world leader in private equity, having raised 24 private equity funds (including growth equity), as indicated in the table above, with approximately $107.2 billion of capital commitments through December 31, 2018. We invest in industry-leading franchises and attract world-class management teams. Our investment approach leverages our capital base, sourcing advantage, global network and industry knowledge. It also leverages a sizable team of operating consultants, who work exclusively with our investment professionals and portfolio company management teams and otherwise at our direction, as well as senior advisors and other advisors, many of whom are former chief executive officers and leaders of the business community.
Our traditional private equity investment strategy typically seeks to engage primarily in management buyouts, build-ups, or other investments with a view to acquire a controlling or significant influence. Building upon our four decades of private equity investing experience, we have sourced a number of smaller growth equity investment opportunities, and we expanded our business by launching dedicated growth equity funds. We have a dedicated growth equity fund, launched in 2016, that pursues growth equity investment opportunities in the technology, media and telecommunications ("TMT") sector, primarily in the United States, Canada, Europe and Israel. In 2016, we launched another dedicated growth equity fund to pursue growth equity investment opportunities in the health care sector, primarily in the United States. As of December 31, 2018, we have received $2.0 billion of capital commitments to our TMT and health care growth equity strategies.
We further expanded on our private equity business by making our first core investment in 2017. Through our core investments strategy, we target investments that have a longer holding period and a lower risk profile, which may not be suitable for our traditional private equity funds. See "—Core Investments Strategy."

Portfolio
The following chart presents information concerning the amount of capital invested by traditional private equity funds and growth equity funds by geography through December 31, 2018. We believe that this data illustrates the benefits of our business approach and our ability to source and invest in deals in multiple geographies. 
As of December 31, 2018, our traditional private equity portfolio consisted of 114 companies with approximately $123 billion of annual revenues. These companies are headquartered in 18 countries and operate in 19 general industries, which take advantage of our broad and deep industry and operating expertise. Many of these companies are leading franchises with global operations, strong management teams and attractive growth prospects, which we believe will provide benefits through a broad range of business conditions.
Investment Approach
Our approach to making private equity investments focuses on achieving multiples of invested capital and attractive risk-adjusted IRRs by selecting high-quality investments that may be made at attractive prices, applying rigorous standards of due diligence when making investment decisions, implementing strategic and operational changes that drive growth and value creation in acquired businesses, carefully monitoring investments, and making informed decisions when developing investment exit strategies.
We believe that we have achieved a leading position in the private equity industry by applying a disciplined investment approach and by building strong partnerships with highly motivated management teams who put their own capital at risk. When making private equity investments, we seek out strong business franchises, attractive growth prospects, leading market positions and the ability to generate attractive returns. In our private equity funds, we do not effect transactions that are "hostile," meaning a target company's board of directors makes an unfavorable recommendation with respect to the transaction or publicly opposes the consummation of the transaction.
Sourcing and Selecting Investments
We have access to significant opportunities for making private equity investments as a result of our sizable capital base, global platform, and relationships with leading executives from major companies, commercial and investment banks, and other investment and advisory institutions. Members of our global network contact us with new investment opportunities, including a substantial number of exclusive investment opportunities and opportunities that are made available to only a limited number of 
12

other firms. We also proactively pursue business development strategies that are designed to generate deals internally based on the depth of our industry knowledge and our reputation as a leading financial sponsor.
To enhance our ability to identify and consummate private equity investments, we have organized our investment professionals in industry-specific teams. Our industry teams work closely with our operating consultants and other advisors to identify businesses that can be grown and improved. These teams conduct their own primary research, develop a list of industry themes and trends, identify companies and assets in need of operational improvement, and seek out businesses and assets that they believe will benefit from our involvement. They possess a detailed understanding of the economic drivers, opportunities for value creation and strategies that can be designed and implemented to improve companies across the industries in which we invest.
Due Diligence and the Investment Decision
When an investment team determines that an investment proposal is worth consideration, the proposal is formally presented to the applicable regional investment committee and the due diligence process commences if appropriate. The objective of the due diligence process is to identify attractive investment opportunities based on the facts and circumstances surrounding an investment and to prepare a framework that may be used from the date of an acquisition to drive operational improvement and value creation. When conducting due diligence, investment teams evaluate a number of important business, financial, tax, accounting, environmental, social, governance, legal and regulatory issues in order to determine whether an investment is suitable. While the due diligence process differs depending on the type of investment we make, generally, in connection with the private equity due diligence process, investment professionals spend significant amounts of time meeting with a company's management and operating personnel, visiting plants and facilities, and where appropriate, speaking with other stakeholders interested in and impacted by the investment in order to understand the opportunities and risks associated with the proposed investment. Our investment professionals may also use the services of outside accountants, consultants, lawyers, investment banks and industry experts as appropriate to assist them in this process. Investment committees or portfolio managers, as applicable, monitor our due diligence practices and approve an investment before it is made.
Building Successful and Competitive Businesses
Portfolio management committees are responsible for working with our investment professionals from the date on which a private equity investment is made until the time it is exited in order to ensure that strategic and operational objectives are accomplished and that the performance of the investment is closely monitored. When investing in a private equity portfolio company, we partner with management teams to execute on our investment thesis, and we rigorously track performance through regular monitoring of detailed operational and financial metrics as well as appropriate environmental, social and governance issues. We have developed a global network of experienced managers and operating executives who assist the private equity portfolio companies in making operational improvements and achieving growth. We augment these resources with operational guidance from operating consultants at KKR Capstone, senior advisors, other advisors and investment teams, and with "100-Day Plans" that focus the firm's efforts and drive our strategies. We seek to emphasize efficient capital management, top-line growth, R&D spending, geographical expansion, cost optimization and investment for the long-term.
Realizing Investments
We have developed substantial expertise for realizing private equity investments. From our inception through December 31, 2018, the firm has generated approximately $141.7 billion of cash proceeds from the sale of our private equity portfolio companies in initial public offerings and secondary offerings, dividends, and sales to strategic and financial buyers. When exiting private equity investments, our objective is to structure the exit in a manner that optimizes returns for fund investors and, in the case of publicly traded companies, minimizes the impact that the exit has on the trading price of the company's securities. We believe that our ability to successfully realize investments is attributable in part to the strength and discipline of our portfolio management committees and capital markets business, as well as the firm's longstanding relationships with corporate buyers and members of the investment banking and investing communities.
Private Equity Fund Structures
The private equity funds that we sponsor and manage have finite lives and investment periods. Each fund is organized as one or more partnerships, and each partnership is controlled by a general partner. Private equity fund investors are limited partners who agree to contribute a specified amount of capital to the fund from time to time for use in qualifying investments during the investment period, which generally lasts up to six years depending on how quickly capital is deployed. The investment period for certain funds may be terminated upon supermajority vote (based on capital commitment) of the fund's limited partners or by the fund's advisory committee. The term of our private equity funds generally last for 10 to 12 years and may last up to 15 years from the date of the fund's first or last investment, subject to a limited number of extensions with the consent of the limited partners or the applicable advisory committee. Given the length of the investment periods and terms of 
13

our private equity funds and the limited conditions under which such periods can be terminated and commitments may be withdrawn, the AUM of our private equity funds provide a long-term stable capital base.
Each private equity fund's general partner is generally entitled to a carried interest that allocates to it 20% of the net profits realized by the limited partners from the fund's investments. Our private equity funds since 2012 generally have a performance hurdle which requires that we return 7%, compounded annually, to limited partners in the fund prior to receiving our 20% share of net profits realized by limited partners. Such performance hurdles are subject to a catch-up allocation to the general partner after the hurdle has been reached. Our earlier private equity funds do not include a performance hurdle. The timing of receipt of carried interest in respect of investments of our private equity funds is dictated by the terms of the partnership agreements that govern such funds, and is distributed to the general partner of a private equity fund only after all of the following are met: (i) a realization event has occurred (e.g. sale of a portfolio company, dividend, etc.); (ii) the vehicle has achieved positive overall investment returns since its inception, in excess of performance hurdles where applicable; and (iii) with respect to investments with a fair value below cost, cost has been returned to fund investors in an amount sufficient to reduce remaining cost to the investments' fair value. For a fund that has a fair value above cost, overall, but has one or more investments where fair value is below cost, the shortfall between cost and fair value for such investments is referred to as a "netting hole." See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity—Sources of Liquidity" for a discussion of netting holes. Net realized profit or loss is not netted between or among funds except for the Annex Fund. In addition, the agreements governing our private equity funds generally include a "clawback" provision that, if triggered, may give rise to a contingent obligation that may require the general partner to return or contribute amounts to the fund for distribution to fund investors at the end of the life of the fund. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Critical Accounting Policies—Recognition of Carried Interest in the Statement of Operations" and "Risk Factors—The 'clawback' provision in our governing agreements may give rise to a contingent obligation that may require us to return or contribute amounts to our funds and fund investors."
We enter into management agreements with our private equity funds pursuant to which we receive management fees in exchange for providing the funds with management and other services. Gross management fees for our private equity funds generally range from 1% to 2% of committed capital during the fund's investment period and are generally 0.75% to 1.25% of invested capital after the expiration of the fund's investment period with subsequent reductions over time, which causes the fees to be reduced as investments are liquidated. In addition, in connection with the expiration of the investment period, a private equity fund may establish a reserve on its fund investors' capital commitments on which no fee is paid unless such capital is invested. These management fees are paid by private equity fund investors, who generally contribute capital to the fund in order to allow the fund to pay the fees to us. Our private equity funds generally require that management fees be returned to fund investors before a carried interest may be paid.
We also enter into monitoring agreements with our portfolio companies pursuant to which we receive periodic monitoring fees in exchange for providing them with management, consulting and other services, and we typically receive transaction fees for providing portfolio companies with financial, advisory and other services in connection with specific transactions. Monitoring agreements may provide for a termination payment following an initial public offering or change of control, if certain criteria are satisfied. In some cases, we may be entitled to other fees that are paid by an investment target upon closing a transaction or when a potential investment is not consummated. Our newer private equity fund agreements typically require us to share 100% of any monitoring, transaction and other fees that are allocable to a fund (after reduction for expenses incurred allocable to a fund from unconsummated transactions) with fund investors.
In addition, the agreements governing our private equity funds enable investors in those funds to reduce their capital commitments available for further investments, on an investor-by-investor basis, in the event one or more "key persons" (for example, investment professionals who are named as "key executives" for certain geographically or product focused funds) cease to be actively involved in the management of the fund. While these provisions do not allow investors in our funds to withdraw capital that has been invested or cause a fund to terminate, the occurrence of a "key person" event could cause disruption in our business, reduce the amount of capital that we have available for future investments, and make it more challenging to raise additional capital in the future.
Because private equity fund investors typically are unwilling to invest their capital in a fund unless the fund's manager also invests its own capital in the fund's investments, our private equity fund documents generally require the general partners of the funds to make minimum capital commitments to the funds. The amounts of these commitments, which are negotiated by fund investors, generally range from 2% to 8% of a fund's total capital commitments at final closing, but may be greater for certain funds pursuing newer strategies. When investments are made, the general partner contributes capital to the fund based on its fund commitment percentage and acquires a capital interest in the investment that is not subject to a carried interest or management fees.

Real Assets
Energy
Our energy platform aims to deliver current returns to fund investors through distributions generated by producing and selling oil and natural gas reserves and capital appreciation. The goal is to provide fund investors with exposure to commodity prices and optionality associated with future drilling and production. Our energy platform targets real asset investment opportunities across the upstream and midstream segments of the oil and gas industry. We have acquired and operated oil and natural gas properties in mature basins located primarily in the United States. In acquiring these properties, which are typically considered to be non-core by their sellers, we seek to generate value through optimizing production, reducing operating costs, and optimizing commercial and marketing arrangements. In addition, we have completed investments in oil and gas drilling development transactions with operating companies and have also acquired mineral and royalty interests. We work closely with external teams of technical and operational experts to assist in the selection, evaluation and operation of investments. We invest in these energy strategies primarily through KKR's energy funds. As of December 31, 2018, we have received $3.6 billion of capital commitments to our energy funds and $1.0 billion of capital commitments to this strategy through separately managed accounts.
Infrastructure
Our infrastructure platform seeks to achieve returns including current income through the acquisition and operational improvement of assets important to the functioning of the economy. We believe that the global infrastructure market provides an opportunity for the firm's private investment, operational improvement capabilities and stakeholder engagement. Through this platform we have made investments in parking, alternative energy, district heating and contracted electricity generation, water and wastewater, locomotive transportation, midstream and telecommunications infrastructure. As of December 31, 2018, we had received $11.2 billion of capital commitments to our infrastructure funds, which include approximately $7.2 billion of total capital commitments in our new KKR Global Infrastructure Investors III fund, and $1.1 billion of capital commitments to this strategy through separately managed accounts and co-investment vehicles.
Real Estate
Our real estate equity platform targets real estate investment opportunities globally, across United States, Western Europe and Asia-Pacific. Our equity investments include direct investments in real property, debt, special situations transactions and businesses with significant real estate holdings that can benefit from KKR's involvement and operational expertise. We seek to partner with real estate owners, lenders, operators, and developers to provide flexible capital to respond to transaction specific needs, including the outright purchase or financing of existing assets or companies and the funding of future development or acquisition opportunities. Through this strategy, we have made real estate equity investments in residential and commercial assets. We have also established investment platforms with strategic partners to invest in commercial real estate in Germany and the United States. As of December 31, 2018, we have received $3.9 billion of capital commitments through our real estate equity investment funds. 
Our real estate credit platform provides capital solutions for real estate transactions with a focus on commercial mortgage-backed securities, whole loans and subordinated debt. As of December 31, 2018, we managed approximately $2.3 billion of assets in our real estate credit strategy, which include KKR Real Estate Finance Trust Inc. ("KREF"), a NYSE-listed real estate investment trust ("REIT"), and $1.1 billion of capital commitments through our real estate credit fund focused on the risk retention tranches of CMBS transactions. 
Real Asset Investment Process
Our energy, infrastructure and real estate funds have a similar investment process as that described under "—Private Equity." Investment teams for a particular real asset strategy formally present potential investments to the applicable strategy oriented investment committee or the portfolio manager, as applicable, which monitors our due diligence practices and approves an investment before it is made. Most of our real asset strategies also have a portfolio management committee that works with our investment professionals from the date on which an investment is made until the time it is exited in order to ensure that strategic and operational objectives are accomplished and that the performance of the investment is closely monitored. In addition to leveraging the resources of the firm, our energy, infrastructure and real estate investment teams typically partner with technical experts and operators to manage our real asset investments.
15

Real Asset Fund Structures
Our energy, infrastructure and real estate funds generally have investment periods of up to 6 years and generally have a fund term of up to 13 years. Management fees for such funds generally range from 0.75% to 1.5% on committed capital, invested capital or net asset value during the investment period and on invested capital or net asset value for investments thereafter, subject to certain adjustments. These funds generally have performance hurdles of 8% to 10% subject to a catch-up allocation to the general partner after the hurdle has been reached. Thereafter the general partners of such funds generally share in 10% to 20% of net profits realized by limited partners.
Core Investments Strategy
Our core investments strategy targets investments with a longer holding period and a lower risk profile than our traditional private equity or, in certain cases, our real asset investments. The holding periods in core investments are generally longer than 15 years. In 2017, we established core investment vehicles with $6.0 billion of capital commitments from fund investors and a $3.5 billion capital commitment from KKR's balance sheet, through which we aim to make core investments in private equity and real asset opportunities globally. 
Public Markets

Through our Public Markets business line, we operate our combined credit and hedge funds platforms. Our credit business invests capital in (i) leveraged credit strategies, including leveraged loans, high-yield bonds, opportunistic credit and revolving credit strategies, and (ii) alternative credit strategies, including special situations and private credit strategies such as direct lending and private opportunistic credit (or mezzanine) investment strategies. The funds, CLOs, separately managed accounts, investment companies registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "Investment Company Act"), including business development companies ("BDCs"), and alternative investment funds ("AIFs") in our leveraged credit and alternative credit strategies are managed by KKR Credit Advisors (US) LLC, which is an SEC-registered investment adviser and KKR Credit Advisors (Ireland) Unlimited Company, regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland ("CBI"). Our Public Markets business line also includes our hedge funds platform, which consists of strategic partnerships with third-party hedge fund managers in which KKR owns a minority stake (which we refer to as "hedge fund partnerships"). Our hedge fund partnerships offer a variety of investment strategies, including hedge fund-of-funds, equity hedge funds and credit hedge funds. 
We intend to continue to grow the Public Markets business line by leveraging our global investment platform, experienced investment professionals and the ability to adapt our investment strategies to different market conditions to capitalize on investment opportunities that may arise at various levels of the capital structure and across market cycles. 
On April 9, 2018, we completed the transaction (the "FS Investments Transaction") to form FS/KKR Advisor, LLC ("FS/KKR Advisor"), a new strategic BDC partnership with Franklin Square Holdings, L.P. ("FS Investments"), to provide investment advisory services to two BDCs previously advised and sub-advised by KKR Credit Advisors (US) LLC, and four BDCs previously advised by FS Investments. We own a 50% interest in FS/KKR Advisor. In December 2018, one of the BDCs previously advised by KKR Credit Advisors (US) LLC and one of the BDCs previously advised by FS Investments merged to create FS KKR Capital Corp., a BDC listed on the NYSE and advised by FS/KKR Advisor. As of December 31, 2018, our BDC platform had approximately $16.8 billion in combined AUM. We report all of the AUM of the BDCs in our AUM.

The S&P/LSTA Loan Index is a daily tradable index for the U.S. loan market that seeks to mirror the market-weighted performance of the largest institutional loans that meet certain criteria. The S&P/ LSTA BB-B Loan Index is comprised of loans in the S&P/LSTA Loan Index, whose rating is BB+, BB, BB-, B+, B or B-. The BoAML HY Master II Index is an index for high-yield corporate bonds. It is designed to measure the broad high-yield market, including lower-rated securities. The BoAML HY BB-B Constrained is a subset of the BoAML HY Master II Index including all securities rated BB1 through B3, inclusive. The CS Inst West European Leveraged Loan Index contains only institutional loan facilities priced above 90, excluding TL and TLa facilities and loans rated CC, C or are in default. The S&P European Leveraged Loan Index reflects the market-weighted performance of institutional leveraged loan portfolios investing in European credits. While the returns of our leveraged credit strategies reflect the reinvestment of income and dividends, none of the indices presented in the chart above reflect such reinvestment, which has the effect of increasing the reported relative performance of these strategies as compared to the indices. Furthermore, these indices are not subject to management fees, incentive allocations, or expenses.

(3) | The Opportunistic Credit strategy invests in high-yield securities and corporate loans with no preset allocation. The benchmark used for purposes of comparison for the Opportunistic Credit strategy presented herein is based on 50% S&P/LSTA Loan Index and 50% BoAML HY Master II Index. Funds within this strategy may utilize third-party financing facilities to enhance investment returns. In cases where financing facilities are used, the amounts drawn on the facility are deducted from the assets of the fund in the calculation of net asset value, which tends to increase returns when net asset value grows over time and decrease returns when net asset value decreases over time.


(4) | Performance is based on a composite of portfolios that primarily invest in leveraged loans. The benchmark used for purposes of comparison for the Bank Loans strategy is based on the S&P/LSTA Loan Index.


(5) | Performance is based on a composite of portfolios that primarily invest in high-yield securities. The benchmark used for purposes of comparison for the High Yield strategy is based on the BoAML HY Master II Index.


(6) | Performance is based on a composite of portfolios that primarily invest in leveraged loans rated B-/Baa3 or higher. The benchmark used for purposes of comparison for the Bank Loans Conservative strategy is based on the S&P/LSTA BB-B Loan Index.

Our alternative credit strategies primarily invest in more illiquid instruments through private investment funds, BDCs and separately managed accounts. The following table presents information regarding our Public Markets alternative credit commingled funds where investors are subject to capital commitments from inception to December 31, 2018. Some of these funds have been investing for less than 24 months, and thus their performance is less meaningful and not included below. In addition, the information presented below is not intended to be representative of any past or future performance for any particular period other than the period presented below. Past performance is no guarantee of any future result.

(1)    Recycled capital is excluded from the amounts invested and realized.  
(2)    These credit funds utilize third-party financing facilities to provide liquidity to such funds, and in such event IRRs are calculated from the time capital contributions are due from fund investors to the time fund investors receive a related distribution from the fund. The use of such financing facilities generally decreases the amount of invested capital that would otherwise be used to calculate IRRs, which tends to increase IRRs when fair value grows over time and decrease IRRs when fair value decreases over time. IRRs measure the aggregate annual compounded returns generated by a fund's investments over a holding period and are calculated taking into account recycled capital. Net IRRs presented are calculated after giving effect to the allocation of realized and unrealized carried interest and the payment of any applicable management fees.  Gross IRRs are calculated before giving effect to the allocation of carried interest and the payment of any applicable management fees. 
(3) The multiples of invested capital measure the aggregate value generated by a fund's investments in absolute terms. Each multiple of invested capital is calculated by adding together the total realized and unrealized values of a fund's investments and dividing by the total amount of capital invested by the investors. The use of financing facilities generally decreases the amount of invested capital that would otherwise be used to calculate multiples of invested capital, which tends to increase multiples when fair value grows over time and decrease multiples when fair value decreases over time. Such amounts do not give effect to the allocation of any realized and unrealized returns on a fund's investments to the fund's general partner pursuant to a carried interest or the payment of any applicable management fees and are calculated without taking into account recycled capital.

(4) | "Unallocated Commitments" represent unallocated commitments from our strategic investor partnerships.

For additional information regarding impact of market conditions on the value and performance of our investments, see "Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Difficult market and economic conditions can adversely affect our business in many ways, including by reducing the value or performance of the investments that we manage or by reducing the ability of our funds to raise or deploy capital, each of which could negatively impact our net income and cash flow and adversely affect our financial prospects and condition" and "Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Assets We Manage—The historical returns attributable to our funds, including those presented in this report, should not be considered as indicative of the future results of our funds or our balance sheet investments, of our future results or the performance of our common stock."
Investment Approach
Our approach to making investments focuses on creating investment portfolios that seek to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns by selecting investments that may be made at attractive prices, subjecting investments to regular monitoring and oversight, and, for more liquid investments, making buy and sell decisions based on price targets and relative value parameters. The firm employs both "top-down" and "bottom-up" analyses when making investments. Our top-down analysis involves, as appropriate, a macro analysis of relative asset valuations, long-term industry trends, business cycles, regulatory trends, interest rate expectations, credit fundamentals and technical factors to target specific industry sectors and asset classes in which to invest. From a bottom-up perspective, our investment decision is predicated on an investment thesis that is developed using our proprietary resources and knowledge and due diligence.
19

Sourcing and Selecting Investments
We source investment opportunities through a variety of channels, including internal deal generation strategies and the firm's global network of contacts at major companies, corporate executives, commercial and investment banks, financial intermediaries, other private equity sponsors and other investment and advisory institutions. We are also provided with opportunities to invest, in certain strategies where appropriate, in the securities of KKR's private equity portfolio companies, though there are limitations across the platform on the availability and maximum size of such KKR-affiliated investments.
Due Diligence and the Investment Decision
Once a potential investment has been identified, our investment professionals screen the opportunity and make a preliminary determination concerning whether we should proceed with further diligence. When evaluating the suitability of an investment for our funds, we typically employ a relative value framework and subject the investment to due diligence. This review considers many factors including, as appropriate, expected returns, capital structure, credit ratings, historical and projected financial data, the issuer's competitive position, the quality and track record of the issuer's management team, margin stability, and industry and company trends. Investment professionals use the services of outside advisors and industry experts as appropriate to assist them in the due diligence process and, when relevant and permitted, leverage the knowledge and experience of our Private Markets investment professionals. Strategy-specific investment committees monitor our due diligence practices.
Monitoring Investments
We monitor our portfolios of investments using, as applicable, daily, quarterly and annual analyses. Daily analyses include morning market meetings, industry and company pricing runs, industry and company reports and discussions with the firm's Private Markets investment professionals on an as-needed basis. Quarterly analyses include the preparation of quarterly operating results, reconciliations of actual results to projections and updates to financial models (baseline and stress cases). Annual analyses involve conducting internal audits, and testing compliance with monitoring and documentation requirements.
Credit Strategies
Our credit business pursues investments in leveraged credit strategies, such as leveraged loans, high-yield bonds, opportunistic credit and revolving credit strategies, and alternative credit strategies, such as special situations, direct lending and private opportunistic credit (or mezzanine) strategies. We pursue these investments across a range of vehicles, including investment funds and separately managed accounts, for which we receive a fee and in certain cases an incentive fee or carried interest.
We also manage structured credit vehicles in the form of CLOs that hold leveraged loans, high-yield bonds or a combination of both. CLOs are typically structured as special purpose investment vehicles that acquire, monitor and, to varying degrees, manage a pool of credit assets. CLOs generally serve as long-term financing for leveraged credit investments and as a way to reduce refinancing risk, reduce maturity risk and secure a fixed cost of funds over an underlying market interest rate. We typically receive a fee for managing CLOs.
We also serve as the registered investment adviser or sub-adviser to registered investment companies. The management fees we are paid for managing registered investment companies are generally subject to contractual rights that require their board of directors to provide prior notice in order to terminate our investment management services. Following the completion of the transaction to form a strategic BDC partnership with FS Investments in April 2018, FS/KKR Advisor serves as the investment adviser to the BDCs in our BDC platform.    
Leveraged Credit. Our leveraged credit strategies are principally directed at investing in leveraged loans, high-yield bonds or a combination of both. Our opportunistic credit strategy seeks to deploy capital across investment themes that take advantage of credit market dislocations, spanning asset types and liquidity profiles. Our revolving credit strategy invests in senior secured revolving credit facilities. 
Alternative Credit. Our alternative credit strategies consist of special situations and private credit strategies.

• | Special Situations. We seek to make opportunistic investments largely in stressed or distressed companies through our special situations investment strategy. These investments include distressed investments (including post- restructuring equity), control-oriented opportunities, rescue financing (debt or equity investments made to address

20

covenant, maturity or liquidity issues), debtor-in-possession or exit financing, and other event-driven investments in debt or equity. 

• | Private Credit. Our private credit strategies seek to leverage the knowledge and relationships developed in the leveraged credit business. These strategies include direct lending and private opportunistic credit strategies. Through our direct lending strategy, we seek to make investments in proprietarily sourced primarily senior debt financings for middle-market companies. Through our private opportunistic credit strategy, we seek to make investments in directly sourced third-party mezzanine and mezzanine-like transactions and also seek asset-based credit and structured credit opportunities across financial and hard assets. These investments often consist of mezzanine debt, which generates a current yield, coupled with marginal equity exposure with additional upside potential.

Hedge Funds
Our hedge fund platform consists of strategic partnerships with third-party hedge fund managers in which KKR owns a minority stake. This includes a 34.6% interest in Marshall Wace, a global alternative investment manager specializing in long/short equity products, and a 24.9% interest in BlackGold Capital Management L.P. ("BlackGold"), a credit-oriented investment manager focused on energy and hard asset investments. We also own a 39.9% interest in, and are entitled to receive certain other payments from, PAAMCO Prisma Holdings, LLC ("PAAMCO Prisma"), an investment manager focused on liquid alternative investment solutions, including hedge fund-of-fund portfolios. 
On November 14, 2018, we sold all of our 24.6% interest in Nephila Capital Ltd. ("Nephila"), an investment manager focused on investing in natural catastrophe and weather risk, as part of an acquisition of Nephila by a third-party buyer. 
Public Markets AUM and Vehicle Structures
As of December 31, 2018, our Public Markets business line had $91.3 billion of AUM, comprised of $35.5 billion of assets managed in our leveraged credit strategies (which include $2.2 billion of assets managed in our opportunistic credit strategy and $1.8 billion of assets managed in our revolving credit strategy), $6.6 billion of assets managed in our special situations strategy, $22.8 billion of assets managed in our private credit strategies, $25.7 billion of assets managed through our hedge fund platform, and $0.7 billion of assets managed in other strategies. Our private credit strategies include $17.0 billion of assets managed in our direct lending strategy and $5.8 billion of assets managed in our private opportunistic credit (or mezzanine) strategy.

Fundraising and Composition of Fund Investors
We have a Client & Partner Group that is responsible for raising capital for us globally across all products, expanding our client relationships across asset classes and across types of fund investors, developing products to meet our clients' needs, and servicing existing fund investors and products. We also provide fundraising services to certain third-party fund managers in our hedge fund partnerships. As of December 31, 2018, we had over 80 executives and professionals dedicated to our Client & Partner Group.
As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 970 investors in funds across all our strategies, which reflect the addition of 70 investors during the year. On average, a fund investor is invested in approximately two of our products as of December 31, 2018. The following charts detail our investor base by type and geography as of December 31, 2018. 
Fund Investor Base by Type (1) Fund Investor Base by Geography (1)

(1) | Based on the AUM of our Private Markets investment funds, Private Markets co-investment vehicles, and Public Markets separately managed accounts and Public Markets investment funds. These charts exclude general partner commitments, assets managed through CLOs, and assets managed by other asset managers with which KKR has formed strategic partnerships where KKR does not hold more than a 50% ownership interest. Allocations are assigned to a type or geographic region according to subscriptions received from a limited partner. 

Capital Markets

Our Capital Markets business line is comprised of our global capital markets business, which is integrated with KKR’s other business lines, and serves our firm, our portfolio companies and third-party clients by developing and implementing both traditional and non-traditional capital solutions for investments or companies seeking financing. These services include arranging debt and equity financing, placing and underwriting securities offerings, and providing other types of capital markets services that may result in the firm receiving fees, including underwriting, placement, transaction and syndication fees, commissions, underwriting discounts, interest payments and other compensation, which may be payable in cash or securities, in respect of the activities described above.
Our capital markets business underwrites credit facilities and arranges loan syndications and participations. When we are sole arrangers of a credit facility, we may advance amounts to the borrower on behalf of other lenders, subject to repayment. When we underwrite an offering of securities on a firm commitment basis, we commit to buy and sell an issue of securities and generate revenue by purchasing the securities at a discount or for a fee. When we act in an agency capacity or best efforts basis, we generate revenue for arranging financing or placing securities with capital markets investors. We may also provide issuers with capital markets advice on security selection, access to markets, marketing considerations, securities pricing, and other aspects of capital markets transactions in exchange for a fee. Our capital markets business also provides syndication services in 
23

respect of co-investments in transactions participated in by KKR funds or third-party clients, which may entitle the firm to receive syndication fees, management fees and/or a carried interest.
The capital markets business has a global footprint, with local presence and licenses to carry out certain broker-dealer activities in various countries in North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific and the Middle East. Our flagship capital markets subsidiary is KKR Capital Markets LLC, an SEC-registered broker-dealer and a member of the Financial Industry Regulation Authority ("FINRA"). 
Principal Activities

Through our Principal Activities business line, we manage the firm's own assets on our balance sheet and deploy capital to support and grow our business lines. Typically, the funds in our Private Markets and Public Markets business lines contractually require us, as general partner of the funds, to make sizable capital commitments from time to time. We believe making general partner commitments assists us in raising new funds from limited partners by demonstrating our conviction in a given fund's strategy. We also use our balance sheet to acquire investments in order to help establish a track record for fundraising purposes in new strategies. We may also use our own capital to seed investments for new funds, to bridge capital selectively for our funds' investments or finance strategic acquisitions and partnerships, although the financial results of an acquired business or hedge fund partnership may be reported in our other business lines. 
Our Principal Activities business line also provides the required capital to fund the various commitments of our Capital Markets business line when underwriting or syndicating securities, or when providing term loan commitments for transactions involving our portfolio companies and for third parties. Our Principal Activities business line also holds assets that may be utilized to satisfy regulatory requirements for our Capital Markets business line and risk retention requirements for our CLOs. 
We also make opportunistic investments through our Principal Activities business line, which include co-investments alongside our Private Markets and Public Markets funds as well as Principal Activities investments that do not involve our Private Markets or Public Markets funds.
We endeavor to use our balance sheet strategically and opportunistically to generate an attractive risk-adjusted return on equity in a manner that is consistent with our fiduciary duties, in compliance with applicable laws, and consistent with our one-firm approach.
24

The chart below presents the holdings of our Principal Activities business line by asset class as of December 31, 2018.
Holdings by Asset Class (1)

(1) | General partner commitments in our funds are included in the various asset classes shown above. Assets and revenues of other asset managers with which KKR has formed strategic partnerships where KKR does not hold more than 50% ownership interest are not included in our Principal Activities business line but are reported in the financial results of our other business lines. Private Equity includes KKR private equity funds, co-investments alongside such KKR-sponsored private equity funds, certain core equity investments, and other opportunistic investments. Equity investments in other asset classes, such as real estate, special situations and energy appear in these other asset classes. Other Credit consists of certain leveraged credit and specialty finance strategies.

25

Competition
We compete with other investment managers for both fund investors and investment opportunities. The firm's competitors consist primarily of sponsors of public and private investment funds, real estate development companies, BDCs, investment banks, commercial finance companies and operating companies acting as strategic buyers. We believe that competition for fund investors is based primarily on investment performance, investor liquidity and willingness to invest, investor perception of investment managers' drive, focus and alignment of interest, business reputation, duration of relationships, quality of services, pricing, fund terms including fees, and the relative attractiveness of the types of investments that have been or are to be made. We believe that competition for investment opportunities is based primarily on the pricing, terms and structure of a proposed investment and certainty of execution. In addition to these traditional competitors within the global investment management industry, we also face competition from local and regional firms, financial institutions and sovereign wealth funds in the various countries in which we invest. In certain emerging markets, local firms may have more established relationships with the companies in which we are attempting to invest. These competitors often fall into one of the aforementioned categories but in some cases may represent new types of fund investors, including high net worth individuals, family offices and state-sponsored entities.
There are numerous funds focused on private equity, real assets, growth equity, credit and hedge fund strategies that compete for investor capital. Fund managers have also increasingly adopted investment strategies outside of their traditional focus. For example, funds focused on credit and equity strategies have become active in taking control positions in companies, while private equity funds have acquired minority equity or debt positions in publicly listed companies. This convergence could heighten competition for investments. Furthermore, as institutional fund investors increasingly consolidate their relationships for multiple investment products with a few investment firms, competition for capital from such institutional fund investors may become more acute. However, such consolidation may also lead institutional fund investors to prefer more established investment firms, which could help us compete against newer entrants or investment firms that are smaller in size or offer more limited types of investment strategies.
Some of the entities that we compete with as an investment firm may have greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources and more personnel than us and, in the case of some asset classes, longer operating histories, more established relationships or greater experience. Several of our competitors also have raised, or may raise, significant amounts of capital and have investment objectives that are similar to the investment objectives of our funds, which may create additional competition for investment opportunities. Some of these competitors may also have lower costs of capital and access to funding sources that are not available to us, which may create competitive advantages for them. In addition, some of these competitors may have higher risk tolerances, different risk assessments or lower return thresholds, which could allow them to consider a wider range of investments and to bid more aggressively than us for investments. Strategic buyers may also be able to achieve synergistic cost savings or revenue enhancements with respect to a targeted portfolio company, which may provide them with a competitive advantage in bidding for such investments.
Our capital markets business competes primarily with investment banks and independent broker-dealers in North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific and the Middle East. We principally focus our capital markets activities on the firm, our portfolio companies and fund investors, but we also seek to service other third parties. While we generally target customers with whom we have existing relationships, those customers may have similar relationships with the firm's competitors, many of whom will have access to competing securities transactions, greater financial, technical or marketing resources or more established reputations than us. 
Competition is also intense for the attraction and retention of qualified employees and consultants. Our ability to continue to compete effectively in our businesses will depend upon our ability to attract new employees and consultants and retain and motivate our existing employees and consultants.

As part of our effort, we utilize a team of 66 operating consultants at KKR Capstone, who are not KKR employees but work exclusively with our investment professionals and portfolio company management teams or our designees. With professionals in North America, Europe and the Asia-Pacific, KKR Capstone provides additional expertise for assessing investment opportunities and assisting managers of portfolio companies in defining strategic priorities and implementing operational changes. During the initial phases of an investment, KKR Capstone's work seeks to implement our thesis for value creation. These operating consultants may assist portfolio companies in addressing top-line growth, cost optimization and efficient capital allocation and in developing operating and financial metrics. Over time, this work shifts to identifying challenges and taking advantage of business opportunities that arise during the life of an investment. KKR Capstone is consolidated in KKR's financial results for GAAP purposes, but is not a subsidiary or affiliate of KKR.
Senior Advisors and Other Advisors
To complement the expertise of our investment professionals, we have a team of senior advisors and other advisors.

(6) | 40% of the carried interest earned from our investment funds, and, beginning with the quarter ended September 30, 2016, 40% of the management fees that would have been subject to a management fee refund for investment funds that have a preferred return, are allocated to a carry pool, from which carried interest is allocable to our employees and selected other individuals. Beginning with the quarter ended September 30, 2017, 43% of carried interest generated by then-current and future funds is allocated to the carry pool instead of 40% of carried interest. For impacted funds, the incremental 3% replaces the amount of certain management fee refunds that would have been calculated for those funds as performance income compensation. No carried interest has been allocated with respect to co-investments acquired from KPE in the KPE Transaction.

Regulation
Our operations are subject to regulation and supervision in a number of jurisdictions. The level of regulation and supervision to which we are subject varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and is based on the type of business activity involved. We, in conjunction with our outside advisors and counsel, seek to manage our business and operations in compliance with such regulation and supervision. The regulatory and legal requirements that apply to our activities are subject to change from time to time and may become more restrictive, which may make compliance with applicable requirements more difficult or expensive or otherwise restrict our ability to conduct our business activities in the manner in which they are now conducted. Changes in applicable regulatory and legal requirements, including changes in their enforcement, could materially and adversely affect our business and our financial condition and results of operations. As a matter of public policy, the regulatory bodies that regulate our business activities are generally responsible for safeguarding the integrity of the securities and financial markets and protecting fund investors who participate in those markets rather than protecting the interests of our stockholders.
United States
Regulation as an Investment Adviser
We conduct our advisory business through our investment adviser subsidiaries, including Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. L.P. and its wholly-owned subsidiary KKR Credit Advisors (US) LLC, each of which is registered as an investment adviser with the SEC under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the "Investment Advisers Act"). The investment advisers are subject to the anti-fraud provisions of the Investment Advisers Act and to fiduciary duties derived from these provisions, which apply to our relationships with our advisory clients globally, including funds that we manage. These provisions and duties impose restrictions and obligations on us with respect to our dealings with our fund investors and our investments, including for example restrictions on agency cross and principal transactions. Our registered investment advisers are subject to periodic SEC examinations and other requirements under the Investment Advisers Act and related regulations primarily intended to benefit advisory clients. These additional requirements relate, among other things, to maintaining an effective and comprehensive compliance program, record-keeping and reporting requirements and disclosure requirements. The Investment Advisers Act generally grants the SEC broad administrative powers, including the power to limit or restrict an investment adviser from conducting advisory activities in the event it fails to comply with federal securities laws. Additional sanctions that may be imposed for failure to comply with applicable requirements include the prohibition of individuals from associating with an investment adviser, the revocation of registrations and other censures and fines.
KKR Credit Advisors (US) LLC is also subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act as an investment adviser to a registered investment company. The KKR Income Opportunities Fund is a closed-end management investment company registered under the Investment Company Act. The closed-end management investment company and KKR Credit Advisors (US) LLC are subject to the Investment Company Act and the rules thereunder, which among other things regulate the relationship between a registered investment company and its investment adviser and prohibit or restrict principal transactions and joint transactions. 
Regulation as a Broker-Dealer

MCS Capital Markets LLC, one of our subsidiaries, is registered as a broker-dealer with the SEC under the Exchange Act and in 35 U.S. States. As registered broker-dealers, KKR Capital Markets LLC and MCS Capital Markets LLC are subject to periodic SEC and FINRA examinations and reviews. A broker-dealer is subject to legal requirements covering all aspects of its securities business, including sales and trading practices, public and private securities offerings, use and safekeeping of customers' funds and securities, capital structure, record-keeping and retention and the conduct and qualifications of directors, officers, employees and other associated persons. These requirements include the SEC's "uniform net capital rule," which specifies the minimum level of net capital that a broker-dealer must maintain, requires a significant part of the broker-dealer's assets to be kept in relatively liquid form, imposes certain requirements that may have the effect of prohibiting a broker-dealer from distributing or withdrawing its capital and subjects any distributions or withdrawals of capital by a broker-dealer to notice requirements. These and other requirements also include rules that limit a broker-dealer's ratio of subordinated debt to equity in its regulatory capital composition, constrain a broker-dealer's ability to expand its business under certain circumstances and impose additional requirements when the broker-dealer participates in securities offerings of affiliated entities. Violations of these requirements may result in censures, fines, the issuance of cease-and-desist orders, revocation of licenses or registrations, the suspension or expulsion from the securities industry of the broker-dealer or its officers or employees or other similar consequences by regulatory bodies.
