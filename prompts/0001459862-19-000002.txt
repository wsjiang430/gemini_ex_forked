 Item 1. Business 
 The purpose of the Aberdeen Standard Palladium ETF Trust (the “Trust”), formerly known as ETFS Palladium Trust prior to October 1, 2018, is to own palladium transferred to the Trust in exchange for shares issued by the Trust (“Shares”). Each Share represents a fractional undivided beneficial interest in and ownership of the Trust. The assets of the Trust are anticipated to consist solely of palladium bullion. The Trust was formed on December 30, 2009 when an initial deposit of palladium was made in exchange for the issuance of two Baskets (a “Basket” consists of 50,000 Shares). 
 The sponsor of the Trust is Aberdeen Standard Investments ETFs Sponsor LLC (the “Sponsor”), formerly known as ETF Securities USA LLC prior to October 1, 2018. The trustee of the Trust is The Bank of New York Mellon (the “Trustee”) and the custodian is JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A., London Branch (the “Custodian”). 
 The Trust’s Shares at redeemable value decreased from $241,554,950 at December 31, 2017 to $185,465,009 at December 31, 2018, the Trust’s fiscal year end. Outstanding Shares in the Trust decreased from 2,400,000 Shares at December 31, 2017 to 1,550,000 Shares at December 31, 2018. 
 The Trust is not managed like a corporation or an active investment vehicle. The Trust has no directors, officers or employees. It does not engage in any activities designed to obtain a profit from or to improve the losses caused by changes in the price of palladium. The palladium held by the Trust will only be delivered to pay the remuneration due to the Sponsor (the “Sponsor’s Fee”), distributed to Authorized Participants (defined below) in connection with the redemption of Baskets or sold (1) on an as-needed basis to pay Trust expenses not assumed by the Sponsor, (2) in the event the Trust terminates and liquidates its assets, or (3) as otherwise required by law or regulation. 
 The Trust is not registered as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and is not required to register under such act. The Trust does not and will not hold or trade in commodities futures contracts, “commodity interests” or any other instruments regulated by the Commodity Exchange Act (the “CEA”), as administered by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the “CFTC”). The Trust is not a commodity pool for purposes of the CEA and the shares are not “commodity interests”  and neither the Sponsor nor the Trustee is subject to regulation as a commodity pool operator or a commodity trading advisor in connection with the Shares. The Trust has no fixed termination date. 
 The Sponsor of the registrant maintains an Internet website at www.aberdeenstandardetfs.us, through which the registrant’s annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, are made available free of charge as soon as reasonably practicable after they have been filed or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). Additional information regarding the Trust may also be found on the SEC’s EDGAR database at www.sec.gov. 
 Trust Objective 
 The investment objective of the Trust is for the Shares to reflect the performance of the price of palladium bullion, less the expenses of the Trust’s operations. The Shares are intended to constitute a simple and cost-effective means of making an investment similar to an investment in physical palladium. An investment in physical palladium requires expensive and sometimes complicated arrangements in connection with the assay, transportation, warehousing and insurance of the metal. Traditionally, such expense and complications have resulted in investments in physical palladium being efficient only in amounts beyond the reach of many investors. 
 The Shares are intended to provide institutional and retail investors with a simple and cost-efficient means, with minimal credit risk, of gaining investment benefits similar to those of holding palladium bullion. The Shares offer an investment that: 
 •Is Easily Accessible. The Shares trade on the NYSE Arca and provide institutional and retail investors with indirect access to the palladium bullion market. The Shares are bought and sold on the NYSE Arca like any other exchange-listed securities. The close of the NYSE Arca trading session is 4:00 p.m. New York time. 
 •Is Relatively Cost Effective. The Sponsor expects that, for many investors, costs associated with buying and selling the Shares in the secondary market and the payment of the Trust’s ongoing expenses will be lower than the costs associated with buying and selling palladium bullion and storing and insuring palladium bullion in a traditional allocated palladium bullion account. 
 •Has Minimal Credit Risk. The Shares represent an interest in physical bullion owned by the Trust (other than an amount held in unallocated form which is not sufficient to make up a whole plate or ingot or which is held temporarily to effect a creation or redemption of Shares). Physical bullion of the Trust in the Custodian’s possession is not subject to borrowing arrangements with third parties. Other than the palladium temporarily being held in an unallocated palladium account with the Custodian, the physical bullion of the Trust is not subject to counterparty or credit risks. See “Risk Factors—Palladium held in the Trust’s unallocated palladium account and any Authorized Participant’s unallocated palladium account is not segregated from the Custodian’s assets....” This contrasts with most other financial products that gain exposure to bullion through the use of derivatives that are subject to counterparty and credit risks.

 Overview of the Palladium Industry
 Introduction
 This section provides a brief introduction to the palladium industry by looking at some of the key participants, detailing the primary sources of demand and supply.
 In this annual report, the term “ounces” refers to troy ounces.
 Platinum Group Metals
 Platinum and palladium are the two best known metals of the six platinum group metals (“PGMs”). Platinum and palladium have the greatest economic importance and are found in the largest quantities. The other four - iridium, rhodium, ruthenium and osmium - are produced only as co-products of platinum and palladium.  
 PGMs are found primarily in South Africa and Russia. South Africa is the world’s leading platinum producer and one of the largest palladium producers. Russia is the largest producer of palladium and most production is concentrated in the Norilsk region. All of South Africa’s production is sourced from the Bushveld Igneous Complex, which hosts the world’s largest resource of PGMs. Together, South Africa and Russia accounted for 84% of platinum supply in 2017 and 78% of palladium supply in 2017.

  The following are some of the main characteristics of the palladium market illustrated by the table:
 Russia has traditionally been the largest producer of palladium, providing on average 46% of supply over the past 10 years.  However its production has declined and sales of state held stock has dwindled down to zero.  In 2017, Russia provided 40% of mine supplies while South Africa produced 38%.  South Africa has on average supplied over 35% of production over the past 10 years.  North America contributes approximately 13% of mine supply. Autocatalysts are the largest component of palladium demand, representing close to 78% of total demand in 2017. Palladium investment demand remains a very small part of the market with only 53,000 ounces of demand from retail investment in 2017. Jewelry demand for palladium contributed 3% of total demand in 2017, up from 2% in 2016. Other industrial demand (electronics, dentistry and chemical) has fallen from 28% of total demand in 2009 to 21% of total demand in 2017.

 Historical Chart of the Price of Palladium
 The price of palladium is volatile and fluctuations are expected to have a direct impact on the value of the Shares. However, movements in the price of palladium in the past are not a reliable indicator of future movements. The following chart illustrates the movements in the price of an ounce of palladium in U.S. Dollars from December 2008 to December 2018 and is based on information provided by Bloomberg:

 Palladium prices fell sharply during the first phase of the global financial crisis, when prices dropped from $579 per ounce in February 2008 to $173 per ounce in October 2008. Prices then rallied almost five-fold until February 2011 to $841/oz, in line with other precious metals that gained favor as investors sought to diversify their assets away from paper currencies that they felt were being debased. Adding to demand for palladium, a number of countries had car scrappage programs, as part of their expenditure programs to counter the recession and to encourage people to replace their old vehicles with newer more environmentally-friendly ones. The rise in Chinese demand for cars and autocatalysts has also provided support for palladium demand in addition to increasing emission controls. Palladium prices have tempered since 2011, but concerns over supply shortages due to labor problems at mines in South Africa and dwindling Russian stocks have provided some price support since mid-2012. Palladium rose to a 13 year high of $907 per ounce in September 2014, a 27% increase from the start of the year. The rally was driven by supply side concerns following the longest strike in South African mining history and escalating tensions between Russia and Ukraine. The strong rally in 2014 was completely unwound in 2015, when South African mine supply resumed back to pre-strike levels and pessimism about industrial demand in China overwhelmed the true tightness in the market. Palladium was the top performer of the precious metals complex for 3 consecutive years from 2016 to 2018, where it rose nearly 125% from $563 per troy ounce on December 31, 2015 to $1,261.75 per troy ounce on December 31, 2018. Given palladium’s demand is most sensitive to the industrial production cycle palladium may see further support along with industrial metals in anticipation of a rise in US infrastructure spending and recovery in global growth. Expected continued supply deficits, growing demand, and drawdowns in above ground stocks have kept the market balance for palladium favorable.

      Operation of the Palladium Market    The global trade in palladium consists of Over-the-Counter (“OTC”) transactions in spot, forwards, and options and other derivatives, together with exchange-traded futures and options.
 Global Over-The-Counter Market
 The OTC market trades on a 24-hour per day continuous basis and accounts for most global palladium trading. Market makers, as well as others in the OTC market, trade with each other and with their clients on a principal-to-principal basis. All risks and issues of credit are between the parties directly involved in the transaction. Market makers include the market-making members of the London Platinum and Palladium Market (“LPPM”), the trade association that acts as the coordinator for activities conducted on behalf of its members and other participants in the LPPM. Five member participants of the LPPM are currently participating in the electronic LME PM fix process (as described below) administered by the London Metal Exchange (“LME”). The OTC market provides a relatively flexible market in terms of quotes, price, size, destinations for delivery and other factors. Bullion dealers customize transactions to meet clients’ requirements. The OTC market has no formal structure and no open-outcry meeting place. The main centers of the OTC market are London, New York, Hong Kong and Zurich. Mining companies, manufacturers of jewelry and industrial products, together with investors and speculators, tend to transact their business through one of these market centers. Centers such as Dubai and several cities in the Far East also transact substantial OTC market business, typically involving jewelry and small plates or ingots (1 kilogram or less) and will hedge their exposure by selling into one of these main OTC centers. Precious metals dealers have offices around the world and most of the world’s major bullion dealers are either members or associate members of the London Bullion Market Association (“LBMA”) and/or the LPPM. In the OTC market, the standard size of palladium trades between market makers is 1,000 ounces. Liquidity in the OTC market can vary from time to time during the course of the 24-hour trading day. Fluctuations in liquidity are reflected in adjustments to dealing spreads—the differential between a dealer’s “buy” and “sell” prices. The period of greatest liquidity in the palladium market generally occurs at the time of day when trading in the European time zones overlaps with trading in the United States, which is when OTC market trading in London, New York, Zurich and other centers coincides with futures and options trading on the Commodity Exchange, Inc. (“COMEX”), a designated contract market within the CME Group. This period lasts for approximately four hours each New York business day morning. The Zurich and London Palladium Bullion Markets
 Although the market for physical palladium is distributed globally, most palladium is stored and most OTC market trades are cleared through Zurich. As of September 1, 2009, London also serves as a center for the clearing of OTC trades in palladium. In addition to coordinating market activities, the LPPM acts as the principal point of contact between the market and its regulators. A primary function of the LPPM is its involvement in the promotion of refining standards by maintenance of the “London/Zurich Good Delivery Lists,” which are the lists of LPPM accredited melters and assayers of palladium. The LPPM also coordinates market clearing and vaulting, promotes good trading practices and develops standard documentation.
 Palladium is traded generally on a loco Zurich basis, meaning the precious metal is physically held in vaults in Zurich or is transferred into accounts established in Zurich. As of September 1, 2009, palladium began trading on a loco London basis as well, meaning that the precious metal is physically held in vaults in London or is transferred into accounts established in London. The basis for settlement and delivery of a loco Zurich spot trade is payment (generally in U.S. Dollars) two business days after the trade date against delivery. Delivery of the palladium can either be by physical delivery or through the clearing systems to an unallocated account.
 The unit of trade in London and Zurich is the troy ounce, whose conversion between grams is: 1,000 grams equals 32.1507465 troy ounces, and one troy ounce equals 31.1034768 grams. A good delivery palladium plate or ingot on the LPPM approved list is acceptable for delivery in settlement of a transaction on the OTC market (a “Good Delivery Plate or Ingot”). A Good Delivery Plate or Ingot must contain between 32 and 192 troy ounces of palladium with a minimum fineness (or purity) of 999.5 parts per 1,000 (99.95%), be of good appearance, and be easy to handle and stack. The palladium content of a palladium plate or ingot is calculated by multiplying the gross weight by the fineness of the plate or ingot. A Good Delivery Plate or Ingot must also bear the stamp of one of the melters and assayers who are on the LPPM approved list. Unless otherwise specified, the palladium spot price always refers to that of “Good Delivery Standards” set by the LPPM. Business is generally conducted over the phone and through electronic dealing systems.

 Since December 1, 2014, the LME  has been administering the operation of electronic palladium bullion price fixing systems (“LMEbullion”) that replicate electronically the manual London palladium fix processes previously employed by the London Platinum and Palladium Fixing Company Ltd (“LPPFCL”) as well as providing electronic market clearing processes for palladium bullion transactions at the fixed prices established by the LME pricing mechanism. The LME’s electronic price fixing processes, like the previous London palladium fix processes, establishes and publishes fixed prices for troy ounces of palladium twice each London trading day during fixing sessions beginning at 9:45 a.m. London time (the LME AM Fix) and 2:00 p.m. London time (the LME PM Fix). In addition to utilizing the same London palladium fix standards and methods, the LME also supervises the palladium electronic price fixing processes through its market operations, compliance, internal audit and third-party complaint handling capabilities in order to support the integrity of the LME PM Fix. The LME, in administering LMEbullion, uses a pricing methodology that meets the administrative and regulatory needs of palladium market participants, including the International Organization of Securities Commission’s (IOSCO) Principles for Financial Benchmarks.
 Daily during London trading hours the LME AM Fix and the LME PM Fix each provide reference palladium prices for that day’s trading. Many long-term contracts will be priced on the basis of either the LME AM Fix or the LME PM Fix, and market participants will usually refer to one or the other of these prices when looking for a basis for valuations. The Trust values its palladium on the basis of the LME PM Fix.
 Formal participation in the LME PM Fix is limited to participating LPPM members. Five LPPM members are currently participating in establishing the LME PM Fix (Goldman Sachs International, HSBC Bank USA NA, ICBC Standard Bank plc, Johnson Matthey plc and BASF Metals Ltd.). Any other market participant wishing to participate in the trading on the LME PM Fix is required to do so through one of the participating LPPM members.
 Orders are placed either with one of the participating LPPM member participants or with another precious metals dealer who will then be in contact with a participating LPPM member during the fixing. The fix begins with the chair reflecting the market price and other data, prevailing at the opening of the fix. This is relayed by the LPPM member participants to their dealing rooms which have direct communication with all interested parties. Any market member may enter the fixing process at any time, or adjust or withdraw his order. The palladium price is adjusted up or down until all the buy and sell orders are electronically matched, at which time the price is declared fixed. All fixing orders are transacted on the basis of this fixed price, which is instantly relayed to the market through various media.
 The LBMA and the LME have asserted that the LME’s electronic price fixing processes are similar to the non‑electronic processes previously used to establish the applicable London palladium fix where the London palladium fix process adjusted the palladium price up or down until all the buy and sell orders entered by the participating LPPM members are matched, at which time the price was declared fixed. Nevertheless, the LME PM Fix has several advantages over the previous London palladium fix. The LME’s electronic price fixing processes are intended to be transparent. The LME asserts that its electronic price fixing processes also will be fully auditable by third parties since an audit trail exists from the beginning of each fixing session. The LME also asserts that the market operation, compliance, internal audit and third-party complaint handling capabilities of the LME will support the integrity of the LME PM Fix.
 Since December 1, 2014, the Sponsor determined that the London palladium fix, which has been revised based on the new LME method and is now known as the LME PM Fix, will be an appropriate basis for valuing palladium bullion received upon purchase of the Trust’s Shares, delivered upon redemption of the Trust’s Shares and for determining the value of the Trust’s palladium bullion each trading day.  The Sponsor also has determined that the LME PM Fix will fairly represent the commercial value of palladium bullion held by the Trust and, the “Benchmark Price” (as defined in the Trust Agreement) of the Trust’s palladium bullion as of any day will be the LME PM Fix for such day.
 As of December 1, 2014, the LPPFCL transferred ownership of the historic and future intellectual property of the twice daily “fix” for platinum and palladium bullion to a subsidiary company of the LBMA.
 Futures Exchanges 
 The most significant palladium futures exchanges are the COMEX and the Tokyo Commodity Exchange (“TOCOM”). The COMEX is the largest exchange in the world for trading precious metals futures and options and launched palladium futures in 1968, followed with options in 2010. The TOCOM has been trading palladium since 1992. Trading on these exchanges is based on fixed delivery dates and transaction sizes for the futures and options contracts traded. Trading costs are negotiable. As a matter of practice, only a small percentage of the futures market turnover ever comes to physical delivery of the palladium represented by the contracts traded. Both exchanges permit trading on margin. Margin trading can add to the speculative risk involved given the potential for margin calls if the price moves against the contract holder. The COMEX trades palladium futures almost continuously (with one short break in the evening) through its CME Globex electronic trading system and clears through its central clearing system. On June 6, 2003, the TOCOM adopted a similar clearing system. In each case, the exchange acts as a counterparty for each member for clearing purposes.

 Market Regulation
 The global palladium markets are overseen and regulated by both governmental and self-regulatory organizations. In addition, certain trade associations have established rules and protocols for market practices and participants. In the United Kingdom, responsibility for the regulation of the financial market participants, including the major participating members of the LPPM, falls under the authority of the Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”) as provided by the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (“FSM Act”). Under this act, all UK-based banks, together with other investment firms, are subject to a range of requirements, including fitness and properness, capital adequacy, liquidity, and systems and controls.
 The FCA is responsible for regulating investment products, including derivatives, and those who deal in investment products. Regulation of spot, commercial forwards, and deposits of palladium not covered by the FSM Act is provided for by The London Code of Conduct for Non-Investment Products, which was established by market participants in conjunction with the Bank of England.
 The TOCOM has authority to perform financial and operational surveillance on its members’ trading activities, scrutinize positions held by members and large-scale customers, and monitor the price movements of futures markets by comparing them with cash and other derivative markets’ prices. To act as a Futures Commission Merchant Broker on the TOCOM, a broker must obtain a license from Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (“METI”), the regulatory authority that oversees the operations of the TOCOM.
 The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) regulates trading in commodity contracts, such as futures, options and swaps.  In addition, under the Commodity Exchange Act of 1936 (“CEA”), the CFTC has jurisdiction to prosecute manipulation and fraud in any commodity (including precious metals) traded in interstate commerce as spot as well as deliverable forwards. The CFTC is the exclusive regulator of U.S. commodity exchanges and clearing houses.
 Secondary Market Trading 
 While the Trust’s investment objective is for the Shares to reflect the performance of palladium bullion, less the expenses of the Trust, the Shares may trade in the secondary market on the NYSE Arca at prices that are lower or higher relative to their net asset value (the value of the Trust’s assets less its liabilities (“NAV”)) per Share. The amount of the discount or premium in the trading price relative to the NAV per Share may be influenced by non-concurrent trading hours between the NYSE Arca, COMEX, and the London and Zurich palladium bullion markets. While the Shares trade on the NYSE Arca until 4:00 p.m. New York time, liquidity in the global palladium market is reduced after the close of the COMEX at 1:30 p.m. New York time. As a result, during this time, trading spreads, and the resulting premium or discount, on the Shares may widen.  Valuation of Palladium and Computation of Net Asset Value 
 On each day that the NYSE Arca is open for regular trading, as promptly as practicable after 4:00 p.m., New York time, on such day (the “Evaluation Time”), the Trustee evaluates the palladium held by the Trust and determines the NAV of the Trust. For the purposes of making these calculations, a business day means any day other than a day when NYSE Arca is closed for regular trading. 
 At the Evaluation Time, the Trustee values the Trust’s palladium on the basis of that day’s LME PM Fix or, if no LME PM Fix is made on such day, the next most recent LME PM Fix determined prior to the Evaluation Time will be used, unless the Sponsor determines that such price is inappropriate as a basis for evaluation. In the event the Sponsor determines that the LME PM Fix or such other publicly available price as the Sponsor may deem fairly represents the commercial value of the Trust’s palladium is not an appropriate basis for evaluation of the Trust’s palladium, it shall identify an alternative basis for such evaluation to be employed by the Trustee. Neither the Trustee nor the Sponsor shall be liable to any person for the determination that the LME PM Fix or such other publicly available price is not appropriate as a basis for evaluation of the Trust’s palladium or for any determination as to the alternative basis for such evaluation provided that such determination is made in good faith. See “Operation of the Palladium Market—The Zurich and London Palladium Bullion Markets” for a description of the LME PM Fix.
 Once the value of the palladium has been determined, the Trustee subtracts all estimated accrued but unpaid fees (other than the fees accruing for such day on which the valuation takes place that are computed by reference to the value of the Trust or its assets), expenses and other liabilities of the Trust from the total value of the palladium and all other assets of the Trust (other than any amounts credited to the Trust’s reserve account, if established). The resulting figure is the adjusted net asset value (the “ANAV”) of the Trust. The ANAV of the Trust is used to compute the Sponsor’s Fee. 
 All fees accruing for the day on which the valuation takes place that are computed by reference to the value of the Trust or its assets shall be calculated using the ANAV calculated for such day. The Trustee shall subtract from the ANAV the amount of accrued fees so computed for such day and the resulting figure is the NAV of the Trust. The Trustee also determines the NAV per Share by dividing the NAV of the Trust by the number of the Shares outstanding as of the close of trading on the NYSE Arca (which includes the net number of any Shares created or redeemed on such evaluation day). 
 The Trustee’s estimation of accrued but unpaid fees, expenses and liabilities is conclusive upon all persons interested in the Trust and no revision or correction in any computation made under the Trust Agreement will be required by reason of any difference in amounts estimated from those actually paid.

 Trust Expenses 
 The Trust’s only ordinary recurring expense is the Sponsor’s Fee. In exchange for the Sponsor’s Fee, the Sponsor has agreed to assume the following administrative and marketing expenses incurred by the Trust: the Trustee’s monthly fee and out-of-pocket expenses, the Custodian’s fee and reimbursement of the Custodian’s expenses under the Custody Agreements (defined below), Exchange listing fees, SEC registration fees, printing and mailing costs, audit fees and up to $100,000 per annum in legal expenses. The Sponsor also paid the costs of the Trust’s organization and the initial sale of the Shares, including the applicable SEC registration fees. 
 The Sponsor’s Fee accrues daily at an annualized rate equal to 0.60% of the ANAV of the Trust and is payable monthly in arrears. The Sponsor’s Fee is paid by delivery of palladium to an account maintained by the Custodian for the Sponsor on an unallocated basis. The Sponsor, from time to time, may temporarily waive all or a portion of the Sponsor’s Fee at its discretion for a stated period of time. Presently, the Sponsor does not intend to waive any of its fee. 
 Furthermore, the Sponsor may, in its sole discretion, agree to rebate all or a portion of the Sponsor’s Fee attributable to Shares held by institutional investors subject to minimum shareholding and lock up requirements as determined by the Sponsor to foster stability in the Trust’s asset levels. Any such rebate will be subject to negotiation and written agreement between the Sponsor and the investor on a case by case basis. The Sponsor is under no obligation to provide any rebates of the Sponsor’s Fee. Neither the Trust nor the Trustee will be a party to any Sponsor’s Fee rebate arrangements negotiated by the Sponsor. Any Sponsor’s Fee rebate shall be paid from the funds of the Sponsor and not from the assets of the Trust.
 The Sponsor’s Fee is paid by delivery of palladium to an account maintained by the Custodian for the Sponsor on an unallocated basis, monthly on the first business day of the month in respect of fees payable for the prior month.  The delivery is of that number of ounces of palladium which equals the daily accrual of the Sponsor’s Fee for such prior month calculated at the LME PM Fix.
 The Trustee will, when directed by the Sponsor, and, in the absence of such direction, may, in its discretion, sell palladium in such quantity and at such times as may be necessary to permit payment in cash of Trust expenses not assumed by the Sponsor. The Trustee is authorized to sell palladium at such times and in the smallest amounts required to permit such payments as they become due, it being the intention to avoid or minimize the Trust’s holdings of assets other than palladium. Accordingly, the amount of palladium to be sold will vary from time to time depending on the level of the Trust’s expenses and the market price of palladium. The Custodian is authorized to purchase from the Trust, at the request of the Trustee, palladium needed to cover Trust expenses not assumed by the Sponsor at the price used by the Trustee to determine the value of the palladium held by the Trust on the date of the sale.
 The Sponsor’s Fee for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $1,073,755 (December 31, 2017: $1,278,403; December 31, 2016: $1,099,935). 
 Cash held by the Trustee pending payment of the Trust’s expenses will not bear any interest.
 Deposit of Palladium; Issuance of Shares 
 The Trust creates and redeems Shares from time to time, but only in one or more Baskets of 50,000 Shares. Only registered broker-dealers (or other securities market participants not required to register as broker-dealers, such as a bank or other financial institution) who (1) are participants in DTC and (2) have entered into written agreements with the Sponsor and the Trustee (each an “Authorized Participant”) can deposit palladium and receive Baskets of Shares in exchange. The creation and redemption of Baskets is only made in exchange for the delivery to the Trust or the distribution by the Trust of the amount of palladium represented by the Baskets being created or redeemed, the amount of which is based on the combined NAV of the number of Shares included in the Baskets being created or redeemed determined on the day the order to create or redeem Baskets is properly received. 
 All palladium bullion deposited with the Custodian or for the Custodian by the Zurich Sub-Custodian must be of at least a minimum fineness (or purity) of 999.5 parts per 1,000 (99.95%) and otherwise conform to the rules, regulations practices and customs of the LPPM, including the specifications for a Good Delivery Plate or Ingot. 
 Creation and redemption orders are accepted on “business days” the NYSE Arca is open for regular trading. Settlements of such orders requiring receipt or delivery, or confirmation of receipt or delivery, of palladium in the United Kingdom, Zurich or another jurisdiction occur on “business days” when (1) banks in the United Kingdom, Zurich or such other jurisdiction and (2) the London or Zurich palladium markets are regularly open for business. If such banks or the London or Zurich palladium markets are not open for regular business for a full day, such a day will only be a “business day” for settlement purposes if the settlement procedures can be completed by the end of such day.

 On any business day, an Authorized Participant may place an order with the Trustee to purchase one or more Baskets. Purchase orders must be placed no later than 3:59:59 p.m. on each business day the NYSE Arca is open for regular trading. A purchase order so received is effective on the date it is received in satisfactory form by the Trustee. By placing a purchase order, an Authorized Participant agrees to deposit palladium with the Trust, as described below. Prior to the delivery of Baskets for a purchase order, the Authorized Participant must also have wired to the Trustee the non-refundable transaction fee due for the purchase order (as explained under “Creation and Redemption Transaction Fee” below). 
 An Authorized Participant who places a purchase order is responsible for crediting its Authorized Participant Unallocated Account, either loco London or loco Zurich, with the required palladium deposit amount by the second business day in London or Zurich following the purchase order date. Upon receipt of the palladium deposit amount, the Custodian, after receiving appropriate instructions from the Authorized Participant and the Trustee, will transfer on the second business day following the purchase order date the palladium deposit amount from the Authorized Participant Unallocated Account to the unallocated palladium account of the Trust established with the Custodian under the Unallocated Account Agreement between the Trustee and the Custodian (the “Trust Unallocated Account”) and the Trustee will direct the Depository Trust Company (the “DTC”) to credit the number of Baskets ordered to the Authorized Participant’s DTC account. Acting on standing instructions given by the Trustee, the Custodian will transfer the palladium deposit amount from the Trust Unallocated Account to the allocated palladium account of the Trust established with the Custodian under the Allocated Account Agreement between the Trustee and the Custodian (the “Trust Allocated Account”), by transferring specific palladium plates or ingots from its inventory or the inventory of the Zurich Sub-Custodian to the Trust Allocated Account. The Trust’s Unallocated Account Agreement and Allocated Account Agreement are referred to collectively as the “Custody Agreements.”
 Withdrawal of Palladium; Redemption of Shares 
 The procedures by which an Authorized Participant can redeem one or more Baskets mirror the procedures for the creation of Baskets. On any business day, an Authorized Participant may place an order with the Trustee to redeem one or more Baskets. Redemption orders must be placed no later than 3:59:59 p.m. on each business day the NYSE Arca is open for regular trading. A redemption order so received is effective on the date it is received in satisfactory form by the Trustee. The redemption procedures allow Authorized Participants to redeem Baskets and do not entitle an individual owner of beneficial interests in the Shares (a “Shareholder”) to redeem any Shares in an amount less than a Basket, or to redeem Baskets other than through an Authorized Participant. 
 By placing a redemption order, an Authorized Participant agrees to deliver the Baskets to be redeemed through DTC’s book-entry system to the Trust not later than the second business day following the effective date of the redemption order. Prior to the delivery of the redemption distribution for a redemption order, the Authorized Participant must also have wired to the Trustee the non-refundable transaction fee due for the redemption order (as explained under “Creation and Redemption Transaction Fee” below). 
 The redemption distribution from the Trust consists of a credit to the redeeming Authorized Participant’s Authorized Participant Unallocated Account, either loco London or loco Zurich, representing the amount of the palladium held by the Trust evidenced by the Shares being redeemed. Fractions of a fine ounce of palladium included in the redemption distribution smaller than 0.001 of a fine ounce are disregarded. Redemption distributions are subject to the deduction of any applicable tax or other governmental charges which may be due. 
 Redemption settlements including palladium deliveries loco London may be delayed longer than two, but no more than five, business days following the redemption order date. Additionally, if a loco swap or physical transfer is necessary to effect a loco London or loco Zurich redemption, the settlement of loco London or loco Zurich redemption deliveries may be delayed more than two, but not more than five, business days.
 Creation and Redemption Transaction Fee 
 To compensate the Trustee for services in processing the creation and redemption of Baskets, an Authorized Participant is required to pay a transaction fee to the Trustee of $500 per order to create or redeem Baskets. An order may include multiple Baskets. The transaction fee may be reduced, increased or otherwise changed by the Trustee with the consent of the Sponsor. The Trustee shall notify DTC of any agreement to change the transaction fee and will not implement any increase in the fee for the redemption of Baskets until 30 days after the date of the notice.  Change in Settlement Cycle
 Pursuant to an SEC rule amendment adopted in March 2017, the standard settlement cycle for most securities transactions by broker-dealers was shortened from three business days after the trade date (“T+3 Settlement”) to two business days following the trade date (“T+2 Settlement”), effective as of September 5, 2017.  Consistent with the rule amendment, beginning on September 5, 2017, the creation and redemption processes for the Trust changed from T+3 Settlement to T+2 Settlement.  Creation and redemption orders placed before September 5, 2017 were not subject to this change.

 Name Changes
 Effective October 1, 2018, the name of the Trust changed from the “ETFS Palladium Trust” to the “Aberdeen Standard Palladium ETF Trust”. In addition, effective October 1, 2018, the name of the Shares changed from “ETFS Physical Palladium Shares” to “Aberdeen Standard Physical Palladium Shares ETF”, and the name of the Sponsor changed from “ETF Securities USA LLC” to “Aberdeen Standard Investments ETFs Sponsor LLC”.    The Sponsor’s Role    The Sponsor arranged for the creation of the Trust, the registration of the Shares for their public offering in the United States and the listing of the Shares on the NYSE Arca. The Sponsor has agreed to assume the following administrative and marketing expenses incurred by the Trust: the Trustee’s monthly fee and out-of-pocket expenses, the Custodian’s fee and the reimbursement of the Custodian’s expenses under the Custody Agreements, Exchange listing fees, SEC registration fees, printing and mailing costs, audit fees and up to $100,000 per annum in legal expenses. The Sponsor also paid the costs of the Trust’s organization and the initial sale of the Shares, including the applicable SEC registration fees. 
 The Sponsor does not exercise day-to-day oversight over the Trustee or the Custodian. The Sponsor may remove the Trustee and appoint a successor Trustee (i) if the Trustee ceases to meet certain objective requirements (including the requirement that it have capital, surplus and undivided profits of at least $150 million), (ii) if, having received written notice of a material breach of its obligations under the Trust Agreement, the Trustee has not cured the breach within 30 days, or (iii) if the Trustee refuses to consent to the implementation of an amendment to the Trust’s initial Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. The Sponsor also has the right to replace the Trustee during the 90 days following any merger, consolidation or conversion in which the Trustee is not the surviving entity or, in its discretion, on the fifth anniversary of the creation of the Trust or on any subsequent third anniversary thereafter. The Sponsor also has the right to approve any new or additional custodian that the Trustee may wish to appoint and any new or additional Zurich Sub-Custodian that the Custodian may wish to appoint. 
 The Sponsor or one of its affiliates or agents (1) develops a marketing plan for the Trust on an ongoing basis, (2) prepares marketing materials regarding the Shares, including the content of the Trust’s website and (3) executes the marketing plan for the Trust.

      The Trustee’s Role    The Trustee is generally responsible for the day-to-day administration of the Trust, including keeping the Trust’s operational records. The Trustee’s principal responsibilities include (1) transferring the Trust’s palladium as needed to pay the Sponsor’s Fee in palladium (palladium transfers are expected to occur approximately monthly in the ordinary course), (2) valuing the Trust’s palladium and calculating the NAV of the Trust and the NAV per Share, (3) receiving and processing orders from Authorized Participants to create and redeem Baskets and coordinating the processing of such orders with the Custodian and DTC, (4) selling the Trust’s palladium as needed to pay any extraordinary Trust expenses that are not assumed by the Sponsor, (5) when appropriate, making distributions of cash or other property to Shareholders, and (6) receiving and reviewing reports from or on the Custodian’s custody of and transactions in the Trust’s palladium. The Trustee shall, with respect to directing the Custodian, act in accordance with the instructions of the Sponsor. If the Custodian resigns, the Trustee shall appoint an additional or replacement Custodian selected by the Sponsor. The Trustee intends to regularly communicate with the Sponsor to monitor the overall performance of the Trust. The Trustee does not monitor the performance of the Custodian, the Zurich Sub-Custodian or any other sub-custodian other than to review the reports provided by the Custodian pursuant to the Custody Agreements. The Trustee, along with the Sponsor, will liaise with the Trust’s legal, accounting and other professional service providers as needed. The Trustee will assist and support the Sponsor with the preparation of all periodic reports required to be filed with the SEC on behalf of the Trust.
 The Trustee’s monthly fees and out-of-pocket expenses are paid by the Sponsor. 
 Affiliates of the Trustee may from time to time act as Authorized Participants or purchase or sell palladium or Shares for their own account, as agent for their customers and for accounts over which they exercise investment discretion. Affiliates of the Trustee are subject to the same transaction fee as other Authorized Participants.
 The Custodian 
 JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (“JPMorgan”) serves as the Custodian of the Trust’s palladium. JPMorgan is a national banking association organized under the laws of the United States of America. JPMorgan is subject to supervision by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
 JPMorgan’s London office is regulated by the FCA and is located at 25 Bank Street, London, E14 5JP, United Kingdom. JPMorgan is a subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase & Co.  While the United Kingdom operations of the Custodian are regulated by the FCA, the custodial services provided by the Custodian and any sub-custodian, including the Zurich Sub-Custodian under the Custody Agreements, are presently not a regulated activity subject to the supervision and rules of the FCA.
 The Custodian’s Role
 The Custodian is responsible for safekeeping of the Trust’s palladium deposited with it by Authorized Participants in connection with the creation of Baskets. The Custodian is also responsible for selecting the Zurich Sub-Custodian and its other direct sub-custodians, if any. The Custodian facilitates the transfer of palladium in and out of the Trust through the unallocated palladium accounts it will maintain for each Authorized Participant and the unallocated and allocated palladium accounts it will maintain for the Trust. The Custodian holds at its London, England vault premises that portion of the Trust’s allocated palladium to be held in London. The Zurich Sub-Custodian holds at its Zurich, Switzerland vault premises that portion of the Trust’s allocated palladium to be held in Zurich on behalf of the Custodian. The Custodian is responsible for allocating specific plates or ingots of physical palladium to the Trust’s allocated palladium account. The Custodian provides the Trustee with regular reports detailing the palladium transfers in and out of the Trust’s unallocated and allocated palladium accounts and identifying the palladium plates or ingots held in the Trust’s allocated palladium account.
 The Custodian’s fees and expenses under the Custody Agreements are paid by the Sponsor.
 The Custodian and its affiliates may from time to time act as Authorized Participants or purchase or sell palladium or Shares for their own account, as agent for their customers and for accounts over which they exercise investment discretion. The Custodian and its affiliates are subject to the same transaction fee as other Authorized Participants.
 Inspection of Palladium
 Under the Custody Agreements, the Trustee, the Sponsor and the Sponsor’s auditors and inspectors may, only up to twice a year, visit the premises of the Custodian for the purpose of examining the Trust’s palladium and certain related records maintained by the Custodian. Under the Allocated Account Agreement, the Custodian agreed to procure similar inspection rights from the Zurich Sub-Custodian.  Any such inspection rights with respect to the Zurich Sub-Custodian are expected to be granted in accordance with the normal course of dealing between the Custodian and the Zurich Sub-Custodian.  Visits by auditors and inspectors to the Zurich Sub-Custodian’s facilities will be arranged through the Custodian.  Other than with respect to the Zurich Sub-Custodian, the Trustee and the Sponsor have no right to visit the premises of any sub-custodian for the purposes of examining the Trust’s palladium or any records maintained by the sub-custodian, and no sub-custodian is obligated to cooperate in any review the Trustee or the Sponsor may wish to conduct of the facilities, procedures, records or creditworthiness of such sub-custodian.


 
11

      The Sponsor has exercised its right to visit the Custodian and the Zurich Sub-Custodian in order to examine the palladium and the records maintained by them. Inspections were conducted by Inspectorate International Limited, a leading commodity inspection and testing company retained by the Sponsor, as of May 11, 2018 and December 31, 2018. 
 Description of the Shares 
 General    The Trustee is authorized under the Trust Agreement to create and issue an unlimited number of Shares. The Trustee creates Shares only in Baskets (a Basket equals a block of 50,000 Shares) and only upon the order of an Authorized Participant. The Shares represent units of fractional undivided beneficial interest in and ownership of the Trust and have no par value. Any creation and issuance of Shares above the amount registered on the Trust’s then-current and effective registration statement with the SEC will require the registration of such additional Shares. 
 Description of Limited Rights    The Shares do not represent a traditional investment and Shareholders should not view them as similar to “shares” of a corporation operating a business enterprise with management and a board of directors. Shareholders do not have the statutory rights normally associated with the ownership of shares of a corporation, including, for example, the right to bring “oppression” or “derivative” actions. All Shares are of the same class with equal rights and privileges. Each Share is transferable, is fully paid and non-assessable and entitles the holder to vote on the limited matters upon which Shareholders may vote under the Trust Agreement. The Shares do not entitle their holders to any conversion or pre-emptive rights, or, except as provided below, any redemption rights or rights to distributions. 
 Distributions    If the Trust is terminated and liquidated, the Trustee will distribute to the Shareholders any amounts remaining after the satisfaction of all outstanding liabilities of the Trust and the establishment of such reserves for applicable taxes, other governmental charges and contingent or future liabilities as the Trustee shall determine. Shareholders of record on the record date fixed by the Trustee for a distribution will be entitled to receive their pro rata portion of any distribution. 
 Voting and Approvals    Under the Trust Agreement, Shareholders have no voting rights, except in limited circumstances. The Trustee may terminate the Trust upon the agreement of Shareholders owning at least 75% of the outstanding Shares. In addition, certain amendments to the Trust Agreement require advance notice to the Shareholders before the effectiveness of such amendments, but no Shareholder vote or approval is required for any amendment to the Trust Agreement.
 Redemption of the Shares    The Shares may only be redeemed by or through an Authorized Participant and only in Baskets. 
 Book-Entry Form    Individual certificates will not be issued for the Shares. Instead, one or more global certificates is deposited by the Trustee with DTC and registered in the name of Cede & Co., as nominee for DTC. The global certificates evidence all of the Shares outstanding at any time. Under the Trust Agreement, Shareholders are limited to (1) participants in DTC such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies (DTC Participants), (2) those who maintain, either directly or indirectly, a custodial relationship with a DTC Participant (Indirect Participants), and (3) those banks, brokers, dealers, trust companies and others who hold interests in the Shares through DTC Participants or Indirect Participants. The Shares are only transferable through the book-entry system of DTC. Shareholders who are not DTC Participants may transfer their Shares through DTC by instructing the DTC Participant holding their Shares (or by instructing the Indirect Participant or other entity through which their Shares are held) to transfer the Shares. Transfers will be made in accordance with standard securities industry practice. 
 Custody of the Trust’s Palladium 
 Custody of the physical palladium deposited with and held by the Trust is provided by the Custodian at its London, England vaults and by the Zurich Sub-Custodian selected by the Custodian in its Zurich vaults and by other sub-custodians on a temporary basis. The Custodian is a market maker, clearer and approved weigher under the rules of the LPPM.
 The Custodian is the custodian of the physical palladium credited to the Trust Allocated Account in accordance with the Custody Agreements. The Custodian segregates the physical palladium credited to the Trust’s Allocated Account from any other precious metal it holds or holds for others by entering appropriate entries in its books and records, and requires the Zurich Sub-Custodian to also segregate the physical palladium of the Trust from the other palladium held by it for other customers of the Custodian and the Zurich Sub-Custodian’s other customers. The Custodian requires the Zurich Sub-Custodian to identify in its books and records the Trust as having the rights to the physical palladium credited to its Trust Allocated Account.


 
12

      The Custodian, as instructed by the Trustee on behalf of the Trust, is authorized to accept, on behalf of the Trust, deposits of palladium in unallocated form. Acting on standing instructions specified in the Custody Agreements, the Custodian will or will require the Zurich Sub-Custodian to allocate palladium deposited in unallocated form with the Trust by selecting plates or ingots of palladium for deposit to the Trust Allocated Account. All physical palladium allocated to the Trust must conform to the rules, regulations, practices and customs of the LPPM.
 The process of withdrawing palladium from the Trust for a redemption of a Basket will follow the same general procedure as for depositing palladium with the Trust for a creation of a Basket, only in reverse. Each transfer of palladium between the Trust Allocated Account and the Trust Unallocated Account connected with a creation or redemption of a Basket may result in a small amount of palladium being held in the Trust Unallocated Account after the completion of the transfer. In making deposits and withdrawals between the Trust Allocated Account and the Trust Unallocated Account, the Custodian will use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize the amount of palladium held in the Trust Unallocated Account as of the close of each business day. See “Deposit of Palladium; Issuance of Shares.” and “Withdrawal of Palladium; Redemption of Shares.”
 United States Federal Income Tax Consequences
 The following discussion of the material US federal income tax consequences that generally applies to the purchase, ownership and disposition of Shares by a US Shareholder (as defined below), and certain US federal income tax consequences that may apply to an investment in Shares by a Non-US Shareholder (as defined below). The discussion is based on the United States Internal Revenue code of 1986 as amended (the “Code”). The discussion below is based on the Code, United States Treasury Regulations (“Treasury Regulations”) promulgated under the Code and judicial and administrative interpretations of the Code, all as in effect on the date of this annual report and all of which are subject to change either prospectively or retroactively. The tax treatment of Shareholders may vary depending upon their own particular circumstances. Certain Shareholders (including broker-dealers, traders, banks and other financial institutions, insurance companies, real estate investment trusts, tax-exempt entities, Shareholders whose functional currency is not the U.S. Dollar or other investors with special circumstances) may be subject to special rules not discussed below. In addition, the following discussion applies only to investors who hold Shares as “capital assets” within the meaning of Code section 1221 and not as part of a straddle, hedging transaction or a conversion or constructive sale transaction. Moreover, the discussion below does not address the effect of any state, local or foreign tax law or any transfer tax on an owner of Shares.
 Purchasers of Shares are urged to consult their own tax advisors with respect to all federal, state, local and foreign tax law or any transfer tax considerations potentially applicable to their investment in Shares, including substantial changes to the Code made in the recently enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (P.L. 115-97). 
 For purposes of this discussion, a “US Shareholder” is a Shareholder that is: 
 •An individual who is treated as a citizen or resident of the United States for US federal income tax purposes; 
 •A corporation (or other entity treated as a corporation for US federal tax purposes) created or organized in or under the laws of the United States or any political subdivision thereof; 
 •An estate, the income of which is includible in gross income for US federal income tax purposes regardless of its source; or 
 •A trust, if a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more US persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust. 
 A Shareholder that is not a US Shareholder as defined above (other than a partnership, or an entity treated as a partnership for US federal tax purposes) generally is considered a “Non-US Shareholder” for purposes of this discussion. For US federal income tax purposes, the treatment of any beneficial owner of an interest in a partnership, including any entity treated as a partnership for US federal income tax purposes, generally depends upon the status of the partner and upon the activities of the partnership. Partnerships and partners in partnerships should consult their tax advisors about the US federal income tax consequences of purchasing, owning and disposing of Shares. 
 Taxation of the Trust    The Trust is classified as a “grantor trust” for US federal income tax purposes. As a result, the Trust itself will not be subject to US federal income tax. Instead, the Trust’s income and expenses “flow through” to the Shareholders and the Trustee reports the Trust’s income, gains, losses and deductions to the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) on that basis. 
 Taxation of US Shareholders    Shareholders generally are treated, for US federal income tax purposes, as if they directly owned a pro rata share of the underlying assets held by the Trust. Shareholders are also treated as if they directly received their respective pro rata share of the Trust’s income, if any, and as if they directly incurred their respective pro rata share of the Trust’s expenses. In the case of a Shareholder that purchases Shares for cash, its initial tax basis in its pro rata share of the assets held by the Trust at the time it acquires its Shares is equal to its cost of acquiring the Shares. In the case of a Shareholder that acquires its Shares as part of a creation of a Basket, the delivery of palladium to the Trust in exchange for the Shares is not a taxable event to the Shareholder, and the Shareholder’s tax basis and holding period for the Shares are the same as its tax basis and holding period for the palladium delivered in exchange therefore 

 
13

      (except to the extent of any cash contributed for such Shares). For purposes of this discussion, it is assumed that all of a Shareholder’s Shares are acquired on the same date and at the same price per Share. Shareholders that hold multiple lots of Shares, or that are contemplating acquiring multiple lots of Shares, should consult their tax advisors. 
 ﻿
 When the Trust sells or transfers palladium, for example to pay expenses, a Shareholder generally will recognize a gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between (1) the Shareholder’s pro rata share of the amount realized by the Trust upon the sale or transfer and (2) the Shareholder’s tax basis for its pro rata share of the palladium that was sold or transferred. Such gain or loss will generally be long-term or short-term capital gain or loss, depending upon whether the Shareholder has a holding period in its Shares of longer than one year. A Shareholder’s tax basis for its share of any palladium sold by the Trust generally will be determined by multiplying the Shareholder’s total basis for its Shares immediately prior to the sale, by a fraction the numerator of which is the amount of palladium sold, and the denominator of which is the total amount of the palladium held by the Trust immediately prior to the sale. After any such sale, a Shareholder’s tax basis for its pro rata share of the palladium remaining in the Trust will be equal to its tax basis for its Shares immediately prior to the sale, less the portion of such basis allocable to its share of the palladium that was sold.
 Upon a Shareholder’s sale of some or all of its Shares, the Shareholder will be treated as having sold a pro rata share of the palladium held in the Trust at the time of the sale. Accordingly, the Shareholder generally will recognize a gain or loss on the sale in an amount equal to the difference between (1) the amount realized pursuant to the sale of the Shares, and (2) the Shareholder’s tax basis for the Shares sold, as determined in the manner described in the preceding paragraph. 
 A redemption of some or all of a Shareholder’s Shares in exchange for the underlying palladium represented by the Shares redeemed generally will not be a taxable event to the Shareholder. The Shareholder’s tax basis for the palladium received in the redemption generally will be the same as the Shareholder’s tax basis for the Shares redeemed. The Shareholder’s holding period with respect to the palladium received should include the period during which the Shareholder held the Shares redeemed. A subsequent sale of the palladium received by the Shareholder will be a taxable event. 
 An Authorized Participant and other investors may be able to re-invest, on a tax-deferred basis, in-kind redemption proceeds received from exchange-traded products that are substantially similar to the Trust in the Trust’s Shares. Authorized Participants and other investors should consult their tax advisors as to whether and under what circumstances the reinvestment in the Shares of proceeds from substantially similar exchange-traded products can be accomplished on a tax-deferred basis. 
 Under current law, gains recognized by individuals, estates or trusts  from the sale of “collectibles,” including physical palladium, held for more than one year are taxed at a maximum federal income tax rate of 28%, rather than the 20% rate applicable to most other long-term capital gains. For these purposes, gain recognized by an individual upon the sale of Shares held for more than one year, or attributable to the Trust’s sale of any physical palladium which the Shareholder is treated (through its ownership of Shares) as having held for more than one year, generally will be taxed at a maximum rate of 28%. The tax rates for capital gains recognized upon the sale of assets held by an individual US Shareholder for one year or less or by a corporate taxpayer are generally the same as those at which ordinary income is taxed. 
 In addition, high-income individuals and certain trusts and estates are subject to a 3.8% Medicare contribution tax that is imposed on net investment income and gain. Shareholders should consult their tax advisor regarding this tax. 
 Brokerage Fees and Trust Expenses 
 Any brokerage or other transaction fees incurred by a Shareholder in purchasing Shares is treated as part of the Shareholder’s tax basis in the Shares. Similarly, any brokerage fee incurred by a Shareholder in selling Shares reduces the amount realized by the Shareholder with respect to the sale.
 Shareholders will be required to recognize a gain or loss upon a sale of palladium by the Trust (as discussed above), even though some or all of the proceeds of such sale are used by the Trustee to pay Trust expenses. Shareholders may deduct their respective pro rata share of each expense incurred by the Trust to the same extent as if they directly incurred the expense. Shareholders who are individuals, estates or trusts, however, may be required to treat some or all of the expenses of the Trust, to the extent that such expenses may be deducted, as miscellaneous itemized deductions. Under the recently enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (P.L. 115-97), miscellaneous itemized deductions, including expenses for the production of income, will not be deductible for either regular federal income tax or alternative minimum tax purposes for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 and before January 1, 2026.
 Investment by Regulated Investment Companies    Mutual funds and other investment vehicles which are “regulated investment companies” within the meaning of Code section 851 should consult with their tax advisors concerning (1) the likelihood that an investment in Shares, although they are a “security” within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, may be considered an investment in the underlying palladium for purposes of Code section 851(b), and (2) the extent to which an investment in Shares might nevertheless be consistent with preservation of their qualification under Code section 851. We note that in recent administrative guidance, the IRS stated that it will no longer issue rulings under Code section 851(b) relating to the determination of whether or not an instrument or position is a “security”, but, instead, intends to defer to guidance from the SEC for such determination.

      United States Information Reporting and Backup Withholding Tax for US and Non-US Shareholders    The Trustee or the appropriate broker will file certain information returns with the IRS, and provides certain tax-related information to Shareholders, in accordance with applicable Treasury Regulations. Each Shareholder will be provided with information regarding its allocable portion of the Trust’s annual income (if any) and expenses. 
 A US Shareholder may be subject to US backup withholding tax in certain circumstances unless it provides its taxpayer identification number and complies with certain certification procedures. Non-US Shareholders may have to comply with certification procedures to establish that they are not a US person in order to avoid the backup withholding tax. 
 The amount of any backup withholding tax will be allowed as a credit against a Shareholder’s US federal income tax liability and may entitle such a Shareholder to a refund, provided that the required information is furnished to the IRS. 
 Income Taxation of Non-US Shareholders    The Trust does not expect to generate taxable income except for gains (if any) upon the sale of palladium. A Non-US Shareholder generally is not subject to US federal income tax with respect to gains recognized upon the sale or other disposition of Shares, or upon the sale of palladium by the Trust, unless (1) the Non-US Shareholder is an individual and is present in the United States for 183 days or more during the taxable year of the sale or other disposition, and the gain is treated as being from United States sources; or (2) the gain is effectively connected with the conduct by the Non-US Shareholder of a trade or business in the United States. 
 Taxation in Jurisdictions other than the United States    Prospective purchasers of Shares that are based in or acting out of a jurisdiction other than the United States are advised to consult their own tax advisers as to the tax consequences, under the laws of such jurisdiction (or any other jurisdiction not being the United States to which they are subject), of their purchase, holding, sale and redemption of or any other dealing in Shares and, in particular, as to whether any value added tax, other consumption tax or transfer tax is payable in relation to such purchase, holding, sale, redemption or other dealing. 
 ERISA and Related Considerations
 The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”), and/or Code section 4975 impose certain requirements on certain employee benefit plans and certain other plans and arrangements, including individual retirement accounts and annuities, Keogh plans, and certain commingled investment vehicles or insurance company general or separate accounts in which such plans or arrangements are invested (collectively, “Plans”), and on persons who are fiduciaries with respect to the investment of “plan assets” of a Plan. Government plans and some church plans are not subject to the fiduciary responsibility provisions of ERISA or the provisions of section 4975 of the Code, but may be subject to substantially similar rules under other federal law, or under state or local law (“Other Law”). 
 In contemplating an investment of a portion of Plan assets in Shares, the Plan fiduciary responsible for making such investment should carefully consider, taking into account the facts and circumstances of the Plan and the “Risk Factors” discussed above and whether such investment is consistent with its fiduciary responsibilities under ERISA or Other Law, including, but not limited to: (1) whether the investment is permitted under the Plan’s governing documents, (2) whether the fiduciary has the authority to make the investment, (3) whether the investment is consistent with the Plan’s funding objectives, (4) the tax effects of the investment on the Plan, and (5) whether the investment is prudent considering the factors discussed in this report. In addition, ERISA and Code section 4975 prohibit a broad range of transactions involving assets of a plan and persons who are “parties in interest” under ERISA or “disqualified persons” under section 4975 of the Code. A violation of these rules may result in the imposition of significant excise taxes and other liabilities. Plans subject to Other Law may be subject to similar restrictions. 
 It is anticipated that the Shares will constitute “publicly offered securities” as defined in the Department of Labor “Plan Asset Regulations,” §2510.3-101 (b)(2) as modified by section 3(42) of ERISA. Accordingly, pursuant to the Plan Asset Regulations, only Shares purchased by a Plan, and not an interest in the underlying assets held in the Trust, should be treated as assets of the Plan, for purposes of applying the “fiduciary responsibility” rules of ERISA and the “prohibited transaction” rules of ERISA and the Code. Fiduciaries of plans subject to Other Law should consult legal counsel to determine whether there would be a similar result under the Other Law. 
 Investment by Certain Retirement Plans    Code section 408(m) provides that the acquisition of a “collectible” by an individual retirement account (“IRA”) or a participant-directed account maintained under any plan that is tax-qualified under Code section 401(a) (“Tax Qualified Account”) is treated as a taxable distribution from the account to the owner of the IRA, or to the participant for whom the Tax Qualified Account is maintained, of an amount equal to the cost to the account of acquiring the collectible.   The term “collectible” is defined to include, with certain exceptions, “any metal or gem”. The IRS has issued several private letter rulings to the effect that a purchase by an IRA, or by a participant-directed account under a Code section 401(a) plan, of publicly-traded Shares in a trust holding precious metals will not be treated as resulting in a taxable distribution to the IRA owner or Tax Qualified Account participant under Code section 408(m). However the private letter rulings provide that, if any of the Shares so purchased are distributed from the IRA or Tax Qualified

      Account to the IRA owner or Tax Qualified Account participant, or if any precious metal is received by such IRA or Tax Qualified Account upon the redemption of any of the Shares purchased by it, the Shares or precious metal so distributed will be subject to federal income tax in the year of distribution, to the extent provided under the applicable provisions of Code sections 408(d), 408(m) or 402. Accordingly, potential IRA or Tax Qualified Account investors are urged to consult with their own professional advisors concerning the treatment of an investment in Shares under Code section 408(m).
