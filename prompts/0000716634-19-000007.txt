Business Segment / Unit | Our Commercial Brands | Country | Description | Website Link 
Cinema Exhibition / All Countries | | United States, Australia, New Zealand | Our Reading Cinemas tradename is derived from our over 180 year history as the “Reading Railroad” featured on the Monopoly game board. Under this brand, we deliver beyond-the-home entertainment (principally mainstream movies and alternative content and attendant food and beverage) across our three operating jurisdictions. All our cinemas are equipped with the latest state-of-the-art digital equipment, and 19 Reading Cinemas feature at least one TITAN LUXE, TITAN XC or IMAX premium auditorium. | Reading Cinemas US Reading Cinemas AU Reading Cinemas NZ 
 | United States | Since its opening in 1989, our New York City Angelika Film Center has and consistently continues to be one of the most popular and influential arthouse cinemas in the U.S., featuring principally independent and foreign films. To date, we have expanded our Angelika Film Center Group to include 5 other Angelikas: two in the Dallas area, two in the Washington DC area and one in San Diego, CA. We are actively looking for more locations. | Angelika Film Center 
 | United States | In 2017, our Consolidated Theatres celebrated 100 years of providing cinematic entertainment in the state of Hawaii. We are the oldest and largest circuit in Hawaii with 9 cinemas on the islands of Oahu and Maui, including our new state-of-the-art 8-screen concept cinema: Olino by Consolidated Theatres in West Oahu. | Consolidated Theatres

﻿ | | United States | Our City Cinemas circuit, which consists of five cinemas in the Manhattan area of New York City features an eclectic mix of programming, from mainstream blockbusters to independent films. | City Cinemas 
Real Estate / Leasing | | United States | Our 44 Union Square property – the historic Tammany Hall, located overlooking Union Square in New York City -- is currently in the final stages of a complete re-development. We are currently in exclusive lease negotiations for long term leases with respect to approximately 90% of the net rentable area of the building and, while no assurances can be given, it is currently anticipated that our base building will be ready for tenant improvement work before the end of the second quarter of this year. | 44 Union Square
 | Australia | Located on 203,287 square feet of land in suburban Brisbane, the center is currently comprised of approximately 146,905 square feet of net rentable area and is 98% leased. At the end of 2017, we completed a major expansion that added a new 8-screen Reading Cinemas with TITAN LUXE, an additional 10,150 square feet (943m2) of restaurant tenant space and 124 parking spaces. | Newmarket Village 
 | Australia | Anchored by a 10-screen Reading Cinemas, Auburn/Redyard is an outdoor retail center located in a suburb of Sydney. The center is currently comprised of approximately 519,992 square feet of land and 75,492 square feet of net rentable area, serviced by a 727 space subterranean parking garage, and is 83% leased. In 2018, we added to the center approximately 20,870 square foot of land currently improved with a 16,830 square foot office building, rented to Telstra through July 2022, and over the past two years have added an additional 15,000 rentable square feet of fully leased restaurant and retail space. | Auburn/Redyard 
 | Australia | Anchored by a six-screen Reading Cinemas, Cannon Park is located in Townsville, Australia, and is currently comprised of 245,266 square feet of land and 104,744 square feet of net rentable area, which is currently 85% leased. We are working on plans to add approximately 13,100 square feet of net rentable area to the center. | Cannon Park Townsville 
 | Australia | Anchored by a 10-screen Reading Cinema and four F&B or retail tenancies, the Belmont Common is located in Perth, Australia, and is currently comprised of 103,204 square feet of land and 59,395 square feet of net rentable area, which is currently 96% leased. | The Belmont Common

﻿ | New Zealand | Located in the heart of Wellington – New Zealand’s capital city – this center is comprised of 161,071 square feet of land situated proximate to the Te Papa Tongarewa Museum (attracting over 1.5 million visitors annually), across the street from the site of Wellington’s newly announced convention center (estimated to open its doors in 2022) and at a major public transit hub. Damage from the 2016 earthquake necessitated demolition of our nine-story parking garage at the site, and unrelated seismic issues have caused us to close portions of the existing cinema and retail structure while we reevaluate the center for redevelopment as an entertainment themed urban center with a major food and grocery component. Wellington continues to be rated as one of the top cities in the world in which to live, and we continue to believe that the Courtenay Central site is located in one of the most vibrant and growing commercial and entertainment sections of Wellington. | Courtenay Central
Real Estate / Live Theatre | United States | We continue to operate three (3) off-Broadway live theatres, one (1) in Chicago and two (2) in Manhattan, New York, under the Liberty Theatres tradename. In 2018, we entered into a license with Audible, a subsidiary of Amazon, pursuant to which our Minetta Lane Theatre serves as Audible’s live theatre home in New York City. | Liberty Theatres 

  ﻿
 We synergistically bring together cinema based entertainment and real estate and believe that these two business segments complement one another, as our cinemas have historically provided the steady cash flows that allow us to be opportunistic in acquiring and holding real estate assets (including non-income producing land) and support our real estate development activities.  Our real estate allows us to develop an asset base that we believe will stand the test of time and one that is capable of providing financial  leverage. More specifically, the combination of these two segments provides a variety of business advantages including the following: 

· | Cinema Anchor Tenancy. Cinemas can be used as anchors for larger retail developments (referred to as entertainment-themed centers, or “ETCs”), and our involvement in the cinema business can give us an advantage over other real estate developers or redevelopers who must identify and negotiate with third party anchor tenants. We have used cinemas to create our own anchors at our five (5) ETCs. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Reduced Pressure to Deliver Cinema Business Growth. Pure cinema operators can encounter financial difficulty as demands upon them to produce cinema-based earnings growth tempt them into reinvesting their cash flow into increasingly marginal cinema sites, overpaying for existing cinemas or entering into high-rent leases. While we believe that there will continue to be attractive opportunities to acquire cinema assets and/or to develop upper-end specialty type theaters in the future, we do not feel pressure to build or acquire cinemas for the sake of adding units or building gross cinema revenues. This strategy has, over the years, allowed us to acquire cinemas at multiples of trailing theater cash flow below those paid by third parties in recent acquisitions. We intend to focus our use of cash flow on our real estate development and operating activities, to the extent that attractive cinema opportunities are not available to us or that such funds are not needed for reinvestment to maintain our cinemas in a competitive position. In 2018, we invested approximately $24.0 million in the upgrading and repositioning of our historic cinema assets or adding new cinemas, and approximately $30.7 million in the acquisition or development of our non-cinema real estate assets. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Flexibility in Property Use. We are always open to the idea of converting an entertainment property to another use, if there is a higher and better use for the property, or to sell individual assets if an attractive opportunity presents itself. Our Union Square property, which is in the final stages of redevelopment was initially acquired as an entertainment property. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿
 Insofar as we are aware, we are the only publicly traded company in the world to apply this two-track, synergistic approach to the cinema and real estate development businesses on an international basis.  None of the major cinema exhibition companies (other than Marcus Theatres) have any material landholdings as they operate predominantly on a leased-facility model.
 ﻿
 Business Mix and Impact of Foreign Currency Fluctuations 
 ﻿
 We have worked to maintain a balance both between our cinema and real estate assets and between our U.S. and our Australian and New Zealand assets. In 2018, we invested approximately $40.6 million in our U.S. assets: $23.4 million for the development of our real estate assets (principally construction of our Union Square property) and $17.2 million for the improvements of our cinema assets (principally upgrading our offerings at our existing cinemas).  We invested approximately $12.3 million in our Australian assets: $6.4 million for the development of our real estate assets (principally at our Auburn (Sydney) shopping centers), and $6.0 million for the development of our cinema assets (principally renovations of our cinemas at Auburn, Elizabeth, and Charlestown and the upgrade of certain other cinemas).  We invested approximately $1.8 million in our New Zealand assets:  $1.0 million for the development of 

  - 14 -

real estate assets (principally towards the redevelopment of our Courtenay Central assets), and approximately $817,000 for the development of cinema assets (principally upgrades).    ﻿
 As shown in the chart set forth the International Business Risks section below, exchange rates for the currencies of these jurisdictions have varied, sometimes materially.  These ratios naturally have an impact on our revenues and asset values, which are reported in USD.  Notwithstanding these fluctuations, we continue to believe that, over the long term, operating in Australia and New Zealand is a prudent diversification of risk.  Australia has been identified by the United Nations as among the Top 10 countries in the World in terms of natural resources per person. Deutsche Bank has twice named Wellington the best place in the world to live. In 2013, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development rated Australia as the best place to live and work in the world. In our view, the economies of Australian and New Zealand are stable economies and their lifestyles support our entertainment/lifestyle focus. 
 ﻿
 At December 31, 2018, the book value of our assets was $439.0 million, and, as of that same date, we had a consolidated stockholders’ book equity of $180.5 million. Calculated based on book value, $138.9 million, or 32% of our assets, relate to our cinema exhibition activities and $263.8 million, or 60%, of our assets, relate to our real estate activities.  
 ﻿

    ﻿
 For additional segment financial information, please see Note 1 – Description of Business and Segment Reporting to our 2018 consolidated financial statements.    ﻿
 We have diversified our assets among three countries: the United States, Australia, and New Zealand. Based on book value, at December 31, 2018, we had approximately 50% of our assets in the United States, 36% in Australia and 14% in New Zealand compared to 45%, 40%, and 15% respectively, at the end of 2017. This increase in U.S. assets is principally due to our investments in the redevelopment of Union Square and the upgrades to our domestic cinema assets, as well as the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar compared to the Australian and the New Zealand dollar.
 ﻿
 At December 31, 2018, we had cash and cash equivalents of $13.1 million, which are treated as a corporate assets. Our cash included $7.6 million denominated in U.S. dollars, $3.5 million (AU $4.9 million) in Australian dollars, and $2.0 million (NZ$3.0 million) in New Zealand dollars. We had total worldwide non-current assets of $408.7 million, distributed as follows:  $203.8 million in the United States, $147.4 million (AU$209.2 million) in Australia and $57.5 million (NZ$85.7 million) in New Zealand.  We had $55.6 unused capacity of available and unrestricted corporate credit facilities at December 31, 2018.
 ﻿
 For 2018, our gross revenues in the United States, Australia, and New Zealand were $165.8 million, $111.7 million, and $31.9 million, respectively, compared to $143.8 million, $106.5 million, and $29.7 million for 2017.  All three countries posted revenue increases in 2018 as a result of higher cinema attendance in all three of our circuits.

  ﻿
 In January of 2019, we acquired our first cinema in Tasmania, a well-established 4 screen cinema (with liquor license) in Devonport, bringing our current cinema count up to 60.  In addition, as of today, we have entered into four lease agreements, providing for the development of an additional 25 state-of-the-art screens.  While no assurances can be given, the completion of these four new complexes is anticipated to increase our cinema count to 64 before the end of 2021.
 ﻿
 We continue to focus on upgrading our existing cinemas and developing new cinema opportunities to provide our customers with premium offerings, including luxury seating, state-of-the-art presentation including sound, lounges, cafés and bar service, and other amenities.  Since 2017 and continuing through 2018, we increased the number of auditoriums featuring recliner seating from 58 to 136. In addition, we added large format TITAN XC or LUXE screen offerings to 18 of our cinemas. Our circuit has been completely converted to digital projection and sound systems. In 2018, we upgraded two of our auditoriums to feature Dolby ATMOS sound which we consider to be the best in the industry at this time.
 ﻿
 Attendance and gross box office was significantly higher for the exhibition industry in the U.S., Australia and New Zealand for 2018, compared to 2017. We believe that the cinema exhibition business will continue to generate increasing cash flows in the years ahead, even in recessionary or inflationary environments, because people will continue to spend a reasonable portion of their entertainment dollars on entertainment outside of the home.  When compared to other forms of outside-the-home entertainment, movies continue to be a popular and competitively priced option.  We believe that the advent of an array of streaming and mobile video services is a threat to traditional in-home forms of entertainment (such as traditional cable and satellite providers), the creation of new sources of program production will ultimately be beneficial to our industry, as cinema exhibition becomes an increasingly important point of differentiation for the marketing of such product.
 ﻿
 Recognizing that the cinema exhibition business is considered a mature business, we continue to see growth opportunities in our cinema exhibition business principally from (i) the enhancement of our existing cinemas, (ii) the development in select markets of art and specialty cinemas, (iii) the development of new state-of-the-art cinemas on land that we already own or may in the future acquire, and (iv) the development of new mainstream cinemas in selected markets. While we continue to consider possible opportunities in 

  - 16 -

third party developments, we prefer, where possible, to put our capital to work in properties that we own rather than take on potentially burdensome lease obligations with their built-in rent increases and pass-throughs and their dependence on third party shopping center operators.
 ﻿
 We continue to expand and upgrade our circuits on an opportunistic basis. Our philosophy is not one of growth at any cost and our goal is not to have more screens than anyone else. Rather, our goal is to have high quality, consistently grossing cinemas, and to grow on a steady and sustainable basis. During 2018, we continued working on the refurbishment of several of our cinema locations including Manville and Mililani in the U.S., and Charlestown, Elizabeth, and Auburn in the Australia and New Zealand circuits.  At the end of 2017, we opened a new cinema at our Newmarket Village Shopping Center in Brisbane, Australia, and re-opened our Cal Oaks cinema, located in Murrieta, California which now features our new “Spotlight” level of service in 6 out of the 17 auditoriums.  “Spotlight” puts focus directly on our customers by providing an in-auditorium, waitered, enhanced F&B experience for their enjoyment.  We also upgraded 54 of our screens to luxury seating and extended our enhanced food offerings to 25 of our cinemas in 2017.  In 2016, we opened an eight-screen, state-of-the-art cinema, branded Olino by Consolidated Theatres, our ninth theatre and first to break ground since 2001 in the state of Hawaii.  In 2015, we opened a new state-of-the-art cinema (eight screens) in Auckland, New Zealand, completed the renovation and rebranding as an “Angelika” luxury art cinema of our conventional cinema at the Carmel Mountain Plaza in San Diego, California, completely renovated our fourteen-screen Harbourtown cinema in Queensland, Australia, and added the first IMAX screen to our circuit. 
 ﻿
 Since 2015, we have consistently executed our strategic priority of upgrading the food and beverage menu at a number of our U.S. cinemas. We are focused on the renovation and upgrading of our existing U.S. cinemas, along the lines of our Carmel Mountain cinema.  Working with Bruce Seidel (veteran Food Network executive) of Hot Lemon Productions and chef Santos Loo, we are continuing to upgrade our food and beverage offerings.  During 2017, we created our “Spotlight” service concept, which we implemented at our Cal Oaks cinema during 2018.  At year-end 2018, we currently have beer and wine, and in some cases liquor, licenses for 14 of our venues in the U.S. and are in the application process for an additional 5 venues.  As a result we are currently offering alcoholic beverages at 12 of our U.S. cinemas and two of our live theatres. In our international cinema operations, we offer alcoholic beverages for 11 of our cinemas in Australia and five of our cinemas in New Zealand (which includes the joint ventures).
 Operating Information

--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | fee interest in our Union Square property, previously used by us as a live theater venue and for rental to third parties and now in the final stages of redevelopment for retail and office uses;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | our ETCs in Sydney (Redyard Center), Brisbane (Newmarket Village Center), Townsville (Cannon Park), Perth (Belmont) and Wellington (Courtenay Central), each of which includes a Reading Cinema;

--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | cash and cash equivalents, aggregating $13.1 million.
--+------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿
 Although we operate cinemas in three jurisdictions, the general nature of our operations and operating strategies does not vary materially from jurisdiction-to-jurisdiction. In each jurisdiction, our gross receipts are primarily from box office receipts, food and beverage sales, and screen advertising. Our ancillary revenue is created principally from theater rentals (for example, for film festivals and special events), and ancillary programming (such as concerts and sporting events).
 ﻿
 Our cinemas generated approximately 64% of their 2018 revenue from box office receipts.  Ticket prices vary by location, and in selected locations we offer reduced rates for senior citizens, children and, in certain markets, military and students.
 ﻿


  - 17 -

Show times and features are placed in advertisements on our various websites, on internet sites and, in some markets, in local newspapers. We are increasing our presence in social media, thereby, reducing our dependency on print advertising.  Film distributors may also advertise certain feature films in various print, radio and television media, as well as on the internet, and distributors generally pay those costs. 
 ﻿
 F&B sales accounted for approximately 29% of our total 2018 cinema revenue. Although certain cinemas have licenses for the sale and on-premises consumption of alcoholic beverages, historically F&B products have been primarily popcorn, candy, and soda. This is changing, as more of our theaters are offering expanded food and beverage offerings.  One of our strategic focuses is to upgrade our existing cinemas with expanded F&B offerings.
 ﻿
 Screen advertising and other revenue contribute approximately 7% of our total 2018 cinema revenue.  With the exception of certain rights that we have retained to sell to local advertisers, generally speaking, we are not in the screen advertising business and nationally recognized screen-advertising companies’ contract with us for the right to show such advertising on our screens.
 ﻿
 Management of Cinemas
 ﻿
 With the exception of our three unconsolidated cinemas, we manage our cinemas with executives located in Los Angeles and Manhattan in the U.S.; Melbourne, Australia; and Wellington, New Zealand.  Our two New Zealand Rialto cinemas are owned by a joint venture in which Reading New Zealand is a 50% joint venture partner. While we assist in the booking of these two cinemas, our joint venture partner, Event Cinemas, manages their day-to-day operations.  In addition, we have a passive one-third interest in a 16-screen Brisbane cinema managed by Event Cinemas.
 ﻿
 Licensing and Pricing 
 ﻿
 Film product is available from a variety of sources, ranging from the major film distributors, such as Paramount Pictures, Twentieth Century Fox, Warner Bros, Buena Vista Pictures (Disney), Sony Pictures Releasing, Universal Pictures and Lionsgate, to a variety of smaller independent film distributors.  In Australia and New Zealand, some of those major distributors distribute through local unaffiliated distributors. Worldwide, the major film distributors dominate the market for mainstream conventional films.  In the U.S., art and specialty film is distributed through the art and specialty divisions of these major distributors, such as Fox Searchlight and Sony Pictures Classics, and through independent distributors such as A24. Film payment terms are generally based upon an agreed-upon percentage of box office receipts that will vary from film-to-film.
 ﻿
 Competition    ﻿
 Film is allocated by the applicable distributor among competitive cinemas.  Accordingly, from time-to-time, we may be unable to license every film that we desire to play. In the Australian and New Zealand markets, we generally have access to all film product in the market. 
 ﻿
 Competition for films may be intense, depending upon the number of cinemas in a particular competitive market. Our ability to obtain top grossing first run feature films may be adversely impacted by our comparatively small size, and the limited number of screens and markets that we can supply to distributors. Moreover, because of the dramatic consolidation of screens into the hands of a few very large and powerful exhibitors such as Cineworld (the new owners of Regal), AMC (including the newly acquired Carmike), Cinemark, and Galaxy Cinemas, who control 64% of the North American market, these mega-exhibition companies are in a position to offer distributors access to many more screens in major markets than we can.  Also, the majors have a significant number of markets where they operate without material competition, meaning that the distributors have no alternative exhibitor for their films in these markets.  Accordingly, distributors may decide to give preference to these mega-exhibitors when it comes to licensing top-grossing films, rather than deal with independents such as ourselves. The situation is different in Australia and New Zealand, where typically every major multiplex cinema has access to all of the film currently in distribution, regardless of the ownership of that multiplex cinema.  However, on the reverse side, we have suffered somewhat in these markets from competition from boutique operators, who are able to book top grossing commercial films for limited runs, thus increasing competition for customers wishing to view such top grossing films.
 ﻿
 The availability of state-of-the-art technology and/or luxury seating can also be a factor in the preference of one cinema over another. In recent periods, a number of cinemas have opened or re-opened featuring luxury seating and/or expanded food and beverage service, including the sale of alcoholic beverages and food served to the seat.  We have, for a number of years, offered alcoholic beverages in certain of our Australia and New Zealand cinemas and at certain of our Angelika Film Centers in the U.S.  We are currently working to upgrade the seating and food and beverage offerings (including the offering of alcoholic beverages) at a number of our existing cinemas. We now offer alcoholic beverages at 28 of our worldwide cinemas.
 ﻿
 The film exhibition markets in the United States, Australia, and New Zealand are to a certain extent dominated by a limited number of major exhibition companies.  The principal exhibitors in the United States are AMC (with 11,247 screens in 1,027 cinemas, which includes the information of newly acquired Carmike), Regal (with 7,315 screens in 561 cinemas), recently acquired by Cineworld 

  - 18 -

Group, the U.K.’s largest cinema operator, and Cinemark (with 4,561 screens in 339 cinemas).  As of December 31, 2018, we were the 11th largest exhibitor with 1% of the box office in the United States with 245 screens in 27 cinemas under management.
 ﻿
 The principal exhibitors in Australia are Greater Union, which does business under the Event Cinemas name (a subsidiary of Amalgamated Holdings Limited) (“Event”), Hoyts Cinemas (“Hoyts”), and Village Cinemas (“Village”). The major exhibitors control approximately 78% of the total cinema box office: Event 43%, Hoyts 22%, and Village 13%.  Event has 566 screens nationally, Hoyts 354 screens, and Village 210 screens. By comparison, our 149 screens (excluding any partnership theaters) represent approximately 7% of the total box office.
 ﻿
 The principal exhibitors in New Zealand are Event Cinemas with 116 screens nationally and Hoyts with 70 screens.  Reading has 54 screens (excluding its interest in unconsolidated joint ventures).  The major exhibitors in New Zealand control approximately 52% of the total box office: Event 31% and Hoyts 21%.  Reading has 16% of the market (Event and Reading market share figures exclude any partnership theaters) and we were the third largest exhibitor in New Zealand.
 ﻿
 In Australia and New Zealand, the industry is somewhat vertically integrated in that Roadshow Film Distributors, a subsidiary of Village, serves as a distributor of film in Australia and New Zealand for Warner Brothers.
 ﻿
 Many of our competitors have substantial financial resources which could allow them to operate in a more competitive manner than us.
 ﻿
 In-Home, Streaming and Mobile Device Competition
 ﻿
 The “in-home,” streaming and mobile device entertainment industry has experienced significant leaps in recent periods in both the quality and affordability of in-home and mobile device entertainment systems and in the accessibility to, and quality of, entertainment programming through cable, satellite, internet distribution channels, and Blu-ray/DVD. The success of these alternative distribution channels and the entrance of new sources of product (like Netflix and Amazon) who are producing product competitive with films produced for theatrical release puts additional pressure on film distributors to reduce and/or eliminate the time period between theatrical and secondary release dates.  With the acquisition of Fox, Disney is now poised to enter this market.
 To a certain extent, it appears that consumers are willing to choose convenience over presentation quality.  We are responding to this challenge generally by increasing the comfort and service levels available at our cinemas, by offering convenient on-line ticket reservations services with guaranteed seating, by investing in larger screens and enhanced audio, by offering more specialized and alternative product to our audiences and by providing value for the movie goer’s dollar. We are focusing on the fact that going to the movies is a social experience, and we are working to make that experience the best that it can be.  Also, that we must differentiate ourselves from other forms of video entertainment by emphasizing the special nature of seeing video presentations in a cinema environment and by developing ways to position ourselves to take advantage in the increased output of film and feature product.  These are issues common to both our U.S. and international cinema operations.  
 ﻿
 Competitive issues are discussed in detail under the caption, Item 1A – Risk Factors.
 ﻿
 Seasonality
 ﻿
 Major films are generally released to coincide with holidays. With the exception of Christmas and New Year’s Days, this fact provides some balancing of our revenue because there is no material overlap between holidays in the United States and those in Australia and New Zealand. Distributors will delay, in certain cases, releases in Australia and New Zealand to take advantage of Australian and New Zealand holidays that are not celebrated in the United States. However, the deferral of releases is becoming increasingly less common, given the need to address internet and other channels of distribution that operate on a worldwide basis.  
 ﻿
 REAL ESTATE
 ﻿
 Overall
 ﻿
 We engage in real estate development and the ownership and rental or licensing to third parties of retail, commercial and live theater assets. We own the fee interests in all of our live theaters, and in 12 of our cinemas (as presented in the preceding table within the “Cinema Exhibition” section).  Our real estate business creates long-term value for our stockholders through the continuous improvement and development of our investment and operating properties, including our ETCs. 
 ﻿
 Our real estate activities have historically consisted principally of: 

· | the ownership of fee or long-term leasehold interests in properties used in our cinema exhibition activities or which were acquired for the development of cinemas or cinema-based real estate development projects;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the acquisition of fee interests in land for general real estate development;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the licensing to production companies of our live theaters; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------

 
  - 19 -


· | the redevelopment of our existing fee-owned cinema or live theater sites to their highest and best use.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ﻿
 Over 2016 and 2017, we added 25,635 square feet of newly constructed net rentable space to our existing ETCs (calculated exclusive of cinema space), of which 24,924 square feet has been rented.
 ﻿
 In light of the geographic reach of our business, and the highly localized nature of the real estate business, we have historically made use of third party contractors to provide on-site management of our real estate development and management activities. We have begun, however, in recent periods to selectively build our internal resources in this regard, concentrating on Australia and New Zealand where we have increased our overall real estate team from 3 to 7 full time employees over the last 3 years. 
 ﻿
 In 2016, we began the construction phase of the redevelopment of our Union Square property into approximately 73,322 square feet of net leasable area (inclusive of anticipated BOMA adjustments), comprised of retail and office space. While no assurances can be given, we currently anticipate that the building will be ready for the commencement of the construction of tenant improvements during the second quarter of 2019.  We are currently negotiating, on an exclusive basis, leases representing approximately 90% of the net leasable area of the building.  A short video on this project can be seen at www.44unionsquare.com.
 ﻿
 Regarding our Cinemas 1,2,3 property in Manhattan, we have received the consent of the 25% minority member of the ownership entity for the redevelopment of the property. We are evaluating the potential to redevelop the property as a mixed use property.  While we are still talking with the owner of the adjacent property about a possible joint venture development, we have not been able to come to an agreement as to the terms of that joint venture. Accordingly, we have shifted our strategic plan with respect to that property and have commenced the master-planning for a go-it-alone development.  The Cinemas 1,2,3, is a cash flowing contributor to our domestic cinema operations. On August 31, 2016, we secured a new three-year mortgage loan ($20.0 million) with Valley National Bank, with a one year option to extend through August 31, 2020, the proceeds of which were used to repay the then existing mortgage on the property, and to repay certain inter-company indebtedness, and for working capital purposes.  
 ﻿
 On April 11, 2016, we purchased for $11.2 million a 24,000 square foot office building with 72 parking spaces located at 5995 Sepulveda Boulevard in Culver City, California.  We currently use approximately 50% of the leasable area for our headquarters offices and endeavor to lease the remainder to unaffiliated third parties.  Culver City has in recent years developed as a center of entertainment and high-tech activity in Los Angeles County. We moved into the building in February, 2017, and have obtained $8.4 million in financing on the property pursuant to a 10-year, fixed rate mortgage loan at an interest rate of 4.64% per annum and in June 2017 we obtained an additional $1.5 million in financing due to a reappraisal of the property, at an interest rate of 4.44%. Currently, we own essentially all of the office space from which we conduct our executive and administrative operations. All of our leasehold interests are cinema operating properties.
 ﻿
 All of our leasehold interests are cinema operating properties.
 ﻿
 Overseas, on December 23, 2015, we acquired two adjoining properties in Townsville, Queensland, Australia for a total of $24.1 million (AU$33.4 million) comprising approximately 5.6 acres. The total gross leasable area of the two properties, the Cannon Park City Centre and the Cannon Park Discount Centre, is 133,000 square feet.  Our multiplex cinema at the Cannon Park City Centre is the anchor tenant of that center.  This acquisition is consistent with our business plan to own, where practical, the land underlying our entertainment assets. We operate these two (2) properties as a single ETC.  This acquisition was funded internally.   For additional information, see Note 4 – Real Estate Transactions. 
 ﻿
 We continue to work on the expansion and upgrading of our Auburn/Redyard in Sydney, Australia and Newmarket Village in Brisbane, Australia and to master-plan the expansion and enhancement of our Cannon Park ETC in Townsville, Australia through the expansion or improvement of our Reading Cinemas at each of these centres and additional food and beverage focused space.
 ﻿
 At Auburn/RedYard, since the beginning of 2016, we have constructed and entered into leases representing approximately 15,000 square feet of additional retail space, which increased the square footage of that center from approximately 117,000 to approximately 132,000 square feet.  Of this 15,000 square feet, 9,600 square feet was completed in 2016, and the remaining 5,900 square feet was completed in Q4 2017.  In 2018, we acquired a 20,870 square foot in-fill property, currently improved with a 16,830 square foot office building, leased to Telstra through July 2022. This increased our frontage on Parramatta Road to 1,620 of uninterrupted square feet.    The center is now comprised of 519,992 square feet of land, 75,492 square feet of retail improvements, surface parking for 367 vehicles and subterranean parking for 727 vehicles and is 83% leased.    The center also has approximately 10,586 square foot of additional land available for development.  This expansion was funded internally.
 ﻿
 At Newmarket Village, we added a state-of-the art eight-screen Reading Cinema, 10,150 square feet of additional retail space and 124 additional parking spaces.   On November 30, 2015, we acquired an approximately 23,000 square foot parcel adjacent to our tenant Coles supermarket.  This property is currently improved with an office building, which is now fully leased.  These leases have early development provisions allowing us to terminate these arrangements in connection with a redevelopment of the property.  We intend to ultimately demolish this office building and to integrate this parcel into Newmarket Village.  This will increase our Newmarket 

  - 20 -

Village footprint from approximately 204,000 square feet to approximately 227,000 square feet.  Our Newmarket Village project was funded internally and is currently approximately 98% leased.
 ﻿
 Located in the heart of Wellington – New Zealand’s capital city – this center is comprised of 161,071 square feet of land situated proximate to the Te Papa Tongarewa Museum (attracting over 1.5 million visitors annually), across the street from the site of Wellington’s newly announced convention center (estimated to open its doors in 2022) and at a major public transit hub.   Damage from the 2016 earthquake necessitated demolition of our nine-story parking garage at the site, and unrelated seismic issues have caused us to close portions of the existing cinema and retail structure while we reevaluate the center for redevelopment as an entertainment themed urban center with a major food and grocery component.   
     Wellington continues to be rated as one of the top cities in the world in which to live, and we continue to believe that the Courtenay Central site is located in one of the most vibrant and growing commercial and entertainment sections of  Wellington.
 ﻿
 In addition to certain historic railroad properties (such as our 6.8 acre Viaduct Property in downtown Philadelphia and certain adjacent commercial properties) and certain expansion space associated with our existing ETCs, we have two unimproved properties that we acquired for, and are currently being held for, development:  (i) our 50% interest in a 202-acre parcel in Coachella, California (near the grounds where the Coachella Music Festival is held), currently zoned for residential and mixed-use uses, and (ii) our 70.4–acre parcel in Manukau, a suburb of Auckland, New Zealand (located adjacent to the Auckland Airport) currently zoned for a mixture of light and heavy industrial uses.
 ﻿
 Our Coachella property was acquired as a long term land hold in a foreclosure auction by the Resolution Trust Corporation as the liquidator of the lender with the first mortgage on the property.   The zoning has been established and the property freed of a burdensome development agreement.   We are monitoring developments in the area, and believe that this property is likely a candidate for sale.   Development activity in the vicinity appears to be strengthening.  
 ﻿
 In 2016, the Auckland City Council revised the zoning of the agricultural portion of our property in Manukau (approximately 64.0 acres) to light industrial uses.  The remaining 6.4 acres of our Manukau property were already zoned for heavy industrial use.  Light industrial uses include certain manufacturing, production, logistic, transportation, warehouse and wholesale distribution activities and, on an ancillary basis, certain office, retail and educational uses. Now that our zoning enhancement goal has been achieved, we are working with other major landowners in the area on the development of a master plan for the construction of needed infrastructure works, while we continue to develop our long range plans for the property.
 ﻿
 While we report our real estate as a separate segment, it has historically operated as an integral portion of our overall business and, historically, has principally been in support of that business.  We have, however, acquired or developed certain properties that do not currently have any cinema or other entertainment component.
 ﻿
 Our real estate activities, holdings and developments are described in greater detail in Item 2 – Properties. 
 ﻿
 EMPLOYEES
 ﻿
 As of December 31, 2018, we had 104 full-time executive and administrative employees, 113 live theatre employees, 8 Real Estate employees and 2,719 cinema employees. A small number of our cinema employees in New Zealand are union members, as are our projectionists in Hawaii. None of our Australian-based employees or other employees are subject to union contracts. Overall, we are of the view that the existence of these collective-bargaining agreements does not materially increase our costs of labor or our ability to compete.

  ﻿
 The above list is not necessarily exhaustive, as business is by definition unpredictable and risky, and it is subject to influence by numerous factors outside of our control, such as changes in government regulation or policy, competition, interest rates, supply, 

  - 22 -

technological innovation, changes in consumer taste, the weather, and the extent to which consumers in our markets have the economic wherewithal to spend money on beyond-the-home entertainment. Refer to Item 1A Risk factors for more information.
 ﻿
 Given the variety and unpredictability of the factors that will ultimately influence our businesses and our results of operation, it naturally follows that no guarantees can be given that any of our forward-looking statements will ultimately prove to be correct.  Actual results will undoubtedly vary and there is no guarantee as to how our securities will perform either when considered in isolation or when compared to other securities or investment opportunities.
 ﻿
 Finally, we undertake no obligation to update publicly or to revise any of our forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required under applicable law.  Accordingly, you should always note the date to which our forward-looking statements speak.
 ﻿
 Additionally, certain of the presentations included in this annual report may contain “non-US GAAP financial measures.”  In such case, a reconciliation of this information to our US GAAP financial statements will be made available in connection with such statements.
