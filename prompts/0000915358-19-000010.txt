 Overview 
 ﻿
 SigmaTron is a Delaware corporation, which was organized on November 16, 1993, and commenced operations when it became the successor to all of the assets and liabilities of SigmaTron L.P., an Illinois limited partnership, through a reorganization on February 8, 1994.
 ﻿
 The Company operates in one business segment as an independent provider of electronic manufacturing services (“EMS”), which includes printed circuit board assemblies and completely assembled (box-build) electronic products.  In connection with the production of assembled products, the Company also provides services to its customers, including (1) automatic and manual assembly and testing of products; (2) material sourcing and procurement; (3) manufacturing and test engineering support; (4) design services; (5) warehousing and distribution services; and (6) assistance in obtaining product approval from governmental and other regulatory bodies.  The Company provides these manufacturing services through an international network of facilities located in the United States, Mexico, China, Vietnam and Taiwan.
 ﻿
 The Company provides manufacturing and assembly services ranging from the assembly of individual components to the assembly and testing of box-build electronic products.  The Company has the ability to produce assemblies requiring mechanical as well as electronic capabilities.  The products assembled by the

Company are then incorporated into finished products sold in various industries, particularly industrial electronics, consumer electronics and medical/life sciences.  In some instances the Company manufactures the completed finished product for its customers.
 ﻿
 The Company operates manufacturing facilities in Elk Grove Village, Illinois United States of America (“U.S.”); Union City, California U.S.; Acuna, Chihuahua and Tijuana, Mexico; Suzhou, China; and Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.  In addition, the Company maintains an International Procurement Office (“IPO”) in Taipei, Taiwan.  The Company also provides design services in Elgin, Illinois.  The Company has an information technology office in Taichung, Taiwan.  
 ﻿
 The Company’s international footprint provides our customers with flexibility within the Company to manufacture in China, Mexico, Vietnam or the U.S.  We believe this strategy will continue to serve the Company well as its customers continuously evaluate their supply chain strategies.
 ﻿
 Products and Services
 ﻿
 The Company provides a broad range of electronic and electromechanical manufacturing related outsourcing solutions for its customers.  These solutions incorporate the Company’s knowledge and expertise in the EMS industry to provide its customers with an international network of manufacturing facilities, advanced manufacturing technologies, complete supply chain management, responsive and flexible customer service, as well as product design, test and engineering support.  The Company’s EMS solutions are available from inception of product concept through the ultimate delivery of a finished product.  Such technologies and services include the following:
 ﻿
 Manufacturing and Testing Services: The Company’s core business is the assembly and testing of all types of electronic printed circuit board assemblies (“PCBA”) and often incorporating these PCBAs into electronic modules used in all types of devices and products that depend on electronics for their operation.  This assembly work utilizes state of the art manufacturing and test equipment to deliver highly reliable products to the Company’s customers.  The Company supports new product introduction (“NPI”), low volume / high mix as well as high volume/ low mix assembly work at all levels of complexity.  Assembly services include pin-through-hole (“PTH”) components, surface mount (“SMT”) components, including ball grid array (“BGA”), part-on-part components, conformal coating, parylene coating and others.  Test services include and are not limited to, in-circuit, automated optical inspection (“AOI”), functional, burn-in, hi-pot and boundary scan.  From simple component assembly through the most complicated industry testing, the Company offers most of the services required to build electronic devices commercially available in the market today.
 ﻿
 Design Services: To complement the manufacturing services it offers its customers, the Company also offers design for manufacturing (“DFM”), and design for test (“DFT”) review services to help customers ensure that the products they have designed are optimized for production and testing.  The Company also offers complete product design services.
 ﻿
 Supply Chain Management: The Company provides complete supply chain management for the procurement of components needed to build customers’ products.  This includes the procurement and management of all types of electronic components and related mechanical parts such as plastics and metals.  The Company’s resources supporting this activity are provided both on a plant specific basis as well as globally through its IPO in Taipei, Taiwan.  Each of its sites is linked together using the same Enterprise Resource Planning (“ERP”) system and custom IScore software tools with real-time on-line visibility for customer access.  The Company procures material from major manufacturers and distributors of electronic parts all over the world.
 ﻿
 The Company relies on numerous third-party suppliers for components used in the Company’s production process.  Certain of these components are available only from single-sources or a limited number of suppliers.  In addition, a customer’s specifications may require the Company to obtain components from a single-source or a small number of suppliers.  In the past twelve months the component marketplace has experienced shortages of various components, which in some cases has delayed delivery of product to customers.  The loss of any such suppliers could have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations.  Further, the Company could operate at a cost disadvantage compared to competitors who have greater direct

buying power from suppliers.  The Company does not enter into long-term purchase agreements with major or single-source suppliers.  The Company believes that short-term purchase orders with its suppliers provides flexibility, given that the Company’s orders are based on the changing needs of its customers.
 ﻿
 Warehousing and Distribution: The Company provides both in-house and third party warehousing, shipping, and customs brokerage for border crossings as part of its service offering.  This includes international shipping, drop shipments to the end customer, as well as, support of inventory optimization activities such as kanban and consignment.
 ﻿
 Green, Sustainability, and Social Responsible Initiatives: The Company supports initiatives that promote sustainability, green environment and social responsibility.  The Company requires its supply chain to meet all government imposed requirements in these areas and helps its customers in achieving effective compliance.  Those include, but are not limited to, Restrictions of Hazardous Substances (“RoHS”), Restriction of Chemicals (“REACH”) and Conflict Minerals regulations. 
 ﻿
 Manufacturing Location and Certifications:  The Company’s manufacturing and warehousing locations are strategically located to support our customers with locations in Elk Grove Village, Illinois U.S.; Union City, California U.S.; Acuna, Chihuahua and Tijuana, Mexico; Suzhou, China and Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.  The Company’s ability to transition manufacturing to lower cost regions without jeopardizing flexibility and service, differentiates it from many competitors.  Manufacturing certifications and registrations are location specific, and include ISO 9001:2015, ISO 14001:2015, IATF 16949:2009, Medical ISO 13485:2016 and FDB Certification, Aerospace AS9100D and International Traffic in Arms Regulations (“ITAR”) certifications.  
 ﻿

 ﻿
 Mexico, Vietnam and China Operations
 ﻿
 The Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Standard Components de Mexico, S.A, a Mexican corporation, is located in Acuna, Coahuila Mexico, a border town across the Rio Grande River from Del Rio, Texas, and is 155 miles west of San Antonio. Standard Components de Mexico, S.A. was incorporated and commenced operation in 1968 and had 806 employees at April 30, 2019.  The Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, AbleMex S.A. de C.V., a Mexican corporation, is located in Tijuana, Baja California Mexico, a border town south of San Diego, California.  AbleMex S.A. de C.V. was incorporated and commenced operations in 2000.  The operation had 364 employees at April 30, 2019.  The Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Digital Appliance Controls de Mexico S.A., a Mexican corporation, operates in Chihuahua, Mexico, located approximately 235 miles from El Paso, Texas.  Digital Appliance Controls de Mexico S.A. was incorporated and commenced operations in 1997.  The operation had 513 employees at April 30, 2019.  The Company believes that one of the key benefits to having operations in Mexico is its access to cost-effective labor resources while having geographic proximity to the United States.
 ﻿
 The Company’s wholly-owned foreign enterprises, Wujiang SigmaTron Electronics Co., Ltd. and SigmaTron Electronic Technology Co., Ltd., are located in Suzhou, China.  The Company has entered into an agreement with governmental authorities in the economic development zone of Wujiang, Jiangsu Province, Peoples Republic of China, pursuant to which the Company became the lessee of a parcel of land of approximately 100 Chinese acres.  The term of the land lease is 50 years.  The Company built a manufacturing plant, office space and dormitories on this site during 2004.  In fiscal year 2015, the China facility expanded and added 40,000 square feet in warehouse and manufacturing.  The total square footage of the facility is 202,000 and the operation had 505 employees as of April 30, 2019.  Both SigmaTron China entities operate at this site. 
 ﻿
 The Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Spitfire Controls (Vietnam) Co. Ltd. is located in Amata Industrial Park, Bien Hoa City, Dong Nai Province, Vietnam, and is 18 miles east of Ho Chi Minh City.  Spitfire Controls (Vietnam) Co. Ltd. was incorporated and commenced operation in 2005 and had 392 employees as of April 30, 2019.
 ﻿
 The Company provides funds for salaries, wages, overhead and capital expenditure items as necessary to operate its wholly-owned Mexican, Vietnamese and Chinese subsidiaries and foreign enterprises and the Taiwan IPO.  The Company provides funding in U.S. Dollars, which are exchanged for Pesos, Dong, Renminbi, and New Taiwan dollars.  The fluctuation of currencies from time to time, without an equal or greater increase in inflation, could have a material impact on the financial results of the Company.  The impact of currency fluctuations for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2019, resulted in net foreign currency transaction losses of approximately $433,742 compared to net foreign currency gains of $125,000 in the prior year.  In fiscal year 2019, the Company paid approximately $53,090,000 to its foreign subsidiaries.
 ﻿

Competition
 ﻿
 The EMS industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid change.  Furthermore, both large and small companies compete in the industry, and many have significantly greater financial resources, more extensive business experience and greater marketing and production capabilities than the Company.  The significant competitive factors in this industry include price, quality, service, timeliness, reliability, the ability to source raw components, and manufacturing and technological capabilities.  The Company believes it can compete on all of these factors.
 ﻿
 Consolidation
 ﻿
 As a result of consolidation and other transactions involving competitors and other companies in the Company’s markets, the Company occasionally reviews potential transactions relating to its business, products and technologies.  Such transactions could include mergers, acquisitions, strategic alliances, joint ventures, licensing agreements, co-promotion agreements, financing arrangements or other types of transactions.  In the future, the Company may choose to enter into these types of or other transactions at any time depending on available sources of financing, and such transactions could have a material impact on the Company’s business, financial condition or operations.
 ﻿
 Governmental Regulations 
 ﻿
 The Company’s operations are subject to certain foreign government, U.S. federal, state and local regulatory requirements relating to, among others, environmental, waste management, labor and health and safety matters.  Management believes that the Company’s business is operated in compliance with all such regulations, which include European regulations known as RoHS and REACH.  RoHS prohibits the use of lead, mercury and certain other specified substances in products being sold into the European Union.  The Company has RoHS-dedicated manufacturing capabilities at all of its manufacturing operations. REACH imposes information reporting requirements on all listed SVHCs (substances of very high concern).  From time-to-time the Company's customers request REACH required information and certifications on the assemblies the Company manufactures for them.  These requests require the Company to gather information from component suppliers to verify the presence and level of mass of any SVHCs greater than 0.1% in the assemblies the Company manufactures based on customer specifications.  If any SVHCs are present at more than 0.1% of the mass of the item, the specific concentration and mass of the SVHC must be reported to proper authorities by the Company's customer.
 ﻿
 The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) introduced reporting requirements for verification of whether the Company directly (or indirectly through suppliers of components) is purchasing the minerals or metals gold, columbite-tantalite, cassiterite, wolframite and their derivatives (tin, tungsten, and tantalum), that are being provided by sources in the conflict region of the Democratic Republic of Congo (“DRC”).  Consistent with recent prior years, in May 2019, the Company filed Form SD with the Securities and Exchange Commission stating the Company’s supply chain remains DRC conflict undeterminable.
 ﻿
 The Company’s costs of compliance with environmental laws, including conflict mineral reporting, is estimated to be a total of approximately $1,600,000 for the three most recently completed fiscal years ending April 30, 2019.  Additional or modified requirements may be imposed in the future.  If such additional or modified requirements are imposed, or if conditions requiring remediation are found to exist, the Company may be required to incur additional expenditures.
 ﻿
 Backlog
 ﻿
 The Company relies on forecasted orders and purchase orders (firm orders) from its customers to estimate backlog.  The Company’s backlog of firm orders as of April 30, 2019, and April 30, 2018, was approximately $269,660,000 and $219,100,000, respectively.  The Company believes a significant portion of the backlog at April 30, 2019, will ship in fiscal year 2020.  Because customers may cancel or reschedule deliveries, backlog may not be a meaningful indicator of future revenue.  Variations in the magnitude and duration of contracts,

forecasts and purchase orders received by the Company and delivery requirements generally may result in substantial fluctuations in backlog from period to period.
 ﻿
 Employees
 ﻿
 The Company employed approximately 3,106 full-time employees as of April 30, 2019, including 208 engaged in engineering or engineering-related services, 2,510 in manufacturing and 388 in administrative and marketing functions.  
 ﻿
 The Company has a labor contract with Chemical & Production Workers Union Local No. 30, AFL-CIO, covering the Company’s workers in Elk Grove Village, Illinois which expires on November 30, 2021. The Company’s Mexican subsidiary, Standard Components de Mexico S.A., has a labor contract with Sindicato De Trabajadores de la Industra Electronica, Similares y Conexos del Estado de Coahuila, C.T.M. covering the Company’s workers in Acuna, Mexico which expires on February 3, 2020.  The Company’s subsidiary located in Tijuana, Mexico has a labor contract with Sindicato Mexico Moderno De Trabajadores De La, Baja California, C.R.O.C.  The contract does not have an expiration date.  The Company’s subsidiary located in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, has a labor contract with CONG DOAN CO SO CONG TY TNHH Spitfire Controls Vietnam. The contract expires on February 5, 2020.
 ﻿
 Since the time the Company commenced operations, it has not experienced any union-related work stoppages.  The Company believes its relations with its unions and its other employees are good.
