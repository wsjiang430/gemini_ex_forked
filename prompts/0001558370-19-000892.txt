     ITEM 1.BUSINESS
     General
     We are a diversified natural resource company that generates income from coal production and oil & gas mineral interests located in strategic producing regions across the United States. We are currently the second largest coal producer in the eastern United States with eight underground mining complexes in Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland and West Virginia as well as a coal loading terminal in Indiana.  We market our coal production to major domestic and international utilities and industrial users. We have grown historically primarily through expansion of our coal operations by adding and developing mines and coal reserves in these regions.  In addition, we generate royalty income from mineral interests we own in premier oil & gas producing regions in the United States, primarily the Anadarko, Permian, Williston and Appalachian basins.  
     ARLP, a Delaware limited partnership, completed its initial public offering on August 19, 1999 and is listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the ticker symbol "ARLP."  We are managed by our sole general partner, MGP, a Delaware limited liability company, which holds a non-economic general partner interest in ARLP.  Prior to the Simplification Transactions, MGP was a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of AHGP.  Alliance GP, LLC ("AGP"), which is indirectly wholly owned by Mr. Craft, was the general partner of AHGP prior to the Simplification Transactions and became the direct owner of MGP as a result of those transactions.  See discussions under Partnership Simplification regarding changes in ownership of ARLP and MGP as a result of the Exchange Transaction and Simplification Transactions.
     Simplification Transactions
     On July 28, 2017, the conflicts committee ("Conflicts Committee") of the board of directors ("Board of Directors") of MGP and AGP's board of directors approved a transaction to simplify our partnership structure.  Pursuant to that transaction, which closed on the same date, MGP contributed to ARLP all of its incentive distribution rights ("IDRs") and its 0.99% managing general partner interest in ARLP in exchange for 56,100,000 ARLP common units and a non-economic general partner interest in ARLP.  In conjunction with this transaction and on the same economic basis as MGP,

SGP also contributed to ARLP its 0.01% general partner interest in both ARLP and the Intermediate Partnership in exchange for 28,141 ARLP common units collectively (the "Exchange Transaction").  
     On February 22, 2018, our Board of Directors and the board of directors of AHGP's general partner approved a simplification agreement (the "Simplification Agreement") pursuant to which, among other things, through a series of transactions (the "Simplification Transactions"):
    
i. | AHGP would become a wholly owned subsidiary of ARLP,
---+-----------------------------------------------------


ii. | all of the issued and outstanding AHGP common units would be canceled and converted into the right to receive the ARLP common units held by AHGP and its subsidiaries,
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


iii. | in exchange for a number of ARLP common units calculated pursuant to the Simplification Agreement, MGP's 1.0001% general partner interest in our Intermediate Partnership and MGP's 0.001% managing member interest in our subsidiary, Alliance Coal, would be contributed to us, and
-----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


iv. | MGP would remain ARLP's sole general partner and would be a wholly owned subsidiary of AGP, and thus no control, management, or governance changes with respect to our business would occur.
----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      The Simplification Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby were approved by the written consent of approximately 68% of the holders of AHGP common units outstanding as of April 25, 2018, the record date for the consent solicitation.  On May 31, 2018, ARLP, AHGP and the other parties to the Simplification Agreement completed the transactions contemplated by the Simplification Agreement. 
     As part of the Simplification Transactions, (i) each AHGP common unit that was issued and outstanding at the effective time of the Simplification Transactions was canceled and converted into the right to receive a portion of the ARLP common units held by AHGP and its subsidiaries, and (ii) SGP became the sole limited partner in AHGP.  Each outstanding AHGP common unit, other than certain AHGP common units held by the Owners of SGP, converted into the right to receive approximately 1.4782 ARLP common units held by AHGP and its subsidiaries.  The remaining AHGP common units held by the Owners of SGP were canceled and converted into the right to receive 29,188,997 ARLP common units which equaled (i) the product of the number of certain AHGP common units held by the Owners of SGP multiplied by 1.4782, minus (ii) 1,322,388 ARLP common units.  In addition, ARLP issued 1,322,388 ARLP common units to the Owners of SGP in exchange for causing SGP to contribute to ARLP its remaining limited partner interest in AHGP, which included AHGP's indirect ownership of a 1.0001% general partner interest in the Intermediate Partnership and a 0.001% managing member interest in Alliance Coal, resulting in an overall exchange ratio to the Owners of SGP equal to that of the other AHGP unitholders.  Upon the issuance of ARLP common units to the Owners of SGP in exchange for the limited partner interest in AHGP, ARLP became a) the sole limited partner of AHGP and b) through AHGP, the indirect owner of a 1.0001% general partner interest in the Intermediate Partnership and a 0.001% managing member interest in Alliance Coal.  
     AllDale I & II Acquisition
     On January 3, 2019 (the "Acquisition Date"), ARLP acquired the general partner interests and all of the limited partner interests not owned by Cavalier Minerals JV, LLC ("Cavalier Minerals") in AllDale Minerals LP ("AllDale I") and AllDale Minerals II, LP ("AllDale II", and collectively with AllDale I, "AllDale I & II") for $176.0 million, which was funded with cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facility (the "Acquisition").  ARLP indirectly owns a 96.0% non-managing member interest and a non-economic managing member interest in Cavalier Minerals. The Acquisition provides ARLP with diversified exposure to industry leading operators and is consistent with our general business strategy to pursue accretive acquisitions.  
     Kodiak Redemption
     On January 26, 2019, Kodiak Gas Services, LLC ("Kodiak") provided notification that it intended to redeem our preferred interest for $135.0 million, which is inclusive of an early redemption premium.  On February 8, 2019, we received the cash proceeds of the redemption.

     Mining Operations
     At December 31, 2018, we had approximately 1.7 billion tons of coal reserves in Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. We produce a diverse range of steam and metallurgical coal with varying sulfur and heat contents, which enables us to satisfy the broad range of specifications required by our customers.  In 2018, we sold a record 40.4 million tons of coal and produced 40.3 million tons.  The coal we sold in 2018 was approximately 28.1% low-sulfur coal, 40.1% medium-sulfur coal and 31.8% high-sulfur coal.  Based on market expectations, we classify low-sulfur coal as coal with a sulfur content of less than 1.5%, medium-sulfur coal as coal with a sulfur content of 1.5% to 3%, and high-sulfur coal as coal with a sulfur content of greater than 3%.  In 2018, approximately 68.2% of our tons sold were purchased by United States electric utilities and 27.8% were sold into the international markets through brokered transactions.  The balance of our tons sold were to third-party resellers and industrial consumers.  For tons sold to United 

 
  3

 
States electric utilities, 100% were sold to utility plants with installed pollution control devices.  The BTU content of our coal ranges from 11,400 to 13,200.

     Royalty Operations
     AllDale Partnerships
     On November 10, 2014, Cavalier Minerals, in which Alliance Minerals, LLC ("Alliance Minerals") owns a 96.0% non-managing member interest, acquired a 71.7% limited partner interest in AllDale I and subsequently acquired a 72.8% limited partner interest in AllDale II.   AllDale I & II were created to acquire oil & gas mineral interests in various geographic locations within producing basins in the continental United States.  In February 2017, our subsidiary, Alliance Minerals, committed to directly invest $30.0 million in AllDale Minerals III, LP ("AllDale III") and as of December 31, 2018, Alliance Minerals had no remaining commitment to AllDale III.  AllDale III was created to acquire oil & gas minerals in the same geographical locations as AllDale I & II.   AllDale III, together with AllDale I & II are considered the ("AllDale Partnerships.")
     As discussed in the AllDale I & II Acquisition section above, on January 3, 2019, ARLP acquired the AllDale I & II general partner interests and all of the limited partner interests in AllDale I & II not owned by Cavalier Minerals.  As a result of the Acquisition and our previous investment held through Cavalier Minerals, ARLP now owns 100% of the general partner interests and approximately 97% of the limited partner interests in AllDale I & II. AllDale I & II control approximately 43,000 net royalty acres strategically positioned in the core of the Anadarko (SCOOP/STACK), Permian (Delaware and Midland), Williston (Bakken) and Appalachian basins. As of January 3, 2019, there were 3,823 gross producing wells generating production net to ARLP's interest of approximately 2,523 barrels of oil equivalent per day. In addition, there were 529 wells being drilled on ARLP's acreage and another 903 permitted well locations.
     Other Operations
     Mt. Vernon Transfer Terminal, LLC
     Our subsidiary, Mt. Vernon, leases land and operates a coal loading terminal on the Ohio River at Mt. Vernon, Indiana.  Coal is delivered to Mt. Vernon by both rail and truck.  The terminal has a capacity of 8.0 million tons per year with existing ground storage of approximately 60,000 to 70,000 tons.  During 2018, the terminal loaded approximately 6.5 million tons for customers of Gibson County Coal and Hamilton.     Coal Brokerage
     As markets allow, Alliance Coal buys coal from our mining operations and outside producers principally throughout the eastern United States, which we then resell.  We have a policy of matching our outside coal purchases and sales to minimize market risks associated with buying and reselling coal.  In 2018, we did not make outside coal purchases for brokerage activity.     Matrix Group
     Our subsidiaries, Matrix Design Group, LLC ("Matrix Design") and its subsidiaries Matrix Design International, LLC and Matrix Design Africa (PTY) LTD, and Alliance Design Group, LLC ("Alliance Design") (collectively the Matrix Design entities and Alliance Design are referred to as the "Matrix Group"), provide a variety of mining technology products and services for our mining operations and certain industrial and mining technology products and services to third parties.  Matrix Group's products and services include miner and equipment tracking systems and proximity detection systems.  We acquired Matrix Design in September 2006.

 Compression Investment
     On July 19, 2017, Alliance Minerals purchased $100 million of Series A-1 Preferred Interests from Kodiak, a privately-held company providing large-scale, high-utilization gas compression assets to customers operating primarily in the Permian Basin.  On February 8, 2019, Kodiak redeemed the preferred interests held by Alliance Minerals for $135.0 million cash which is inclusive of an early redemption premium.     Additional Services
     We develop and market additional services in order to establish ourselves as the supplier of choice for our customers.  Historically, and in 2018, outside revenues from these services were immaterial.     Coal Marketing and Sales
     As is customary in the coal industry, we have entered into long-term coal supply agreements with many of our customers.  These arrangements are mutually beneficial to us and our customers in that they provide greater predictability of sales volumes and sales prices.  Although many utility customers recently have appeared to favor a shorter-term contracting strategy, in 2018 approximately 69.1% and 68.9% of our sales tonnage and total coal sales, respectively, were sold under long-term contracts (contracts having a term of one year or greater) with committed term expirations ranging from 2019 to 2026.  As of February 14, 2019, our nominal commitment under long-term contracts was approximately 17.3 million tons in 2019 and 17.2 million tons in 2020.  The commitment of coal under contract is an approximate number because a limited number of our contracts contain provisions that could cause the nominal commitment to increase or decrease; however, the overall variance to total committed sales is minimal.  The contractual time commitments for customers to nominate future purchase volumes under these contracts are typically sufficient to allow us to balance our sales commitments with prospective production capacity.  In addition, the nominal commitment can otherwise change because of reopener provisions contained in certain of these long-term contracts.
     The provisions of long-term contracts are the results of both bidding procedures and extensive negotiations with each customer.  As a result, the provisions of these contracts vary significantly in many respects, including, among other factors, price adjustment features, price and contract reopener terms, permitted sources of supply, force majeure provisions, and coal qualities and quantities.  Virtually all of our long-term contracts are subject to price adjustment provisions, which periodically permit an increase or decrease in the contract price, typically to reflect changes in specified indices or changes in production costs resulting from regulatory changes, or both.  These provisions, however, may not assure that the contract price will reflect every change in production or other costs.  Failure of the parties to agree on a price pursuant to an adjustment or a reopener provision can, in some instances, lead to early termination of a contract.  Some of the long-term contracts also permit the contract to be reopened for renegotiation of terms and conditions other than pricing terms, and where a mutually acceptable agreement on terms and conditions cannot be concluded, either party may have the option to terminate the contract.  The long-term contracts typically stipulate procedures for transportation of coal, quality control, sampling and weighing.  Most contain provisions requiring us to deliver coal within stated ranges for specific coal characteristics such as heat, sulfur, ash, moisture, grindability, volatility and other qualities.  Failure to meet these specifications can result in economic penalties, rejection or suspension of shipments or termination of the contracts.  While most of the contracts specify the approved seams and/or approved locations from which the coal is to be mined, some contracts allow the coal to be sourced from more than one mine or location.  Although the volume to be delivered pursuant to a long-term contract is stipulated, the buyers often have the option to vary the volume within specified limits.
     The international coal market has been a substantial part of our business with indirect sales to end users in Europe, Africa, Asia, North America and South America.  Our sales into the international coal market are considered exports and are made through brokered transactions.  During the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, export tons represented approximately 27.8%, 17.4% and 4.5% of tons sold, respectively.  We use the end usage point as the basis for attributing tons to individual countries. Because title to our export shipments typically transfers to our brokerage customers at a point that does not necessarily reflect the end usage point, we attribute export tons to the country with the end usage point, if known. 
     Reliance on Major Customers
     During 2018, we derived approximately 10.9% of our total revenues from Louisville Gas and Electric Company.  We did not derive 10.0% or more of our total revenues from any other individual customer during 2018.  For more information

     Competition
     The coal industry is intensely competitive.  The most important factors on which we compete are coal price, coal quality (including sulfur and heat content), transportation costs from the mine to the customer and the reliability and diversity of supply.  We are currently the second largest coal producer in the eastern United States.  Our principal competitors include Arch Coal, Inc., CONSOL Coal Resources LP, CONSOL Energy, Inc., Contura Energy, Inc., Foresight Energy LP, Murray Energy, Inc., and Peabody Energy Corporation.  While a number of our competitors have been involved in reorganization in bankruptcy, these events have not resulted in a material diminution in available coal supply and there remains significant competition for ongoing coal sales.  We also compete directly with a number of smaller producers in the Illinois Basin and Appalachian regions.  
     In addition, we compete with companies that produce coal from one or more foreign countries. The prices we are able to obtain for our coal are primarily linked to coal consumption patterns of domestic electricity generating utilities, which in turn are influenced by economic activity, government regulations, weather and technological developments.  We export a significant portion of our coal into the international coal markets and historically the prices we obtain for our export coal have been influenced by a number of factors, such as global economic conditions, weather patterns and global supply and demand, among others.  Potential changes to international trade agreements, trade concessions or other political and economic arrangements may benefit coal producers operating in countries other than the United States. We may be adversely impacted on the basis of price or other factors with companies that in the future may benefit from favorable foreign trade policies or other arrangements. In addition, coal is sold internationally in United States dollars and, as a result, general economic conditions in foreign markets and changes in foreign currency exchange rates may provide our foreign competitors with a competitive advantage. If our competitors' currencies decline against the United States dollar or against foreign purchasers' local currencies, those competitors may be able to offer lower prices for coal to those purchasers. Furthermore, if the currencies of overseas purchasers were to significantly decline in value in comparison to the United States dollar, those purchasers may seek decreased prices for the coal we sell to them. Consequently, currency fluctuations could adversely affect the competitiveness of our coal in international markets, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
     Further, coal competes with other fuels such as natural gas, nuclear energy, petroleum and renewable energy sources for electrical power generation.  Costs and other factors, such as safety and environmental considerations, have affected and may continue to affect the overall demand for coal as a fuel.  
     For additional information, please see "Item 1A. Risk Factors."  
     Transportation
     Our coal is transported to our customers by barge, rail and truck.  Depending on the proximity of the customer to the mine and the transportation available for delivering coal to that customer, transportation costs can be a substantial part of the total delivered cost of a customer's coal.  As a consequence, the availability and cost of transportation constitute important factors in the marketability of coal.  We believe our mines are located in favorable geographic locations that minimize transportation costs for our customers, and in many cases we are able to accommodate multiple transportation options.  Our customers typically pay the transportation costs from the mining complex to the destination, which is the standard practice in the industry.  Approximately 41.1% of our 2018 sales volume was initially shipped from the mines by barge, 37.3% was shipped from the mines by rail and 21.6% was shipped from the mines by truck.  The practices of, rates set by and capacity availability of, the transportation company serving a particular mine or customer may affect, either adversely or favorably, our marketing efforts with respect to coal produced from the relevant mine.     Regulation and Laws
     The coal mining industry is subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and local authorities on matters such as:
    
· | employee health and safety;
--+----------------------------


· | mine permits and other licensing requirements;
--+-----------------------------------------------


· | air quality standards;
--+-----------------------

 
 
  10

 


· | water quality standards;
--+-------------------------


· | storage of petroleum products and substances that are regarded as hazardous under applicable laws or that, if spilled, could reach waterways or wetlands;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | plant and wildlife protection;
--+-------------------------------


· | reclamation and restoration of mining properties after mining is completed;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | discharge of materials;
--+------------------------


· | storage and handling of explosives;
--+------------------------------------


· | wetlands protection;
--+---------------------


· | surface subsidence from underground mining; and
--+------------------------------------------------


· | the effects, if any, that mining has on groundwater quality and availability.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      In addition, the utility industry is subject to extensive regulation regarding the environmental impact of its power generation activities, which has adversely affected demand for coal.  It is possible that new legislation or regulations may be adopted, or that existing laws or regulations may be differently interpreted or more stringently enforced, any of which could have a significant impact on our mining operations or our customers' ability to use coal. For more information, please see risk factors described in "Item 1A. Risk Factors" below.
     We are committed to conducting mining operations in compliance with applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations.  However, because of the extensive and detailed nature of these regulatory requirements, particularly the regulatory system of the Mine Safety and Health Administration ("MSHA") where citations can be issued without regard to fault and many of the standards include subjective elements, it is not reasonable to expect any coal mining company to be free of citations.  When we receive a citation, we attempt to promptly remediate any identified condition.  While we have not quantified all of the costs of compliance with applicable federal and state laws and associated regulations, those costs have been and are expected to continue to be significant.  Compliance with these laws and regulations has substantially increased the cost of coal mining for domestic coal producers.
     Capital expenditures for environmental matters have not been material in recent years.  We have accrued for the present value of the estimated cost of asset retirement obligations and mine closings, including the cost of treating mine water discharge, when necessary.  The accruals for asset retirement obligations and mine closing costs are based upon permit requirements and the costs and timing of asset retirement obligations and mine closing procedures.  Although management believes it has made adequate provisions for all expected reclamation and other costs associated with mine closures, future operating results would be adversely affected if these accruals were insufficient.
     Mining Permits and Approvals
     Numerous governmental permits or approvals are required for mining operations.  Applications for permits require extensive engineering and data analysis and presentation, and must address a variety of environmental, health and safety matters associated with a proposed mining operation.  These matters include the manner and sequencing of coal extraction, the storage, use and disposal of waste and other substances and impacts on the environment, the construction of water containment areas, and reclamation of the area after coal extraction.  Meeting all requirements imposed by any of these authorities may be costly and time consuming, and may delay or prevent commencement or continuation of mining operations.
     The permitting process for certain mining operations can extend over several years and can be subject to administrative and judicial challenge, including by the public.  Some required mining permits are becoming increasingly difficult to obtain in a timely manner, or at all.  We cannot assure you that we will not experience difficulty or delays in obtaining mining permits in the future or that a current permit will not be revoked.
     We are required to post bonds to secure performance under our permits.  Under some circumstances, substantial fines and penalties, including revocation of mining permits, may be imposed under the laws and regulations described above.  Monetary sanctions and, in severe circumstances, criminal sanctions may be imposed for failure to comply with these laws and regulations.  Regulations also provide that a mining permit can be refused or revoked if the permit applicant or permittee owns or controls, directly or indirectly through other entities, mining operations that have outstanding environmental violations.  Although, like other coal companies, we have been cited for violations in the ordinary course of our business, we have never had a permit suspended or revoked because of any violation, and the penalties assessed for these violations have not been material.

 Mine Health and Safety Laws
     Stringent safety and health standards have been imposed by federal legislation since the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969 ("CMHSA") was adopted.  The Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977 ("FMSHA"), and regulations adopted pursuant thereto, significantly expanded the enforcement of health and safety standards of the CMHSA, and imposed extensive and detailed safety and health standards on numerous aspects of mining operations, including training of mine personnel, mining procedures, blasting, the equipment used in mining operations, and numerous other matters.  MSHA monitors and rigorously enforces compliance with these federal laws and regulations.  In addition, most of the states where we operate have state programs for mine safety and health regulation and enforcement.  Federal and state safety and health regulations affecting the coal mining industry are perhaps the most comprehensive and rigorous system in the United States for protection of employee safety and have a significant effect on our operating costs.  Although many of the requirements primarily impact underground mining, our competitors in all of the areas in which we operate are subject to the same laws and regulations.
     The FMSHA has been construed as authorizing MSHA to issue citations and orders pursuant to the legal doctrine of strict liability, or liability without fault, and FMSHA requires imposition of a civil penalty for each cited violation.  Negligence and gravity assessments, and other factors can result in the issuance of various types of orders, including orders requiring withdrawal from the mine or the affected area, and some orders can also result in the imposition of civil penalties.  The FMSHA also contains criminal liability provisions.  For example, criminal liability may be imposed upon corporate operators who knowingly and willfully authorize, order or carry out violations of the FMSHA, or its mandatory health and safety standards.
     The Federal Mine Improvement and New Emergency Response Act of 2006 ("MINER Act") significantly amended the FMSHA, imposing more extensive and stringent compliance standards, increasing criminal penalties and establishing a maximum civil penalty for non-compliance, and expanding the scope of federal oversight, inspection, and enforcement activities.  Following the passage of the MINER Act, MSHA has issued new or more stringent rules and policies on a variety of topics, including:
    
· | sealing off abandoned areas of underground coal mines;
--+-------------------------------------------------------


· | mine safety equipment, training and emergency reporting requirements;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


· | substantially increased civil penalties for regulatory violations;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


· | training and availability of mine rescue teams;
--+------------------------------------------------


· | underground "refuge alternatives" capable of sustaining trapped miners in the event of an emergency;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | flame-resistant conveyor belts, fire prevention and detection, and use of air from the belt entry; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | post-accident two-way communications and electronic tracking systems.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------

      MSHA continues to interpret and implement various provisions of the MINER Act, along with introducing new proposed regulations and standards.
     In 2014, MSHA began implementation of a finalized new regulation titled "Lowering Miner's Exposure to Respirable Coal Mine Dust, Including Continuous Personal Dust Monitors."  The final rule implemented a reduction in the allowable respirable coal mine dust exposure limits, requires the use of sampling data taken from a single sample rather than an average of samples, and increases oversight by MSHA regarding coal mine dust and ventilation issues at each mine, including the approval process for ventilation plans at each mine, all of which increase mining costs.  The second phase of the rule began in February 2016 and requires additional sampling for designated and other occupations using the new continuous personal dust monitor technology, which provides real time dust exposure information to the miner.  Phase three of the rule began in August 2016, and resulted in lowering the current respirable dust level of 2.0 milligrams per cubic meter to 1.5 milligrams per cubic meter of air.  Compliance with these rules can result in increased costs on our operations, including, but not limited to, the purchasing of new equipment and the hiring of additional personnel to assist with monitoring, reporting, and recordkeeping obligations.  On July 9, 2018, MSHA published a request for information to solicit stakeholder comments, data, and information for the development of a framework to conduct a retrospective study on the impact of the final rule, as well as a request for information and data on engineering controls and best practices used by mine operators to lower miners' exposure to respirable coal dust.  The comment period for this request for information will close on July 9, 2019.  It is uncertain whether MSHA will present additional proposed rules, or revisions to the final rule, following the closing of the comment period for the current request for information.
    
 
  12

 

 Additionally, in July 2014, MSHA proposed a rule addressing the "criteria and procedures for assessment of civil penalties."  Public commenters have expressed concern that the proposed rule exceeds MSHA's rulemaking authority and would result in substantially increased civil penalties for regulatory violations cited by MSHA.  MSHA last revised the process for proposing civil penalties in 2006 and, as discussed above, civil penalties increased significantly.  The notice-and-comment period for this proposed rule closed, and it is uncertain when, or if, MSHA will present a final rule addressing these civil penalties.
     In January 2015, MSHA published a final rule requiring mine operators to install proximity detection systems on continuous mining machines, over a staggered time frame ranging from November 2015 through March 2018.  The proximity detection systems initiate a warning or shutdown the continuous mining machine depending on the proximity of the machine to a miner.  MSHA subsequently proposed a rule requiring mine operators to also install proximity detection systems on other types of underground mobile mining equipment.  The comment period for this proposed rule closed on April 10, 2017, and it is uncertain when MSHA will promulgate a final rule addressing the issue of proximity detection systems on underground mobile mining equipment, other than continuous mining machines.
     In June 2016, MSHA published a request for information on Exposure of Underground Miners to Diesel Exhaust.  Following a comment period that closed in November 2016, MSHA received requests for MSHA and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health to hold a Diesel Exhaust Partnership to address the issues covered by MSHA's request for information.  The comment period for the request for information was reopened and closed in January 2018.  The comment period was reopened again in March 2018 and is scheduled to close in March 2019. It is uncertain whether MSHA will present a proposed rule pertaining to exposure of underground miners to diesel exhaust, after completing its evaluation of the comments received.
     In June 2018, MSHA published a request for information on Safety Improvement Technologies for Mobile Equipment at Surface Mines and for Belt Conveyors at Surface and Underground Mines.  The comment period for the request for information closed on December 24, 2018.  It is uncertain whether MSHA will present a proposed rule pertaining to safety improvement technologies for mobile equipment at surface mines or for belt conveyors at surface and underground mines.
     Subsequent to passage of the MINER Act, Illinois, Kentucky, Pennsylvania and West Virginia have enacted legislation addressing issues such as mine safety and accident reporting, increased civil and criminal penalties, and increased inspections and oversight.  Additionally, state administrative agencies can promulgate administrative rules and regulations affecting our operations.  Other states may pass similar legislation or administrative regulations in the future.
     Some of the costs of complying with existing regulations and implementing new safety and health regulations may be passed on to our customers.  Although we have not quantified the full impact, implementing and complying with these new state and federal safety laws and regulations have had, and are expected to continue to have, an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial position.
     Black Lung Benefits Act
     The Black Lung Benefits Act of 1977 and the Black Lung Benefits Reform Act of 1977, as amended in 1981 ("BLBA") requires businesses that conduct current mining operations to make payments of black lung benefits to current and former coal miners with black lung disease and to some survivors of a miner who dies from this disease.  The BLBA levied a tax on coal sold of $1.10 per ton for underground-mined coal and $0.55 per ton for surface-mined coal, but not to exceed 4.4% of the applicable sales price, in order to compensate miners who are totally disabled due to black lung disease and some survivors of miners who died from this disease, and who were last employed as miners prior to 1970 or subsequently where no responsible coal mine operator has been identified for claims.  The coal we sell into international markets is generally not subject to this tax.  In addition, the BLBA provides that some claims for which coal operators had previously been responsible are or will become obligations of the government trust funded by the tax.  The Revenue Act of 1987 extended the termination date of this tax from January 1, 1996, to the earlier of January 1, 2014, or the date on which the government trust becomes solvent.  The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 extended these rates through December 31, 2018.  As of January 1, 2019, the excise tax rates have reverted to their original 1977 statutory levels of $0.50 per ton for underground-mined coal and $0.25 per ton for surface mined coal, but not to exceed 2% of the applicable sales price.

 Workers' Compensation and Black Lung
     We provide income replacement and medical treatment for work-related traumatic injury claims as required by applicable state laws.  Workers' compensation laws also compensate survivors of workers who suffer employment related deaths.  We generally self-insure this potential expense using our actuary estimates of the cost of present and future claims.  In addition, coal mining companies are subject to CMHSA, as amended, and various state statutes for the payment of medical and disability benefits to eligible recipients related to coal worker's pneumoconiosis, or black lung.  We also provide for these claims through self-insurance programs. Our pneumoconiosis benefits liability is calculated using the service cost method based on the actuarial present value of the estimated pneumoconiosis benefits obligation.  Our actuarial calculations are based on numerous assumptions including disability incidence, medical costs, mortality, death benefits, dependents and discount rates. For more information concerning our requirement to maintain bonds to secure our workers' compensation obligations, see the discussion of surety bonds below under "—Bonding Requirements."
     The revised BLBA regulations took effect in January 2001, relaxing the stringent award criteria established under previous regulations and thus potentially allowing new federal claims to be awarded and allowing previously denied claimants to re-file under the revised criteria.  These regulations may also increase black lung related medical costs by broadening the scope of conditions for which medical costs are reimbursable and increase legal costs by shifting more of the burden of proof to the employer.
     The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, enacted in 2010, includes significant changes to the federal black lung program retroactive to 2005, including an automatic survivor benefit paid upon the death of a miner with an awarded black lung claim and establishes a rebuttable presumption with regard to pneumoconiosis among miners with 15 or more years of coal mine employment that are totally disabled by a respiratory condition.  These changes could have a material impact on our costs expended in association with the federal black lung program.
     Coal Industry Retiree Health Benefits Act
     The Federal Coal Industry Retiree Health Benefits Act ("CIRHBA") was enacted to fund health benefits for some United Mine Workers of America retirees.  CIRHBA merged previously established union benefit plans into a single fund into which "signatory operators" and "related persons" are obligated to pay annual premiums for beneficiaries.  CIRHBA also created a second benefit fund for miners who retired between July 21, 1992 and September 30, 1994, and whose former employers are no longer in business.  Because of our union-free status, we are not required to make payments to retired miners under CIRHBA, with the exception of limited payments made on behalf of predecessors of MC Mining.  However, in connection with the sale of the coal assets acquired by Alliance Resource Holdings, Inc. ("ARH") in 1996, MAPCO Inc., now a wholly owned subsidiary of The Williams Companies, Inc., agreed to retain, and be responsible for, all liabilities under CIRHBA.     Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act
     The Federal Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 ("SMCRA") and similar state statutes establish operational, reclamation and closure standards for all aspects of surface mining as well as many aspects of deep mining.  Although we have minimal surface mining activity and no mountaintop removal mining activity, SMCRA nevertheless requires that comprehensive environmental protection and reclamation standards be met during the course of and upon completion of our mining activities.
     SMCRA and similar state statutes require, among other things, that mined property be restored in accordance with specified standards and approved reclamation plans.  SMCRA requires us to restore the surface to approximate the original contours as contemporaneously as practicable with the completion of surface mining operations.  Federal law and some states impose on mine operators the responsibility for replacing certain water supplies damaged by mining operations and repairing or compensating for damage to certain structures occurring on the surface as a result of mine subsidence, a consequence of longwall mining and possibly other mining operations.  We believe we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable regulations relating to reclamation.
     In addition, the Abandoned Mine Lands Program, which is part of SMCRA, imposes a tax on all current mining operations, the proceeds of which are used to restore mines closed before 1977.  The tax for surface-mined and underground-mined coal is $0.28 per ton and $0.12 per ton, respectively.  We have accrued the estimated costs of reclamation and mine closing, including the cost of treating mine water discharge when necessary.  Please read "Item 8.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 16 - Asset Retirement Obligations."  In addition, states from time to time have increased and may continue to increase their fees and taxes to fund reclamation or orphaned mine sites and acid mine drainage control on a statewide basis.  
     Under SMCRA, responsibility for unabated violations, unpaid civil penalties and unpaid reclamation fees of independent contract mine operators and other third parties can be imputed to other companies that are deemed, according to the regulations, to have "owned" or "controlled" the third-party violator.  Sanctions against the "owner" or "controller" are quite severe and can include being blocked from receiving new permits and having any permits revoked that were issued after the time of the violations or after the time civil penalties or reclamation fees became due.  We are not aware of any currently pending or asserted claims against us relating to the "ownership" or "control" theories discussed above.  However, we cannot assure you that such claims will not be asserted in the future.
     The United States Office of Surface Mining Reclamation ("OSM") published in November 2009 an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, announcing its intent to revise the Stream Buffer Zone ("SBZ") rule published in December 2008.  The SBZ rule prohibits mining disturbances within 100 feet of streams if there would be a negative effect on water quality.  Environmental groups brought lawsuits challenging the rule, and in a March 2010 settlement, the OSM agreed to rewrite the SBZ rule.  In January 2013, the environmental groups reopened the litigation against OSM for failure to abide by the terms of the settlement.  Oral arguments were heard on January 31, 2014.  OSM published a notice in December 2014 to vacate the 2008 SBZ rule to comply with an order issued by the United States District Court for the District of Columbia.  OSM reimplemented the 1983 SBZ rule.  Subsequent attempts by OSM to issue a revised stream protection rule met with Congressional opposition, ultimately resulting in the passage of a resolution under the Congressional Review Act that revoked OSM's stream protection rule and prevents the agency from promulgating a substantially similar rule absent future legislation.  Whether Congress will enact future legislation to require a new stream protection rule remains uncertain.
     In December 2009, the United States Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") issued proposed rules on coal combustion residues ("CCRs") in 2010.  This final rule was published in December 2014.  The EPA's final rule does not address the placement of CCRs in minefills or non-minefill uses of CCRs at coal mine sites.  OSM has announced their intention to release a proposed rule to regulate placement and use of CCRs at coal mine sites, but, to date, no further action has been taken.  These actions by OSM, potentially could result in additional delays and costs associated with obtaining permits, prohibitions or restrictions relating to mining activities, and additional enforcement actions.
     Bonding Requirements
     Federal and state laws require bonds to secure our obligations to reclaim lands used for mining, to pay federal and state workers' compensation, to pay certain black lung claims, and to satisfy other miscellaneous obligations.  These bonds are typically renewable on a yearly basis.  It has become increasingly difficult for us and for our competitors to secure new surety bonds without posting collateral.  In addition, surety bond costs have increased while the market terms of surety bonds have generally become less favorable to us.  It is possible that surety bond issuers may refuse to renew bonds or may demand additional collateral upon those renewals.  Our failure to maintain, or inability to acquire, surety bonds that are required by state and federal laws would have a material adverse effect on our ability to produce coal, which could affect our profitability and cash flow. For additional information, please see "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements."     Air Emissions
     The CAA and similar state and local laws and regulations regulate emissions into the air and affect coal mining operations.  The CAA directly impacts our coal mining and processing operations by imposing permitting requirements and, in some cases, requirements to install certain emissions control equipment, achieve certain emissions standards, or implement certain work practices on sources that emit various air pollutants.  The CAA also indirectly affects coal mining operations by extensively regulating the air emissions of coal-fired electric power generating plants and other coal-burning facilities.  There have been a series of federal rulemakings focused on emissions from coal-fired electric generating facilities.  Installation of additional emissions control technology and any additional measures required under applicable state and federal laws and regulations related to air emissions will make it more costly to operate coal-fired power plants and possibly other facilities that consume coal and, depending on the requirements of individual state implementation plans ("SIPs"), could make coal a less attractive fuel alternative in the planning and building of power plants in the future.  

 
  15

 
A significant reduction in coal's share of power generating capacity could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  Since 2010, utilities have completed or formally announced the retirement or conversion of over 630 coal-fired electric generating units through 2030 in the United States.
     In addition to the greenhouse gas ("GHG") issues discussed below, the air emissions programs that may affect our operations, directly or indirectly, include, but are not limited to, the following:
    
· | The EPA's Acid Rain Program, provided in Title IV of the CAA, regulates emissions of sulfur dioxide from electric generating facilities. Sulfur dioxide is a by-product of coal combustion. Affected facilities purchase or are otherwise allocated sulfur dioxide emissions allowances, which must be surrendered annually in an amount equal to a facility's sulfur dioxide emissions in that year. Affected facilities may sell or trade excess allowances to other facilities that require additional allowances to offset their sulfur dioxide emissions. In addition to purchasing or trading for additional sulfur dioxide allowances, affected power facilities can satisfy the requirements of the EPA's Acid Rain Program by switching to lower-sulfur fuels, installing pollution control devices such as flue gas desulfurization systems, or "scrubbers," or by reducing electricity generating levels. In 2018, we sold 68.2% of our total tons to electric utilities in the United States, of which 100% was sold to utility plants with installed pollution control devices. These requirements would not be supplanted by a replacement rule for the Clean Air Interstate Rule ("CAIR"), discussed below. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The CAIR calls for power plants in 28 states and Washington, D.C. to reduce emission levels of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide pursuant to a cap-and-trade program similar to the system in effect for acid rain. In June 2011, the EPA finalized the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule ("CSAPR"), a replacement rule for CAIR, which would have required 28 states in the Midwest and eastern seaboard to reduce power plant emissions that cross state lines and contribute to ozone and/or fine particle pollution in other states. Under CSAPR, the first phase of the nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide emissions reductions would have commenced in 2012 with further reductions effective in 2014. However, in August 2012, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals vacated CSAPR, finding the EPA exceeded its statutory authority under the CAA and striking down the EPA's decision to require federal implementation plans ("FIPs"), rather than SIPs, to implement mandated reductions. In its ruling, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals ordered the EPA to continue administering CAIR but proceed expeditiously to promulgate a replacement rule for CAIR. The United States Supreme Court granted the EPA's certiorari petition appealing the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals' decision and heard oral arguments in December 2013. In April 2014, the United States Supreme Court reversed and remanded the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals' decision, concluding that the EPA's approach is lawful. CSAPR has been reinstated and the EPA began implementation of Phase 1 requirements in January 2015. In September 2016, the EPA finalized the CSAPR Update to respond to the remand by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. Implementation of Phase 2 began in 2017. In December 2018, the EPA determined that the CSAPR Update rule satisfies "good neighbor" obligations for the 2008 national ambient air quality standards ("NAAQS") for ground-level ozone. Litigation is pending against the CSAPR Update in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. The impacts of CSAPR Update are unknown at the present time due to the implementation of Mercury and Air Toxic Standards ("MATS"), discussed below, and the significant number of coal retirements that have resulted and that potentially will result from MATS. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | In February 2012, the EPA adopted the MATS, which regulates the emission of mercury and other metals, fine particulates, and acid gases such as hydrogen chloride from coal and oil-fired power plants. In March 2013, the EPA finalized a reconsideration of the MATS rule as it pertains to new power plants, principally adjusting emissions limits to levels attainable by existing control technologies. Appeals were filed and oral arguments were heard by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals in December 2013. In April 2014 the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld MATS. In June 2015, the United States Supreme Court remanded the final rule back to the D.C. Circuit holding that the agency must consider cost before deciding whether regulation is necessary and appropriate. In December 2015, the EPA issued, for comment, the proposed Supplemental Finding. In April 2016, the EPA issued a final supplemental finding upholding the rule and concluding that a cost analysis supports the MATS rule. In April 2017, the D.C Circuit Court of Appeals granted the EPA's request to cancel oral arguments and ordered the case held in abeyance for an EPA review of the supplemental finding. In December 2018, the EPA issued a proposed Supplemental Cost Finding, as well as the CAA required "risk and technology review." Many electric generators have already announced retirements due to the MATS rule. Although various issues surrounding the MATS rule remain subject to litigation in the D.C. Circuit, the MATS rule has forced generators to make capital investments to retrofit

power plants and could lead to additional premature retirements of older coal-fired generating units. The announced and possible additional retirements are likely to reduce the demand for coal. Apart from MATS, several states have enacted or proposed regulations requiring reductions in mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants, and federal legislation to reduce mercury emissions from power plants has been proposed. Regulation of mercury emissions by the EPA, states, or Congress may decrease the future demand for coal.

· | In January 2013, the EPA issued final Maximum Achievable Control Technology ("MACT") standards for several classes of boilers and process heaters, including large coal-fired boilers and process heaters ("Boiler MACT"), which require owners of industrial, commercial, and institutional boilers to comply with standards for air pollutants, including mercury and other metals, fine particulates, and acid gases such as hydrogen chloride. Businesses and environmental groups have filed legal challenges to Boiler MACT in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals and petitioned the EPA to reconsider the rule. In December 2014, the EPA announced reconsideration of the standard and will accept public comment on five issues for its standards on area sources, will review three issues related to its major-source boiler standards, and four issues relating to commercial and solid waste incinerator units. Before reconsideration, the EPA estimated the rule will affect 1,700 existing major source facilities with an estimated 14,316 boilers and process heaters. While some owners would make capital expenditures to retrofit boilers and process heaters, a number of boilers and process heaters could be prematurely retired. Retirements are likely to reduce the demand for coal. In August 2016, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals vacated a portion of the rule while remanding portions back to the EPA. In December 2016, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals agreed to the EPA request to remand the rule back to the EPA without vacatur. In March 2018, the D.C. Circuit affirmed the rule's startup and shutdown work practice standards but remanded a portion of the rule to reconsider the EPA's decision to adopt the 130 ppm carbon monoxide limits. The impact of the regulations will depend on the EPA's reconsideration and the outcome of subsequent legal challenges.

· | The EPA is required by the CAA to periodically re-evaluate the available health effects information to determine whether the NAAQS should be revised. Pursuant to this process, the EPA has adopted more stringent NAAQS for fine particulate matter ("PM"), ozone, nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide. As a result, some states will be required to amend their existing SIPs to attain and maintain compliance with the new air quality standards and other states will be required to develop new SIPs for areas that were previously in "attainment" but do not attain the new standards. In addition, under the revised ozone NAAQS, significant additional emissions control expenditures may be required at coal-fired power plants. Initial non-attainment determinations related to the revised sulfur dioxide standard became effective in October 2013. In addition, in January 2013, the EPA updated the NAAQS for fine particulate matter emitted by a wide variety of sources including power plants, industrial facilities, and gasoline and diesel engines, tightening the annual PM 2.5 standard to 12 micrograms per cubic meter. The revised standard became effective in March 2013. In November 2013, the EPA proposed a rule to clarify PM 2.5 implementation requirements to the states for current 1997 and 2006 non-attainment areas. In July 2016, the EPA issued a final rule for states to use in creating their plans to address particulate matter. In October 2015, the EPA published a final rule that reduced the ozone NAAQS from 75 to 70 ppb. Various industry and state petitioners have filed challenges to the final rule as have several environmental groups. Attainment dates for the new standards range between 2013 and 2030, depending on the severity of the non-attainment. In April 2017, the D.C. Court of Appeals granted the EPA's request to cancel oral arguments and ordered the case held in abeyance for an EPA review of the 2015 Rule. In July 2009, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals vacated part of a rule implementing the ozone NAAQS and remanded certain other aspects of the rule to the EPA for further consideration. In June 2013, the EPA proposed a rule for implementing the 2008 ozone NAAQS. Under a consent decree published in the Federal Register in January 2017, the EPA has agreed to review the NAAQS for nitrogen oxides with a final decision due by 2018 and review the NAAQS for sulfur oxide with a final decision due by 2019. In July 2017, the EPA proposed to retain the current NAAQS for nitrogen oxides. The comment period for the proposal closed in September 2017. In June 2018, the EPA proposed to retain the existing sulfur oxide standards. The comment period for the proposal closed in August 2018. New standards may impose additional emissions control requirements on new and expanded coal-fired power plants and industrial boilers. Because coal mining operations and coal-fired electric generating facilities emit particulate matter and sulfur dioxide, our mining operations and our customers could be affected when the new standards are implemented by the applicable states, and developments might indirectly reduce the demand for coal.

· | The EPA's regional haze program is designed to protect and improve visibility at and around national parks, national wilderness areas and international parks. Under the program, states are required to develop SIPs to improve visibility. Typically, these plans call for reductions in sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions from coal-fueled electric plants. In prior cases, the EPA has decided to negate the SIPs and impose stringent requirements through FIPs. The regional haze program, including particularly the EPA's FIPs, and any future regulations may restrict the construction of new coal-fired power plants whose operation may impair visibility at and around federally protected areas and may require some existing coal-fired power plants to install additional control measures designed to limit haze-causing emissions. These requirements could limit the demand for coal in some locations. In June 2018, the EPA proposed to retain the existing sulfur oxide standards. The comment period for the proposal closed in August 2018.

· | The EPA's new source review ("NSR") program under the CAA in certain circumstances requires existing coal-fired power plants, when modifications to those plants significantly increase emissions, to install more stringent air emissions control equipment. The Department of Justice, on behalf of the EPA, has filed lawsuits against a number of coal-fired electric generating facilities alleging violations of the NSR program. The EPA has alleged that certain modifications have been made to these facilities without first obtaining certain permits issued under the program. Several of these lawsuits have settled, but others remain pending. In addition, there are proposals to modify the NSR program as a part of the Affordable Clean Energy ("ACE") rule which is subject to current pending litigation as discussed below. Depending on the ultimate resolution of these cases, demand for coal could be affected.

      Carbon Dioxide Emissions
     Combustion of fossil fuels, such as the coal we produce, results in the emission of carbon dioxide, which is considered a GHG.  Combustion of fuel for mining equipment used in coal production also emits GHGs.  Future regulation of GHG emissions in the United States could occur pursuant to future United States treaty commitments, new domestic legislation or regulation by the EPA.  Former President Obama expressed support for a mandatory cap and trade program to restrict or regulate emissions of GHGs and Congress has considered various proposals to reduce GHG emissions, and it is possible federal legislation could be adopted in the future.  Internationally, the Kyoto Protocol set binding emission targets for developed countries that ratified it (the United States did not ratify, and Canada officially withdrew from its Kyoto commitment in 2012) to reduce their global GHG emissions.  The Kyoto Protocol was nominally extended past its expiration date of December 2012, with a requirement for a new legal construct to be put into place by 2015.  The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change met in Paris, France in December 2015 and agreed to an international climate agreement (the "Paris Agreement").  Although this agreement does not create any binding obligations for nations to limit their GHG emissions, it does include pledges to voluntarily limit or reduce future emissions.  These commitments could further reduce demand and prices for our coal.  In June of 2017, President Trump announced that the United States would withdraw from the Paris Agreement, which has a four year exit process.  Future participation in the Paris Agreement by the United States remains uncertain. However, many states, regions and governmental bodies have adopted GHG initiatives and have or are considering the imposition of fees or taxes based on the emission of GHGs by certain facilities, including coal-fired electric generating facilities.  Others have announced their intent to increase the use of renewable energy sources, displacing coal and other fossil fuels.  Depending on the particular regulatory program that may be enacted, at either the federal or state level, the demand for coal could be negatively impacted, which would have an adverse effect on our operations.
     Even in the absence of new federal legislation, the EPA has begun to regulate GHG emissions under the CAA based on the United States Supreme Court's 2007 decision in Massachusetts v. Environmental Protection Agency that the EPA has authority to regulate GHG emissions.  In 2009, the EPA issued a final rule, known as the "Endangerment Finding", which found that GHG emissions, including carbon dioxide and methane, endanger public health and welfare and that six GHGs, including carbon dioxide and methane, emitted by motor vehicles endanger both the public health and welfare.
     In May 2010, the EPA issued its final "tailoring rule" for GHG emissions, a policy aimed at shielding small emission sources from CAA permitting requirements.  The EPA's rule phases in various GHG-related permitting requirements beginning in January 2011.  Beginning July 1, 2011, the EPA requires facilities that must already obtain NSR permits (new or modified stationary sources) for other pollutants to include GHGs in their permits for new construction projects that emit at least 100,000 tons per year of GHGs and existing facilities that increase their emissions by at least 75,000 tons per year.  These permits require that the permittee adopt the Best Available Control Technology ("BACT").  In June 2014, 

 
  18

 
the United States Supreme Court invalidated the EPA's position that power plants and other sources can be subject to permitting requirements based on their GHG emissions alone.  For CO2 BACT to apply, CAA permitting must be triggered by another regulated pollutant (e.g., SO2).
     As a result of revisions to its preconstruction permitting rules that became fully effective in 2011, the EPA is now requiring new sources, including coal-fired power plants, to undergo control technology reviews for GHGs (predominantly carbon dioxide) as a condition of permit issuance.  These reviews may impose limits on GHG emissions, or otherwise be used to compel consideration of alternative fuels and generation systems, as well as increase litigation risk for—and so discourage development of—coal-fired power plants.  The EPA has also issued final rules requiring the monitoring and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from certain sources.
     In March 2012, the EPA proposed New Source Performance Standards ("NSPS") for carbon dioxide emissions from new fossil fuel-fired power plants.  The proposal requires new coal units to meet a carbon dioxide emissions standard of 1,000 lbs. CO2/MWh, which is equivalent to the carbon dioxide emitted by a natural gas combined cycle unit.  In January 2014, the EPA formally published its re-proposed NSPS for carbon dioxide emissions from new power plants.  The re-proposed rule requires an emissions standard of 1,100 lbs. CO2/MWh for new coal-fired power plants.  To meet such a standard, new coal plants would be required to install carbon capture and storage ("CCS") technology. In August 2015, the EPA released final rules requiring newly constructed coal-fired steam electric generating units ("EGUs") to emit no more than 1,400 lbs CO2/MWh (gross) and be constructed with CCS to capture 16% of CO2 produced by an electric generating unit burning bituminous coal.  At the same time, the EPA finalized GHG emissions regulations for modified and existing power plants.  The rule for modified sources required reducing GHG emissions from any modified or reconstructed source and could limit the ability of generators to upgrade coal-fired power plants thereby reducing the demand for coal.  In April 2017, the EPA published notice in the federal register that the agency has initiated a review of the NSPS for new and modified fossil fuel fired power plants and that, following the review, the EPA will initiate reconsideration proceedings to suspend, revise or rescind this NSPS.  Challenges to the NSPS have been filed in United States Court of Appeal for the D.C. Circuit and oral arguments were set for April 2017; however, in April 2017, the U.S Court of Appeal for the D.C. Circuit ordered the NSPS case held in abeyance for an EPA review of the rule.  In December 2018, the EPA re-proposed the NSPS with a standard reflecting the performance of currently demonstrated supercritical technologies with an emission limit of 1,900 lbs. CO2/MWh for large units (heat input greater than 2,000 MMBtu/hour) and subcritical technologies with an emission limit of 2,000 lbs. CO2/MWh for small units. It is likely than any repeal or revisions to the NSPS will be subject to legal challenges as well.  Future implementation of the NSPS is uncertain at this time.
     In August 2015, the EPA issued its final Clean Power Plan ("CPP") rules that establish carbon pollution standards for power plants, called CO2 emission performance rates.  Judicial challenges led the United States Supreme Court to grant a stay in February 2016 of the implementation of the CPP before the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ("Circuit Court") even issued a decision.  By its terms, this stay will remain in effect throughout the pendency of the appeals process including at the Circuit Court and the Supreme Court through any certiorari petition that may be granted.   The Supreme Court's stay applies only to the EPA's regulations for CO2 emissions from existing power plants and will not affect the EPA's standards for new power plants.  It is not yet clear how either the Circuit Court or the Supreme Court will rule on the legality of the CPP. Additionally, in October 2017 the EPA proposed to repeal the CPP, although the final outcome of this action and the pending litigation regarding the CPP is uncertain at this time.   In connection with this proposed repeal, the EPA issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking ("ANPRM") in December 2017 regarding emission guidelines to limit GHG emissions from existing electricity utility generating units.  The ANPRM seeks comment regarding what the EPA should include in a potential new, existing-source regulation under the Clean Air Act of GHG emissions from electric utility generating units that it may propose.  In August 2018, the EPA proposed the ACE rule to replace the CPP with a rule that utilizes heat rate improvement measures as the "best system of emission reduction". The ACE rule adopts new implementing regulations under the CAA to clarify the roles of the EPA and the states, including an extension of the deadline for state plans and EPA approvals; and, the rule revises the NSR permitting program to provide EGUs the opportunity to make efficiency improvements without triggering NSR permit requirements. The EPA's attempts to replace the CPP with the ACE rule are currently subject to litigation, and we cannot predict the final outcome.
     Notwithstanding the ACE rule, these requirements have led to premature retirements and could lead to additional premature retirements of coal-fired generating units and reduce the demand for coal.  Congress has rejected legislation to restrict carbon dioxide emissions from existing power plants and it is unclear whether the EPA has the legal authority to 

 
  19

 
regulate carbon dioxide emissions from existing and modified power plants as proposed in the NSPS and CPP.  Substantial limitations on GHG emissions could adversely affect demand for the coal we produce.
     There have been numerous protests of and challenges to the permitting of new coal-fired power plants by environmental organizations and state regulators for concerns related to GHG emissions.  For instance, various state regulatory authorities have rejected the construction of new coal-fueled power plants based on the uncertainty surrounding the potential costs associated with GHG emissions from these plants under future laws limiting the emissions of carbon dioxide.  In addition, several permits issued to new coal-fueled power plants without limits on GHG emissions have been appealed to the EPA's Environmental Appeals Board.  In addition, over thirty states have currently adopted "renewable energy standards" or "renewable portfolio standards," which encourage or require electric utilities to obtain a certain percentage of their electric generation portfolio from renewable resources by a certain date.  Several states have announced their intent to have renewable energy comprise 100% of their electric generation portfolio. Other states may adopt similar requirements, and federal legislation is a possibility in this area.  To the extent these requirements affect our current and prospective customers, they may reduce the demand for coal-fired power, and may affect long-term demand for our coal.  Finally, a federal appeals court allowed a lawsuit pursuing federal common law claims to proceed against certain utilities on the basis that they may have created a public nuisance due to their emissions of carbon dioxide, while a second federal appeals court dismissed a similar case on procedural grounds.  The United States Supreme Court overturned that decision in June 2011, holding that federal common law provides no basis for public nuisance claims against utilities due to their carbon dioxide emissions.  The United States Supreme Court did not, however, decide whether similar claims can be brought under state common law.  As a result, despite this favorable ruling, tort-type liabilities remain a concern.
     In addition, environmental advocacy groups have filed a variety of judicial challenges claiming that the environmental analyses conducted by federal agencies before granting permits and other approvals necessary for certain coal activities do not satisfy the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act ("NEPA").  These groups assert that the environmental analyses in question do not adequately consider the climate change impacts of these particular projects.  In December 2014 the Council on Environmental Quality ("CEQ") released updated draft guidance discussing how federal agencies should consider the effects of GHG emissions and climate change in their NEPA evaluations.  The guidance encourages agencies to provide more detailed discussion of the direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts of a proposed action's reasonably foreseeable emissions and effects.  This guidance could create additional delays and costs in the NEPA review process or in our operations, or even an inability to obtain necessary federal approvals for our future operations, including due to the increased risk of legal challenges from environmental groups seeking additional analysis of climate impacts.  In April 2017, CEQ withdrew its final 2016 guidance on how federal agencies should incorporate climate change and GHG considerations into NEPA reviews of federal actions; however, the potential remains for CEQ to issue similar guidance in the future.
     Many states and regions have adopted GHG initiatives and certain governmental bodies have or are considering the imposition of fees or taxes based on the emission of GHG by certain facilities, including coal-fired electric generating facilities.  For example, in 2005, ten Northeastern states entered into the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative agreement ("RGGI"), calling for implementation of a cap and trade program aimed at reducing carbon dioxide emissions from power plants in the participating states.  The members of RGGI have established in statutes and/or regulations a carbon dioxide trading program.  Auctions for carbon dioxide allowances under the program began in September 2008.  Since its inception, several additional northeastern states and Canadian provinces have joined RGGI as participants or observers.  In addition, New Jersey is expected to rejoin RGGI and the recently elected governors of Pennsylvania and Virginia have expressed interest in joining RGGI.
     Following the RGGI model, five Western states launched the Western Regional Climate Action Initiative to identify, evaluate, and implement collective and cooperative methods of reducing GHG in the region to 15% below 2005 levels by 2020.  These states were joined by two additional states and four Canadian provinces and became collectively known as the Western Climate Initiative Partners. However, in November 2011, six states withdrew, leaving California and the four Canadian provinces as members. At a January 2012 stakeholder meeting, this group confirmed a commitment and timetable to create the largest carbon market in North America and provide a model to guide future efforts to establish national approaches in both Canada and the United States to reduce GHG emissions.  It is likely that these regional efforts will continue.
     It is possible that future international, federal and state initiatives to control GHG emissions could result in increased costs associated with coal production and consumption, such as costs to install additional controls to reduce carbon dioxide emissions or costs to purchase emissions reduction credits to comply with future emissions trading programs.  Such 

 
  20

 
increased costs for coal consumption could result in some customers switching to alternative sources of fuel, or otherwise adversely affect our operations and demand for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  Also, recently activist shareholders have made attempts to pressure large financial institutions to restrict access to capital for the fossil fuel industry.
     Water Discharge
     The Federal Clean Water Act ("CWA") and similar state and local laws and regulations affect coal mining operations by imposing restrictions on effluent discharge into waters and the discharge of dredged or fill material into the waters of the United States Regular monitoring, as well as compliance with reporting requirements and performance standards, is a precondition for the issuance and renewal of permits governing the discharge of pollutants into water.  Section 404 of the CWA imposes permitting and mitigation requirements associated with the dredging and filling of wetlands and streams.  The CWA and equivalent state legislation, where such equivalent state legislation exists, affect coal mining operations that impact wetlands and streams.  Although permitting requirements have been tightened in recent years, we believe we have obtained all necessary permits required under CWA Section 404 as it has traditionally been interpreted by the responsible agencies.  However, mitigation requirements under existing and possible future "fill" permits may vary considerably.  For that reason, the setting of post-mine asset retirement obligation accruals for such mitigation projects is difficult to ascertain with certainty and may increase in the future.  For more information about asset retirement obligations, please read "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 16 - Asset Retirement Obligations." Although more stringent permitting requirements may be imposed in the future, we are not able to accurately predict the impact, if any, of such permitting requirements.
     The United States Army Corps of Engineers ("Corps of Engineers") maintains two permitting programs under CWA Section 404 for the discharge of dredged or fill material: one for "individual" permits and a more streamlined program for "general" permits.  In June 2010, the Corps of Engineers suspended the use of "general" permits under Nationwide Permit 21 ("NWP 21") in the Appalachian states.  In February 2012, the Corps of Engineers reissued the final 2012 NWP 21.  The Center for Biological Diversity later filed a notice of intent to sue the Corps of Engineers based on allegations the 2012 NWP 21 program violated the Endangered Species Act ("ESA").  The Corps of Engineers and National Marine Fisheries Service ("NMFS") have completed their programmatic ESA Section 7 consultation process on the Corps of Engineers' 2012 NWP 21 package, and NMFS has issued a revised biological opinion finding that the NWP 21 program does not jeopardize the continued existence of threatened and endangered species and will not result in the destruction or adverse modification of designated critical habitat. However, the opinion contains 12 additional protective measures the Corps of Engineers will implement in certain districts to "enhance the protection of listed species and critical habitat." While these measures will not affect previously verified permit activities where construction has not yet been completed, several Corps of Engineers districts with mining operations will be impacted by the additional protective measures going forward. These measures include additional reporting and notification requirements, potential imposition of new regional conditions and additional actions concerning cumulative effects analyses and mitigation.  Our coal mining operations typically require Section 404 permits to authorize activities such as the creation of slurry ponds and stream impoundments.  The CWA authorizes the EPA to review Section 404 permits issued by the Corps of Engineers, and in 2009, the EPA began reviewing Section 404 permits issued by the Corps of Engineers for coal mining in Appalachia.  Currently, significant uncertainty exists regarding the obtaining of permits under the CWA for coal mining operations in Appalachia due to various initiatives launched by the EPA regarding these permits.
     The EPA also has statutory "veto" power over a Section 404 permit if the EPA determines, after notice and an opportunity for a public hearing, that the permit will have an "unacceptable adverse effect." In January 2011, the EPA exercised its veto power to withdraw or restrict the use of a previously issued permit for Spruce No. 1 Surface Mine in West Virginia, which is one of the largest surface mining operations ever authorized in Appalachia.  This action was the first time that such power was exercised with regard to a previously permitted coal mining project.  A challenge to the EPA's exercise of this authority was made in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia and in March 2012, that court ruled that the EPA lacked the statutory authority to invalidate an already issued Section 404 permit retroactively.  In April 2013, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed this decision and authorized the EPA to retroactively veto portions of a Section 404 permit.  The United States Supreme Court denied a request to review this decision.  Any future use of the EPA's Section 404 "veto" power could create uncertainly with regard to our continued use of current permits, as well as impose additional time and cost burdens on future operations, potentially adversely affecting our coal revenues.  In addition, the EPA initiated a preemptive veto prior to the filing of any actual permit application for a copper and gold mine based on fictitious mine scenario. The implications of this decision could allow the EPA to bypass the state permitting process and engage in watershed and land use planning.  In June 2018, the EPA Administrator issued 

 
  21

 
a memorandum directing the EPA's Office of Water to promulgate draft regulations eliminating the use of the EPA's Section 404 authority before a Section 404 permit application has been filed, or after a permit has been issued. To date, the EPA has not issued a proposed rule.
     Total Maximum Daily Load ("TMDL") regulations under the CWA establish a process to calculate the maximum amount of a pollutant that an impaired water body can receive and still meet state water quality standards, and to allocate pollutant loads among the point and non-point pollutant sources discharging into that water body.  Likewise, when water quality in a receiving stream is better than required, states are required to conduct an antidegradation review before approving discharge permits. The adoption of new TMDL-related allocations or any changes to antidegradation policies for streams near our coal mines could require more costly water treatment and could adversely affect our coal production.
     Considerable legal uncertainty exists surrounding the standard for what constitutes jurisdictional waters and wetlands subject to the protections and requirements of the CWA. A 2015 rulemaking by the EPA to revise the standard was stayed nationwide by the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit and stayed for certain primarily western states by a United States District Court in North Dakota. In January 2018, the Supreme Court determined that the circuit courts do not have jurisdiction to hear challenges to the 2015 rule, removing the basis for the Sixth Circuit to continue its nationwide stay. Additionally, the EPA has promulgated a final rule that extends the applicability date of the 2015 rule for another two years in order to allow the EPA to undertake a rulemaking on the question of what constitutes a water of the United States. In the meantime, judicial challenges to the 2015 rulemaking are likely to continue to work their way through the courts along with challenges to the recent rulemaking that extends the applicability date of the 2015 rule. For now, the EPA and the Corps of Engineers will continue to apply the existing standard for what constitutes a water of the United States as determined by the Supreme Court in the Rapanos case and post-Rapanos guidance. Should the 2015 rule take effect, or should a different rule expanding the definition of what constitutes a water of the United States be promulgated as a result of the EPA and the Corps of Engineers' rulemaking process, we could face increased costs and delays due to additional permitting and regulatory requirements and possible challenges to permitting decisions.  In December 2018, the EPA issued a proposed rule to revise the definition "to increase CWA program predictability and consistency by increasing clarity as to the scope of 'waters of the United States' federally regulated under the Act."  Litigation surrounding these developments is ongoing and we cannot predict the outcome at this time.
     Hazardous Substances and Wastes
     The Federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act ("CERCLA"), otherwise known as the "Superfund" law, and analogous state laws, impose liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on certain classes of persons that are considered to have contributed to the release of a "hazardous substance" into the environment.  These persons include the owner or operator of the site where the release occurred and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances found at the site.  Persons who are or were responsible for the release of hazardous substances may be subject to joint and several liability under CERCLA for the costs of cleaning up releases of hazardous substances and natural resource damages.  Some products used in coal mining operations generate waste containing hazardous substances.  We are currently unaware of any material liability associated with the release or disposal of hazardous substances from our past or present mine sites.
     The Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act ("RCRA") and corresponding state laws regulating hazardous waste affect coal mining operations by imposing requirements for the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, disposal, and cleanup of hazardous wastes. Many mining wastes are excluded from the regulatory definition of hazardous wastes, and coal mining operations covered by SMCRA permits are by statute exempted from RCRA permitting. RCRA also allows the EPA to require corrective action at sites where there is a release of hazardous substances.  In addition, each state has its own laws regarding the proper management and disposal of waste material.  While these laws impose ongoing compliance obligations, such costs are not believed to have a material impact on our operations.
     In June 2010, the EPA released a proposed rule to regulate the disposal of certain coal combustion by-products ("CCB").  The proposed rule set forth two very different options for regulating CCB under RCRA.  The first option called for regulation of CCB as a hazardous waste under Subtitle C, which creates a comprehensive program of federally enforceable requirements for waste management and disposal.  The second option utilized Subtitle D, which would give the EPA authority to set performance standards for waste management facilities and would be enforced primarily through citizen suits.  The proposal leaves intact the Bevill exemption for beneficial uses of CCB.  In April 2012, several environmental organizations filed suit against the EPA to compel the EPA to take action on the proposed rule.  Several companies and industry groups intervened.  A consent decree was entered on January 29, 2014.

 
  22

 

     The EPA finalized the CCB rule on December 19, 2014, setting nationwide solid nonhazardous waste standards for CCB disposal.  On April 17, 2015, the EPA finalized regulations under the solid waste provisions of Subtitle D of RCRA and not the hazardous waste provisions of Subtitle C which became effective on October 19, 2015.  The EPA affirms in the preamble to the final rule that "this rule does not apply to CCR placed in active or abandoned underground or surface mines." Instead, "the United States Department of Interior ("DOI") and EPA will address the management of CCR in mine fills in a separate regulatory action(s)." While classification of CCB as a hazardous waste would have led to more stringent restrictions and higher costs, this regulation may still increase our customers' operating costs and potentially reduce their ability to purchase coal.
     On November 3, 2015, the EPA published the final rule Effluent Limitations Guidelines and Standards ("ELG"), revising the regulations for the Steam Electric Power Generating category which became effective on January 4, 2016. The rule sets the first federal limits on the levels of toxic metals in wastewater that can be discharged from power plants, based on technology improvements in the steam electric power industry over the last three decades. The combined effect of the CCR and ELG regulations has forced power generating companies to close existing ash ponds and will likely force the closure of certain older existing coal burning power plants that cannot comply with the new standards.  These regulations add costs to the operation of coal burning power plants on top of other regulations like the 2014 regulations issued under Section 316(b) of the CWA that affects the cooling water intake structures at power plants in order to reduce fish impingement and entrainment. Individually and collectively, these regulations could, in turn, impact the market for our products.  In April 2017, the EPA granted petitions for reconsideration and an administrative stay of all future compliance deadlines for the ELG rule.  In August 2017, the EPA granted petitions for reconsideration of the CCR rule.  In July 2018, the EPA published a final rule to revise requirements and extend the deadlines from the 2015 rule. In August 2018, the DC Circuit issued a decision that imposed additional restrictions and addressed all remaining issues in the litigation on the 2015 CCR rule.  This court decision could make it more difficult for the EPA to reform the 2015 rule.
     Endangered Species Act
     The federal ESA and counterpart state legislation protect species threatened with possible extinction. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service (the "USFWS") works closely with the OSM and state regulatory agencies to ensure that species subject to the ESA are protected from mining-related impacts.  If the USFWS were to designate species indigenous to the areas in which we operate as threatened or endangered, we could be subject to additional regulatory and permitting requirements.     Other Environmental, Health and Safety Regulations
     In addition to the laws and regulations described above, we are subject to regulations regarding underground and above ground storage tanks in which we may store petroleum or other substances.  Some monitoring equipment that we use is subject to licensing under the Federal Atomic Energy Act. Water supply wells located on our properties are subject to federal, state, and local regulation.  In addition, our use of explosives is subject to the Federal Safe Explosives Act.  We are also required to comply with the Federal Safe Drinking Water Act, the Toxic Substance Control Act, and the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act.  The costs of compliance with these regulations should not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.     Regulation of the Oil & Gas Industry
     Oil, natural gas and NGL exploration, development and production operations are subject to stringent laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to protection of the environment or occupational health and safety. While we are not the operator for oil & gas activities associated with our mineral interests, these laws and regulations have the potential to impact production on our properties, including requirements to: 
· | obtain permits to conduct regulated activities;
--+------------------------------------------------


· | limit or prohibit drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands and other protected areas;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | restrict the types, quantities and concentration of materials that can be released into the environment in the performance of drilling and production activities;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | initiate investigatory and remedial measures to mitigate pollution from former or current operations, such as restoration of drilling pits and plugging of abandoned wells; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 
  23

 


· | apply specific health and safety criteria addressing worker protection.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------

      Failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal sanctions, including monetary penalties, the imposition of strict, joint and several liability, investigatory and remedial obligations and the issuance of injunctions limiting or prohibiting some or all of the operations on our properties. Moreover, these laws, rules and regulations may restrict the rate of oil, natural gas and NGL production below the rate that would otherwise be possible. The regulatory burden on the oil & gas industry increases the cost of doing business in the industry and consequently affects profitability. The trend in environmental regulation has been to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment, and thus, any changes in environmental laws and regulations or re-interpretation of enforcement policies that result in more stringent and costly construction, drilling, water management, completion, emission or discharge limits or waste handling, disposal or remediation obligations could increase the cost to our operators of developing our properties. Moreover, accidental releases or spills may occur in the course of operations on our properties, causing our operators to incur significant costs and liabilities as a result of such releases or spills, including any third-party claims for damage to property, natural resources or persons. Increased costs or operating restrictions on our properties as a result of compliance with or liability under environmental laws could result in reduced exploratory and production activities on our properties and thus adversely affect the income those properties generate.
     Employees
     To conduct our operations, as of December 31, 2018, we employed 3,599 full-time employees, including 3,212 employees involved in active mining operations, 212 employees in other operations, and 175 corporate employees.  Our work force is entirely union-free.     Administrative Services
     On April 1, 2010, effective January 1, 2010, ARLP entered into an administrative services agreement ("Administrative Services Agreement") with our general partner, the Intermediate Partnership, AGP, AHGP and Alliance Resource Holdings II, Inc. ("ARH II").  Under the Administrative Services Agreement, certain employees, including some executive officers, provided administrative services for AHGP, AGP and ARH II and their respective affiliates.  Prior to the Simplification Transactions, we were reimbursed for services rendered by our employees on behalf of these entities as provided under the Administrative Services Agreement.  We billed and recognized administrative service revenue under this agreement for the year ended December 31, 2018 of $0.2 million from AHGP.  In conjunction with the Simplification Transactions, we discontinued the Administrative Service Agreement.
