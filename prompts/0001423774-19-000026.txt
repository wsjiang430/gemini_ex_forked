Item 1. Business
Overview
Zuora is a leading cloud-based subscription management platform. We provide software that enables companies across multiple industries and geographies to launch, manage or transform to a subscription business model. Architected specifically for dynamic, recurring subscription business models, our cloud-based software functions as an intelligent subscription management hub that automates and orchestrates the entire subscription order-to-revenue process, including billing and revenue recognition. Our solution enables businesses to easily change pricing and packaging for products and services to grow and scale, to efficiently comply with revenue recognition standards, and to build meaningful relationships with their subscribers.
We believe we are in the early stages of a multi-decade global shift away from product-based business models, characterized by transactional one-time sales, towards recurring subscription-based business models. This trend, which we refer to as the “Subscription Economy,” is visible everywhere you look. In media and entertainment, consumers are adopting video-on-demand services and digital music streaming services. Commuters are taking advantage of automobile subscription programs and subscription-based ride-sharing services. In the technology space, companies are opting for software-as-a-service applications over on-premise installations. In manufacturing, sensors and connectivity have allowed companies to bundle an array of digital services with their physical products. Digital subscriptions have had a positive effect on the newspaper and publishing industries, with readers increasingly subscribing to digital news and information sources. In addition, the retail space features a growing multitude of subscription services including clothing and accessories, cosmetics and personal care, meals and groceries, vitamins and prescriptions, pet care, and many more.
Many of today’s enterprise software systems that businesses use to manage their order-to-revenue processes were built for a product driven economy, and are extremely difficult to re-configure for the dynamic, ongoing nature of subscription services. In traditional business models, order-to-revenue was a linear process—a customer orders a product, is billed for that product, payment is collected, and the revenue is recognized. These legacy systems were not specifically designed to handle the complexities and ongoing customer events of recurring relationships and their impact on areas such as billing proration, revenue recognition, and reporting in real-time. Trying to use this software to build a subscription business frequently results in prolonged and complex manual downstream work, hard-coded customizations, a proliferation of stock-keeping units (SKUs), and inefficiency.
Subscription business models are inherently dynamic, with multiple interactions and constantly-changing relationships and events. The capabilities to launch, price, and bill for products, facilitate and record cash receipts, process and recognize revenue, and produce the data required to close their books and drive key decisions are mission critical and particularly complex for companies with subscription business models. As a result, as companies launch or grow a subscription business, they often conclude that legacy systems are inadequate.
Our vision is simple. We call it “The World Subscribed,” and it’s the idea that one day every company will be a part of the Subscription Economy. Our mission is to enable all companies to be successful in the Subscription Economy. Zuora’s products enable companies to:

• | Reduce Time to Market. Zuora significantly reduces the time required to go-to-market with new subscription offerings and to iterate on the pricing and packaging of existing offerings, enabling businesses to quickly react to changing market and customer needs, launch new services, and enter new markets. Changes can be made in minutes without having to re-code or re-engineer back office systems.


• | Increase Operational Efficiencies. Customers regularly make changes to their subscriptions. Zuora automates these processes and reduces the impact of changes, including proration for invoices, changes to revenue recognition, taxation, provisioning, and reporting. Automating these functions saves businesses valuable time and resources by eliminating manual processes and customizations, increasing operational efficiencies.


• | Free Up IT and Engineering Resources. Our cloud-based solution reduces both system complexity and costs. With Zuora, engineering and IT departments no longer need to build in-house custom systems or customizations for their Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems to keep up with market changes, ongoing customer demands, and new order-to-cash processes.


• | Establish a Single System of Record. Our solution captures financial and operational data and enables subscription businesses to have a single system of record rather than having to reconcile data from multiple systems. Key business metrics can be accessed at any point in time to make critical business decisions.

• | Make Customer Data-Driven Decisions. Because our solution serves as a single source of data and information for subscribers, companies can use Zuora to gain insight into customer behavior. This helps them understand their subscribers better, predict up-sell opportunities, and increase customer retention.


• | Access Growing Ecosystem of Order-to-Revenue Software Partners. Our solution has over 50 pre-built connectors to various order-to-revenue software partners, including payment gateways, tax vendors, general ledgers, and Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems. Rather than building integrations for each of these, our customers can take advantage of pre-built connectors to extend the capabilities of Zuora for specific industries.


• | Support Rapid International Expansion. With over 30 pre-built payment gateways, over 150 supported currencies, and over 20 supported payment methods, our solution enables companies to quickly expand internationally and acquire and support customers in new geographical regions. We believe we are well-positioned to capitalize on what we see as a broad, industry-wide shift towards subscription business models. We have spent over a decade doing three things: building leading and differentiated technology, enhancing our proprietary deployment methodology, and deploying a business model that enables us to deliver on our mission and achieve long-term sustainable growth.


• | Automate Revenue Recognition. In light of the accounting complexities associated with subscription models, our revenue recognition product automates revenue recognition processes in compliance with accounting standards and reduces our customers’ reliance on error-prone manual processing and spreadsheets.

We currently serve customers in over 30 countries, across dozens of industries. We had 526 customers with annual contract value (ACV) equal to or greater than $100,000 as of January 31, 2019. Customers pay for our platform under a subscription-based model, and this model allows us to grow as the Subscription Economy grows. For fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, our total revenue was $235.2 million, $167.9 million and $113.0 million, respectively. 
Products
Our solution is the system of record for our customers’ subscription business models and consists of three components: our Zuora Central Platform, order-to-revenue products, and an application marketplace.
Zuora Central Platform
Our Zuora Central Platform acts as an intelligent subscription management hub, allowing customers to orient order-to-revenue operations around it to create a dynamic order-to-revenue process designed specifically for subscription business models. Our Zuora Central Platform is composed of six core engines.

• | Pricing Engine allows customers to price and package in minutes without having to recode or re-engineer back-office systems. This includes mixing and matching one-time, recurring, or usage pricing models in order to design strategic and tailored pricing plans.


• | Subscription Orders Engine automates the subscription management lifecycle and recalculates billing, payments, and revenue for events during the subscriber lifecycle.


• | Rating Engine enables our customers to meter and rate any monetization or account model so their customers are charged accurately.


• | Global Payments Engine simplifies worldwide payment operations by enabling our customers to charge using over 30 pre-built payment gateways, over 150 supported currencies, and over 20 supported payment methods.


• | Subscription Metrics Engine provides reporting and insight into metrics required to run a subscription business.


• | Subscription Accounting Engine increases business agility by helping our customers close their books with audit-ready, automated financial operations.

Products
We can deploy and configure our portfolio of order-to-revenue products to meet a wide variety of use cases for subscription business models.
We offer two flagship products:

• | Zuora Billing. Designed specifically for subscription billing, Zuora Billing allows our customers to bill in multiple ways, calculate prorations when subscriptions change, and to group customers into batches for different billing and payment operations. The product also helps our customers set payment terms, manage hierarchical billing relationships, consolidate invoicing across multiple subscriptions, and collect revenue using a global network of payment gateways.

• | Zuora RevPro. Zuora RevPro is a revenue recognition automation solution that enables our customers to group transactions of goods and services into revenue contracts and performance obligations in accordance with the new ASC 606 / IFRS 15 revenue standards. Zuora RevPro helps our customers automate revenue and deferred revenue management in accordance with their accounting policies, business rules, and pricing models.

We also offer add-on products including:

• | Zuora CPQ. Designed specifically for configuring deals, pricing, and quoting in a subscription business, Zuora CPQ allows our customers to configure any type of deal, such as multi-year subscriptions, and price ramp deals and use the rules engine and guided selling workflows to scale their sales team.


• | Zuora Collect. Specifically designed to handle the complicated function of collections associated with dynamic subscription-based businesses, Zuora Collect helps our customers streamline their collections processes by configuring their own automated dunning workflow, orchestrating various retry rules for electronic payments, and targeting the root cause of a payment decline.

Zuora Marketplace
The Zuora Marketplace offers industry-specific tools and third-party applications that extend Zuora’s capabilities for our customers. The Zuora Marketplace has dozens of applications and features from over 50 partners. Applications include a broad range of applications needed by subscription businesses, such as pre-built general ledger connectors, pre-built tax connectors, pre-built payment gateways connectors, pre-built lockbox connectors, developer applications, and collections applications.

Our Customers
Organizations of all sizes, across a wide variety of industries and in many locations around the world, have adopted our platform. As of January 31, 2019, we had 526 customers with annual contract value (ACV) equal to or greater than $100,000, representing over 85% of our total ACV. As of January 31, 2018 and 2017, we had 415 and 292 customers, respectively, with ACV equal to or greater than $100,000. We define the number of customers at the end of any particular period as the number of parties or organizations that have entered into a distinct subscription contract with us for which the term has not ended. Each party with which we have entered into a distinct subscription contract is considered a unique customer, and in some cases, there may be more than one customer within a single organization. For a definition of ACV, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Operational and Financial Metrics.”
No customer represented more than 10% of our total revenue for fiscal 2019, fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017.
Research and Development
Our research and development organization is responsible for the design, development, testing, and certification of our applications. We believe that our differentiated intellectual property and technical deployments will help us maintain a leading position in the market for subscription management solutions.
Sales and Marketing
We market and sell to organizations of all sizes across a broad range of industries. Our key focus areas are companies that are adopting, transforming, and expanding their subscription businesses.
We have a mature enterprise sales model and have built and trained a nimble, enterprise-scale sales and field organization. Because of the transformative nature of our solution, especially in larger organizations, the selling process is often complex and can involve agreement across multiple departments inside an organization, including the chief executive officer. Over the years, we have developed methodologies and best practices to enable our sales teams to be successful at navigating these challenges and have built these learnings into our sales enablement and training to ensure successful onboarding and productivity of new sales account executives. We believe our mature sales methodologies and processes offer us significant advantages, particularly in long enterprise sales-cycles. Our sales teams are organized by geographic territories, customer size, and customer verticals. We plan to continue to invest in our direct sales force to grow our enterprise customer base, both domestically and internationally.
We conduct a wide range of marketing activities such as our annual Subscribed events around the world; partner marketing events with our GSIs, consultants, technology, and ecosystem partners; the Subscription Economy Index, our study of the collective health of subscription businesses and their impact on the overall economy; as well as educational content, data-based benchmarks and best practices sharing for the Subscription Economy in a variety of formats such as digital, print, and video.
As newer markets emerge domestically and internationally, we plan to continue investing in our sales and marketing to grow our customer base.
Competition
The market for subscription management products and services is highly competitive, rapidly evolving, fragmented, and subject to changing technology, shifting customer needs, and frequent introductions of new products and services. Our main competitors fall into the following categories:

• | providers of traditional ERP software, such as Oracle Corporation and SAP AG;


• | traditional order-to-revenue solutions that address individual elements of the subscription revenue process, such as traditional Configure Price Quote (CPQ) management, billing, collections, revenue recognition, or e-commerce software;


• | telecommunications billing systems and other niche systems, such as Amdocs Limited; and


• | in-house custom built systems.

The competitive factors that companies in our industry need to have are:
5


• | subscription-based product features and functionality;


• | ability to support the specific needs of companies with subscription business models;


• | ease of use;


• | vision for the market and product innovation;


• | enterprise-grade performance and features such as system scalability, security, performance, and resiliency;


• | customer experience, including support and professional services;


• | strength of sales and marketing efforts;


• | relationships with GSIs, management consulting firms, and resellers;


• | ability to integrate with legacy and other enterprise infrastructures and third-party applications;


• | brand awareness and reputation; and


• | total cost of ownership.

We believe we compete favorably against our competitors with respect to these factors. Our ability to compete will largely depend on our ongoing performance and the quality of our platform.
Employees
As of January 31, 2019, we had a total of 1,221 employees, including 476 outside the United States including in Europe and Asia. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We believe we have a good relationship with our employees and our unique, strong culture differentiates us and is a key driver of business success.
Intellectual Property
Intellectual property is an important aspect of our business, and we seek protection for our intellectual property as appropriate. We currently rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, confidentiality procedures, contractual commitments, and other legal rights to protect our intellectual property. As of January 31, 2019, in the United States, we hold three issued patents that expire in 2035, and have fifteen patent applications pending. We also hold one issued patent in Australia that expires in 2032 (absent any extensions), and have six patent applications pending in other foreign jurisdictions. We continually review our development efforts to assess the existence and patentability of new intellectual property. We also pursue the registration of our domain names, trademarks, and service marks in the United States and in certain foreign jurisdictions. As of January 31, 2019, we had sixteen registered trademarks in the United States, including Zuora, Subscription Economy, Subscribed, and Powering the Subscription Economy. We also had twelve registered trademarks in foreign jurisdictions.
Intellectual property laws, procedures, and restrictions provide only limited protection and any of our intellectual property rights may be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, infringed, or misappropriated. Further, the laws of certain countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States and, therefore, in certain jurisdictions, we may be unable to protect our proprietary technology.
Backlog
We generally enter into subscription agreements with our customers with one- to three-year terms. The timing of our invoices to the customer is a negotiated term and thus varies among our subscription contracts. We typically invoice customers in advance in either annual or quarterly installments. Due to this, at any point in the contract term, there can be amounts that we have not yet been contractually able to invoice. Until such time as these amounts are invoiced, they are not recorded in revenue, deferred revenue, or elsewhere in our consolidated financial statements, and are considered by us to be backlog. 
We expect that the amount of backlog relative to the total value of our contracts will change from year to year for several reasons, including the amount of cash collected early in the contract term, the specific timing and duration of large customer subscription agreements, varying invoicing cycles of subscription agreements, the specific timing of customer renewal, changes in customer financial circumstances, and foreign currency fluctuations. Moreover, customers may attempt to renegotiate the terms of their agreements to, among other things, change their committed volume during the term of the subscription agreements. Our customers also often make other alterations to their subscription agreements during the term of the agreement, including changing their platform edition or the products they subscribe to. All of these changes during the term of a customer’s 
6

subscription agreement may significantly impact the firm backlog as of any particular date. Accordingly, we believe that fluctuations in backlog are not necessarily a reliable indicator of future revenue and we do not utilize backlog as a key management metric internally.
