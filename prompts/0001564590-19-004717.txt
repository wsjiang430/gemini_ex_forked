End Markets
 We primarily operate in two end markets: the advanced industrial market and the medical market. 
 Advanced Industrial Market
 For the year ended December 31, 2018, the advanced industrial market accounted for approximately 50% of the Company’s revenue. Revenue from our products sold to the advanced industrial market is affected by a number of factors, including changing technology requirements and preferences of our customers, productivity or quality investments in a manufacturing environment, the financial condition of our customers, changes in regulatory requirements and laws, and general economic conditions. We believe that the Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) on manufacturing activities specific to different regions around the world may provide an indication of the impact of general economic conditions on our sales into the advanced industrial market. 
 6


Medical Market
 For the year ended December 31, 2018, the medical market accounted for approximately 50% of the Company’s revenue. Revenue from our products sold to the medical market is generally affected by hospital and other healthcare provider capital spending, changes in regulatory requirements and laws, aggregation of purchasing by healthcare networks, trends in surgical procedures, changes in technology requirements, changes in customer or patient preferences, and general demographic trends. 
Working Capital Requirements
 There are no special inventory requirements or credit terms extended to customers that would have a material adverse effect on our working capital.
 Customers 
 We have a diverse group of customers that include companies that are global leaders in their industries. Many of our customers participate in several market industries. No customer accounted for greater than 10% of our consolidated revenue during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 or 2016. 
 Customers of our Photonics, Vision, and Precision Motion segments include a large number of OEM customers who integrate our products into their systems for sale to end users. We also sell directly to end users. Our customers include leaders in the medical and advanced industrial markets. A typical OEM customer will usually evaluate our products and our ability to provide application knowledge and expertise, post-sales application support and services, supply chain management over long durations, manufacturing capabilities, product quality, global presence, and product customization before deciding to incorporate our products into their products or systems. Customers generally choose suppliers based on a number of factors, including product performance, reliability, application support, price, breadth of the supplier’s product offerings, the financial condition of the supplier, and the geographical coverage offered by the supplier. Once certain of our products have been designed into a given OEM customer’s product or system, there are generally significant barriers to subsequent supplier changes until the end of the product or system life cycle, especially in the medical market. 
 Seasonality 
 While our revenues are not highly seasonal on a consolidated basis, the revenues of some of our individual product lines, particularly our visualization solutions, imaging informatics, and thermal chart recorder products, are impacted in the first and fourth quarters by seasonality due to hospital budgeting cycles.
Backlog 
 As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, our consolidated backlog was approximately $234.4 million and $187.1 million, respectively. The majority of orders included in backlog represent open orders for products and services that, based on management’s projections, have a reasonable probability of being delivered over the subsequent twelve-month period. Orders included in backlog may be canceled or rescheduled by customers without significant penalty. Management believes that backlog is not a meaningful indicator of future business prospects for any of our business segments due to the short lead time required on our products and the ability of customers to reschedule or cancel orders. Therefore, backlog as of any particular date should not be relied upon as indicative of our revenues for any future period. 
Manufacturing 
 Manufacturing functions are performed internally when we choose to maintain control over critical portions of the production process or for cost related reasons while some of the less critical portions are outsourced to third parties. To the extent it makes financial sense, we will consider outsourcing additional portions of the production process. 
 Products offered by our Photonics segment are manufactured at facilities in Bedford, Massachusetts; Mukilteo, Washington; Phoenix, Arizona; Taunton and Manchester, United Kingdom; and Suzhou, China. Products offered by our Vision segment are manufactured at facilities in Syracuse and Rochester, New York; San Jose, California; and Ludwigsstadt, Germany. Products offered by our Precision Motion segment are primarily manufactured at facilities in Bedford, Massachusetts; Loomis, California; Poole and Cambridge, United Kingdom; and Suzhou, China.
 Many of our products are manufactured under ISO 9001 certification, while the majority of our products manufactured for the medical market are manufactured under ISO 13485 certification. Our medical insufflators, pumps, cameras and accessories products are also manufactured under ISO 14001 certification. Certain visualization solutions, thermal chart recorders and imaging informatics

products are manufactured under current good manufacturing practices (CGMPs), which is a requirement of their medical device classification by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”). In addition, certain visualization solutions, thermal printers, imaging informatics and medical insufflators, pumps, cameras and accessories products are manufactured under section 510(k) of the FDA. 
 Marketing, Sales and Distribution 
 We sell our products globally, primarily through our direct sales force. Sales outside of the United States are largely based on a direct sales force, but occasionally are sold through distributors, including manufacturers’ representatives, to either augment our selling effort or serve a local market where we have no direct sales force. Our local sales, applications, and service teams and our distributors work closely with our customers to ensure customer satisfaction with our products. We have sales and service centers located in the United States, Europe and Asia. 
 To support our sales efforts, we maintain and continue to invest in a number of application centers around the world, where our application experts work closely with customers on integrating and using our solutions in their equipment. We currently maintain several service and application centers in the United States, Europe and Asia.
 Competition 
 The markets in which we compete are dynamic and highly competitive. Due to the wide range of our products, we face many different types of competition and competitors. This affects our ability to sell our products and the prices at which these products are sold. Our competitors range from large foreign and domestic organizations, which produce a comprehensive array of goods and services and may have greater financial and other resources than we do, to small firms producing a limited number of goods or services for specialized market segments. 
 Competitive factors in our Photonics, Vision, and Precision Motion segments include product performance, price, quality and reliability, features, compatibility of products with existing systems, technical support, product breadth, market presence, on-time delivery and our overall reputation. We believe that our products offer a number of competitive advantages. However, some of our competitors are substantially larger and have greater financial and other resources. 
 Raw Materials, Components and Supplies 
 Each of our businesses uses a wide variety of raw materials, key components and parts that are generally available from alternative sources of supply and in adequate quantities from domestic and foreign sources. In some instances, we design and/or re-engineer the parts and components used in our products. For certain critical raw materials, key components and parts used in the production of some of our principal products, we have identified only a limited number of suppliers or, in some instances, a single source of supply. We also rely on a limited number of suppliers to manufacture subassemblies for some of our products. 
 For a further discussion of the importance and risks associated with our supply chain, see applicable risk factors under Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 Patents and Intellectual Property 
 We rely upon a combination of copyrights, patents, trademarks, trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights. We hold a number of registered and pending patents in the United States and other countries. In addition, we also have trademarks registered in the United States and other countries. We will continue to actively pursue applications for new patents and trademarks as we deem appropriate. However, there can be no assurance that any other patents will be issued to us or that such patents, if and when issued, will provide any protection or benefit to us. 
 Although we believe that our patents and pending patent applications are important, we rely upon several additional factors that are essential to our business success, including: market position, technological innovation, know-how, application knowledge and product performance. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to sustain these advantages. Considering the diversified nature of our businesses, we do not believe that any individual patent is material to our business as a whole.
 We also protect our proprietary rights by controlling access to our proprietary information and by maintaining confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, and certain customers and suppliers. For a further discussion of the importance of risks associated with our intellectual property rights, see applicable risk factors under Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Human Resources 
 As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we employed 2,133 and 2,034 employees, respectively. We also utilize temporary and contract personnel that are not included in these headcount numbers. 
 Government Regulation 
 Our current and contemplated activities and the products and processes that will result from such activities are subject to substantial government regulations, both in the United States and internationally. Most of our production facilities are subject to various federal, state, local, and/or foreign environmental regulations related to the use, storage, handling, and disposal of regulated materials, chemicals, and certain waste products. Such rules are subject to changes by the governing agencies and we monitor those changes closely.
 We may face increasing complexity in our product designs and procurement operations due to the evolving nature of product compliance standards. Those standards may impact the material composition of our products entering specific markets. Such regulations went into effect in the European Union (“EU”) in 2006 (“The Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive” (“RoHS”)) and in 2007 (“Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals” (“REACH”)), and in China in 2007 (“Management Methods for Controlling Pollution Caused by Electronic Information Products Regulation” (“China-RoHS”)).
 Our capital expenditures, earnings, and competitive position have not been, and are not expected to be, materially affected by our compliance with federal, state, and local environmental provisions which have been enacted or adopted to regulate the distribution of materials into the environment.
 Medical Device Regulation
 Certain products manufactured by us are integrated into systems by our customers that are subject to regulation by the United States Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”). We must comply with certain quality control measurements in order for our products to be effectively used in our customers’ end products. Non-compliance with quality control measurements could result in fines, penalties, and loss of business with our customers. 
 We are also subject to certain medical device regulations. Medical devices are subject to extensive and rigorous regulation by the FDA and by other federal, state and local authorities. The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the “FDCA”) and related regulations govern the conditions of safety, efficacy, clearance, approval, manufacturing, quality system requirements, labeling, packaging, distribution, storage, recordkeeping, reporting, marketing, advertising, and promotion of products.
 FDA Premarket Clearance and Approval Requirements 
 Unless an exemption applies, each medical device commercially distributed in the United States requires either FDA clearance of a 510(k) premarket notification or approval of a premarket approval application (“PMA”). Under the FDCA, medical devices are classified into one of three classes—Class I, Class II or Class III—depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of manufacturer and regulatory control needed to ensure its safety and effectiveness. Class I includes devices with the lowest risk to the patient and are those for which safety and effectiveness can be assured by adherence to the FDA’s General Controls for medical devices, which include compliance with the applicable portions of the Quality System Regulation (the “QSR”), facility registration and product listing, reporting of adverse medical events, and truthful and non-misleading labeling, advertising, and promotional materials. Class II devices are subject to the FDA’s General Controls and special controls as deemed necessary by the FDA to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device. These special controls can include performance standards, postmarket surveillance, patient registries and FDA guidance documents. While most Class I devices are exempt from the 510(k) premarket notification requirement, manufacturers of most Class II devices are required to submit to the FDA a premarket notification under Section 510(k) of the FDCA, requesting permission to commercially distribute the device. The FDA’s permission to commercially distribute a device subject to a 510(k) premarket notification is generally known as 510(k) clearance. Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risks, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or some implantable devices, or devices that have a new intended use, or use advanced technology that is not substantially equivalent to that of a legally marketed device are placed in Class III, requiring approval of a PMA. Some pre-amendment devices are unclassified, but are subject to the FDA’s premarket notification and clearance process in order to be commercially distributed. In many cases, our customers are responsible for compliance with the FDA’s requirements applicable to medical devices. However, we also currently market certain Class II medical device products independently that are subject to these requirements.

510(k) Marketing Clearance Pathway
 To obtain 510(k) clearance, we must submit to the FDA a premarket notification submission demonstrating that the proposed device is ‘‘substantially equivalent’’ to a predicate device already on the market. A predicate device is a legally marketed device that is not subject to premarket approval, i.e., a device that was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976 (pre-amendments device) and for which a PMA is not required, a device that has been reclassified from Class III to Class II or Class I, or a device that was found substantially equivalent through the 510(k) process. The FDA’s 510(k) clearance process usually takes from nine to twelve months, but may take significantly longer. The FDA may require additional information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence.
 If the FDA agrees that the device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device currently on the market, it will grant 510(k) clearance to commercially market the device. If the FDA determines that the device is “not substantially equivalent” to a previously cleared device, the device is automatically designated as a Class III device. The device sponsor must then fulfill more rigorous PMA requirements, or can request a risk-based classification determination for the device in accordance with the “de novo” process, which is a route to market for novel medical devices that are low to moderate risk and are not substantially equivalent to a predicate device.
 After a device receives 510(k) marketing clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change or modification in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) marketing clearance or, depending on the modification, a de novo classification or PMA approval. The FDA requires each manufacturer to determine whether the proposed change requires submission of a 510(k) or a PMA in the first instance, but the FDA can review any such decision and disagree with a manufacturer’s determination. Many minor modifications today are accomplished by a letter-to-file in which the manufacturer documents the change in an internal letter-to-file. The letter-to-file is in lieu of submitting a new 510(k) to obtain clearance for every change. The FDA can always review these letters-to-file in an inspection. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer’s determination, the FDA can require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or request the recall of the modified device until 510(k) marketing clearance or PMA approval is obtained. Also, in these circumstances, we may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties. 
 Post-market Regulation
 After a device is cleared or approved for marketing, numerous and pervasive regulatory requirements continue to apply. These include:
  
• | establishment registration and device listing with the FDA;
--+------------------------------------------------------------


• | QSR requirements, which require manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the design and manufacturing process;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | labeling and marketing regulations, which require that promotion is truthful, not misleading and fairly balanced, provides adequate directions for use and that all claims are substantiated, and also prohibit the promotion of products for unapproved or “off-label” uses and impose other restrictions on labeling;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA guidance on off-label dissemination of information and responding to unsolicited requests for information;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | clearance or approval of product modifications to 510(k)-cleared devices that could significantly affect safety or effectiveness or that would constitute a major change in intended use of one of the cleared devices;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | medical device reporting regulations, which require that a manufacturer report to the FDA if a device that it markets may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or has malfunctioned and the device or a similar device that it markets would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury, if the malfunction were to recur;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | correction, removal and recall reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA that may present a risk to health;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | complying with requirements governing Unique Device Identifiers (UDI) on devices and also requiring the submission of certain information about each device to the FDA’s Global Unique Device Identification Database (GUDID);
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the FDA’s recall authority, whereby the agency can order device manufacturers to recall from the market a product that is in violation of governing laws and regulations; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | post-market surveillance activities and regulations, which apply when deemed by the FDA to be necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data on the device.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We may be subject to similar foreign laws that may include applicable post-marketing requirements such as safety surveillance. Our manufacturing processes are required to comply with the applicable portions of the QSR, which cover the methods and the

facilities and controls for the design, manufacture, testing, production, processes, controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, distribution, installation and servicing of finished devices intended for human use. The QSR also requires, among other things, maintenance of a device master file, device history file, and a complaints file. As a manufacturer, we are subject to periodic scheduled or unscheduled inspections by the FDA. Our failure to maintain compliance with the QSR requirements could result in the shut-down of, or restrictions on, our manufacturing operations and the recall or seizure of our products, which would have a material adverse effect on our business. The discovery of previously unknown problems with any of our products, including unanticipated adverse events or adverse events of increasing severity or frequency, whether resulting from the use of the device within the scope of its clearance or off-label by a physician in the practice of medicine, could result in restrictions on the device, including the removal of the product from the market or voluntary or mandatory device recalls.
 The FDA has broad regulatory compliance and enforcement powers. If the FDA determines that we failed to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, it can take a variety of compliance or enforcement actions, which may result in any of the following sanctions:
  
• | warning letters, untitled letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | recalls, withdrawals, or administrative detention or seizure of our products;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | operating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusing or delaying requests for 510(k) marketing clearance or PMA approvals of new products or modified products;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | withdrawing 510(k) clearances or PMA approvals that have already been granted;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusal to grant export or import approvals for our products; or
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


• | criminal prosecution.

Other Healthcare Laws and Regulations
 In the United States and other jurisdictions where we operate our business, there are healthcare laws and regulations that constrain our business operations, including our sales, marketing and promotional activities, and that limit the kinds of arrangements we may have with customers, physicians, healthcare entities and others in a position to purchase or recommend our products or other products or services we may develop and commercialize. These laws include, without limitation: the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration to induce, or in return for, either the referral of an individual or the purchase or recommendation of an item or service for which payment may be made under any federal healthcare program; federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment to the federal government, including federal healthcare programs, that are false or fraudulent; the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and making false statements relating to healthcare matters; HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, or HITECH, and their implementing regulations, which imposes certain requirements on certain types of individuals and entities relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information; the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program to annually report to the federal government information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members; and state and foreign law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. Violations of these laws may result in substantial civil penalties, including treble damages, and criminal penalties, including imprisonment, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, and exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs. For further information regarding other healthcare laws and regulations that our operations are subject to, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Relating to our Business—Our business is indirectly subject to healthcare industry cost containment and healthcare reform measures that could result in reduced sales of our products.”
