Item 1.    Business Overview
 For many years we have developed and marketed high performance memory products, including “Very Fast” static random access memory, or SRAM, that are incorporated primarily in high-performance networking and telecommunications equipment, such as routers, switches, wide area network infrastructure equipment, wireless base stations and network access equipment. We sell these products to leading original equipment manufacturer, or OEM, customers including Nokia.  In addition, we serve the ongoing needs of the military, industrial, test and measurement equipment, automotive and medical markets for high-performance SRAMs. Based on the performance characteristics of our products and the breadth of our product portfolio, we consider ourselves to be a leading provider of Very Fast SRAMs. We utilize a fabless business model, which allows us both to focus our resources on research and development, product design and marketing, and to gain access to advanced process technologies with only modest capital investment and fixed costs.
 Beginning in November 2015 with the acquisition of an Israeli company, our principal strategic objective has been the development of in-place associative computing solutions for applications in evolving new markets such as “big data” (including machine learning and deep convolutional neural networks (“CNNs”)), natural language processing, computer vision, and cyber security. Our commercialization efforts for the initial associative processing unit (“APU”) are focused on applications using similarity search, such as visual search in ecommerce and molecular structure similarity search in drug discovery.    We were incorporated in California in 1995 under the name Giga Semiconductor, Inc. We changed our name to GSI Technology in December 2003 and reincorporated in Delaware in June 2004 under the name GSI Technology, Inc. Our principal executive offices are located at 1213 Elko Drive, Sunnyvale, California, 94089, and our telephone number is (408) 331-8800.
 Industry Background
 SRAM Market Overview
 Virtually all types of high-performance electronic systems incorporate some form of volatile memory. An SRAM is a memory device that retains data as long as power is supplied, without requiring any further user

intervention. In contrast, dynamic random access memory, or DRAM, is a memory device that requires user intervention in the form of refresh operations to retain data while power is supplied, due to the capacitive nature of its memory cell.  However, a DRAM memory cell is much smaller than an SRAM memory cell, so several times more DRAM bits than SRAM bits can be implemented in any given unit area of silicon.  The fundamentally different characteristics of SRAM and DRAM memory cells have resulted in the emergence of markedly different architectures for SRAM-based and DRAM-based memory products, and the two types of memory serve different applications. Classically, SRAM-based products have served high performance requirements while DRAM-based products have been used in cost-optimized applications.  Today, SRAM- and DRAM-based products serve both performance and cost-based applications.  As the volatile memory market fragments into a variety of specialized products, more meaningful distinctions between volatile memory products can be made.
 There is an increasingly broad variety of volatile memory products on the market, characterized by a number of attributes, such as speed, memory capacity, or density, I/O interface and power consumption. There are several different industry measures of speed:
 latency, which is the delay between the request for data and the delivery of such data for use and is measured in nanoseconds, or ns, or when used to describe performance of synchronous memory products may be described in terms of numbers of clock cycles required between the load of an address and the delivery of valid data;
 random access time, which is the minimum amount of time required between accesses to random locations within the memory array, typically measured in nanoseconds, or ns;
 bandwidth, which is the rate at which data can be streamed to or from a device and is often measured in megabits or gigabits per second (Mb/s or Gb/s); 
 clock frequency, which is the cycle rate of a clock within a synchronous device and is often measured in megahertz or gigahertz (MHz or GHz); and
 transaction rate, which is the rate at which new commands can be executed by the memory device, and is often measured in millions or billions of transactions per second (MT/s or BT/s).
     Historically, SRAMs have been utilized wherever other lower price-per-bit memory technologies have been inadequate. SRAMs demonstrate lower latency and faster random access times relative to DRAMs and other types of memory technologies, but at a higher price-per-bit. Historically, the volatile memory market has had three price-performance points, DRAM at the low end, Fast SRAM at the high end, and slow SRAM in the middle.  Gartner Dataquest divides the SRAM market into segments based on speed. The highest performance segment is comprised of SRAMs that operate at speeds of less than 10 nanoseconds, which we refer to as “Very Fast SRAMs.” Very Fast SRAMs are predominantly utilized in high-performance networking and telecommunications equipment.  Over the past two decades, alternative memory technologies have been introduced to address certain applications that formerly used slow SRAMs. For example, new types of DRAM have displaced slow SRAM in applications such as cell phones.  However, in the networking memory market a technology vacuum formed between Fast SRAMs on one end and commodity DRAMs at the other, with no high bandwidth, high transaction rate, moderate capacity, moderate latency, and moderate cost volatile memory product to fill the void. In the past decade, low latency DRAMs, or LLDRAMs, have been developed to fill that void. Like the slow SRAMs that came before them, LLDRAMs have a much higher price-per-bit than commodity DRAMs (in order to deliver higher transaction rates) but demonstrate slower random access times and longer latencies than Fast SRAMs. 
 The need for increasingly greater capacity, data bandwidth and transaction rates from the various memory technologies continues unabated as the networking market begins to make preparations for Terabit networking in the latter half of the current decade.  We believe that Fast SRAM and LLDRAM, optimized for networking applications, will continue to play an essential role in enabling continued improvements in network performance.
 We believe the key success factors for a networking memory vendor are the ability to offer a broad catalog of high-performance, high-quality and high-reliability networking memory products, to maintain timely availability of

prior generations of products for several years after their introductions, and to provide effective logistic and technical support throughout their OEM customers’ product development and manufacturing life cycles.
 Memory Requirements for “Big Data” Applications
 With the vast amount of data currently being generated and the demand for faster processing of that data, processor speeds are continuing to increase.  However, existing systems that move data back and forth between the processor and memory are inadequate to address the fast response times required by “big data” applications (including machine learning, CNNs and natural language processing).  Faster response times are also needed to meet the demands of developers in such markets as cyber security and computer vision.  For example, in the automotive market, advanced driver assistance systems require a tremendous amount of image processing to be accomplished in real time. 
 Our commercialization efforts for the APU product are initially focused on similarity search applications.  Similarity search uses a technique called distance metric learning, in which learning algorithms measure how similar or related objects are.  Our APU is well suited for similarity search because its design enables very fast computation speeds with high degrees of accuracy and scalability for very large datasets.  The use of visual search, a subset of similarity search, is forecasted to grow rapidly as AI is adopted by the online retail industry. In software simulations, the APU has demonstrated the ability to increase the rate of computation by orders of magnitude with greater accuracy and reduced power consumption.  This kind of performance has the potential to transform online retailers’ capabilities and improve customers online shopping experience.
 The APU’s higher speeds and increased accuracy in similarity search can potentially lower drug discovery costs, an important goal for research organizations dependent on funding. The APU is well suited in drug discovery due to its ability to perform similarity search using very descriptive molecular representations in a virtual environment rather than in a lab setting.  This can significantly reduce the cost of developing drugs by virtually screening them. Use of AI products like the APU could reduce costs, increase drug efficacy and safety, and increase speed to market thereby potentially saving billions of dollars. As a result, the APU is getting the attention of pharmaceutical and genomics players.    The GSI Solution
 Continue Leadership in the High Performance Memory Market
 We endeavor to address the overall needs of our OEM customers, not only satisfying their immediate requirements for our latest generation, highest performance networking memory, but also providing them with the ongoing long-term support necessary during the entire lives of the systems in which our products are utilized. Accordingly, the key elements of our solution include:
 Product Performance Leadership.  Through the use of advanced architectures and design methodologies, we have developed high-performance SRAM and LLDRAM products offering superior high speed performance capabilities and low power consumption, while our advanced silicon process technologies allow us to optimize yields, lower manufacturing costs and improve quality.
     Product Innovation.  We believe that we have established a position as a technology leader in the design and development of Very Fast SRAMs.  We are believed to have the industry’s highest density RadHard SRAM, the SigmaQuad‑II+, which is an example of our industry-leading product innovation.
     Broad and Readily Available Product Portfolio.  We have what we believe is the broadest catalog of Very Fast SRAM products.
     Master Die Methodology.  Our master die methodology enables multiple product families, and variations thereof, to be manufactured from a single mask set so that we are able to maintain a 

 
  5
 
common pool of wafers that incorporate all available master die, allowing rapid fulfillment of customer orders and reducing costs.
     Customer Responsiveness.  We work closely with leading networking and telecommunications OEMs, as well as their chip-set suppliers, to anticipate their requirements and to rapidly develop and implement solutions that allow them to meet their specific product performance objectives.  
 Development of In-Place Associative Computing Products
 Our in-place associative computing technology addresses the bottleneck caused by the inability of memory bus speeds to keep up with increasing processor speeds by changing the concept of computing from serial data processing – where data is moved back and forth from the processor to the memory – to parallel processing computation and search functions being conducted directly in the main processing array.  This computing model has the potential to greatly expedite computation and response times in “big data” applications.  We believe that our state-of-the-art circuit design expertise will enable the development of high quality associative processors using our patented, in-place associative computing technology and algorithms to create a new category of computing products with substantial target markets and a large new customer base in those markets. We anticipate the release of our initial APU product to be released in the second half of calendar 2019. Our associative computing products will improve system performance, reducing query response times from hours to seconds and at the same time significantly reducing power consumption and reducing system cost. The GSI Strategy
 Our objective is to profitably increase our market share in the markets that we serve, while developing transformative new products utilizing our cutting-edge in-place associative computing technology.  Our strategy includes the following key elements:
 Continue to Focus on the Networking and Telecommunications Markets.  We intend to continue to focus on designing and developing high transaction rate, low latency, high bandwidth and feature-rich memory products targeted primarily at the networking and telecommunications markets.
 
 Complete the Introduction of Our Initial In-place Associative Computing Product.  Our principal strategic objective is the completion of our initial in-place associative computing product.  Realization of this goal will require additional development and marketing efforts in calendar 2019, with initial product introduction and customer evaluation expected in the second half of calendar 2019.
     Exploit Opportunities to Expand the Market for Our Memory Products.  While we develop our high-performance memory products principally for the networking and telecommunications markets, they are often applicable across a wide range of industries and applications. We have experienced growth in product sales for military, industrial, test and measurement, and medical markets and intend to continue penetrating these and other new markets with similar needs for high-performance memory technologies.
     Strengthen and Expand Customer Relationships.  We are focused on maintaining close relationships with industry leaders to facilitate rapid adoption of our products and to enhance our position as a leading provider of high-performance memory.  We work with both our customers and with their non-memory IC suppliers that require high-performance memory support in order to anticipate their future high-performance memory needs and to identify and respond to their immediate requests for currently available products and variants on currently available products.
     Continue to Invest in Research and Development to Extend Our Technology Leadership.  We believe we have established a position as a technology leader in the design and development of Very Fast SRAMs. Our Very Fast SRAM products most often provide the highest speed available at a given density for a given device configuration. We intend to maintain and advance our technology leadership through continual enhancement of our existing Very Fast SRAM products, particularly our 

 
  6
 
SigmaQuad/SigmaDDR family of low latency, high-bandwidth synchronous SRAMs, while we continue to broaden our product line with the introduction of other new high performance memory technologies targeted to address the evolving needs of the high performance memory market.
     Collaborate with Wafer Foundries to Leverage Leading-edge Process Technologies.  We will continue to rely upon advanced complementary metal oxide semiconductor, or CMOS, technologies, the most commonly used process technologies for manufacturing semiconductor devices, from TSMC for SRAM-based products and from Powerchip for DRAM-based products.
     Seek New Market Opportunities.  We intend to supplement our internal development activities by seeking additional opportunities to acquire other businesses, product lines or technologies, or enter into strategic partnerships, that would complement our current product lines, expand the breadth of our markets, enhance our technical capabilities, or otherwise provide growth opportunities.
 Products
 We design, develop and market a broad range of high-performance memory products primarily for the networking and telecommunications markets. We specialize in high performance memory products featuring very high transaction rates, high density, low latency, high bandwidth, fast clock access times and low power consumption. We commit to offering our products for longer periods of time than our competitors, typically seven years or more following their initial introduction. Accordingly, we continue to offer products in a variety of package types that have been discontinued by other suppliers.
 We currently offer more than 30 families of SRAMs and one family of LLDRAMs. These basic product configurations are the basis for over 16,000 individual products that incorporate a variety of performance specifications and optional features. Our products can be found in a wide range of networking and telecommunications equipment, including core routers, multi-service access routers, universal gateways, enterprise edge routers, service provider edge routers, optical edge routers, fast Ethernet switches and wireless base stations. We also sell our products to OEMs that manufacture products for military and aerospace applications such as radar and guidance systems and satellites, for professional audio applications such as sound mixing systems, for test and measurement applications such as high-speed testers, for automotive applications such as smart cruise control, and for medical applications such as ultrasound and CAT scan equipment.
 We have spent more than three years developing and marketing in-place associative computing solutions, leveraging both the patented technology obtained in our acquisition of MikaMonu Group Ltd. (“MikaMonu”) in November 2015 and our 20-plus years of high-performance SRAM development experience.  Our new associative computing solutions, including the APU, will address evolving new markets, such as “big data” (including machine learning and CNNs), natural language processing, computer vision and cyber security with our initial focus in this area being for similarity search applications.
 Synchronous SRAM Products
 Synchronous SRAMs are controlled by timing signals, referred to as clocks, which make them easier to use than older style asynchronous SRAMs with similar latency characteristics in applications requiring high bandwidth data transfers. Synchronous SRAMs that employ double data rate interface protocols can transfer data at much higher bandwidth than both single data rate and asynchronous SRAMs.  We currently supply synchronous SRAMs that can cycle at operating frequencies as high as 1,333 MHz.
 BurstRAM™ and NBT™ SRAMs.    We currently offer BurstRAMs and No Bus Turnaround, or NBT, SRAMs that implement a single data rate bus protocol. BurstRAMs were originally developed for microprocessor cache applications and have become the most widely used synchronous SRAMs on the market. They are used in applications where large amounts of data are read or written in single sessions, or bursts. NBT SRAMs are a variation on the BurstRAM theme and were developed to address the needs of moderate performance networking 

 
  7
 
applications. NBT SRAMs feature a single data rate bus protocol designed to minimize or eliminate wasted data transfer time slots on the bus when BurstRAMs switch from read to write operations. Both families of products can perform burst data transfers or single cycle transfers at the discretion of the user.
 Our BurstRAMs and NBT SRAMs are offered in both pipeline and flow-through modes. Flow-through SRAMs allow the shortest latency. Pipelined SRAMs break the access into discrete clock-controlled steps, allowing new access commands to be accepted while an access is already in progress. Therefore, while flow-through SRAMs offer lower latency, pipelined SRAMs offer greater data bandwidth. Our BurstRAM and NBT SRAM products incorporate a number of features that reduce our OEM customers’ cost of ownership and increase their design flexibility, including a JTAG test port and our FLXDrive feature, which allows system designers to optimize signal integrity for a given application.
 We currently offer BurstRAMs and NBT SRAMs with storage densities of up to 288 megabits with clock frequency of up to 400 MHz and clock access times as fast as 2 nanoseconds that operate at 3.3, 2.5 or 1.8 volts.
 SigmaQuad and SigmaDDR Products.    High-performance double data rate and quad data rate synchronous SRAMs have become the de facto standard for the networking and telecommunications industry. We offer a full line of quad data rate separate I/O SRAMs, known as our SigmaQuad family, as well as a companion line of double data rate common I/O SRAMs, known as our SigmaDDR family.  SigmaQuad SRAMs feature two uni-directional (one input and one output) double data rate data ports (two data ports times double data rate transfers equals quad data rate), controlled via a single address and control port. SigmaDDR SRAMs feature a single bi-directional double data rate data port. We currently offer our SigmaQuad and SigmaDDR devices in multiple bus protocol versions and data burst lengths, and with various power supply and interface voltages, all under the names SigmaQuad, SigmaQuad-II,  SigmaQuad-IIIe and SigmaQuad-IVe, and their SigmaDDR equivalents. An additional variant in this family of SRAMs is the SigmaSIO DDR, which is designed to address some segments of the market currently served by dual-port SRAMs.
 We currently offer SigmaQuad/SigmaDDR products in five storage densities, 18 megabits, 36 megabits, 72 megabits, 144 megabits and 288 megabits. These SRAMs are capable of speeds up to 1,333 MHz and operate on main power supply voltages that range from 2.5 volts to 1.2 volts and interface voltages that range from 1.8 volts to 1.2 volts.    RadHard and RadTolerant SRAM Products.  We have committed to introduce and market radiation-hardened, or “RadHard”, and radiation-tolerant, or “RadTolerant”, SRAMs for aerospace and military applications such as networking satellites and missiles.  Our initial RadHard and RadTolerant products are 288 megabit devices from our SigmaQuad-II family.  The RadHard products are housed in a hermetically-sealed ceramic column grid array package, and undergo a special fabrication process that diminishes the adverse effects of high-radiation environments.
 Low Latency DRAM Products
 Our low latency DRAM family fills an under-served market segment between commodity DRAMs and Fast SRAMs. Offering moderate density, moderate speed and moderate cost, LLDRAM technology gives system designers a middle choice when commodity DRAM performance is insufficient but Fast SRAM performance is unnecessary. LLDRAMs offer one-third the latency of commodity DRAMs and four times the density of Fast SRAMs, giving networking equipment designers another tool for solving difficult data management problems.
 Our current LLDRAM portfolio includes both 288 megabit and 576 megabit devices that are capable of speeds of up to 533 MHz, and that operate on a 1.8 volt power supply and support both 1.8 volt and 1.5 volt interfaces. They are available in five distinct configurations including common I/O and separate I/O types and data bus widths of x36, x18 and x9. These devices serve as an alternate source for users of a popular, functionally equivalent device from a competing vendor.

 Customers
 Historically, our primary sales and marketing strategy has been to achieve design wins with leading OEMs in the networking and telecommunications markets and the other markets we serve.  With the development of our new in-place associative computing products, we are focusing sales and marketing efforts in the markets for “big data” (including CNNs), natural language processing, computer vision and cyber security with our initial focus in this area being for similarity search applications.
 The following is a representative list of our OEM customers that directly or indirectly purchased more than $500,000 of our products in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019:

BAE Systems | Ciena | Cisco Systems
General Dynamics | Honeywell | Lockheed 
Nokia | Raytheon | Rockwell 

      Many of our OEM customers use contract manufacturers to assemble their equipment. Accordingly, a significant percentage of our net revenues is derived from sales to these contract manufacturers and to consignment warehouses who purchase products from us for use by contract manufacturers. In addition, we sell our products to OEM customers indirectly through domestic and international distributors.
 In the case of sales of our products to distributors and consignment warehouses, the decision to purchase our products is typically made by the OEM customers. In the case of contract manufacturers, OEM customers typically provide a list of approved products to the contract manufacturer, which then has discretion whether or not to purchase our products from that list.
 Direct sales to contract manufacturers and consignment warehouses accounted for 41.3%, 34.9% and 39.0% of our net revenues for fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Sales to foreign and domestic distributors accounted for 56.0%, 62.5% and 57.5% of our net revenues for fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
 The following direct customers accounted for 10% or more of our net revenues in one or more of the following periods:

 | Fiscal Year Ended | 
 | March 31, | 
 | 2019 | | 2018 | | 2017 | 
Contract manufacturers and consignment warehouses: | | | | | | 
Flextronics Technology | 21.8 | % | 14.0 | % | 10.4 | %
Sanmina | 17.7 | | 16.0 | | 20.4 | 
Distributors: | | | | | | 
Avnet Logistics | 31.3 | | 35.3 | | 25.5 | 
Nexcomm | 14.8 | | 16.1 | | 19.7 | 

      Nokia was our largest customer in fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017.  Nokia purchases products directly from us and through contract manufacturers and distributors.  Based on information provided to us by its contract manufacturers and our distributors, purchases by Nokia represented approximately 45%, 36% and 41% of our net revenues in fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. To our knowledge, none of our other OEM customers accounted for more than 10% of our net revenues in any of these periods.

 Sales, Marketing and Technical Support
 We sell our products primarily through our worldwide network of independent sales representatives and distributors. As of March 31, 2019, we employed 17 sales and marketing personnel, and were supported by over 200 independent sales representatives, which we believe will enable us to address an expanded customer base with the expected introduction of our associative computing products in fiscal 2020. We believe that our relationship with our U.S. distributor, Avnet, puts us in a strong position to address the Very Fast SRAM and LLDRAM memory markets in the United States. We currently have regional sales offices located in Canada, China, Hong Kong, Israel and the United States. We believe this international coverage allows us to better serve our distributors and OEM customers by providing them with coordinated support. We believe that our customers’ purchasing decisions are based primarily on product performance, availability, features, quality, reliability, price, manufacturing flexibility and service. Many of our OEM customers have had long-term relationships with us based on our success in meeting these criteria.
 Our sales are generally made pursuant to purchase orders received between one and six months prior to the scheduled delivery date. Because industry practice allows customers to reschedule or cancel orders on relatively short notice, these orders are not firm and hence we believe that backlog is not a good indicator of our future sales. We typically provide a warranty of up to 36 months on our products. Liability for a stated warranty period is usually limited to replacement of defective products.
 Our marketing efforts are, first and foremost, focused on ensuring that the products we develop meet or exceed our customers’ needs. Historically, those efforts have been focused on defining our high-performance SRAM and LLDRAM product roadmaps by working closely with key customers to understand their roadmaps and to ensure that the products we develop meet their requirements (primary aspects of which include functionality, performance, electrical interfaces, power, and schedule).  More recently, our marketing efforts have been expanded to include marketing the new in-place associative computing products that we are developing.  Our marketing group also provides technical, strategic and tactical sales support to our direct sales personnel, sales representatives and distributors. This support includes in-depth product presentations, datasheets, application notes, simulation models, sales tools, marketing communications, marketing research, trademark administration and other support functions.  We also engage in various marketing activities to increase brand awareness.
  We emphasize customer service and technical support in an effort to provide our OEM customers with the knowledge and resources necessary to successfully use our products in their designs. Our customer service organization includes a technical team of applications engineers, technical marketing personnel and, when required, product design engineers. We provide customer support throughout the qualification and sales process and continue providing follow-up service after the sale of our products and on an ongoing basis. In addition, we provide our OEM customers with comprehensive datasheets, application notes and reference designs and access to our FPGA controller IP for use in their product development.
 Manufacturing
 We outsource our wafer fabrication, assembly and wafer sort testing, which enables us to focus on our design strengths, minimize fixed costs and capital expenditures and gain access to advanced manufacturing technologies. Our engineers work closely with our outsource partners to increase yields, reduce manufacturing costs, and help assure the quality of our products.
 Currently, all of our wafers are manufactured by TSMC and Powerchip under individually negotiated purchase orders. We do not currently have a long-term supply contract with either of these foundries, and, therefore, neither of them is obligated to manufacture products for us for any specified period, in any specified quantity or at any specified price, except as may be provided in a particular purchase order. Our future success depends in part on our ability to secure sufficient capacity at TSMC, Powerchip or other independent foundries to supply us with the wafers we require.

 
  10
 

 The majority of our current SRAM products are manufactured using 0.13 micron, 90 nanometer, 65 nanometer and 40 nanometer process technologies on 300 millimeter wafers at TSMC. Our LLDRAM production at Powerchip uses 72 nanometer and 63 nanometer process technologies. Our new in-place associative computing products will be manufactured at TSMC initially using 28 nanometer process technology.
 Our master die methodology enables multiple product families, and variations thereof, to be manufactured from a single mask set. As a result, based upon the way available die from a wafer are metalized, wire bonded, packaged and tested, we can create a number of different products. The manufacturing process consists of two phases, the first of which takes approximately eight to twelve weeks and results in wafers that have the potential to yield multiple products within a given product family. After the completion of this phase, the wafers are stored pending customer orders. Once we receive orders for a particular product, we perform the second phase, consisting of final wafer processing, assembly, burn-in and test, which takes approximately four to eight weeks to complete. This two-step manufacturing process enables us to significantly shorten our product lead times, providing flexibility for customization and to increase the availability of our products.
 All of our manufactured wafers, including wafers for our APU product, are tested for electrical compliance and most are packaged at Advanced Semiconductor Engineering, or ASE, which is located in Taiwan. Our test procedures require that all of our products be subjected to accelerated burn-in and extensive functional electrical testing which is performed at our Taiwan and U.S. test facilities. Our radiation-hardened products are assembled and tested at STS, located near our Sunnyvale, California headquarters facility.
 Research and Development
 We have devoted substantial resources in the last three years on the development of a new category of in-place associative computing products. Our research and development staff includes engineering professionals with extensive experience in the areas of high-speed circuit design, including SRAM design, DRAM design and systems level networking and telecommunications equipment design, and well suited for the development of our associative computing products. The design process for our products is complex. As a result, we have made substantial investments in computer-aided design and engineering resources to manage our design process. Competition
 Our existing and potential competitors include many large domestic and international companies, some of which have substantially greater resources, offer other types of memory and/or non-memory technologies and may have longer standing relationships with OEM customers than we do. Unlike us, some of our principal competitors maintain their own semiconductor fabs, which may, at times, provide them with capacity, cost and technical advantages.
 Our principal competitors include Cypress Semiconductor, Integrated Silicon Solution, Micron and REC for our SRAM and LLDRAM products.  NVIDIA Corporation and Intel Corporation are prospective competitors for the in-place associative computing products that we are currently developing.  Other competitors are expected to enter this field as well. While some of our competitors offer a broader array of products and offer some of their products at lower prices than we do, we believe that our focus on performance leadership provides us with key competitive advantages.
 We believe that our ability to compete successfully in the rapidly evolving markets for “big data” and memory products for the networking and telecommunications markets depends on a number of factors, including:
 product performance, features, quality, reliability and price; 
 manufacturing flexibility, product availability and customer service throughout the lifetime of the product; 

 
  11
 

 the timing and success of new product introductions by us, our customers and our competitors; and 
 our ability to anticipate and conform to new industry standards.
 We believe we compete favorably with our competitors based on these factors. However, we may not be able to compete successfully in the future with respect to any of these factors. Our failure to compete successfully in these or other areas could harm our business.
 The market for networking memory products is competitive and is characterized by technological change, declining average selling prices and product obsolescence. Competition could increase in the future from existing competitors and from other companies that may enter our existing or future markets with solutions that may be less costly or provide higher performance or more desirable features than our products. This increased competition may result in price reductions, reduced profit margins and loss of market share.
 In addition, we are vulnerable to advances in technology by competitors, including new SRAM architectures as well as new forms of DRAM and other new memory technologies. Because we have limited experience developing IC products other than Very Fast SRAMs and LLDRAMs, any efforts by us to introduce new products based on new technology, including the in-place associative computing products currently under development, may not be successful and, as a result, our business may suffer.
 Intellectual Property
 Our ability to compete successfully depends, in part, upon our ability to protect our proprietary technology and information. We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secret laws, non-disclosure and other contractual arrangements and technical measures to protect our intellectual property. We believe that it is important to maintain a large patent portfolio to protect our innovations. We currently hold 75 United States patents, including 56 memory patents and 19 associative computing patents, and have in excess of a dozen patent applications pending. We cannot assure you that any patents will be issued as a result of our pending applications. We believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel and the success of our ongoing product development efforts are also important in maintaining our competitive position. We generally enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees, distributors, customers and potential customers and limit access to our proprietary information. Our intellectual property rights, if challenged, may not be upheld as valid, may not be adequate to prevent misappropriation of our technology or may not prevent the development of competitive products. Additionally, we may not be able to obtain patents or other intellectual property protection in the future. Furthermore, the laws of certain foreign countries in which our products are or may be developed, manufactured or sold, including various countries in Asia, may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States and thus make the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely in these countries.
 The semiconductor industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights, which have resulted in significant and often protracted and expensive litigation. We or our foundry from time to time are notified of claims that we may be infringing patents or other intellectual property rights owned by third parties. We have been involved in patent infringement litigation in the past.  We have been subject to other intellectual property claims in the past and we may be subject to additional claims and litigation in the future. Litigation by or against us relating to allegations of patent infringement or other intellectual property matters could result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel, whether or not such litigation results in a determination favorable to us. In the event of an adverse result in any such litigation, we could be required to pay substantial damages, cease the manufacture, use and sale of infringing products, expend significant resources to develop non-infringing technology, discontinue the use of certain processes or obtain licenses to the infringing technology. Licenses may not be offered or the terms of any offered licenses may not be acceptable to us. If we fail to obtain a license from a third party for technology used by us, we could incur 

 
  12
