ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Our Business
Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. (“we,” “us,” “our,” or the “Company”) is the largest producer and marketer of shell eggs in the United States. In fiscal 2019, we sold approximately 1,038.9 million dozen shell eggs, which we believe represented approximately 19% of domestic shell egg consumption. Our total flock of approximately 36.2 million layers and 9.4 million pullets and breeders is the largest in the U.S.  Layers are mature female chickens, pullets are female chickens usually under 18 weeks of age, and breeders are male and female chickens used to produce fertile eggs to be hatched for egg production flocks.
The Company has one operating segment, which is the production, grading, packaging, marketing and distribution of shell eggs.  The majority of our customers rely on us to provide most of their shell egg needs, including specialty and non-specialty eggs. Specialty eggs represent a broad range of products.  We classify nutritionally enhanced, cage free, organic and brown eggs as specialty products for accounting and reporting purposes. We classify all other shell eggs as non-specialty products.  While we report separate sales information for these egg types, there are many cost factors which are not specifically available for non-specialty or specialty eggs due to the nature of egg production. We manage our operations and allocate resources to these types of eggs on a consolidated basis based on the demands of our customers.
We sell most of our shell eggs in the southwestern, southeastern, mid-western and mid-Atlantic regions of the U.S. through our extensive distribution network to a diverse group of customers, including national and regional grocery store chains, club stores, foodservice distributors and egg product consumers. Some of our sales are completed through co-pack agreements – a common practice in the industry whereby production and processing of certain products is outsourced to another producer.  The strength of our position is evidenced by having the largest market share in the grocery segment for shell eggs.  We sell shell eggs to a majority of large U.S. food retailers.
We are one of the largest producers and marketers in the U.S. of value-added specialty shell eggs, which have been a significant and growing segment of the market in recent years.  A significant number of our food service customers, large restaurant chains, and major retailers, including our largest customers, have committed to exclusive offerings of cage-free eggs by specified future dates. We are working with our customers to ensure a smooth transition in meeting their goals. Our focus for future expansion at our farms will be environments that are cage-free or with equipment that can easily be converted to cage-free, based on a timeline to meet our customer’s needs.
In fiscal 2019, specialty shell eggs and co-pack specialty shell eggs represented 36.2% and 2.0% of our shell egg sales dollars, respectively, and accounted for approximately 23.8% and 1.3%, respectively, of our total shell egg volumes. In fiscal 2018, specialty shell eggs and co-pack specialty shell eggs represented 32.0% and 1.8% of our shell egg sales dollars, respectively, and accounted for approximately 23.5% and 1.3%, respectively, of our total shell egg volumes.  Prices for specialty eggs are less volatile than non-specialty shell egg prices and are generally higher due to consumer willingness to pay for the perceived increased benefits from those products. We market our specialty shell eggs under the following brands: Egg-Land’s Best®, Land O’ Lakes®, Farmhouse®, and 4-Grain®.  We are a member of the Egg-Land’s Best, Inc. (“EB”) cooperative and produce, market and distribute Egg-Land’s Best® and Land O’ Lakes®  branded eggs, along with our associated joint ventures, under exclusive license agreements for a number of states in the southeast, south central, and southwest U.S. as well as the New York City area. We market cage-free eggs under our trademarked Farmhouse® brand and distribute them across the southeast and southwest regions of the U.S.  We market organic, cage-free, vegetarian, and omega-3 eggs under our 4-Grain® brand. We also produce, market, and distribute private label specialty shell eggs to several customers.
We are a leader in industry consolidation. Since 1989, we have completed 21 acquisitions ranging in size from 160,000 layers to 7.5 million layers.  Despite a market characterized by increasing consolidation, the shell egg production industry remains highly fragmented. According to Egg Industry magazine, at December 31, 2018, 60 producers, owning at least one million layers, owned approximately 98% of total industry layers. The ten largest producers owned approximately 53% of total industry layers. We believe industry consolidation will continue and we plan to capitalize on opportunities as they arise.
Industry Background 

Based on historical consumption trends, we believe general demand for eggs increases in line with overall population growth, averaging about 2% per year. In 2013 and 2014, consumption of eggs grew approximately 2% per year.  In 2015, egg consumption decreased approximately 4% over the prior year primarily due to a shortage of eggs resulting from an outbreak of avian influenza ("AI") in the spring of that year. In 2016, consumption rebounded increasing 7% over 2015 and 3% over the pre-shortage level of 2014. According to U.S. Department of Agriculture (“USDA”), annual per capita U.S. consumption since 2000 varied between 249 and 284 eggs. In calendar year 2018, per capita U.S. consumption was estimated to be 284 eggs, or approximately five eggs per person per week. Per capita consumption is determined by dividing the total supply of eggs by the entire population in the U.S. (i.e. all eggs supplied domestically by the egg industry are consumed).  
Approximately 69% of eggs produced in the U.S. are sold as shell eggs. Shell egg sales are mostly to food service and retail consumers (e.g. through grocery and convenience stores) with a relatively small amount exported. The remaining 31% of eggs produced in the U.S. are sold as egg products (shell eggs broken and sold in liquid, frozen, or dried form) to institutions (e.g. companies producing baked goods). In both fiscal 2019 and 2018, approximately 3% of our net sales was egg products. 
Prices for Shell Eggs
Shell egg prices are a critical component of profitability for the Company and the industry as a whole. While there are many pricing mechanisms, we believe the majority of shell eggs sold in the U.S. in the retail and foodservice channels are sold at independently quoted wholesale market prices for shell eggs. We sell the majority of our non-specialty shell eggs at independently quoted wholesale market prices for shell eggs or formulas related to our costs of production which include the cost of corn and soybean meal.  For fiscal 2019, wholesale large shell egg prices in the southeast region, as quoted by Urner Barry, averaged $1.23 compared with $1.49 for fiscal 2018 and $0.85 for fiscal 2017, evidencing their volatility. For additional information regarding shell egg prices, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Item 7 of Part II of this report.
Feed Costs for Shell Egg Production
Feed is a primary cost component in the production of shell eggs and represents over half of industry farm level production costs. Most shell egg producers, including us, are vertically integrated, manufacturing the majority of the feed required for their operations. Although feed ingredients, primarily corn and soybean meal, are available from a number of sources, prices for ingredients can fluctuate and are affected by weather, speculators, and various supply and demand factors. Our feed cost per dozen eggs produced for fiscal 2019 was 5.3% higher than fiscal 2018 primarily due to unfavorable crop conditions in the south-central U.S. which resulted in higher ingredient prices at some of our larger feed mill operations. Looking forward to 2020, grain prices are trending higher as historic rainfall and flooding through the early growing season are adversely affecting this year’s U.S. corn and soybean crops.  However, ongoing uncertainties and geopolitical issues surrounding trade agreements and international tariffs have led to reduced exports and downward pressure on recent grain prices.  As such, we expect our feed costs to be more volatile and potentially higher in fiscal 2020.
Growth Strategy and Acquisitions
For many years, we have pursued a growth strategy focused on the acquisition of existing shell egg production and processing facilities, as well as the construction of new and more efficient facilities.  Since the beginning of fiscal 1989, we have completed 21 acquisitions. In addition, we have built numerous “in-line” shell egg production and processing facilities as well as pullet growing facilities which added to our capacity.  This growth has allowed us to more effectively retire older and less efficient facilities without losing production capacity.  The “in-line” facilities provide gathering, grading and packaging of shell eggs by less labor-intensive, more efficient, mechanical means. We continue to upgrade and modify our facilities, and invest in new facilities, to meet changing demand as many food service customers, restaurant chains, and retailers have committed to exclusive offerings of cage-free eggs over the next several years.
The construction of new, more efficient production and processing facilities is also an integral part of our growth strategy.  Such construction requires compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations, including the receipt of permits that could cause schedule delays, although we have not experienced any significant delays in the past.
Our total flock, including pullets, layers and breeders increased from approximately 40.8 million at the end of fiscal 2014 to approximately 45.6 million as of June 1, 2019.  The dozens of shell eggs sold increased from approximately 1,013.7 million in fiscal 2014 to approximately 1,038.9 million for fiscal 2019.  

We continue to pursue opportunities to acquire companies engaged in the production and sale of shell eggs.  We will continue to evaluate and selectively pursue acquisitions that will expand our shell egg production capabilities in existing markets and broaden our geographic reach. We have extensive experience identifying, valuing, executing, and integrating acquisitions and we intend to leverage that experience in the evaluation and execution of future acquisitions. We will seek to acquire regional shell egg businesses with significant market share and long-standing customer relationships. We believe enhancing our national presence will help us further strengthen our relationships with existing customers, many of whom have operations across the U.S.
Federal antitrust laws require regulatory approval of acquisitions that exceed certain threshold levels of significance, and we are subject to federal and state laws prohibiting anti-competitive conduct.   We believe our sales of shell eggs during the last fiscal year represented approximately 19% of domestic shell egg sales, making us the largest producer and distributor of shell eggs in the U.S. However, because the shell egg production and distribution industry is so fragmented, we believe there are many acquisition opportunities available to us that would not be restricted pursuant to antitrust laws.

Through exclusive license agreements with EB in several key territories and our trademarked Farmhouse® and 4Grain® brands, we are a leading producer and marketer of value-added specialty shell eggs. We also produce, market, and distribute private label specialty shell eggs to several customers. Since selling prices of specialty shell eggs are generally less volatile than non-specialty shell egg prices, we believe growing our specialty eggs business will enhance the stability of our margins.  We expect the price of specialty eggs to remain at a premium to regular shell eggs, and intend to grow our specialty shell egg business.
Shell Eggs
Production.  Our operations are fully integrated. We hatch chicks, grow and maintain flocks of pullets, layers, and breeders, manufacture feed, and produce, process, package, and distribute shell eggs.  We produce approximately 84% of our total shell eggs sold, with 91% of such production coming from company-owned facilities, and the other 9% coming from contract producers.  Under a typical arrangement with a contract producer, we own the flock, furnish all feed and critical supplies, own the shell eggs produced and assume market risks. The contract producers own and operate their facilities and are paid a fee based on production with incentives for performance. We purchase approximately 16% of the total shell eggs we sell from outside producers.
The commercial production of shell eggs requires a source of baby chicks for laying flock replacement. We produce the majority of our chicks in our own hatcheries and obtain the balance from commercial sources. We own breeder and hatchery facilities capable of producing 21.2 million pullet chicks per year in a computer-controlled environment. These pullets are distributed to 43 laying operations around the southwestern, southeastern, mid-western and mid-Atlantic regions of the U.S. 
Our facilities produce an average of 2.4 million dozen shell eggs per day. The shell eggs are processed, graded and packaged predominantly without handling by human hands. We have spent a cumulative total of $312.7 million over the past five years to expand and upgrade our facilities with the most advanced equipment and technology available in our industry. We believe our constant attention to production efficiencies and focus on automation throughout the supply chain enables us to be a low cost supplier in all the markets in which we compete.
Feed cost represents the largest element of our farm egg production cost, ranging from 57% to 62% of total farm production cost in the last five fiscal years. Although feed ingredients are available from a number of sources, we have little, if any, control over the prices of the ingredients we purchase, which are affected by weather, speculators, and various supply and demand factors.  For example, the severe drought in the summer of 2012 and resulting damage to the national corn and soybean crop resulted in high and volatile feed costs.  Increases in feed costs unaccompanied by increases in the selling price of eggs can have a material adverse effect on our operations.  High feed costs can encourage shell egg producers to reduce production, resulting in higher egg prices.  Alternatively, low feed costs can encourage industry overproduction, possibly resulting in lower egg prices. 
After the eggs are produced, they are graded and packaged.  Substantially all of our farms have modern “in-line” facilities to mechanically gather, grade and package the eggs produced.  The increased use of in-line facilities has generated significant cost savings compared to the cost of eggs produced from non-in-line facilities.  In addition to greater efficiency, the in-line facilities produce a higher percentage of USDA Grade A eggs, which sell at higher prices.  Eggs produced on farms owned by contractors are brought to our processing plants to be graded and packaged. Since shell eggs are perishable, we maintain very low egg inventories, usually consisting of approximately four days of production.
Egg production activities are subject to risks inherent in the agriculture industry, such as weather conditions and disease.  These risks are outside our control and could have a material adverse effect on our operations.  The marketability of shell eggs is subject to risks such as possible changes in food consumption preferences and practices reflecting perceived health concerns.
We operate in a cyclical industry with total demand that is generally steady and a product that is generally price-inelastic.  Thus, small increases in production or decreases in demand can have a large adverse effect on prices and vice-versa.  

Marketing.  Of the 1,038.9 million dozen shell eggs sold by us in fiscal 2019, our flocks produced 876.7 million.
We sell our shell eggs to a diverse group of customers, including national and local grocery store chains, club stores, foodservice distributors, and egg product consumers. We utilize electronic ordering and invoicing systems that enable us to manage inventory for certain customers. Our top ten customers accounted for an aggregate of 69.8%, 69.4%, and 69.5% of net sales dollars for fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. Two customers, Wal-Mart Stores and Sam’s Club, on a combined basis, accounted for 33.7%, 33.2%, and 28.9% of net sales dollars during fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.
The majority of eggs sold are sold based on the daily or short-term needs of our customers.  Most sales to established accounts are on open account with payment terms ranging from seven to 30 days.  Although we have established long-term relationships with many of our customers, many of them are free to acquire shell eggs from other sources.
The shell eggs we sell are either delivered to our customers’ warehouse or retail stores, either by our own fleet or contracted refrigerated delivery trucks, or are picked up by our customers at our processing facilities.
We sell our shell eggs at prices generally related to independently quoted wholesale market prices or at formulas related to our costs of production. Wholesale prices are subject to wide fluctuations.  The prices of shell eggs reflect fluctuations in the quoted market and changes in corn and soybean meal prices, and the results of our shell egg operations are materially affected by changes in market quotations and feed costs.  Egg prices reflect a number of economic conditions, such as the supply of eggs and the demand level, which, in turn, are influenced by a number of factors we cannot control.  No representation can be made as to the future level of prices.
According to USDA reports, for the past five years, U.S. annual per capita egg consumption grew from 256 in 2015 to 284 in 2018. Looking ahead, we believe fast food restaurant consumption, high protein diet trends, industry advertising campaigns, and improved nutritional reputation of eggs related to better scientific understanding of the role of cholesterol in diets may result in increased per capita egg consumption levels; however, no assurance can be given that per capita consumption will not decline in the future.

We sell the majority of our shell eggs across the southwestern, southeastern, mid-western and mid-Atlantic regions of the U.S. We are a major factor in egg marketing in a majority of these states.  Many states in our market area are egg deficit regions where production of fresh shell eggs is less than total consumption.  Competition from other producers in specific market areas is generally based on price, service, and quality of product.  Strong competition exists in each of our markets.
Seasonality.  Retail sales of shell eggs are greatest during the fall and winter months and lowest during the summer months.  Prices for shell eggs fluctuate in response to seasonal demand factors and a natural increase in egg production during the spring and early summer. We generally experience lower sales and net income in our fourth and first fiscal quarters ending in May/June and August/September, respectively. During the past ten fiscal years, three of our first quarters resulted in net operating losses, and during this same period, three of our fourth quarters resulted in net operating losses.
Specialty Eggs. We produce specialty eggs such as Egg-Land’s Best®, Land O’ Lakes®, 4Grain®, and Farmhouse®
branded eggs.  Specialty eggs are intended to meet the demands of consumers who are sensitive to environmental, health and/or animal welfare issues.  Specialty shell eggs are becoming a more significant segment of the shell egg market.  During recent years an increasing number of large restaurant chains, food service companies and grocery chains, including our largest customers, announced goals to transition to a cage-free egg supply chain by specified future dates. For fiscal 2019, specialty eggs accounted for 36.2% of our shell egg dollar sales and 23.8% of our shell egg dozens sold, as compared to 32.0% of shell egg dollar sales and 23.5% of shell egg dozens sold in fiscal 2018.  Additionally, specialty eggs sold through our co-pack arrangements accounted for an additional 2.0% of shell egg dollar sales and 1.3% of shell egg dozens sold in fiscal 2019, compared with 1.8% of shell egg dollar sales and 1.3% of shell egg dozens sold in fiscal 2018.  We produce and process Egg-Land’s Best® and Land O’ Lakes® branded eggs under license from EB at our facilities under EB guidelines.  The product is marketed to our established base of customers at premium prices compared to non-specialty shell eggs. Egg-Land’s Best® branded eggs accounted for approximately 19.2% of our shell egg dollar sales in fiscal 2019, compared to 17.7% in fiscal 2018. Based on dozens sold, Egg-Land’s Best® branded eggs accounted for 12.8% of dozens sold for fiscal 2019, compared to 13.2% in fiscal 2018.  Land O’ Lakes® branded eggs are produced by hens that are fed a whole grain diet, free of animal fat and animal by-products.  Farmhouse® brand eggs are produced at our facilities by cage-free hens that are provided with a diet of all grain, vegetarian feed.  We market organic, wholesome, cage-free, vegetarian, and omega-3 eggs under our 4-Grain® brand, which consists of both caged and cage-free eggs.  Farmhouse®, Land O’ Lakes®, 4Grain® and other non-Egg-Land’s Best® specialty eggs accounted for 17.0% of our shell egg dollar sales in fiscal 2019, compared to 14.3% in fiscal 2018, and 11.1% of dozens sold for fiscal 2019, compared to 10.4% for fiscal 2018.

Egg Products. Egg products are shell eggs broken and sold in liquid, frozen, or dried form.  In fiscal 2019 and 2018, egg products represented approximately 3% of our net sales.  We sell egg products primarily into the institutional and food service sectors in the U.S.  Our egg products are sold through our wholly owned subsidiary American Egg Products, LLC located in Blackshear, Georgia and our majority owned subsidiary Texas Egg Products, LLC located in Waelder, Texas.  Prices for egg products are generally related to independently quoted market prices or formulas.
Competition.  The production, processing, and distribution of shell eggs is an intensely competitive business, which traditionally has attracted large numbers of producers.  Shell egg competition is generally based on price, service, and product quality. 
The U.S. shell egg industry remains highly fragmented but is characterized by a growing concentration of producers. In 2018, 60 producers with one million or more layers owned 98% of the 337.9 million total U.S. layers, compared to 2000, when 63 producers with one million or more layers owned 79% of the 273 million total layers, and 1990, when 56 producers with one million or more layers owned 64% of the 232 million total layers. We believe a continuation of the concentration trend will result in reduced cyclicality of shell egg prices, but no assurance can be given in that regard. A continuation of this trend could also create greater competition among fewer producers.
Patents and Trade Names.  We own the trademarks Farmhouse®, Sunups®, Sunny Meadow® and 4Grain®. We do not own any patents or proprietary technologies. We produce and market Egg-Land's Best® and Land O’ Lakes® branded eggs under license agreements with EB.  We believe these trademarks and license agreements are important to our business.  We do not know of any infringing uses that would materially affect the use of these trademarks, and we actively defend and enforce them.
Government Regulation.  Our facilities and operations are subject to regulation by various federal, state, and local agencies, including, but not limited to, the United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), USDA, Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), Occupational Safety and Health Administration and corresponding state agencies or laws. The applicable regulations relate to grading, quality control, labeling, sanitary control and reuse or disposal of waste. Our shell egg facilities are subject to periodic USDA, FDA and EPA inspections. Our feed production facilities are subject to FDA regulation and inspections. We maintain our own inspection program to ensure compliance with our own standards and customer specifications. There can be no assurance that we will not be required to incur significant costs for compliance with such statutes and regulations. In the future, additional rules could be proposed that, if adopted, could increase our costs. 
Environmental Regulation.  Our operations and facilities are subject to various federal, state, and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations governing, among other things, the generation, storage, handling, use, transportation, disposal, and remediation of hazardous materials. Under these laws and regulations, we are required to obtain permits from governmental authorities, including, but not limited to, wastewater discharge permits. We have made, and will continue to make, capital and other expenditures relating to compliance with existing environmental, health and safety laws and regulations and permits. We are not currently aware of any major capital expenditures necessary to comply with such laws and regulations; however, because environmental, health and safety laws and regulations are becoming increasingly more stringent, including those relating to animal wastes and wastewater discharges, there can be no assurance that we will not be required to incur significant costs for compliance with such laws and regulations in the future.
Employees. As of June 1, 2019, we had 3,490 employees, of whom 2,945 worked in egg production, processing and marketing, 165 worked in feed mill operations and 380 were administrative employees, including our executive officers.  Approximately 5.1% of our personnel are part-time.  None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement.  We consider our relations with employees to be good.
