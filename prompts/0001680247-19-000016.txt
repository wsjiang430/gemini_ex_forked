Item 1.     Business.
Our Company
We are a growth‑oriented, Midland, Texas‑based oilfield services company providing hydraulic fracturing and other complementary services to leading upstream oil and gas companies engaged in the exploration and production, or E&P, of North American unconventional oil and natural gas resources. Our operations are primarily focused in the Permian Basin, where we have cultivated longstanding customer relationships with some of the region’s most active and well‑capitalized E&P companies. The Permian Basin is widely regarded as the most prolific oil‑producing area in the United States, and we believe we are one of the leading providers of hydraulic fracturing services in the region by hydraulic horsepower, or HHP. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we purchased and deployed four newbuild hydraulic fracturing units, bringing our total horse power to 905,000 HHP, or 20 deployed fleets. 
On December 31, 2018, we consummated the purchase of certain pressure pumping assets and real property from Pioneer Natural Resources USA, Inc. (“Pioneer”) and Pioneer Natural Resources Pumping Services, LLC (“Pioneer Pumping Services”). Prior to the purchase, the pressure pumping assets exclusively provided integrated pressure pumping services to Pioneer’s completion and production operations. The acquisition cost of the assets was comprised of $110.0 million of cash and 16.6 million shares of our common stock. In connection with the consummation of transaction, we became a strategic long-term service provider to Pioneer, providing pressure pumping and related services for a term of up to 10 years.
The pressure pumping assets acquired include eight hydraulic fracturing fleets with a total of 510,000 HHP, four coiled tubing units and an associated equipment maintenance facility. Through this acquisition, we expanded our existing presence in the Permian Basin, and increased our pumping capacity by 56%, to 28 hydraulic fracturing fleets with a total of 1,415,000 HHP, further strengthening our position as one of the largest pure-play provider of integrated well completion services in the Permian Basin. 
Our modern hydraulic fracturing fleet has been designed to handle the most challenging Permian Basin operating conditions and the region’s increasingly high‑intensity well completions, which are characterized by longer horizontal wellbores, more frac stages per lateral and increasing amounts of proppant per well. 
In addition to our core hydraulic fracturing operations, we also offer a suite of complementary well completion and production services, including cementing, coiled tubing, flowback services and drilling. We believe these complementary services create operational efficiencies for our customers and allow us to capture a greater portion of their capital spending across the lifecycle of an unconventional well. 
Our primary business objective is to serve as a strategic long-term partner to our customers. We achieve this objective by providing reliable, high‑quality services that are tailored to our customers’ needs and synchronized with their well development programs. This alignment assists our customers in optimizing the long‑term development of their unconventional resources. Over the past three years, we have leveraged our strong relationships in the Permian Basin to significantly grow our installed HHP capacity and organically build our cementing and coiled tubing lines of business. Consistent with past performance, we believe our substantial market presence will continue to yield a variety of actionable growth opportunities allowing us to expand both our hydraulic fracturing and complementary services going forward. To this end, we intend to continue to differentiate ourselves, consistent with our past practice, by opportunistically deploying new equipment on a long‑term dedicated basis.
Our Services
We conduct our business through five operating segments: hydraulic fracturing (inclusive of acidizing), cementing, coil tubing, flowback and drilling. For reporting purposes, the hydraulic fracturing and cementing operating segments are aggregated into our one reportable segment: pressure pumping. For additional financial information on our reportable segment, please see Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

Pressure Pumping
Hydraulic Fracturing
We primarily provide hydraulic fracturing services to E&P companies in the Permian Basin. These services are intended to optimize hydrocarbon flow paths during the completion phase of horizontal shale wellbores. We have significant expertise in multi‑stage fracturing of horizontal oil‑producing wells in unconventional geological formations. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we continued to organically grow our hydraulic fracturing business to a total of 20 hydraulic fracturing fleets with an aggregate of 905,000 HHP. Following the consummation of our acquisition of pressure pumping assets from Pioneer Pressure Pumping Services, we increased our hydraulic fracturing business to a total 28 fleets, or 1,415,000 HHP.
The fracturing process consists of pumping a fracturing fluid into a well at sufficient pressure to fracture the formation. Materials known as proppants, which in our business are comprised primarily of sand, are suspended in the fracturing fluid and are pumped into the fracture to prop it open. The fracturing fluid is designed to “break,” or loosen viscosity, and be forced out of the formation by its pressure, leaving the proppants suspended in the fractures created, thereby increasing the mobility of the hydrocarbons. As a result of the fracturing process, production rates are usually enhanced substantially, thus increasing the rate of return of hydrocarbons for the operator.
We own and operate a fleet of mobile hydraulic fracturing units and other auxiliary equipment to perform fracturing services. We also refer to all of our fracturing units, other equipment and vehicles necessary to perform a fracturing job as a “fleet” and the personnel assigned to each fleet as a “crew.” Each hydraulic fracturing unit consist primarily of a high pressure hydraulic pump, diesel engine, transmission and various hoses, valves, tanks and other supporting equipment that are typically mounted to a flatbed trailer. 
We provide dedicated equipment, personnel and services that are tailored to meet each of our customer’s needs. Each fleet has a designated team of personnel, which allows us to provide responsive and customized services, such as project design, proppant and other consumables procurement, real‑time data provision and post‑completion analysis for each of our jobs. Many of our hydraulic fracturing fleets and associated personnel have continuously worked with the same customer for the past several years promoting deep relationships and a high degree of coordination and visibility into future customer activity levels. Furthermore, in light of our substantial market presence and historically high fleet utilization levels, we have established a variety of entrenched relationships with key equipment, sand and other downhole consumable suppliers, including over 30 sand suppliers utilized in 2018. These strategic relationships ensure ready access to equipment, parts and materials on a timely and economic basis and allow our dedicated procurement logistics team to ensure consistently safe and reliable operations.
Cementing
We provide cementing services for completion of new wells and remedial work on existing wells. Cementing services use pressure pumping equipment to deliver a slurry of liquid cement that is pumped down a well between the casing and the borehole. Cementing provides isolation between fluid zones behind the casing to minimize potential damage to hydrocarbon bearing formations or the integrity of freshwater aquifers, and provides structural integrity for the casing by securing it to the earth. Cementing is also done when recompleting wells, where one zone is plugged and another is opened.
As of December 31, 2018, we operated a total of 20 cementing units, with 13 units operating in the Permian Basin and 7 units operating in the Uinta‑Piceance Basin. We believe that our cementing segment provides an organic growth opportunity for us to expand our service offerings within our existing customer base.

Other Services
Coiled Tubing
Coiled tubing services involve injecting coiled tubing into wells to perform various completion well intervention operations. Coiled tubing is a flexible steel pipe with a diameter of typically less than three inches and manufactured in continuous lengths of thousands of feet. It is wound or coiled on a truck‑mounted reel for onshore applications. Due to its small diameter, coiled tubing can be inserted into existing production tubing and used to perform a variety of services to enhance the flow of oil or natural gas.
The principal advantages of using coiled tubing include the ability to (i) continue production from the well without interruption, thus reducing the risk of formation damage, (ii) move continuous coiled tubing in and out of a well significantly faster than conventional pipe used with a workover rig, which must be jointed and unjointed, (iii) direct fluids into a wellbore with more precision, allowing for improved stimulation fluid placement, (iv) provide a source of energy to power a downhole motor or manipulate down‑hole tools and (v) enhance access to remote fields due to the smaller size and mobility.
As of December 31, 2018, we had 8 coiled tubing units of various sizes. We believe these units are well suited for the performance requirements of the unconventional resource markets we serve. 
Flowback Services
Our flowback services consist of production testing, solids control, hydrostatic testing and torque services. Flowback involves the process of allowing fluids to flow from the well following a treatment, either in preparation for an impending phase of treatment or to return the well to production. Our flowback equipment consists of manifolds, accumulators, valves, flare stacks and other associated equipment that combine to form up to a total of five well‑testing spreads. We provide flowback services in the Permian Basin and mid‑continent markets.
Surface Air Drilling
We operated a surface air drilling operation in the Uinta‑Piceance Basin, which offered pre‑set surface air drilling services to target depths of approximately 4,000 feet in areas of fragile geology. Air drilling is a technique in which oil, natural gas, or geothermal wells are drilled by creating a pressure within the well that is lower than the reservoir pressure, which results in increased rates of penetration, reduced formation damage and reduced drilling costs. 
On August 31, 2018, we divested our surface air drilling operations, included in our "all other" operating segment category in our financial statements, in order to continue to position ourselves as a Permian Basin-focused pressure pumping business because we believe the pressure pumping market in the Permian Basin offers more supportive long-term growth fundamentals. The divestiture of our surface air drilling operations did not qualify for presentation and disclosure as discontinued operations, and accordingly we have recorded the resulting loss on disposal of our surface air drilling of $0.3 million, as part of our loss on disposal of asset in our statement of operations included in this annual report. The divestiture of our surface air drilling operations resulted in a reduction in the number of our current operating segments. The change in the number of our operating segments did not impact our reportable segment information reported in the financial statements included in this annual report.
Competitive Strengths
Our primary business objective is to serve as a strategic long-term partner for our customers. We achieve this objective by providing reliable, high‑quality services that are tailored to our customers’ needs and synchronized with their well development programs. This alignment assists our customers in optimizing the long‑term development of their unconventional resources. We believe that the following competitive strengths differentiate us from our peers and uniquely position us to achieve our primary business objective.

• | Strong market position in the Permian Basin. We believe we are one of the largest hydraulic fracturing provider by HHP in the Permian Basin, which is the most prolific oil producing area in the United States. Our longstanding customer relationships and substantial Permian Basin market presence uniquely position us to continue growing in tandem with the basin’s ongoing development. The Permian Basin is a mature, liquids‑rich basin with well known geology and a large, exploitable resource base that delivers attractive E&P producer economics at or below current commodity prices. As a result of its significant size, coupled with the presence of multiple prospective geologic benches and other favorable characteristics, the Permian Basin has become widely recognized as the most attractive and economic oil resource in North America.

Our operational focus has historically been in the Permian Basin’s Midland sub‑basin in support of our customers’ core operations. More recently, however, many of our customers have made sizeable acquisitions in the Delaware Basin, and we have expanded our services into the Delaware Basin to help develop their acreage. Further, we believe that we are uniquely positioned to capture a large addressable growth opportunity as the basin develops. For the foreseeable future, we expect both the Midland Basin and the Delaware Basin to continue to command a disproportionate share of future North American E&P spending.

• | Hydraulic fracturing is highly levered to increasing drilling activity and completion intensity levels. The combination of an expanding Permian Basin horizontal rig count and more complex well completions has a compounding effect on HHP demand growth. Horizontal drilling has become the default method for E&P operators to most economically extract unconventional resources, and the number of horizontal rigs has increased from 22% of the total Permian Basin rig count in December 2011 to approximately 91% of the Permian Basin rig count at December 31, 2018. As the horizontal rig count has grown, well completion intensity levels have also increased as a result of longer wellbore lateral lengths, more fracturing stages per foot of lateral and increasing amounts of proppant per stage. Furthermore, the ongoing improvement in drilling and completion efficiencies, driven by innovations such as multi‑well pads and zipper fracs, have further increased the demand for HHP. Taken together, these demand drivers have helped contribute to the full utilization of our fleet and have us well positioned to capture future growth opportunities and enhanced pricing for our services.


• | Deep relationships and operational alignment with high‑quality, Permian Basin‑focused customers. Our deep local roots, operational expertise and commitment to safe and reliable service have allowed us to cultivate longstanding customer relationships with the most active and well‑capitalized Permian Basin operators. Many of our current customers have worked with us since our inception and have integrated our fleet scheduling with their well development programs. This high degree of operational alignment and their continued support have allowed us to maintain relatively high utilization rates over time. As our customers increase activity levels, we expect to continue to leverage these strong relationships to keep our fleet fully utilized and selectively expand our platform in response to specific customer demand.


• | Standardized fleet of modern, well‑maintained equipment. We have a large, homogenous fleet of modern equipment that is configured to handle the Permian Basin’s most complex, highest‑intensity, hydraulic fracturing jobs. We believe that our fleet design is a key advantage compared to many of our competitors who have fracturing units that are not optimized for Permian Basin conditions. Our fleet is largely standardized across units to facilitate efficient maintenance and repair, reducing equipment downtime and improving labor efficiency. Furthermore, our strong relationships with a variety of key suppliers and vendors provide us with the reliable access to the equipment necessary to support our continued organic growth strategy.


• | Proven cross‑cycle financial performance. Over the past several years, we have maintained high cross‑cycle fleet utilization rates. Since September 2016 our fleet has consistently recorded a utilization rate of approximately 100%. Our consistent track record of steady growth, coupled with our ability to quickly deploy new HHP on a dedicated and fully utilized basis, has resulted in revenue growth across the industry’s cycles. We believe that we will be able to continue to grow faster than our competitors while preserving attractive EBITDA margins as a result of our differentiated service offerings and a robust backlog of demand for our services. Furthermore, we believe that our philosophy of maintaining modest

5

financial leverage and a healthy balance sheet has left us more conservatively capitalized than our peers. We expect that improving market fundamentals, our superior execution and our customer‑focused approach should result in strong financial performance.

• | Seasoned management and operating team. We have a seasoned executive management team, with our senior members contributing more than 100 years of collective industry and financial experience. Members of our management team founded our business and seeded our company with a portion of our original investment capital. We believe their track record of successfully building premier oilfield service companies in the Permian Basin, as well as their deep roots and relationships throughout the West Texas community, provide a meaningful competitive advantage for our business. In addition, our management team has assembled a loyal group of highly‑motivated and talented managers and field personnel, and we have had minimal manager‑level turnover in our core service divisions over the past three years. We employ a balanced decision‑making structure that empowers managerial and field personnel to work directly with customers to develop solutions while leveraging senior management’s oversight. This collaborative approach fosters strong customer links at all levels of the organization and effectively institutionalizes customer relationships beyond the executive suite.

Strategy
Our strategy is to:

• | Capture an increasing share of rising demand for hydraulic fracturing services in the Permian Basin. We intend to continue to position ourselves as a Permian Basin‑focused hydraulic fracturing business, as we believe the Permian Basin hydraulic fracturing market offers supportive long‑term growth fundamentals. These fundamentals are characterized by increased demand for our HHP, driven by increasing drilling activity and well completion intensity levels. We are currently operating at approximately 100% utilization, and we believe we are strategically positioned to deploy additional hydraulic fracturing equipment as our customers continue to develop their assets in the Midland Basin and Delaware Basin.


• | Capitalize on improving efficiency gains. We intend to continue to work with our customers and vendors to improve our operational efficiencies and enhance our margins. We believe that improving our efficiencies will result in greater revenue and enhanced margins as fixed costs are spread over a broader revenue base.


• | Cross‑sell our complementary services. In addition to our hydraulic fracturing services, we offer a broad range of complementary services in support of our customers’ development activities, including cementing, coiled tubing, flowback services and drilling. These complementary services create operational efficiencies for our customers, and allow us to capture a greater percentage of their capital spending across the lifecycle of an unconventional well. We believe that, as our customers increase spending levels, we are well positioned to continue cross‑selling and growing our complementary service offerings.


• | Maintain financial stability and flexibility to pursue growth opportunities. Consistent with our historical practices, we plan to continue to maintain a conservative balance sheet, which will allow us to better react to potential changes in industry and market conditions and opportunistically grow our business. In the near term, we intend to continue our past practice of aligning our growth capital expenditures with visible customer demand by strategically deploying new equipment on a long‑term, dedicated basis in response to inbound customer requests. We will also selectively evaluate potential strategic acquisitions that increase our scale and capabilities or diversify our operations.

Our Customers
Our customers consist primarily of oil and natural gas producers in North America. Our top five customers accounted for approximately 68.7%, 66.0% and 58.0% of our revenue, for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2018, XTO Energy, Parsley Energy Operations, LLC and 
6

CrownQuest Operating, LLC, accounted for 24.1%, 16.5%, and 12.2%, respectively, of total revenue. No other customer accounted for more than 10% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018. 
Competition
The markets in which we operate are highly competitive. To be successful, an oilfield services company must provide services that meet the specific needs of oil and natural gas exploration and production companies at competitive prices. Competitive factors impacting sales of our services are price, reputation, technical expertise, service and equipment quality, and health and safety standards. Although we believe our customers consider all of these factors, we believe price is a key factor in E&P companies’ criteria in choosing a service provider. While we seek to price our services competitively, we believe many of our customers elect to work with us based on our deep local roots, operational expertise, equipment’s ability to handle the most complex Permian Basin well completions, and commitment to safety and reliability.
We provide our services primarily in the Permian Basin, and we compete against different companies in each service and product line we offer. Our competition includes many large and small oilfield service companies, including the largest integrated oilfield services companies. Our major competitors for hydraulic fracturing services include C&J Energy Services, Halliburton, Patterson‑UTI Energy Inc., RPC, Inc., Schlumberger, Keane Group, Inc., Liberty Oilfield Services, FTS International, Inc., Superior Energy Services and a number of locally oriented businesses. 
Seasonality
Our results of operations have historically reflected seasonal tendencies, generally in the fourth quarter, relating to the conclusion of our customers’ annual capital expenditure budgets, the holidays and inclement winter weather during which we may experience declines in our operating results.
Operating Risks and Insurance
Our operations are subject to hazards inherent in the oilfield services industry, such as accidents, blowouts, explosions, fires and spills and releases that can cause personal injury or loss of life, damage or destruction of property, equipment, natural resources and the environment and suspension of operations.
In addition, claims for loss of oil and natural gas production and damage to formations can occur in the oilfield services industry. If a serious accident were to occur at a location where our equipment and services are being used, it could result in us being named as a defendant in lawsuits asserting large claims.
Our business involves the transportation of heavy equipment and materials, and as a result, we may also experience traffic accidents which may result in spills, property damage and personal injury.
Despite our efforts to maintain safety standards, we from time to time have suffered accidents in the past and anticipate that we could experience accidents in the future. In addition to the property damage, personal injury and other losses from these accidents, the frequency and severity of these incidents affect our operating costs and insurability and our relationships with customers, employees, regulatory agencies and other parties. Any significant increase in the frequency or severity of these incidents, or the general level of compensation awards, could adversely affect the cost of, or our ability to obtain, workers’ compensation and other forms of insurance, and could have other material adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations.
We maintain commercial general liability, workers’ compensation, business auto, commercial property, umbrella liability, excess liability, and directors and officers insurance policies providing coverages of risks and amounts that we believe to be customary in our industry. Further, we have pollution legal liability coverage for our business entities, which would cover, among other things, third party liability and costs of clean up relating to environmental contamination on our premises while our equipment is in transit and on our customers’ job site. With respect to our hydraulic fracturing operations, coverage would be available under our pollution legal liability policy 
7

for any surface or subsurface environmental clean‑up and liability to third parties arising from any surface or subsurface contamination. We also have certain specific coverages for some of our businesses, including our hydraulic fracturing services.
Although we maintain insurance coverage of types and amounts that we believe to be customary in the industry, we are not fully insured against all risks, either because insurance is not available or because of the high premium costs relative to perceived risk. Further, insurance rates have in the past been subject to wide fluctuation and changes in coverage could result in less coverage, increases in cost or higher deductibles and retentions. Liabilities for which we are not insured, or which exceed the policy limits of our applicable insurance, could have a material adverse effect on us. See “Risk Factors” for a description of certain risks associated with our insurance policies.
Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety Regulations
Our operations are subject to stringent laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection, and occupational health and safety. Numerous federal, state and local governmental agencies issue regulations that often require difficult and costly compliance measures that could carry substantial administrative, civil and criminal penalties and may result in injunctive obligations for non compliance. These laws and regulations may, for example, restrict the types, quantities and concentrations of various substances that can be released into the environment, limit or prohibit construction or drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands, ecologically or seismically sensitive areas and other protected areas, or require action to prevent or remediate pollution from current or former operations. Moreover, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances, hydrocarbons or other waste products into the environment. Changes in environmental, health and safety laws and regulations occur frequently, and any changes that result in more stringent and costly requirements could materially adversely affect our operations and financial position. We have not experienced any material adverse effect from compliance with these requirements, however, this trend may not continue in the future.
Below is an overview of some of the more significant environmental, health and safety requirements with which we must comply. Our customers’ operations are subject to similar laws and regulations. Any material adverse effect of these laws and regulations on our customers’ operations and financial position may also have an indirect material adverse effect on our operations and financial position.
Waste Handling. We handle, transport, store and dispose of wastes that are subject to the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) and comparable state laws and regulations, which affect our activities by imposing requirements regarding the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, disposal and cleanup of hazardous and non hazardous wastes. With federal approval, the individual states administer some or all of the provisions of RCRA, sometimes in conjunction with their own, more stringent requirements. Although certain petroleum production wastes are exempt from regulation as hazardous wastes under RCRA, such wastes may constitute “solid wastes” that are subject to the less stringent requirements of non hazardous waste provisions.
Administrative, civil and criminal penalties can be imposed for failure to comply with waste handling requirements. Moreover, the EPA or state or local governments may adopt more stringent requirements for the handling of non hazardous wastes or recategorize some non hazardous wastes as hazardous for future regulation. Indeed, legislation has been proposed from time to time in Congress to recategorize certain oil and natural gas exploration, development and production wastes as hazardous wastes. Several environmental organizations have also petitioned the EPA to modify existing regulations to recategorize certain oil and natural gas exploration, development and production wastes as hazardous. Any such changes in these laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures and operating expenses. Although we do not believe the current costs of managing our wastes, as presently classified, to be significant, any legislative or regulatory reclassification of oil and natural gas exploration and production wastes could increase our costs to manage and dispose of such wastes.
8

Remediation of Hazardous Substances. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA” or “Superfund”) and analogous state laws generally impose liability without regard to fault or legality of the original conduct, on classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. These persons include the current owner or operator of a contaminated facility, a former owner or operator of the facility at the time of contamination and those persons that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substance at the facility. Liability for the costs of removing or remediating previously disposed wastes or contamination, damages to natural resources, the costs of conducting certain health studies, amongst other things, is strict and joint and several. In addition, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment. In the course of our operations, we use materials that, if released, would be subject to CERCLA and comparable state laws. Therefore, governmental agencies or third parties may seek to hold us responsible under CERCLA and comparable state statutes for all or part of the costs to clean up sites at which such hazardous substances have been released.
One of our facilities in Midland, Texas is located within the boundaries of the West County Road 112 federal Superfund site, which site and the associated investigation and cleanup is being managed by EPA Region 6. The site’s soil and groundwater is contaminated with chromium and hexavalent chromium as a result of historic site operations unaffiliated with the Company and unassociated with the Company’s operations. Toxic tort claims also have been asserted as a result of this groundwater contamination against various unaffiliated parties. In 2013, in order to reduce the Company’s risk of incurring any future liabilities in connection with this site, the Company negotiated and obtained a bona fide prospective purchaser (“BFPP”) letter from EPA Region 6 in connection with a reorganization of the facility site ownership and lease. The BFPP letter generally acknowledges and provides that the Company is unaffiliated with any potentially responsible parties or known contamination that is the subject of the Superfund action, the Company agrees to comply with any future land use restrictions that may be imposed in connection with a site remedy (none have been imposed to date), and the Company agrees to cooperate with and provide access and assistance to EPA Region 6 in connection with the remediation. In exchange for these undertakings, the Company will not be subject to any CERCLA action by the EPA. In addition, the Company separately obtained a 10‑year environmental pollution legal liability insurance policy, effective March 4, 2013, with an aggregate limit of $20 million to insure against potential third‑party claims and any known or unknown pre‑existing conditions at the site, including Superfund or toxic tort liabilities. Both prior to and since obtaining the BFPP letter and the insurance policy, no claims have been made or threatened against the Company or any of its affiliated persons or entities with regard to this Superfund site or any related liabilities, and the Company has not incurred any significant expenses in connection with this matter.
NORM. In the course of our operations, some of our equipment may be exposed to naturally occurring radioactive materials (“NORM”) associated with oil and gas deposits and, accordingly may result in the generation of wastes and other materials containing NORM. NORM exhibiting levels of radiation in excess of established state standards are subject to special handling and disposal requirements, and any storage vessels, piping and work area affected by NORM may be subject to remediation or restoration requirements.
Water Discharges. The Clean Water Act, Safe Drinking Water Act, Oil Pollution Act and analogous state laws and regulations impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the unauthorized discharge of pollutants, including produced waters and other gas and oil wastes, into regulated waters. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA or the state. Also, spill prevention, control and countermeasure plan requirements require appropriate containment berms and similar structures to help prevent the contamination of regulated waters.
Air Emissions. The Clean Air Act (“CAA”) and comparable state laws and regulations, regulate emissions of various air pollutants through the issuance of permits and the imposition of other emissions control requirements. The EPA has developed, and continues to develop, stringent regulations governing emissions of air pollutants from specified sources. New facilities may be required to obtain permits before work can begin, and existing facilities may be required to obtain additional permits and incur capital costs in order to remain in compliance. These and other laws and regulations may increase the costs of compliance for some facilities where we operate. Obtaining or renewing permits also has the potential to delay the development of oil and natural gas projects.
9

Climate Change. The EPA has determined that greenhouse gases (“GHGs”) present an endangerment to public health and the environment because such gases contribute to warming of the earth’s atmosphere and other climatic changes. Based on these findings, the EPA has adopted and implemented, and continues to adopt and implement, regulations that restrict emissions of GHGs under existing provisions of the CAA. The EPA also requires the annual reporting of GHG emissions from certain large sources of GHG emissions in the United States, including certain oil and gas production facilities. The U.S. Congress has from time to time considered adopting legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs and almost one‑half of the states have already taken legal measures to reduce emissions of GHGs primarily through the planned development of GHG emission inventories and/or regional GHG cap and trade programs. In December 2015, the United States joined the international community at the 21st Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris, France. The resulting Paris Agreement calls for the parties to undertake “ambitious efforts” to limit the average global temperature, and to conserve and enhance sinks and reservoirs of greenhouse gases. The Paris Agreement entered into force in November 2016. On June 1, 2017, President Trump announced that the United States planned to withdraw from the Paris Agreement and to seek negotiations either to reenter the Paris Agreement on different terms or establish a new framework agreement. The Paris Agreement provides for a four‑year exit process beginning when it took effect in November 2016, which would result in an effective exit date of November 2020. The United States’ adherence to the exit process is uncertain and/or the terms on which the United States may reenter the Paris Agreement or a separately negotiated agreement are unclear at this time.
Moreover, climate change may cause more extreme weather conditions and increased volatility in seasonal temperatures. Extreme weather conditions can interfere with our operations and increase our costs, and damage resulting from extreme weather may not be fully insured.
Endangered and Threatened Species. Environmental laws such as the Endangered Species Act (“ESA”) and analogous state laws may impact exploration, development and production activities in areas where we operate. The ESA provides broad protection for species of fish, wildlife and plants that are listed as threatened or endangered. Similar protections are offered to migratory birds under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and various state analogs. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service may identify previously unidentified endangered or threatened species or may designate critical habitat and suitable habitat areas that it believes are necessary for survival of a threatened or endangered species, which could cause us or our customers to incur additional costs or become subject to operating restrictions or operating bans in the affected areas.
Regulation of Hydraulic Fracturing and Related Activities. Our hydraulic fracturing operations are a significant component of our business. Hydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons, particularly natural gas, from tight formations, including shales. The process, which involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production, is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions. However, federal agencies have asserted regulatory authority over certain aspects of the process. For example, in May 2014, the EPA issued an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking seeking comment on the development of regulations under the Toxic Substances Control Act to require companies to disclose information regarding the chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing. Beginning in August 2012, the EPA issued a series of rules under the CAA that establish new emission control requirements for certain oil and natural gas production and natural gas processing operations and associated equipment. After several attempts to delay implementation, in September 2018 the EPA issued a proposal to amend and reduce such requirements. In March 2015, the Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”) finalized a rule governing hydraulic fracturing on federal lands. In June 2016, a federal district court judge in Wyoming struck down the final rule, finding that the BLM lacked congressional authority to promulgate the rule. However, in July 2017, the BLM initiated a rulemaking to rescind the final rule and reinstate the regulations that existed immediately before the published effective date of the rule. In light of the BLM’s proposed rulemaking, in September 2017, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit dismissed the appeal and remanded with directions to vacate the lower court’s opinion, leaving the final rule in place. The BLM initiated a rulemaking to rescind the final rule in December 2017. Further, legislation to amend the Safe Drinking Water Act to repeal the exemption for hydraulic fracturing (except when diesel fuels are used) from the definition of “underground injection” and require federal permitting and regulatory control of hydraulic fracturing, as well as legislative proposals to require disclosure of the chemical constituents of the fluids used in the fracturing process, have been proposed in recent sessions of Congress. Several 
10

states and local jurisdictions in which we or our customers operate also have adopted or are considering adopting regulations that could restrict or prohibit hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances, impose more stringent operating standards and/or require the disclosure of the composition of hydraulic fracturing fluids.
More recently, federal and state governments have begun investigating whether the disposal of produced water into underground injection wells has caused increased seismic activity in certain areas. In March 2016, the United States Geological Survey identified six states with the most significant hazards from induced seismicity, including Oklahoma, Kansas, Texas, Colorado, New Mexico and Arkansas. The United States Geological Survey also noted the potential for induced seismicity in Ohio and Alabama. In response to concerns regarding induced seismicity, regulators in some states have imposed, or are considering imposing, additional requirements in the permitting of produced water disposal wells or otherwise to assess any relationship between seismicity and the use of such wells. For example, Oklahoma issued new rules for wastewater disposal wells in 2014 that imposed certain permitting and operating restrictions and reporting requirements on disposal wells in proximity to faults and also, from time to time, has developed and implemented plans directing certain wells where seismic incidents have occurred to restrict or suspend disposal well operations. In particular, the Oklahoma Corporation Commission released well completion seismicity guidelines in December 2016 for operators in the SCOOP and STACK that call for hydraulic fracturing operations to be suspended following earthquakes of certain magnitudes in the vicinity. In addition, in February 2017, the Oklahoma Corporation Commission’s Oil and Gas Conservation Division issued an order limiting future increases in the volume of oil and natural gas wastewater injected into the ground in an effort to reduce the number of earthquakes in the state. The Texas Railroad Commission adopted similar rules in 2014. In addition, in December 2016, the EPA released its final report regarding the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources, concluding that “water cycle” activities associated with hydraulic fracturing may impact drinking water resources under certain circumstances such as water withdrawals for fracturing in times or areas of low water availability, surface spills during the management of fracturing fluids, chemicals or produced water, injection of fracturing fluids into wells with inadequate mechanical integrity, injection of fracturing fluids directly into groundwater resources, discharge of inadequately treated fracturing wastewater to surface waters, and disposal or storage of fracturing wastewater in unlined pits. The results of these studies could lead federal and state governments and agencies to develop and implement additional regulations.
Increased regulation of hydraulic fracturing and related activities (whether as a result of the EPA study results or resulting from other factors) could subject us and our customers to additional permitting and financial assurance requirements, more stringent construction specifications, increased monitoring, reporting and record keeping obligations, and plugging and abandonment requirements. New requirements could result in increased operational costs for us and our customers, and reduce the demand for our services.
OSHA Matters. The Occupational Safety and Health Act (“OSHA”) and comparable state statutes regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers. In addition, the OSHA hazard communication standard requires that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and the public.
