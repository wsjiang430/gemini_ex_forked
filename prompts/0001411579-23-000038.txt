Item 1. Business.
​
General Development of Business
AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (“Holdings”), through its direct and indirect subsidiaries, including American Multi-Cinema, Inc. and its subsidiaries, (collectively with Holdings, unless the context otherwise requires, the “Company” or “AMC”), is principally involved in the theatrical exhibition business and owns, operates or has interests in theatres primarily located in the United States and Europe.
Our business was founded in Kansas City, Missouri in 1920. Holdings was incorporated under the laws of the state of Delaware on June 6, 2007. We maintain our principal executive offices at One AMC Way, 11500 Ash Street, Leawood, Kansas 66211.
COVID-19 Impact, Company Response and Change in Business Strategy
The North American and International industry box offices have been significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in the suspension of new movie production, studios postponed new film releases or moved them to the home video market, streaming, or premium video on demand (“PVOD”) platforms.
The number of previously delayed major movie title releases increased significantly in the second half of 2021, however the production backlog, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, resulted in significantly fewer wide releases during 2022. A more robust slate of major movie releases is expected during 2023, which has generated optimism that box office revenues and attendance levels will continue to improve from what we experienced in 2022. The box office performance in 2022 was also impacted by the direct or simultaneous release of movie titles to the home video or streaming markets in lieu of theatre exhibition, however this practice has diminished and we believe will have a smaller impact on the box office performance and attendance levels of our business in 2023.
As of December 31, 2022, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $631.5 million. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we adjusted certain elements of our business strategy and took significant steps to preserve cash. We are continuing to take significant measures to further strengthen our financial position and enhance our operations, by eliminating non-essential costs, including reductions to our variable costs and elements of our fixed cost structure, introducing new initiatives, and optimizing our theatrical footprint. 
Additionally, we enhanced liquidity through debt issuances, debt refinancing that extended maturities, purchases of debt below par value, and equity sales. See Note 8—Corporate Borrowings and Finance Lease Liabilities, Note 9—Stockholders’ Equity, and Note 16—Subsequent Events in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Part II, Item 8 thereof, for further information.
We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents, together with cash generated from operations, will be sufficient to fund our operations, satisfy our obligations, including cash outflows to repay rent amounts that were deferred during the COVID-19 pandemic and planned capital expenditures, and comply with minimum liquidity and financial covenant requirements under our debt covenants related to borrowings pursuant to the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility for at least the next twelve months. In order to achieve net positive operating cash flows and long-term profitability, we believe that operating revenues will need to increase significantly from 2021 and 2022 levels to levels in line with pre-COVID-19 operating revenues. We believe the anticipated volume of titles available for theatrical release, and the anticipated broad appeal of many of those titles will support increased operating revenues and attendance levels. We believe that recent operating revenues and attendance levels are positive signs of continued demand for the moviegoing experience. Total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 were $3.9 billion, $2.5 billion, and $1.2 billion, respectively, compared to $5.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, 2020, attendance was 201.0 million patrons, 128.5 million patrons, and 75.2 million patrons, respectively, compared to 356.4 million patrons for the year ended December 31, 2019. Moreover, it is difficult to predict future operating revenues and attendance levels and there remain significant risks that may negatively impact operating revenues and attendance, including movie studios release schedules, the production and theatrical release of fewer films compared to levels before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, and direct-to-streaming or other changing movie studio practices.

We currently estimate that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to comply with minimum liquidity and financial covenant requirements under our debt covenants related to borrowings pursuant to the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility, currently and through the next twelve months. Pursuant to the Twelfth Amendment (as defined in Note 8—Corporate Borrowings and Finance Lease Liabilities in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Part II, Item 8 thereof), the requisite revolving lenders party thereto agreed to extend the suspension period for the financial covenant applicable to the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility under the Credit Agreement (as defined in Note 8—Corporate Borrowings and Finance Lease Liabilities in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Part II, Item 8 thereof) through March 31, 2024. The current maturity date of the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility is April 22, 2024; since the financial covenant applicable to the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility is tested as of the last day of any fiscal quarter for which financial statements have been (or were required to have been) delivered, the financial covenant has been effectively suspended through maturity of the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2022 we were subject to a minimum liquidity requirement of $100 million as a condition to the financial covenant suspension period under the Credit Agreement.
The 11.25% Odeon Term Loan due 2023 (“Odeon Term Loan Facility”) was to mature on August 19, 2023 during the third fiscal quarter of the Company’s next calendar year. On October 20, 2022 we completely repaid the Odeon Term Loan Facility using existing cash and $363.0 million net proceeds from the issuance of new 12.75% Odeon Senior Secured Notes due 2027 (“Odeon Notes due 2027”). 

We actively seek and expect, at any time and from time to time, to continue to seek to retire or purchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases and/or exchanges for equity (including AMC Preferred Equity Units) or debt, in open-market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases or exchanges, if any will be upon such terms and at such prices as we may determine, and will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material and to the extent equity is used, dilutive. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we repurchased $118.3 million aggregate principal of the Second Lien Notes due 2026 for $68.3 million and recorded a gain on extinguishment of $75.0 million in other expense (income). These 2022 repurchases included a purchase of $15.0 million aggregate principal of the Second Lien Notes due 2026 from Antara Capital LP (“Antara”), which subsequently became a related party on February 7, 2023, for $5.9 million and a gain on extinguishment of $12.0 million. 
Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2022 we repurchased $5.3 million aggregate principal of the Senior Subordinated Notes due 2027 for $1.6 million and recorded a gain on extinguishment of $3.7 million in other expense (income). Accrued interest of $4.5 million was paid in connection with the repurchases. See Note 8—Corporate Borrowings and Finance Lease Liabilities in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Part II, Item 8 thereof, for more information.
We received rent concessions provided by the lessors that aided in mitigating the economic effects of COVID-19 during the pandemic. These concessions primarily consisted of rent abatements and the deferral of rent payments. As a result, deferred lease amounts were approximately $157.2 million as of December 31, 2022. Including repayments of deferred lease amounts, our cash expenditures for rent increased significantly during the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to December 31, 2021. See Note 3—Leases in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Part II, Item 8 in this Form 10-K for a summary of the estimated future repayment terms for the deferred lease amounts due to COVID-19, and also a summary of the estimated future repayment terms for the minimum operating lease and finance lease amounts.

It is very difficult to estimate our liquidity requirements, future cash burn rates, future operating revenues, and attendance levels. Depending on our assumptions regarding the timing and ability to achieve significantly increased levels of operating revenue, the estimates of amounts of required liquidity vary significantly. In order to achieve net positive operating cash flows and long-term profitability, we believe that operating revenues will need to increase significantly to levels in line with pre-COVID-19 operating revenues. Our current cash burn rates are not sustainable. Further, we cannot accurately predict what future changes may occur to the supply or release date of movie titles available for theatrical exhibition. Nor can we know with certainty the impact on consumer movie-going behavior of studios who release movies to theatrical exhibition and their streaming platforms on the same date, or the potential operating revenue and impact on attendance related to other studio decisions to accelerate in-home availability of their theatrical movies. Studio negotiations regarding evolving theatrical release models and film licensing terms are ongoing. There can be no assurance that the operating revenues, attendance levels, and other assumptions used to estimate our liquidity requirements and future cash burn rates will be correct, and our ability to be predictive is uncertain due to limited ability to predict studio film release dates and success of individual titles. Further, there can be no assurances that

we will be successful in generating the additional liquidity necessary to meet our obligations beyond twelve months from the issuance of these financial statements on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to maintain or renegotiate our minimum liquidity covenant requirements, it could have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.
Please see “Item 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of Part II thereof for additional information. 
We realized $1.2 billion of cancellation of debt income (“CODI”) in connection with our 2020 debt restructuring. As a result, $1.2 billion of our federal net operating losses were eliminated due to tax attribute reduction to offset the CODI. The loss of these attributes may adversely affect our cash flows and therefore our ability to service our indebtedness.
Narrative Description of Business
We are the world’s largest theatrical exhibition company and an industry leader in innovation and operational excellence. Over the course of our 100+ year history, we have pioneered many of the theatrical exhibition industry’s most important innovations. We introduced Multiplex theatres in the 1960s and the North American stadium-seated Megaplex theatre format in the 1990s. Most recently, we continued to innovate and evolve the movie-going experience with the deployment of our theatre renovations featuring plush, powered recliner seating and the launch of our U.S. subscription loyalty tier, AMC Stubs® A-List. Our growth has been driven by a combination of organic growth through reinvestment in our existing assets and through the acquisition of some of the most significant companies in the theatrical exhibition industry.
Our business is operated in two theatrical exhibition reportable segments, U.S. markets and International markets. Prior to 2016, we primarily operated in the United States. Our international operations are largely a result of our acquisition of Odeon and UCI Cinemas Holdings Limited (“Odeon”) in November of 2016 and Nordic Cinema Group Holding AB (“Nordic”) in March of 2017.


Today, AMC is the largest theatre operator in the world. As of December 31, 2022, we owned, leased or operated 940 theatres and 10,474 screens in 12 countries, including 586 theatres with a total of 7,648 screens in the United States and 354 theatres and 2,826 screens in European markets and Saudi Arabia. On January 24, 2023, we sold our investment in 13 theatres and 85 screens in Saudi Arabia, see Note 16—Subsequent Events in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Part II, Item 8 thereof, for further information. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we sold the remaining 51% equity interest in Estonia and Lithuania. As of December 31, 2022, we were the market leader in the United States and Europe including in Italy, Sweden, Norway, and Finland; and a leading theatre operator in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Spain, Portugal and Germany. We have operations in four of the world’s 10 largest economies, including four of the six largest European economies (the United Kingdom, Spain, Italy and Germany) as of December 31, 2022.


As of December 31, 2022, in the U.S. markets, we owned, leased or operated theatres in 43 states and the District of Columbia, with approximately 50% of the U.S. population living within 10 miles of one of our theatres. We have a diversified footprint with complementary global geographic and guest demographic profiles, which we believe gives our circuit a unique profile and offers us strategic and operational advantages while providing our studio partners with a large and diverse distribution channel. As of December 31, 2022, we operated some of the most productive theatres in the top markets in the United States and were the market leader in the top two markets: New York and Los Angeles. As of December 31, 2022, our top five markets, in each of which we held the #1 share position, are Los Angeles, New York, Chicago, Atlanta and Washington, D.C., according to data provided by Comscore.
As of December 31, 2022, in the International markets, we owned, leased or operated theatres in 10 European countries and in Saudi Arabia through Saudi Cinema Company, LLC, our joint venture with Saudi Entertainment Ventures. On January 24, 2023, we sold our investment in Saudi Cinema Company, LLC, see Note 16—Subsequent Events in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Part II, Item 8 thereof, for further information. In all of these 11 countries, we operate productive assets in each of the country’s capitals. Due to the population density in Europe, prior to the effects of COVID-19 pandemic, each screen served on average twice the population of a U.S. screen in a less populated market.

Our theatrical exhibition revenues are generated primarily from box office admissions and theatre food and beverage sales. We offer consumers a broad range of entertainment alternatives including traditional film programming, private theatre rentals, independent and foreign films, performing arts, music and sports. We also offer food and beverage alternatives beyond traditional concession items, including made-to-order meals, customized coffee, healthy snacks, beer, wine, premium cocktails, and dine-in theatre options. The balance of our revenues are generated from ancillary sources, including on-screen advertising, fees earned from our customer loyalty program, rental of theatre auditoriums, income from gift card and exchange ticket sales, and online ticketing fees.
Our Strategy
We are committed to maintaining a leadership position in the exhibition industry by focusing on forward-thinking initiatives for the benefit of our guests. We do this through a combination of unique marketing outreach, seamless digital technology and innovative theatre amenities designed to 1) transform AMC into a world-class leader in customer engagement, 2) deliver the best in-person experience while at AMC theatres, 3) selectively enhance our footprint through expansion in certain markets and strategic closure of underperforming theatres, 4) pursue adjacent opportunities that extend the AMC brand, and 5) explore attractive acquisitions leveraging our existing capabilities and core competencies. Consistent with our history and culture of innovation, we believe our vision and relentless focus on these key elements, which apply strategic and marketing components to traditional theatrical exhibition, will drive our future success.
As discussed above, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on our business. We have taken and continue to take steps to adapt our business strategy in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including adjusting our theatre operating hours in those markets where we are open to align screen availability and associated theatre operating costs with attendance levels for each theatre. We have also taken and continue to take significant steps to preserve cash by eliminating non-essential costs. Our capital allocation strategy will be driven by the cash generation of our business and will be contingent on maintaining adequate liquidity as well as a required return threshold. 

1) | Transform AMC into a World-Class Leader in Customer Engagement
---+---------------------------------------------------------------

AMC engages movie-goers through advances in technology and marketing activities to strengthen the bonds with our current guests and create new connections with potential customers that drive both growth and loyalty. AMC serves our guests, end-to-end, from before they enter our theatres, through their enjoyment of a comprehensive spectrum of film content while at our theatres and then again after the movie when they’ve left the theatre and are deciding what film to see the next time they visit.
In our U.S. markets, we begin the process of engagement with AMC Stubs®, our customer loyalty program, which allows members to earn rewards, receive discounts and participate in exclusive members-only offerings and services. It features a paid tier called AMC Stubs Premiere™ for a flat annual membership fee and a non-paid tier called AMC Stubs Insider™. Both programs reward loyal guests for their patronage of AMC theatres. Rewards earned are redeemable on future purchases at AMC locations. 
AMC Stubs® A-List is our monthly subscription-based tier of our AMC Stubs® loyalty program. This program offers guests admission to movies at AMC up to three times per week, including multiple movies per day and repeat visits to already seen movies from $19.95 to $24.95 per month depending upon the geographic market. AMC Stubs® A-List also includes premium offerings including IMAX®, Dolby Cinema™ at AMC, RealD, Prime and other proprietary PLF brands. AMC Stubs® A-List members can book tickets online in advance and select specific seats at AMC Theatres with reserved seating. 


As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 28,200,000 member households enrolled in AMC Stubs® A-List, AMC Stubs Premiere™ and AMC Stubs Insider™ programs on a combined basis. Our AMC Stubs® members represented approximately 43% of AMC’s U.S. market attendance during the year ended December 31, 2022. Our large database of identified movie-goers also provides us with additional insight into our customers’ movie preferences. This enables us to have an increasingly comprehensive, more personalized and targeted marketing effort. 

9




In our International markets, we currently have loyalty programs in the major territories in which we operate. Movie-goers can earn points for spending money at the theatre, and those points can be redeemed for tickets and concession items at a later date. We currently have more than 14,400,000 members in our various International loyalty programs. 
Our marketing efforts expand beyond our loyalty program. We continue to improve our customer connections through our website and mobile apps and expand our online and movie offerings. We upgraded our mobile applications across the U.S. circuit with the ability to order food and beverage offerings via our mobile applications while ordering tickets ahead of scheduled showtimes. 

In June 2021, the Company launched AMC Investor Connect (“AIC”), an innovative new communication initiative to engage directly with its sizable retail shareholder base and convert shareholders into AMC consumers. AIC allows AMC shareholders to self-identify through the AMC website and receive AMC special offers and important Company updates. As part of AIC, domestic members must sign up for an AMC Stubs account, which includes providing additional personalized data that allows AMC to more precisely engage with our investor consumers. As of February 23, 2023, there were 923,950 global self-identified AMC shareholder members of AIC, which is comprised of both registered and beneficial shareholders.

2) | Deliver the best in-person experience while at AMC theatres
---+------------------------------------------------------------

In conjunction with our advances in technology and marketing initiatives, and consistent with our long-term growth strategy, we plan to continue investing in our theatres and enhancing the consumer experience to deliver the best in-person experience and take greater advantage of incremental revenue-generating opportunities, primarily through comfort and convenience innovations, imaginative food and beverage initiatives, and exciting premium large format (“PLF”) offerings. 

Comfort and Convenience Innovations. Recliner seating is the key feature of our theatre renovations. We believe that maximizing comfort and convenience for our customers will be increasingly necessary to maintain and improve our relevance. These renovations, in conjunction with capital contributions from our landlords, involve stripping theatres to their basic structure in order to replace finishes throughout, upgrading the sight and sound experience, installing modernized points of sale and, most importantly, replacing traditional theatre seats with plush, electric recliners that allow customers to deploy a leg rest and fully recline at the push of a button. Upon reopening a remodeled theatre, we typically increase the ticket price to reflect the enhanced consumer experience. 
As of December 31, 2022, in our U.S. markets, we featured recliner seating in approximately 361 U.S. theatres, including Dine-in-Theatres, totaling approximately 3,503 screens and representing 45.8% of total U.S. screens. In our International markets, as of December 31, 2022, we had recliner seating in approximately 96 International theatres, totaling approximately 621 screens and representing 22.0% of total International screens. 
Open-source internet ticketing makes AMC’s entire universe of seats in the U.S. (approximately 1.0 million as of December 31, 2022), for all our show times, as available as possible, on as many websites and mobile applications as possible. Our tickets are currently on sale either directly or through mobile apps, at our own website and our mobile apps and other third-party ticketing vendors. For the year ended December 31, 2022, approximately 66% of our tickets were purchased online in the U.S., with approximately 81% of total online tickets being purchased through AMC.
Traditional payment sources are evolving rapidly around the globe as the use of cryptocurrencies become more popular and convenient. In response, during the fourth quarter of 2021, we introduced the ability for consumers to pay for tickets, food and beverage items and associated gifts cards with cryptocurrencies in the U.S. markets, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Dogecoin, Ripple, ShibaInu and Bitcoin Cash. The acceptance of cryptocurrency is designed to offer guests greater flexibility and convenience. These transactions all settle in U.S. Dollars. We did not hold any cryptocurrency during the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021.
Imaginative Food and Beverage Initiatives. Our deployment initiatives also apply to food and beverage enhancements. We have expanded our menu of enhanced food and beverage products to include meals, healthy snacks, premium beers, wine and mixed drinks, and other gourmet products. Our long-term growth strategy calls for investment across a spectrum of enhanced food and beverage formats, ranging from simple, less capital-intensive food and beverage design improvements to the development of new dine-in theatre options. We have expanded the capabilities of our online and mobile apps to include the ability to pre-order food and beverages when advanced tickets are purchased. 

10




Guests are able to order food and beverage items when buying tickets in advance and have the items ready upon arrival and available at dedicated pick-up areas or delivered to seat at select theatres.
Our MacGuffins Bar and Lounges (“MacGuffins”) give us an opportunity to engage our legal age customers. As of December 31, 2022, we offer alcohol in approximately 357 AMC theatres in the U.S. markets and 236 theatres in our International markets and continue to explore expansion globally.
Exciting Premium Large Format Offerings. PLF auditoriums generate our highest customer satisfaction scores, and we believe the investment in premium formats increases the value of the movie-going experience for our guests, ultimately leading to additional ticket revenue. To that end, we are committed to investing in and expanding our offerings of the best sight and sound experiences through a combination of our partnerships with IMAX® and Dolby Cinema™ and the further development of our own proprietary PLF offering, AMC Prime.

● | IMAX®. IMAX® is one of the world’s leading entertainment technology companies, specializing in motion picture technologies and presentations. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As of December 31, 2022, AMC was the largest IMAX® exhibitor in the U.S., with 186 (3D enabled) IMAX® screens and a 55% market share. Each one of our IMAX® local installations is protected by geographic exclusivity, and as of December 31, 2022, our IMAX® screen count was 96% greater than our closest competitor. Additionally, as of December 31, 2022, our per-screen grosses were 22% higher than our closest competition. We also operate 35 IMAX® screens in International markets. As part of our long-term growth strategy, we expect to continue to expand our IMAX® relationship across the U.S. and Europe, further strengthening our position as the largest IMAX® exhibitor in the U.S. and a leading IMAX® exhibitor in the United Kingdom and Europe. 

● | Dolby Cinema™. Dolby Cinema™ offers a premium cinema offering for movie-goers that combines state-of-the-art image and sound technologies with inspired theatre design and comfort. Dolby Cinema™ at AMC includes Dolby Vision™ laser projection and object-oriented Dolby Atmos® audio technology, as well as AMC’s plush power reclining seats with seat transducers that vibrate with the action on screen. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As of December 31, 2022, we operated 156 Dolby Cinema™ at AMC auditoriums in the U.S and nine Dolby Cinema™ Auditoriums in the International markets. We expect to expand the deployment of our innovative Dolby Cinema™ auditoriums in both our U.S. and International markets as part of our long-term growth strategy.


● | In-house PLF Brands. We also offer our private label PLF experience at many of our locations, with superior sight and sound technology and enhanced seating as contrasted with our traditional auditoriums. These proprietary PLF auditoriums offer an enhanced theatrical experience for movie-goers beyond our current core theatres, at a lower price premium than IMAX® or Dolby Cinema™. Therefore, it may be especially relevant in smaller or more price-sensitive markets. As of December 31, 2022, we operated 57 screens under proprietary PLF brand names in the U.S. markets and 83 screens in the International markets.

​
Laser at AMC. We launched Laser at AMC, a broadscale initiative to upgrade the projectors at 3,500 auditoriums throughout the United States, with cutting-edge laser projectors. The Laser at AMC experience delivered by laser projection from Cinionic provides guaranteed light levels that are at the top end of the 2D DCI specification. The technology improves image contrast, produces more vivid colors, and maximizes brightness, compared to digital projectors with a xenon light source. We are partnering with Cinionic, a global leader in laser-powered cinema solutions, 

11




through their Cinema-as-a-Service program which requires minimal upfront capital investment required by AMC. The initial agreement to install 3,500 projectors is expected to be completed by 2026. 
​

3) | Expand and Strategically Close Underperforming Theatres
---+--------------------------------------------------------

Our long-term growth strategy includes the deployment of our strategic growth initiatives, opening new-build theatres and continued exploration of small acquisitions. By expanding our platform through disciplined new-build theatres and acquisitions, we are able to further deploy our proven strategic initiatives while further diversifying our consumer base, leading to greater appeal for more films. The additional scale achieved through new-build theatres and acquisitions also serves to benefit AMC through global procurement savings and increased overhead efficiencies. We believe that expansion offers us additional opportunities to introduce our proven guest-focused strategies to movie-goers and will generate meaningful benefits to guests, employees, studio partners and our shareholders. 
The following table sets forth our historical information concerning new builds (including expansions), acquisitions and dispositions (including permanent closures of underperforming theatres and net construction closures) and end-of-period operated theatres and screens through December 31, 2022:

4) | Pursue Adjacent Opportunities that Extend the AMC Brand
---+--------------------------------------------------------

We believe there is considerable opportunity to extend and monetize the AMC brand outside of our movie theatre auditoriums. We plan to pursue opportunities that capitalize on our attractive customer base, our leading brand, our 100+ years of food and beverage expertise, and technology capabilities.
As part of that strategy, in the fourth quarter of 2021, we announced we would be expanding our food and beverage business beyond theatrical exhibition and enter the multi-billion dollar popcorn industry with the launch of AMC Theatres Perfectly Popcorn in the U.S. markets.

● | Beginning in 2023, we will offer prepackaged and ready-to-pop microwaveable AMC Theatres Perfectly Popcorn, which will become available for purchase in supermarkets and convenience stores around the country.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Freshly popped AMC Theatres Perfectly Popcorn is available through food delivery-to-home services. In this way, consumers will be able to enjoy a slice of the AMC experience when being entertained at home.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | “To Go” packages at our theatres of freshly popped popcorn for takeout and/or pickup.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

AMC Theatres Perfectly Popcorn is an opportunity to diversify our business and to create a new food and beverage revenue stream for the Company.
In early 2023, the Company will offer the AMC Entertainment Visa Credit Card. Credit card holders will have the opportunity to earn additional AMC Stubs reward points when they use their AMC Entertainment Visa Credit Card at the movies and on everyday purchases.

5) | Explore Attractive Acquisitions Leveraging Our Existing Capabilities and Core Competencies
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As part of our plans to pursue value-enhancing initiatives that lead to diversification of our business, we will consider attractive and opportunistic acquisitions inside and outside the Exhibition industry that leverage AMC’s footprint and capabilities as well as the core competencies and experiences of AMC’s management team.
​
Our Competitive Strengths
​
We believe we have the following competitive strengths:
Leading guest engagement through digital marketing and technology platforms. Through our AMC Stubs® loyalty program, we have developed a consumer database of some 28.2 million households, representing approximately 58 million individuals. Our digital marketing and technology platforms allow us to engage with these customers frequently, efficiently and on a very personalized level. We believe personalized data drives increased engagement, resulting in higher attendance.



Leading Market Share in Important, Affluent and Diverse Markets. As of December 31, 2022, across our three biggest metropolitan markets in the United States—New York, Los Angeles and Chicago, representing 19% of the country’s total box office—we held a 44% combined market share. We had theatres located in the top 25 U.S. markets, holding the #1 or #2 position in 18 of those 25 markets based on box office revenue. We are also the #1 theatre operator in Italy, Sweden, Norway, and Finland; the #2 operator in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Spain, and Portugal; and the #4 operator in Germany as of December 31, 2022. We believe our strong presence in these top markets makes our theatres highly visible and therefore strategically more important to content providers, who rely on the large audiences and marketing momentum provided by major markets to drive opinion-making and deliver a movie’s overall box office results.
We also have a diversified footprint with complementary global geographic and guest demographic profiles. We have theatres in more densely populated major metropolitan markets, where there is also a scarcity of attractive retail real estate opportunities, as well as complementary suburban and rural markets. Guests from different demographic and geographic profiles have different tastes in movies, and we believe by broadening our geographic base, we can help mitigate the impact of film genre volatility on our box office revenues.

Well Located, Highly Productive Theatres. Our theatres are generally located in the top retail centers across the United States. We believe this provides for long-term visibility and higher productivity and is a key element in the success of our enhanced food and beverage and more comfort and convenience initiatives. Our location strategy, combined with our strong major market presence, enable us to deliver industry-leading theatre-level productivity. During the year ended December 31, 2022, 8 of the 10 highest grossing theatres in the United States were AMC theatres, according to data provided by Comscore. During the same period, AMC’s U.S. markets average total revenues per theatre was approximately $5.1 million. This per unit productivity is important not only to content providers, but also to developers and landlords, for whom per location and per square foot sales numbers are critical measures.
AMC Classic theatres are located primarily in smaller, suburban and rural markets, which affects total revenues per theatre. However, in general, theatres located in smaller suburban and rural markets tend to have less competition and a lower cost structure.

In our International markets, many theatres are located in top retail centers in major metropolitan markets with high visibility. We believe that deploying our proven strategic initiatives in these markets will help drive attendance and greatly improve productivity. Other theatres are in larger and mid-sized cities and towns in affluent regions.
Deployment of unique pricing structures to enhance revenue. AMC has developed a dedicated pricing department and, as a result, we have deployed several different strategic pricing structures that have increased revenue and profitability. 
In June 2018, we launched AMC Stubs® A-List, a subscription pricing structure that offers members three movies a week, including premium formats, for a monthly fee ranging from $19.95 to $24.95 depending on geographical location. Around the same time, we launched “Discount Tuesday” which offers AMC Stubs® members a reduced price for movie attendance on Tuesdays. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the results showed an incremental increase in attendance and corresponding increase in admissions and food and beverage revenue.

Sources of Revenue
Box Office Admissions and Film Content. Box office admissions are our largest source of revenue. We predominantly license theatrical films from distributors owned by major film production companies and from independent distributors on a film-by-film and theatre-by-theatre basis. Film exhibition costs are based on a share of admissions revenues and are accrued based on estimates of the final settlement pursuant to our film licenses. These licenses typically state that rental fees are based on the box office performance of each film, though in certain circumstances and less frequently, our rental fees are based on a mutually agreed settlement rate that is fixed. In some European territories, film rental fees are established on a weekly basis and some licenses use a per capita agreement instead of a revenue share, paying a flat amount per ticket. 
The North American and International industry box office have been significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, film distributors have postponed new film theatrical releases and/or shortened or disregarded the period of theatrical exclusivity (the “window”) and reduced the number of theatrically released motion pictures. Theatrical releases may continue to be postponed and windows shortened or disregarded while the box office suffers from COVID-19 impacts. As a result of the reduction in theatrical film releases, we have licensed and exhibited a larger number of previously released films that have lower film rental terms. We have made adjustments to theatre operating hours to align screen availability and associated theatre operating costs with attendance levels for each theatre.

As we continue our recovery from the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, AMC’s admissions revenues and attendance levels remain significantly behind pre-pandemic levels. Admissions revenues for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were $2.2 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively, compared to $3.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, attendance was 201.0 million patrons and 128.5 million patrons, respectively, compared to 356.4 million patrons for the year ended December 31, 2019. 


During the year ended December 31, 2022, films licensed from our seven largest movie studio distributors based on revenues accounted for approximately 88% of our U.S. admissions revenues, which consisted of Universal, Disney, Paramount, Warner Bros., Sony, 20th Century Studios, and Lionsgate. In Europe, approximately 73% of our box office revenue came from films attributed to our four largest movie distributor groups; which consisted of Disney, Universal, Warner Bros, and Paramount. Our revenues attributable to individual distributors may vary significantly from year to year depending upon the commercial success of each distributor’s films in any given year.
Food and Beverage. Food and beverage sales are our second largest source of revenue after box office admissions. We offer enhanced food and beverage products that include meals, healthy snacks, premium liquor, beer and wine options, and other gourmet products. Our long-term growth strategy calls for investment across a spectrum of enhanced food and beverage formats, ranging from simple, less capital-intensive food and beverage menu improvements to the expansion of our Dine-In Theatre brand. 
We currently operate 49 Dine-In Theatres in the U.S. and three Dine-In Theatres in Europe that deliver chef-inspired menus with seat-side or delivery service to luxury recliners with tables. Our recent Dine-In Theatre concepts are designed to capitalize on the latest food service trend, the fast and casual eating experience.
Our MacGuffins Bar and Lounges (“MacGuffins”) give us an opportunity to engage our legal age customers. As of December 31, 2022, we offer alcohol in approximately 357 AMC theatres in the U.S. markets and 236 theatres in our International markets and continue to explore expansion globally.
Theatrical Exhibition Industry and Competition
U.S. markets. In the United States, the movie exhibition business is large and mature. While in any given calendar quarter the quantity and quality of movies can drive volatile results, box office revenues have generally advanced from 2011 to 2019. The industry’s best year ever, in terms of revenues, was 2018, with box office revenues of approximately $11.9 billion, an increase of approximately 7.1% from 2017, with 1.3 billion admissions in the U.S. and Canada. 

We believe it is the quality of the movie-going experience that will define future success. Whether through enhanced food and beverage options (Food and Beverage Kiosks, Marketplaces, Coca-Cola Freestyle, MacGuffins or Dine-in Theatres), more comfort and convenience (recliner seating, open-source internet ticketing, reserved seating), engagement and loyalty (AMC Stubs®, mobile apps, social media) or sight and sound (digital and laser projection, 3D, 

14




Dolby Cinema™ at AMC, IMAX® or other PLF screens), it is the ease of use and the amenities that these innovations bring to customers that we believe will drive sustained profitability in the years ahead. 
The following table represents information about the U.S./Canada exhibition industry obtained from the National Association of Theatre Owners, with the exception of box office revenues for calendar years 2022 and 2021 obtained from Comscore. See Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under Part II, Item 7 thereof for information regarding our operating data:

2014 | ​ | | 10,400 | | 1,270 | ​ | | 8.19 | ​
2013 | ​ | | 10,920 | | 1,340 | ​ | | 8.15 | ​

Based on information obtained from Comscore, we believe that the three largest exhibitors, in terms of U.S./Canada box office revenue (AMC, Regal Entertainment Group, and Cinemark Holdings, Inc.) generated approximately 54% of the box office revenues in 2022. 


International markets. Movie-going is a popular leisure activity with high penetration across key geographies in our International markets. Theatre appeal has proven resilient to competition for consumers’ leisure spending and to recessionary periods and we believe we will continue to benefit from increased spending across International markets. The European market lags the U.S. market across a number of factors, including annual spend per customer, number of IMAX® screens and screens per capita, which causes us to believe that the deployment of our customer initiatives will be successful in these markets. On the other hand, our European markets are more densely populated and operate with fewer screens per one million of population, making the screens we acquired more valuable.

Additionally, U.S. films generate the majority of the box office in Europe, but movie-goers in specific geographies also welcome locally produced films with local actors and familiar story lines which can mitigate film genre attendance fluctuations. Going forward, we believe we will see positive growth in theatre attendance as we continue to deploy our proven guest-centered innovations like recliner seating, enhanced food and beverage offerings, and premium large format experiences. Like the United States, the international industry box office suffered from months of theatre closures, significantly fewer new films and reopening restrictions and generated far fewer sales than 2019.

Competition. Our theatres are subject to varying degrees of competition in the geographic areas in which they operate. Competition is often intense with respect to attracting patrons, licensing motion pictures and finding new theatre sites. Where real estate is readily available, it is easier to open a theatre near one of our theatres, which may adversely affect operations at our theatre. However, in certain of our densely populated major metropolitan markets, we believe a scarcity of attractive retail real estate opportunities enhances the strategic value of our existing theatres. We also believe the complexity inherent in operating in these major metropolitan markets is a deterrent to other less sophisticated competitors, protecting our market share position.
The theatrical exhibition industry faces competition from other forms of out-of-home entertainment, such as concerts, amusement parks and sporting events, and from other distribution channels for filmed entertainment, such as cable television, pay-per-view, video streaming services, PVOD, and home video systems, as well as from all other forms of entertainment.
We believe movie-going is a compelling consumer out-of-home entertainment experience. Movie theatres currently garner a relatively small share of overall consumer entertainment time and spend, and our industry benefits from available capacity to satisfy additional consumer demand without capital investment.
Seasonality
Our revenues are dependent upon the timing of motion picture releases by distributors. The most marketable motion pictures are usually released during the summer and the year-end holiday seasons. Therefore, our business is seasonal, with higher attendance and revenues generally occurring during the summer months and holiday seasons.
Regulatory Environment
Our theatres in the United States must comply with Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act, or ADA. Compliance with the ADA requires that public accommodations, including websites and mobile apps for such accommodations, be accessible to individuals with disabilities and that new construction or alterations are made to conform to accessibility guidelines. Non-compliance with the ADA could result in the imposition of injunctive relief, fines, and awards of damages to private litigants and additional capital expenditures to remedy such noncompliance. As an employer covered by the ADA, we must make reasonable accommodations to the limitations of employees and qualified applicants with disabilities, provided that such reasonable accommodations do not pose an undue hardship on the operation of our business. In addition, many of our employees are covered by various government employment regulations, including minimum wage, overtime and working conditions regulations. In Europe, all territories have similar national regulations relating to disabilities.
Our operations also are subject to federal, state and local laws regulating such matters as construction, renovation and operation of theatres as well as wages and working conditions, citizenship, health and sanitation requirements, consumer and employee privacy rights, and licensing, including alcoholic beverage sales. We believe our theatres are in material compliance with such requirements.
We own and operate theatres and other properties in the United States, United Kingdom, Spain, Italy, Germany, Portugal, Ireland, Sweden, Finland, Norway, and Denmark, which are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations. Certain of these laws and regulations, including those relating to environmental protection, may impose joint and several liability on certain statutory classes of persons for the costs of investigation or remediation of contamination, regardless of fault or the legality of original disposal. We believe our theatres are in material compliance with such requirements.
AMC Human Capital Resources
​
Our People. AMC associates are core to our commitment to delivering the best theatrical experience in the world. They uphold AMC’s mission of focusing on the guest experience in our theatres, an experience in which excellent customer service is complemented with amazing food and beverage, comfort and premium sight and sound.
COVID-19 Pandemic Impacts. The pandemic has had enormous impacts on our industry, guests and associates and has resulted in material variances in our associate metrics in calendar 2022 compared to the 2019 pre-COVID-19 years. As of December 31, 2022, we employed a total of 33,694 employees, including part-time employees, consisting of 2,787 full-time and 30,907 part-time employees, up from an aggregate of 31,198 employees, including part-time and furloughed employees, consisting of 3,046 full-time and 28,152 part-time employees as of December 31, 

16




2021, and down from an aggregate of 38,872 employees consisting of 3,952 full-time and 34,920 part-time employees as of December 31, 2019. 
Talent Acquisition, Development and Retention. Critical to our operations is the hiring, developing and retaining of associates who support our guest-focused mission in our theatres. Acquiring the right talent at speed and scale is a core capability that we regularly monitor and manage, given the need to rapidly staff our frontline operations. Once hired, we focus on the development of our associates, creating experiences and programs that promote performance, growth and career opportunities for those who are life-long passionate about our business. We sponsor numerous training, education and leadership development programs for associates at all levels, from hourly associates to executive officers. These programs are designed to enhance leadership and managerial capability, facilitate quality execution of our programs, drive guest satisfaction and increase return on investment. 
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion. Our goal is to create a workforce as diverse as the guests we serve and the movies we show on our screens. As such, Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (“DEI”) are fundamental to our culture and critical to our success. In support of this goal, AMC established four councils in support of Women, Latinx, African American and LGBTQ+ associates. The purpose of these councils is to strengthen AMC’s culture by defining opportunities to embrace our diversity, lead with fairness and impartiality and create a more inclusive work environment by leveraging associate experiences. These councils are supported by the DEI function under the guidance of the Chief Human Resources Officer. This DEI focus ensures that all communities are represented in our long-term systemic approach. Our work has been recognized externally: AMC has received a perfect score for 14 consecutive years on the Human Rights Campaign Foundation’s Corporate Equality Index as one of the “Best Places to Work for LGBTQ Equality”; eight consecutive years as one of the “Best Places to Work” for people with disabilities on the Disability Equality Index; and five consecutive years as one of Forbes “Best Employers for Diversity.”
Compensation, Benefits, Safety and Wellness. In addition to offering market competitive salaries and wages, we offer comprehensive health and retirement benefits to eligible employees. Our health and welfare benefits are supplemented with specific programs to manage or improve common health conditions, a variety of voluntary benefits and paid time away from work programs. We also provide a number of innovative programs designed to promote physical, emotional and financial well-being. Our commitment to the safety and health of our associates continues to be a top priority.
