Yum China Holdings, Inc. (referred to herein as “Yum China” and, together with its subsidiaries the “Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our”) was incorporated in Delaware on April 1, 2016. The Company’s U.S. office is located at 7100 Corporate Drive, Plano, Texas, 75024, which carries on the key book-keeping, record-keeping and day-to-day management functions of the holding company, and the telephone number at that location is (972) 338-7530. The Company’s operational headquarters is located at Yum China Building, 20 Tian Yao Qiao Road, Shanghai, 200030, People’s Republic of China (the “PRC” or “China”), where its senior management team is based. Our website address is http://www.yumchina.com. The reference to the Company’s website address is for informational purposes only, does not constitute incorporation by reference of the information contained on the website and should not be considered part of this Form 10-K.
 
“U.S. dollars”, “$” or “US$” refers to the legal currency of the United States, and “RMB” or “Renminbi” refers to the legal currency of China. 
 
References to “our” or “the Company’s” restaurants or restaurant system include references to restaurants owned or franchised by us.
 
Spin-off Transaction
 
The Company separated from Yum! Brands, Inc. (“YUM” or the “Parent”) on October 31, 2016 (the “separation”), becoming an independent, publicly traded company as a result of a pro rata distribution (the “distribution”) of all outstanding shares of Yum China common stock to shareholders of YUM. On October 31, 2016, YUM’s shareholders of record as of 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time on October 19, 2016 received one share of Yum China common stock for every one share of YUM common stock held as of the record date. Common stock of Yum China began trading “regular way” under the ticker symbol “YUMC” on the New York Stock Exchange on November 1, 2016.
 
In connection with the separation of the Company from YUM, Yum! Restaurants Asia Pte. Ltd. (“YRAPL”), a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of YUM, and Yum Restaurants Consulting (Shanghai) Company Limited (“YCCL”), a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of Yum China, entered into a 50-year master license agreement with automatic renewals for additional consecutive renewal terms of 50 years each, subject only to YCCL being in “good standing” and unless YCCL gives notice of its intent not to renew, for the exclusive right to use and sublicense the use of intellectual property owned by YUM and its subsidiaries for the development, promotion and operation of the KFC, Pizza Hut and, subject to achieving certain agreed upon milestones, Taco Bell brands and their related marks and other intellectual property rights for restaurant services in the PRC, excluding Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macau. In exchange, we pay a license fee to YUM equal to 3% of net system sales from both our Company and franchise restaurants. We own the intellectual property of East Dawning, Little Sheep and COFFii & JOY and pay no license fee related to these concepts.
 
The KFC, Pizza Hut, East Dawning, Little Sheep, Taco Bell and COFFii & JOY brands are collectively referred to as the “brands” or “concepts”. Throughout this Form 10-K, the terms “brands” and “concepts” are used interchangeably and “restaurants,” “stores” and “units” are used interchangeably.

General
 
We are the largest restaurant company in China, with over 8,400 restaurants as of year-end 2018 and $8.4 billion of revenues. Our growing restaurant base consists of China’s leading restaurant concepts, including KFC and Pizza Hut brands, as well as brands such as East Dawning, Little Sheep, Taco Bell and COFFii & JOY. We have the exclusive right to operate and sublicense the KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell brands in China (excluding Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macau), and own the intellectual property of the East Dawning, Little Sheep and COFFii & JOY concepts outright. We were the first major global restaurant brand to enter China in 1987 and we have developed deep operating experience in the market. We have since grown to become one of China’s largest restaurant developers covering over 1,200 cities as of December 31, 2018.
 
As of December 31, 2018, we owned and operated approximately 90% of our restaurants. Franchisees contribute to our revenues on an ongoing basis through the payment of royalties based on a percentage of sales. 
 
Restaurant Concepts
 
Most restaurants in each concept offer consumers the ability to dine in and carry out food. In addition, most restaurants in the KFC, Pizza Hut, East Dawning, Taco Bell and COFFii & JOY concepts offer delivery service. 
 
Each concept has proprietary menu items, many developed in China, and emphasizes the preparation of food with high quality ingredients, as well as unique recipes and special seasonings to provide appealing, tasty and convenient food at competitive prices.
 
We have also made investments in delivery outside our concepts, including via the acquisition of a controlling interest in the holding company of DAOJIA.com.cn (“Daojia”), an established online food delivery service provider.
 
Following is a brief description of each concept:
 
KFC
 
KFC is the leading quick-service restaurant (“QSR”) brand in China in terms of system sales and number of restaurants. Founded in Corbin, Kentucky by Colonel Harland D. Sanders in 1939, KFC opened its first restaurant in Beijing, China in 1987. As of December 31, 2018, there were over 5,900 KFC restaurants in over 1,200 cities across China, and KFC continues to grow in both large and small cities. In addition to Original Recipe chicken, KFC in China has an extensive menu featuring pork, seafood, rice dishes, fresh vegetables, soups, congee, desserts and many other products, including premium coffee. The KFC brand is also seeking to increase revenues from its restaurants throughout the day with breakfast, delivery and 24-hour operations in many of its locations. Measured by number of restaurants, we believe KFC has a two-to-one lead over the nearest Western QSR competitor in China.
Pizza Hut
 
Pizza Hut is the leading casual dining restaurant (“CDR”) brand in China, as measured by system sales and number of restaurants, operating in over 500 cities as of December 31, 2018 and offering multiple dayparts, including breakfast, lunch and afternoon tea. Since operating its first China location in Beijing in 1990, Pizza Hut has grown rapidly and, as of year-end 2018, there were over 2,200 Pizza Hut restaurants across China. Pizza Hut has an extensive menu offering a broad variety of pizzas, entrees, pasta, rice dishes, appetizers, beverages and desserts. Measured by number of restaurants, we believe Pizza Hut has a four-to-one lead over its nearest competitor in China.

Other Concepts 
 
Little Sheep. A casual dining brand with its roots in Inner Mongolia, China, Little Sheep specializes in “Hot Pot” cooking, which is very popular in China, particularly during the winter months. Little Sheep had over 300 units in both China and international markets as of December 31, 2018. Of these, over 280 units were franchised.
East Dawning. East Dawning is a Chinese food QSR brand located predominantly in bustling transportation hubs. There were 14 units as of year-end 2018. 
 
Taco Bell. Taco Bell is the world’s leading QSR brand specializing in Mexican-style food, including tacos, burritos, quesadillas, salads, nachos and similar items. The Company opened its first Taco Bell restaurant in Shanghai, China, in December 2016. As of December 31, 2018, there were four Taco Bell units in China.
 
COFFii & JOY. COFFii & JOY is a coffee concept recently developed by the Company in 2018, featuring specialty coffee. As of December 31, 2018, there were 13 COFFii & JOY units in China. 
 
Our Strategies
 
The Company’s primary strategy is to grow sales and profits across its portfolio of brands through increased brand relevance, new store development and enhanced unit economics. Other areas of investment include store remodels, product innovation and quality, improved operating platforms leading to improved service, store-level human resources including recruiting and training, creative marketing programs and product testing.
 
New-Unit Growth
 
Rapidly growing consumer class. Given the rapidly expanding middle class, we believe that there is significant opportunity to expand within China, and we intend to focus our efforts on increasing our geographic footprint in both existing and new markets. We expanded our restaurant count from 6,243 units in 2013 to 8,484 units as of year-end 2018, representing a compounded annual growth rate (“CAGR”) of 6%.
 
Development pipeline. We consider our development pipeline to be robust, and believe we have an opportunity to grow to three times of our base restaurant count in 2016 over the next two to three decades. We are also keen on exploring various new store formats to support further store expansion, including different store designs or service models aimed at addressing the needs of different customers and occasions. For additional information on the risks associated with this growth strategy, see the section entitled “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” including the risk factor entitled “We may not attain our target development goals; aggressive development could cannibalize existing sales; and new restaurants may not be profitable.” 
 
Franchise opportunity. As of December 31, 2018, approximately 10% of our restaurants were operated by franchisees. We anticipate high franchisee demand for our brands, supported by strong unit economics, operational consistency and simplicity, and multiple store formats to drive restaurant growth. While the franchise market in China is still in its early stages compared to developed markets, the Company plans to continue to develop its franchisee-owned store portfolio over time.

Same-Store Sales Growth
 
Food innovation. We are keenly aware of the strength of our core menu items but we also seek to continue to introduce innovative items to meet evolving consumer preferences and local tastes, while simultaneously maintaining brand relevance and broadening brand appeal. In 2018, KFC launched Crayfish Burger, Spicy Single Bone Chicken and Super Taco as part of its Limited Time Offerings. Additionally, KFC added Chinese pancakes and an upgraded panini to its breakfast line, while launching a variety of new ice cream flavors (such as Moosang Durian and Okinawa Sea Salt). For Pizza Hut, we also launched new products such as Italian handcraft pizza, curry beef sauce omurice, salted egg yolk ice cream, and “dirty series” drinks and desserts.
 
Value innovation. KFC plans to continue to focus on value with product offerings such as the bucket and increased combo options throughout the day. In 2018, KFC launched Crazy Thursday, which offers core products at attractive prices on Thursdays to all customers. In addition, Pizza Hut launched multiple value campaigns, such as “Everyday 1 RMB” and “Scream Wednesday” for loyalty program members. “Scream Wednesday” also offers core products at attractive prices, including pizzas, steak and dessert options, and received positive consumer feedback.
 
Daypart opportunities. We believe there are significant daypart opportunities across our brands. For example, KFC introduced premium coffee to expand its breakfast and afternoon dayparts, and Pizza Hut has focused on breakfast and business lunch to further grow same-store sales. 
 
Best in-store experience. The Company continuously looks for ways to improve the customer experience. For example, with continued investment in refurbishing our restaurants, over 80% of KFC’s store portfolio as of December 31, 2018 was remodeled or built in the past five years. Pizza Hut is also well-regarded for offering consumers a contemporary casual dining setting. Our brands also look to improve efficiency to drive sales growth. For example, we have simplified menus and fine-tuned our digital menu boards and in-store self-service order devices. We are also expanding our delivery business through our own smartphone applications, increased collaboration with O2O (Online to Offline) firms (known as aggregators), and pre-order services.
 
Digital. KFC rolled out its loyalty program in 2015 to enable customers with a fully digitized experience. The brand also plans to improve the customer experience through ease of ordering and speed of service, supported by innovative technology. Pizza Hut launched its loyalty program in late 2016, a smartphone application (Super App) in July 2017 and table-side ordering in 2018, which enables customers to order by scanning a QR code with their mobile phone, queue ticketing, and mobile payments. As of December 31, 2018, our loyalty programs had over 160 million members and over 50 million members for KFC and Pizza Hut, respectively, and 81% of payments were made through digital form in 2018, which primarily includes mobile applications and aggregators’ platforms. In addition, one of our key digital initiatives in 2018 is the launch of a privilege membership program. KFC launched its privilege membership program in July 2018, which offers privilege members benefits, such as free delivery and discounts on coffee or breakfast items, over the membership period. Initial results indicate that the program has been effective in increasing order frequency and customer loyalty. Pizza Hut also launched a similar family privilege membership program in the fourth quarter of 2018.
Delivery. China is a world leader in the emerging O2O market. This is where digital online ordering technologies interact with traditional brick and mortar retail to enhance the shopping experience. We see considerable growth potential in the in-home consumption market by aligning our proven restaurant operation capabilities with emerging specialized O2O firms, or aggregators, that offer consumers the ability to order restaurant food at home. Pizza Hut and KFC started partnering with aggregators in 2015. These aggregators include our restaurants in their mobile or online platforms and we generate revenue when orders placed through their platforms are delivered to the customers. We pay a commission typically based on a percentage of sales that are processed through the platform.

 2018 Form 10-K


In 2018, we used our own dedicated riders to deliver orders placed through aggregators’ platforms to customers of KFC and certain Pizza Hut stores. For the remaining of Pizza Hut orders in 2018, we paid an additional commission for the delivery services provided by aggregators. 
 
For orders that are placed through third-party platforms, customers make payments to the aggregators through either mobile payment applications, such as WeChat and Alipay, which are managed by third-party payment processors, or cash upon delivery. For transactions with payments collected by the aggregators from customers, the aggregators settle the amount with third-party payment processors and remit the proceeds to the restaurants generally within a few business days. In 2018, approximately 14% of KFC Company sales were generated from delivery. For Pizza Hut, we continue to work closely with aggregators as well as focus on increasing orders through our own mobile or online platforms and increasing the proportion of orders that are delivered by our dedicated riders, which we believe will give us greater control over delivery quality and improve our ability to make timely deliveries during peak hours. In 2018, delivery sales accounted for approximately 23% of Pizza Hut Company sales. We believe delivery continues to be a business opportunity with potential for further growth. 
 
Enhanced Profitability
 
We focus on improving our unit-level economics and overall profits while also making the necessary investments to support our future growth. Our digital initiatives, such as rolling out pre-order services, have allowed us to optimize staff scheduling, increase operation efficiency and reduce wastage. We plan to pursue additional opportunities to improve profits over the long term by continuing our focus on fiscal discipline and leveraging fixed costs, while maintaining the quality customer experience for which our brands are known.
Franchise and New Business Development
 
The Company’s franchise programs are designed to promote consistency and quality, and the Company is selective in granting franchisees. Franchisees supply capital – initially by paying a franchise fee to the Company and by purchasing or leasing the land use right, building, equipment, signs, seating, inventories and supplies; and, over the longer term, by reinvesting in the business through expansion. As of December 31, 2018, franchisees owned and operated about 10% of our restaurants. Franchisees contribute to the Company’s revenues through the payment of upfront fees and on-going royalties based on a percentage of sales and the payment for other transactions with the Company, such as purchases of food and paper products, advertising services and other services.
 
The Company believes that it is important to maintain strong and open relationships with its franchisees and their representatives. To this end, the Company invests a significant amount of time working with the franchisees and their representative organizations on key aspects of the business, including products, equipment, operational improvements and standards and management techniques.
 
Unconsolidated Affiliates
 
In the first quarter of 2018, the Company completed the acquisition of an additional 36% equity interest in an unconsolidated affiliate that operates KFC stores in Wuxi, China (“Wuxi KFC”), increasing the equity interest to 83%, and began consolidating Wuxi KFC upon the completion of acquisition.
 
As of year-end 2018, approximately 10% of our system wide restaurants were operated by unconsolidated affiliates. All of these restaurants were KFC restaurants, or approximately 14% of total KFC restaurants as of year-end 2018. These unconsolidated affiliates are Chinese joint venture entities partially owned by the Company, which helped KFC establish its initial presence in certain regions of China.

 2018 Form 10-K


Restaurant Operations
 
Restaurant management structure varies among our brands and by unit size. Generally, each restaurant operated by the Company is led by a Restaurant General Manager (“RGM”), together with one or more Assistant Managers. RGMs are skilled and highly trained, with most having a college-level education. Each brand issues detailed manuals, which may then be customized to meet local regulations and customs. These manuals set forth standards and requirements for all aspects of restaurant operations, including food safety and quality, food handling and product preparation procedures, equipment maintenance, facility standards and accounting control procedures. The restaurant management teams are responsible for the day-to-day operation of each unit and for ensuring compliance with operating standards. The performance of RGMs is regularly monitored and coached by Area Managers. In addition, senior operations leaders regularly visit restaurants to promote adherence to system standards and mentor restaurant teams.
Supply and Distribution
 
The Company’s restaurants, including those operated by franchisees, are substantial purchasers of a number of food and paper products, equipment and other restaurant supplies. The principal items purchased include chicken, cheese, beef and pork products and paper and packaging materials. The Company has not experienced any significant, continuous shortages of supplies, and alternative sources for most of these products are generally available. Prices paid for these supplies fluctuate. When prices increase, the brands may attempt to pass on such increases to their customers, although there is no assurance that this can be done practically.
 
The Company partners with over 800 independent suppliers, mostly China-based, providing a wide range of products. The Company, along with multiple independently owned and operated distributors, utilizes 20 logistics centers and three consolidation centers to distribute restaurant products to Company-owned and franchised stores. The Company also owns a seasoning facility in Inner Mongolia, which supplies products to the Little Sheep business, as well as to third-party customers.
 
Prior to August 2016, all restaurants that operated the Company’s concepts, including those owned by franchisees and unconsolidated affiliates, entered into purchase agreements with each of our approved third-party suppliers for raw materials with agreed pricing guidelines applicable to all entities. To improve efficiency and effectiveness of the procurement process, in August 2016, the Company adopted a central procurement model whereby the Company centrally purchases substantially all food and paper products from approved suppliers for most of the restaurants regardless of ownership and then onward sells and delivers them to most of the entities, including franchisees and unconsolidated affiliates, that operate the Company’s restaurants. The Company believes this central procurement model allows the Company to maintain quality control and achieves better prices and terms through volume purchases. Under the central procurement model, the materials purchased from various suppliers are generally intended to be sold on a cost-plus basis. 
 
Food safety is the top priority at the Company. Food safety systems include rigorous standards and training of employees in our restaurants and distribution system, as well as requirements for suppliers. These standards and training topics include, but are not limited to, employee health, product handling, ingredient and product temperature management and prevention of cross contamination. Food safety training is focused on illness prevention, food safety and regulation adherence in day-to-day operations. Our standards also promote compliance with applicable laws and regulations when building new or renovating existing restaurants. For further information on food safety issues, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—Food safety and food-borne illness concerns may have an adverse effect on our reputation and business”.

Trademarks and Patents
 
The Company’s use of certain material trademarks and service marks is governed by a master license agreement between YRAPL and YCCL. Pursuant to the master license agreement, the Company is the exclusive licensee of the KFC, Pizza Hut and, subject to achieving certain agreed upon milestones, Taco Bell brands and their related marks and other intellectual property rights for restaurant services in the PRC, excluding Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macau. The term of the license is 50 years with automatic renewals for additional consecutive renewal terms of 50 years each, subject only to YCCL being in “good standing” and unless YCCL gives notice of its intent not to renew. In exchange, we pay a license fee to YUM equal to 3% of net system sales.
 
The Company’s use of certain other material intellectual property (including intellectual property in product recipes, restaurant operation and restaurant design) is likewise governed by the master license agreement with YRAPL.
 
The Company owns registered trademarks and service marks relating to the East Dawning, Little Sheep and COFFii & JOY brands. Collectively, these licensed and owned marks have significant value and are important to the Company’s business. The Company’s policy is to pursue registration of our important intellectual property rights whenever feasible and to oppose vigorously any infringement of our rights.
 
Working Capital
 
Information about the Company’s working capital is included in MD&A in Part II, Item 7. and the Consolidated and Combined Statements of Cash Flows in Part II, Item 8.
Seasonality
 
Due to the nature of our operations, the Company typically generates higher sales during Chinese festivities, holiday seasons as well as summer months, but relatively lower sales and lower operating profit during the second and fourth quarters. 
Competition
 
Data from the National Bureau of Statistics of China indicates that sales in the consumer food service market in China totaled approximately $650 billion in 2018. Industry conditions vary by region, with local Chinese restaurants and Western chains present, but the Company possesses the largest market share (as measured by both units and system sales). While branded QSR units per million population in China are well below that of the United States, competition in China is increasing and the Company still competes with respect to food taste, quality, value, service, convenience, restaurant location and concept. The restaurant business is often affected by changes in consumer tastes; national, regional or local economic conditions; demographic trends; traffic patterns; the type, number and location of competing restaurants; and disposable income. The Company competes not only for consumers but also for management and hourly personnel and suitable real estate sites. Among KFC’s primary competitors in China are restaurant chains such as McDonald’s and Dicos. Pizza Hut primarily competes with western pizza brands, including Domino’s and Papa John’s, as well as pizza brands developed in China. 
Research and Development
 
In January 2019, the Company opened an innovation center in Shanghai, China to promote product innovation. From time to time, the Company also works with independent suppliers to conduct research and development activities for the benefit of the Company. While the Company believes research and development activities and new product innovation are critical factors to our success, these expenditures were not material for each of 2018, 2017 and 2016.

 2018 Form 10-K


Government Regulation
 
The Company is subject to various laws affecting its business, including laws and regulations concerning information security, labor, health, sanitation and safety. Each of the concepts’ restaurants must comply with licensing and regulation by a number of governmental authorities, which include restaurant operation, health, sanitation, food safety, environmental protection and fire agencies in the province and/or municipality in which the restaurant is located. The Company has not historically been materially adversely affected by such licensing and regulation or by any difficulty, delay or failure to obtain required licenses or approvals. The Company is also subject to tariffs and regulations on imported commodities and equipment and laws regulating foreign investment, as well as anti-bribery and corruption laws. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for a discussion of risks relating to federal, state, provincial, local and international governmental regulation of our business.
Regulations Relating to Dividend Distribution
 
The Chinese laws, rules and regulations applicable to our China subsidiaries permit payments of dividends only out of their accumulated profits, if any, determined in accordance with applicable accounting standards and regulations. In addition, under Chinese law, an enterprise incorporated in China is required to set aside at least 10% of its after-tax profits each year, after making up previous years’ accumulated losses, if any, to fund certain statutory reserve funds, until the aggregate amount of such a fund reaches 50% of its registered capital. As a result, our China subsidiaries are restricted in their ability to transfer a portion of their net assets to us in the form of dividends. At the discretion of their board of directors, as enterprises incorporated in China, our China subsidiaries may allocate a portion of their after-tax profits based on China accounting standards to staff welfare and bonus funds. These reserve funds and staff welfare and bonus funds are not distributable as cash dividends.
Regulations Relating to Taxation
 
Enterprise Income Tax. Under the China Enterprise Income Tax Law (the “EIT Law”) and its implementation rules, a China resident enterprise is subject to Chinese enterprise income tax in respect of its net taxable income derived from sources inside and outside China. The term “resident enterprise” refers to any enterprise established in China and any enterprise established outside China with a “de facto management body” within China.
 
Our China subsidiaries are regarded as China resident enterprises by virtue of their incorporation in China, and are generally subject to Chinese enterprise income tax on their worldwide income at the current uniform rate of 25%, unless reduced under certain specific qualifying criteria. Our China subsidiaries may deduct reasonable expenses that are actually incurred and are related to the generation of their income, including interest and other borrowing expenses, amortization of land use rights and depreciation of buildings and certain fixed assets, subject to any restrictions that may be imposed under the EIT Law, its implementation regulations and any applicable tax notices and circulars issued by the Chinese government or tax authorities.
 
Yum China and each subsidiary of Yum China that is organized outside of China intends to conduct its management functions in a manner that does not cause it to be a China resident enterprise, including by carrying on its day-to-day management activities and maintaining its key records, such as resolutions of its board of directors and resolutions of stockholders, outside of China. As such, we do not believe that Yum China or any of its non-Chinese subsidiaries should be considered a China resident enterprise for purposes of the EIT Law, and should not be subject to Chinese enterprise income tax on that basis. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Doing Business in China—Under the EIT Law, if we are classified as a China resident enterprise for Chinese enterprise income tax purposes, such classification would likely result in unfavorable tax consequences to us and our non-Chinese stockholders.”

 2018 Form 10-K


Value-Added Tax / Business Tax and Local Surcharges. Effective on May 1, 2016, a 6% value-added tax (“VAT”) on output replaced the 5% business tax (“BT”) that has historically been applied to certain restaurant sales under the China Provisional Regulations on Business Tax. Pursuant to Circular Caishui [2016] No. 36 jointly issued by the Ministry of Finance and the State Administration of Taxation (“SAT”), beginning May 1, 2016, any entity engaged in the provision of catering services in China is generally required to pay VAT at the rate of 6% on revenues generated from the provision of such services, less any creditable VAT already paid or borne by such entity upon purchase of materials and services. VAT rates imposed on our purchase of materials and services included 17%, 13%, 11% and 6%. Local surcharges generally ranging from 7% to 13%, varying with the location of the relevant China subsidiary, are imposed on the amount of VAT payable. On December 21, 2016, Circular Caishui [2016] No. 140 was jointly issued by the Ministry of Finance and the SAT, pursuant to which it was confirmed that an entity engaged in catering services shall pay VAT at the rate of 6% on revenues generated from the provision of take-out food. Effective from July 1, 2017, the 13% VAT rate primarily applicable to certain agricultural products was reduced to 11%.  Effective from May 1, 2018, the VAT rates of 17% and 11% were lowered to 16% and 10%, respectively. 
Repatriation of Dividends from Our China Subsidiaries. Dividends (if any) paid by our China subsidiaries to their direct offshore parent company are subject to Chinese withholding income tax at the rate of 10%, provided that such dividends are not effectively connected with any establishment or place of the offshore parent company in China. The 10% withholding income tax rate may be reduced or exempted pursuant to the provisions of any applicable tax treaties or tax arrangements. Hong Kong has a tax arrangement with mainland China that provides for a 5% withholding tax on dividends upon meeting certain conditions and requirements, including, among others, that the Hong Kong resident enterprise directly owns at least 25% equity interests of the Chinese enterprise and is a “beneficial owner” of the dividends, subject to certain post filing review by the Chinese local tax authority. We believe that our Hong Kong subsidiary, which is the equity holder of our Chinese subsidiaries, met the relevant requirements pursuant to the tax arrangement between mainland China and Hong Kong in 2018 and is expected to meet the requirements in subsequent years, thus, it is more likely than not that our dividends declared or earnings expected to be repatriated since 2018 are subject to the reduced withholding tax of 5%. However, if our Hong Kong subsidiary is not considered to be the “beneficial owner” of the dividends by the Chinese local tax authority, the withholding tax rate on dividends paid to it by our Chinese subsidiaries would be subject to a withholding tax rate of 10% with retrospective effect, which would increase our tax liability and reduce the amount of cash available to the Company.  See Item 1A. “Risk Factors--Risks Related to Doing Business in China—We rely to a significant extent on dividends and other distributions on equity paid by our principal operating subsidiaries in China to fund offshore cash requirements.” 
Gains on Direct Disposal of Equity Interests in Our China Subsidiaries. Under the EIT Law and its implementation rules, gains derived by non-resident enterprises from the sale of equity interests in a China resident enterprise are subject to Chinese withholding income tax at the rate of 10%. The 10% withholding income tax rate may be reduced or exempted pursuant to applicable tax treaties or tax arrangements. The gains are computed based on the difference between the sales proceeds and the original investment basis. Stamp duty is also payable upon a direct transfer of equity interest in a China resident enterprise. The stamp duty is calculated at 0.05% on the transfer value, payable by each of the transferor and transferee. We may be subject to these taxes in the event of any future sale by us of a China resident enterprise.

Gains on Indirect Disposal of Equity Interests in Our China Subsidiaries. In February 2015, the SAT issued the SAT’s Bulletin on Several Issues of Enterprise Income Tax on Income Arising from Indirect Transfers of Property by Non-resident Enterprises (“Bulletin 7”). Pursuant to Bulletin 7, an “indirect transfer” of Chinese taxable assets, including equity interests in a China resident enterprise (“Chinese interests”), by a non-resident enterprise, may be recharacterized and treated as a direct transfer of Chinese taxable assets, if such arrangement does not have reasonable commercial purpose and the transferor avoids payment of Chinese enterprise income tax. Where a non-resident enterprise conducts an “indirect transfer” of Chinese interests by disposing of equity interests in an offshore holding company, the transferor, transferee and/or the China resident enterprise being indirectly transferred may report such indirect transfer to the relevant Chinese tax authority, which may in turn report upward to the SAT. Using general anti-tax avoidance provisions, the SAT may treat such indirect transfer as a direct transfer of Chinese interests if the transfer avoids Chinese tax by way of an arrangement without reasonable commercial purpose. As a result, gains derived from such indirect transfer may be subject to Chinese enterprise income tax, and the transferee or other person who is obligated to pay for the transfer would be obligated to withhold the applicable taxes, currently at a rate of up to 10% of the capital gain in the case of an indirect transfer of equity interests in a China resident enterprise. Both the transferor and the party obligated to withhold the applicable taxes may be subject to penalties under Chinese tax laws if the transferor fails to pay the taxes and the party obligated to withhold the applicable taxes fails to withhold the taxes.
 
The above regulations do not apply if either (i) the selling non-resident enterprise recognizes the relevant gain by purchasing and selling equity of the same listed enterprise in the open market (the “listed enterprise exception”); or (ii) the selling non-resident enterprise would have been exempted from enterprise income tax in China pursuant to applicable tax treaties or tax arrangements, if it had directly held and transferred such Chinese interests that were indirectly transferred. The China indirect transfer rules do not apply to gains recognized by individual stockholders.  However, in practice, there have been a few reported cases of individuals being taxed on the indirect transfer of Chinese interests and the law could be changed so as to apply to individual stockholders, possibly with retroactive effect.  In addition, the PRC Individual Income Tax Law and relevant regulations (“IITL”), revised effective January 1, 2019, impose general anti-avoidance tax rules (“GAAR”) on transactions conducted by individuals. As a result, if the China tax authority invokes the GAAR and deems that indirect transfers made by individual stockholders lack reasonable commercial purposes, any gains recognized on such transfers might be subject to individual income tax in China at the standard rate of 20%.
 
It is unclear whether Company stockholders that acquired Yum China stock through the distribution will be treated as acquiring Yum China stock in an open market purchase. If such acquisition of Yum China stock is not treated as acquired in an open market purchase, the listed transaction exception will not be available for transfers of such stock. We expect that transfers in open market transactions of our stock by corporate or other non-individual stockholders that have purchased our stock in open market transactions will not be taxable under the China indirect transfer rules due to the listed enterprise exception. Transfers, whether in the open market or otherwise, of our stock by corporate and other non-individual stockholders that acquired our stock in the distribution or in non-open market transactions may be taxable under the China indirect transfer rules and our China subsidiaries may have filing obligations in respect of such transfers upon the request of relevant Chinese tax authorities. Transfers of our stock in non-open market transactions by corporate and other non-individual stockholders may be taxable under the China indirect transfer rules, whether or not such stock was acquired in open market transactions, and our China subsidiaries may have filing obligations in respect of such transfers upon the request of relevant China tax authorities. Corporate and other non-individual stockholders may be exempt from taxation under the Chinese indirect transfer rules with respect to transfers of our stock if they are tax resident in a country or region that has a tax treaty or arrangement with China that provides for a capital gains tax exemption and they qualify for that exemption.

Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”). In December 2017, the U.S. enacted the Tax Act, which included a broad range of tax reforms, including, but not limited to, the establishment of a flat corporate income tax rate of 21%, the elimination or reduction of certain business deductions, and the imposition of tax on deemed repatriation of accumulated undistributed foreign earnings. The Tax Act has impacted Yum China in two material aspects: (1) in general, all of the foreign-source dividends received by Yum China from its foreign subsidiaries will be exempted from taxation starting from tax year beginning after December 31, 2017 and (2) Yum China recorded additional income tax expense in the fourth quarter of 2017, including an estimated one-time transition tax on its deemed repatriation of accumulated undistributed foreign earnings and additional tax related to the revaluation of certain deferred tax assets. The Tax Act also requires a U.S. shareholder to be subject to tax on Global Intangible Low Taxed Income (“GILTI”) earned by certain foreign subsidiaries.
 
In December 2017, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (SAB 118), which allows us to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not exceeding one year from the enactment date. The Tax Act requires complex computations with significant estimates to be performed, significant judgments to be made in interpretation of the provisions, and the preparation and analysis of information not previously relevant or regularly produced. The U.S. Treasury Department, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”), the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and other standard-setting bodies could interpret or issue guidance on how provisions of the Tax Act will be applied or otherwise administered that is different from our current interpretation. We completed our analysis of the Tax Act in the fourth quarter of 2018 according to guidance released by the U.S. Treasury Department and the IRS as of December 2018 and made an adjustment to the provisional amount of the transition tax accordingly.
 
The U.S. Treasury Department and the IRS released the final transition tax regulations on January 15, 2019, which was published in the Federal Register on February 5, 2019. We are evaluating the impact on our transition tax computation. Any impact resulting from the final regulations would be accounted for in a subsequent period.
 
See Item 1A. “Risk Factors” for a discussion of risks relating to federal, state, local and international regulation relating to taxation of our business.
