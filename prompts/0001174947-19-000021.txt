ITEM 1 | BUSINESS
-------+---------


(a) | General Business
----+-----------------

 First Real Estate Investment Trust of New Jersey (“FREIT”) is an equity real estate investment trust (“REIT”) organized in New Jersey in 1961. FREIT acquires, develops, constructs and holds real estate properties for long-term investment and not for resale.
 FREIT’s long-range investment policy is to review and evaluate potential real estate investment opportunities for acquisition that it believes will (i) complement its existing investment portfolio, (ii) generate increased income and distributions to its shareholders, and (iii) increase the overall value of FREIT’s portfolio. FREIT’s investments may take the form of wholly-owned fee interests, or if the circumstances warrant diversification of risk, ownership on a joint venture basis with other parties, including employees and affiliates of Hekemian & Co., Inc., FREIT’s managing agent (“Hekemian”) (See “Management Agreement”), provided FREIT is able to maintain management control over the property. While our general investment policy is to hold and maintain properties for the long-term, we may, from time-to-time, sell or trade certain properties in order to (i) obtain capital to be used to purchase, develop or renovate other properties which we believe will provide a higher rate of return and increase the value of our investment portfolio, and (ii) divest properties which we have determined or determine are no longer compatible with our growth strategies and investment objectives for our real estate portfolio.

 Fiscal Year 2018 Developments 
 
(i) | FINANCING
----+----------


(a) | On February 7, 2018, Grande Rotunda, LLC refinanced its $115.3 million construction loan held by Wells Fargo with a new loan held by Aareal Capital Corporation in the amount of approximately $118.5 million with additional funding available for retail tenant improvements and leasing costs in the amount of $3,380,000. This refinancing paid off the loan previously held by Wells Fargo, funded loan closing costs and paid the amount due to Hekemian Development Resources for a development fee of $900,000 plus accrued interest of approximately $45,000 (See Note 9 to FREIT’s consolidated financial statements for further details on this fee). This loan is secured by the Rotunda property, bears a floating interest rate at 285 basis points over the one-month LIBOR rate and has a maturity date of February 6, 2021 with two one-year renewal options. As part of this transaction, Grande Rotunda, LLC purchased an interest rate cap on LIBOR for the full amount that can be drawn on this loan of $121.9 million, capping the one-month LIBOR rate at 3% for the first two years of this loan. As of October 31, 2018, approximately $118.5 million of this loan facility was drawn down and the interest rate was approximately 5.13%. (See Note 5 to FREIT’s consolidated financial statements.)

(b) | FREIT has a $13 million revolving line of credit provided by the Provident Bank. The line of credit is for a three-year term ending on October 27, 2020 at which point no further advances shall be permitted and provided the line of credit is not renewed by the lender, the outstanding principal balance of the line of credit shall convert to a

commercial term loan maturing on October 31, 2022. Draws against the credit line can be used for working capital needs and standby letters of credit. Draws against the credit line are secured by mortgages on FREIT’s Franklin Crossing Shopping Center in Franklin Lakes, New Jersey and retail space in Glen Rock, New Jersey. The interest rate on the amount outstanding will be at a floating rate of 275 basis points over the 30-day LIBOR with a floor of 3.75%. During Fiscal 2017, FREIT utilized $3 million of its credit line to fund tenant improvements for new retail tenants at the Rotunda property. As of October 31, 2017, approximately $3.1 million was outstanding (including closing costs of approximately $0.1 million related to the renewal of the line). In February 2018, FREIT repaid the line of credit in the amount of $3.1 million. As of October 31, 2018, there was no amount outstanding and $13 million was available under the line of credit. (See Note 5 to FREIT’s consolidated financial statements.)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(c) | On January 8, 2018, Pierre Towers, LLC (“Pierre Towers”), (which is owned by S And A Commercial Associates Limited Partnership (“S&A”), a consolidated subsidiary of FREIT), refinanced its $29.1 million loan held by State Farm with a new mortgage loan from New York Life Insurance in the amount of $48 million. Pierre Towers paid New York Life Insurance a good faith deposit in the amount of $960,000 (which was included in prepaid expenses and other assets on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of October 31, 2017) and was reimbursed by New York Life when the loan was closed in January 2018. The new loan has a term of ten years and bears a fixed interest rate equal to 3.88%. Interest-only payments are required each month for the first five years of the term and thereafter, principal payments plus accrued interest will be required each month through maturity. This refinancing resulted in: (i) a reduction in the annual interest rate from a fixed rate of 5.38% to a fixed rate of 3.88%; and (ii) net refinancing proceeds of approximately $17.2 million (after giving effect to a $1.2 million loan prepayment cost to pay-off the loan held by State Farm) that were distributed to the partners in S&A with FREIT receiving approximately $11.2 million, based on its 65% membership interest in S&A, which can be used for capital expenditures and general corporate purposes. (See Note 5 to FREIT’s consolidated financial statements.)

(d) | On December 7, 2017, Station Place on Monmouth, LLC (owned 100% by FREIT) closed on a mortgage loan in the amount of $12,350,000 held by Provident Bank to purchase the Station Place property in Red Bank, New Jersey. Interest-only payments are required each month for the first two years of the term and thereafter, principal payments plus accrued interest will be required each month through maturity. The loan bears a floating interest rate equal to 180 basis points over the one-month BBA LIBOR with a maturity date of December 15, 2027. In order to minimize interest rate volatility during the term of the loan, Station Place on Monmouth, LLC entered into an interest rate swap agreement that, in effect, converted the floating interest rate to a fixed interest rate of 4.35% over the term of the loan. (See Note 5 to FREIT’s consolidated financial statements.)

(e) | The loan on the Patchogue, New York property in the amount of approximately $5.2 million became due on March 1, 2018. FREIT is currently operating under the same terms and conditions of the existing agreement while working with the lender, Oritani Bank, to extend the maturity date of the loan and to provide for monthly payments of principal and interest. Until such time as a definitive agreement providing for an extension of the loan is entered into, there can be no assurance the loan will be extended. (See Note 5 to FREIT’s consolidated financial statements.)

(ii) | ROTUNDA The Rotunda property in Baltimore, Maryland (owned by FREIT’s 60% owned consolidated affiliate Grande Rotunda, LLC) is an 11.5 acre site containing a building with approximately 136,000 sq. ft. of office space and approximately 83,000 sq. ft. of retail space on the lower level of the building. In September 2013, FREIT began construction to redevelop and expand this property and, with the exception of retail tenant improvements, the redevelopment was substantially completed in the third quarter of Fiscal 2016. The redevelopment and expansion plans included a modernization of the office building and smaller adjacent buildings, construction of 379 residential apartment rental units, an additional 73,000 square feet of new retail space, and 864 above level parking spaces. The residential section reached a stabilized level of occupancy of approximately 94% by the end of the third quarter of Fiscal 2018. The retail space continues to lease-up and is approximately 84.1% leased and 78.2% occupied as of October 31, 2018. FREIT expects Rotunda’s operations to stabilize in 2019. See “Item 1a-(i) (a)” under the caption Fiscal Year 2018 Developments for details on the financing of this project.

(iii) | DISPOSITIONS & ACQUISITIONS
------+----------------------------


On December 7, 2017, FREIT completed the acquisition of Station Place, a residential apartment complex consisting of one building with 45 units, located in Red Bank, New Jersey through Station Place on Monmouth, LLC (FREIT’s 100% owned consolidated subsidiary). FREIT identified Station Place as the replacement property for the Hammel Gardens property located in Maywood, New Jersey that FREIT sold on June 12, 2017, which completed the like-kind exchange pursuant to Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code. Station Place is part of FREIT’s residential segment. The acquisition cost was $19,550,000 (inclusive of approximately $550,000 of transaction costs capitalized as part of the asset acquisition), which was funded in part with $7 million in net proceeds from the sale of the Hammel Gardens property, and the remaining balance of $12,350,000 (inclusive of the transaction costs) was funded by Station Place on Monmouth, LLC through long-term financing for this property from Provident Bank. (See Notes 3 and 5 to FREIT’s consolidated financial statements for further details.)

(b) | Financial Information about Segments
----+-------------------------------------

 FREIT has two reportable segments: Commercial Properties and Residential Properties. These reportable segments have different types of tenants and are managed separately because each requires different operating strategies and management expertise. Segment information for the three years ended October 31, 2018 is included in Note 14 “Segment Information” to FREIT’s consolidated financial statements.
 
(c) | Narrative Description of Business
----+----------------------------------

 FREIT was founded and organized for the principal purpose of acquiring, developing, and owning a portfolio of diverse income producing real estate properties. FREIT’s developed properties include residential apartment communities and commercial properties that consist of multi and single tenanted properties. Our properties are located in New Jersey, Maryland and New York. We also currently own approximately 7.37 acres of unimproved land in New Jersey. See Item 2, “Properties - Portfolio of Investments.”
FREIT elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code. FREIT operates in such a manner as to qualify for taxation as a REIT in order to take advantage of certain favorable tax aspects of the REIT structure. Generally, a REIT will not be subject to federal income taxes on that portion of its ordinary income or capital gain that is currently distributed to its equity holders.
 As an equity REIT, we generally acquire interests in income producing properties to be held as long-term investments. FREIT’s return on such investments is based on the income generated by such properties mainly in the form of rents.
 From time to time, FREIT has sold, and may sell again in the future, certain of its properties in order to (i) obtain capital used or to be used to purchase, develop or renovate other properties which we believe will provide a higher rate of return and increase the value of our investment portfolio, and (ii) divest properties which FREIT has determined or determines are no longer compatible with our growth strategies and investment objectives for our real estate portfolio.
 We do not hold any patents, registered trademarks, or licenses.
Portfolio of Real Estate Investments
 At October 31, 2018, FREIT’s real estate holdings included (i) eight (8) apartment buildings or complexes containing a total of 1,437 rentable units which is inclusive of the Station Place property in Red Bank, New Jersey which was acquired in December 2017 (See Item 1- a(iii) – “Dispositions and Acquisitions”), (ii) nine (9) commercial properties (retail and office) containing a total of approximately 1,341,000 square feet of leasable space, including one (1) single tenant store (a building located in Patchogue, New York formerly occupied as a supermarket), one (1) one-acre parcel subject to a ground lease, and (iii) three (3) parcels of undeveloped land consisting of approximately 7.37 acres in total. FREIT and its subsidiaries own all such properties in fee simple. See Item 2, “Properties - Portfolio of Investments” of this Annual Report for a description of FREIT’s separate investment properties and certain other pertinent information with respect to such properties that is relevant to FREIT’s business.

 Employees
 On October 31, 2018, FREIT and its subsidiaries had twenty-eight (28) full-time employees and thirteen (13) part-time employees who work solely at the properties owned by FREIT or its subsidiaries. The number of part-time employees varies seasonally.
 Robert S. Hekemian, the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Hekemian, is the former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of FREIT. Mr. Hekemian retired as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of FREIT effective upon the conclusion of FREIT’s 2018 Annual Meeting of Shareholders held on April 5, 2018 (the “2018 Annual Meeting”). Robert S. Hekemian, Jr., the President of Hekemian, is a Trustee of FREIT, and succeeded Robert S. Hekemian as Chief Executive Officer of FREIT effective upon the conclusion of the 2018 Annual Meeting. Ronald J. Artinian, a Trustee of FREIT and the Chairman of the Audit Committee of the Board, succeeded Robert S. Hekemian as Chairman of the Board effective upon the conclusion of the 2018 Annual Meeting.
 Pursuant to the terms of a Consulting Agreement between Robert S. Hekemian and the Trust, Mr. Hekemian will continue to serve the Trust in a consulting capacity effective upon conclusion of FREIT’s 2018 Annual Meeting. The Consulting Agreement has a term of four years and obliges Mr. Hekemian to provide advice and consultation with respect to matters pertaining to FREIT and its subsidiaries, affiliates, assets and business for no fewer than 30 hours per month during the term of the agreement. FREIT will pay Mr. Hekemian a consulting fee of $5,000 per month during the term of the Consulting Agreement, which shall be payable in the form of Shares on a quarterly basis (i.e. in quarterly installments of $15,000).
 Robert S. Hekemian, Jr., Chief Executive Officer, Ronald J. Artinian, Chairman of the Board, Donald W. Barney, President, Treasurer and Chief Financial Officer, and John A. Aiello, Esq., Secretary and Executive Secretary, are the executive officers of FREIT. FREIT does not retain the services of its executive officers on an exclusive basis, and accordingly FREIT’s executive officers are permitted to engage in other business activities as all of their business activities are not devoted to FREIT. Please see “Item 10 – Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance,” for additional information about FREIT’s executive officers. Hekemian & Co., Inc. has been retained by FREIT to manage FREIT’s properties and is responsible for recruiting, on behalf of FREIT, the personnel required to perform all services related to the operation of FREIT’s properties. See “Management Agreement” below. 
 
Management Agreement
 On April 10, 2002, FREIT and Hekemian executed a Management Agreement whereby Hekemian would continue as Managing Agent for FREIT. The term of the Management Agreement was renewed on November 1, 2017 for a two-year term, which will expire on October 31, 2019. The Management Agreement automatically renews for successive periods of two years unless either party gives not less than six (6) months prior notice to the other of non-renewal. Hekemian currently manages all the properties owned by FREIT and its affiliates, except for the office building at the Rotunda located in Baltimore, Maryland, which is managed by an independent third party management company. However, FREIT may retain other managing agents to manage properties acquired after April 10, 2002 and to perform various other duties such as sales, acquisitions, and development with respect to any or all properties. Hekemian does not serve as the exclusive property acquisition advisor to FREIT and is not required to offer potential acquisition properties exclusively to FREIT before acquiring those properties for its own account. The Management Agreement includes a detailed schedule of fees for those services, which Hekemian may be called upon to perform. The Management Agreement provides for a termination fee in the event of a termination or non-renewal of the Management Agreement under certain circumstances.
 Pursuant to the terms of the Management Agreement, FREIT pays Hekemian fees and commissions as compensation for its services. From time to time, FREIT engages Hekemian to provide additional services, such as consulting services related to development, property sales and financing activities of FREIT. Separate fee arrangements are negotiated between Hekemian and FREIT with respect to such additional services. In Fiscal 2007, FREIT’s Board of Trustees approved and FREIT executed a development fee agreement for the Rotunda redevelopment project for the development services to be provided by Hekemian Development Resources, LLC (“Resources”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Hekemian. The development fee agreement, as amended, for the Rotunda provided for Resources to receive a fee equal to 6.375% of the development costs as defined in the development agreement, less the amount of $3 million previously paid to Hekemian for the Rotunda project. In addition, the Board approved the payment of a fee to Resources in the amount of $1.4 million in connection with the revision to the scope of the Rotunda redevelopment project. Grande Rotunda, LLC paid $500,000 of this fee to Resources in Fiscal 2013 and the balance of $900,000 became due upon the issuance of a certificate of occupancy for the multi-family portion of this project. A final certificate of occupancy was issued in Fiscal 2016; however Resources agreed to defer the payment of the $900,000 balance of this fee (the $900,000 was included in accounts payable on FREIT’s consolidated balance sheet at October 31, 2017). Grande Rotunda, LLC paid the $900,000 portion of this fee to Resources in February 2018 in connection with the refinancing of the Wells Fargo construction loan for the Rotunda property with a new loan from Aareal Capital Corporation. Additionally, Grande Rotunda, LLC paid Resources the amount of approximately $45,000 representing a 
  6

mutually agreed upon amount of interest on the $900,000 portion of the fee for the period during which Hekemian Resources had agreed to defer payment thereof. The minority ownership interest of Grande Rotunda, LLC is owned by Rotunda 100, LLC, which is principally owned by employees of Hekemian, including certain members of the immediate family of Robert S. Hekemian, FREIT’s former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and currently a consultant of FREIT, Robert S. Hekemian, Jr., Chief Executive Officer and a Trustee of FREIT, and David Hekemian, a Trustee of FREIT. The members of the Hekemian family have majority management control of this entity. (See Note 9 to FREIT’s consolidated financial statements.)
 Robert S. Hekemian, a consultant of FREIT, is the Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Hekemian. Mr. Hekemian owns approximately 0.2% of all of the issued and outstanding shares of Hekemian. Robert S. Hekemian, Jr., the Chief Executive Officer and a Trustee of FREIT, is the President of Hekemian, and owns approximately 33.3% of all of the issued and outstanding shares of Hekemian. David Hekemian, a Trustee of FREIT, is a Principal of Hekemian, and owns approximately 33.3% of all of the issued and outstanding shares of Hekemian.
 Real Estate Financing
 FREIT funds acquisition opportunities and the development of its real estate properties largely through debt financing, including mortgage loans against certain of its properties. At October 31, 2018, FREIT’s aggregate outstanding mortgage debt was $350.5 million, which bears a weighted average interest rate of 4.02% and an average life of 4.3 years. FREIT has mortgage loans against certain properties, which serve as collateral for such loans. See the tables in Item 2, “Properties - Portfolio of Investments” for the outstanding mortgage balances at October 31, 2018 with respect to each of these properties.
 FREIT is highly leveraged and will continue to be for the foreseeable future. This level of indebtedness results in increased debt service requirements that could adversely affect the financial condition and results of operations of FREIT. A number of FREIT’s mortgage loans are amortized over a period that is longer than the terms of such loans; thereby requiring balloon payments at the expiration of the terms of such loans. FREIT has not established a cash reserve sinking fund with respect to such obligations and at this time does not expect to have sufficient funds from operations to make such balloon payments when due under the terms of such loans. See “Liquidity and Capital Resources” under Item 7.
 FREIT is subject to the normal risks associated with debt financing, including the risk that FREIT’s cash flow will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest; the risk that indebtedness on its properties will not be able to be renewed, repaid or refinanced when due; or that the terms of any renewal or refinancing will not be as favorable as the terms of the indebtedness being replaced. If FREIT were unable to refinance its indebtedness on acceptable terms, or at all, FREIT might be forced to dispose of one or more of its properties on disadvantageous terms which might result in losses to FREIT. These losses could have a material adverse effect on FREIT and its ability to make distributions to shareholders and to pay amounts due on its debt. If a property is mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness and FREIT is unable to meet mortgage payments, the mortgagee could foreclose upon the property, appoint a receiver and receive an assignment of rents and leases or pursue other remedies, all with a consequent loss of revenues and asset value to FREIT. Further, payment obligations on FREIT’s mortgage loans will not be reduced if there is a decline in the economic performance of any of FREIT’s properties. If any such decline in economic performance occurs, FREIT’s revenues, earnings, and funds available for distribution to shareholders would be adversely affected.
 Neither FREIT’s Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust, as amended, nor any policy statement formally adopted by the Board limits either the total amount of indebtedness or the specified percentage of indebtedness (based on the total capitalization of FREIT), which may be incurred by FREIT. Accordingly, FREIT may incur additional secured or unsecured indebtedness in the future in furtherance of its business activities, including, if or when necessary, to refinance its existing debt. Future debt incurred by FREIT could bear interest at rates which are higher than the rates on FREIT’s existing debt. Future debt incurred by FREIT could also bear interest at a variable rate. Increases in interest rates would increase FREIT’s variable interest costs (to the extent that the related indebtedness was not protected by interest rate protection arrangements), which could have a material adverse effect on FREIT and its ability to make distributions to shareholders and to pay amounts due on its debt or cause FREIT to be in default under its debt. Further, in the future, FREIT may not be able to, or may determine that it is not able to, obtain financing for property acquisitions or for capital expenditures to develop or improve its properties on terms which are acceptable to FREIT. In such event, FREIT might elect to defer certain projects unless alternative sources of capital were available, such as through an equity or debt offering by FREIT.
 Competitive Conditions 
 FREIT is subject to normal competition with other investors to acquire real property and to profitably manage such property. Numerous other REITs, banks, insurance companies and pension funds, as well as corporate and individual developers and owners of real estate, compete with FREIT in seeking properties for acquisition and for tenants. Many of these competitors have significantly greater financial resources than FREIT.
 In addition, retailers at FREIT's commercial properties face increasing competition from internet based marketing and shopping, discount shopping centers, outlet malls, sales through catalogue offerings, discount shopping clubs and telemarketing. In many markets, the trade areas of FREIT's commercial properties overlap with the trade areas of other shopping centers. Renovations and expansions at those competing shopping centers and malls could negatively affect FREIT's commercial properties by encouraging shoppers to make their purchases at such new, expanded or renovated shopping centers and malls. Increased competition through these various sources could adversely affect the viability of FREIT's tenants, and 
  7

any new commercial real estate competition developed in the future could potentially have an adverse effect on the revenues of and earnings from FREIT's commercial properties.
 
(A) | General Factors Affecting Investment in Commercial and Apartment Properties; Effect of Economic and Real Estate Conditions
----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The revenues and value of FREIT’s commercial and residential apartment properties may be adversely affected by a number of factors, including, without limitation, the national economic climate; the regional economic climate (which may be adversely affected by plant closings, industry slow-downs and other local business factors); local real estate conditions (such as an oversupply of retail space or apartment units); perceptions by retailers or shoppers of the security, safety, convenience and attractiveness of a shopping center; perception by residential tenants of the safety, convenience and attractiveness of an apartment building or complex; the proximity and the number of competing shopping centers and apartment complexes; the availability of recreational and other amenities and the willingness and ability of the owner to provide capable management and adequate maintenance. In addition, other factors may adversely affect the fair market value of a commercial property or apartment building or complex without necessarily affecting the revenues, including changes in government regulations (such as limitations on development or on hours of operation) changes in tax laws or rates, and potential environmental or other legal liabilities.
 

(B) | Commercial Shopping Center Properties' Dependence on Anchor Stores and Satellite Tenants
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 FREIT believes that its revenues and earnings, its ability to meet its debt obligations, and its funds available for distribution to shareholders would be adversely affected if space in FREIT's multi-store shopping center properties could not be leased or if anchor store tenants or satellite tenants failed to meet their lease obligations.
 The success of FREIT's investment in its shopping center properties is largely dependent upon the success of its tenants. Unfavorable economic, demographic, or competitive conditions may adversely affect the financial condition of tenants and consequently the lease revenues from and the value of FREIT's investments in its shopping center properties. If the sales of stores operating in FREIT's shopping center properties were to decline due to deteriorating economic conditions, the tenants may be unable to pay their base rents or meet other lease charges and fees due to FREIT. In addition, any lease provisions providing for additional rent based on a percentage of sales would not be operative in this economic environment. In the event of default by a tenant, FREIT could suffer a loss of rent and experience extraordinary delays while incurring additional costs in enforcing its rights under the lease, which FREIT may not be able to recapture.
 As of October 31, 2018, the following table lists the ten (10) largest commercial tenants, which account for approximately 51.3% of FREIT’s leased commercial rental space and 38.8% of fixed commercial rents.
 
Tenant | Center | Sq. Ft. | % of Revenue
Burlington Stores, Inc. | Westridge Square | 85,992 | 3.6% 
Kmart Corporation | Westwood Plaza | 84,254 | 1.7% 
Stop & Shop Supermarket Co. | Preakness | 61,020 | 3.4% 
Safeway Stores, Inc. | Damascus Center | 58,358 | 5.1% 
H-Mart Frederick, LLC | Westridge Square | 55,300 | 3.4% 
The Association of Universities for Reseach in Astronomy | Rotunda | 49,300 | 7.6% 
Stop & Shop Supermarket Co. | Franklin Crossing | 48,673 | 4.8% 
Cobb Theaters IV LLC | Rotunda | 35,000 | 4.5% 
TJ MAXX | Westwood Plaza | 28,480 | 2.9% 
T-Bowl, Inc. | Preakness | 27,195 | 1.8% 


(C) | Renewal of Leases and Reletting of Space
----+-----------------------------------------

 There is no assurance that we will be able to retain tenants at our commercial properties upon expiration of their leases. Upon expiration or termination of leases for space located in FREIT's commercial properties, the premises may not be relet or the terms of reletting (including the cost of concessions to tenants) may not be as favorable as lease terms for the terminated lease. If FREIT were unable to promptly relet all or a substantial portion of this space or if the rental rates upon such reletting were significantly lower than current or expected rates, FREIT's revenues and earnings, FREIT’s ability to service its debt, and FREIT’s ability to make distributions to its shareholders, could be adversely affected.
 In October 2018, Sears Holdings Corporation (“Sears”) and certain of its subsidiaries, including Kmart Corporation, filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code as disclosed in the bankruptcy filings. While Sears has elected to close numerous stores, as of the date of this report, Sears continues to pay rent and the Kmart store at the Westwood Plaza Shopping Center in Westwood, New Jersey remains open.
 In March 2018, iHeartMedia Inc. along with its affiliates, including iHeartMedia+Entertainment (formerly known as Clear Channel Broadcasting Inc.), filed jointly for protection under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code as disclosed in the
  8

 bankruptcy filings. As of the date of this report, the lease for iHeartMedia+Entertainment at the Rotunda property in Baltimore, Maryland was assumed, continues to pay rent and remains open.
 FREIT owns and operates an 87,661 square foot shopping center located in Franklin Lakes, New Jersey, the anchor tenant of which is The Stop & Shop Supermarket Company, LLC (“Stop & Shop”). On July 26, 2017, Stop & Shop entered into a lease modification with FREIT whereby the tenant exercised its option to renew the lease for a ten-year period with a right of the tenant to terminate the lease at any time during the fifth year if the store does not meet certain sales volume levels set forth in the modification. This lease modification, which provided for a $250,000 reduction in annual rent, has adversely affected and will adversely affect FREIT’s future operating results. (See Note 15 to FREIT’s consolidated financial statements.)
 On January 4, 2017, Macy’s, Inc. announced its intention to close several of its department stores across the United States, including the approximately 81,160 square foot Macy’s anchor store located at the Preakness Shopping Center in Wayne, New Jersey. Wayne PSC, a 40% owned consolidated affiliate of FREIT, owns and operates this shopping center in which Macy’s operated its store under a long-term lease and was paying annual rent of approximately $234,000 ($2.88 per square foot) with no future rent escalations for the remaining term and option periods of the lease. On April 25, 2017, Wayne PSC announced it had agreed to a termination of Macy’s lease effective as of April 15, 2017. To terminate the lease and take possession of the space, Wayne PSC paid Macy’s a termination fee of $620,000, which was fully expensed in the second quarter of Fiscal 2017. Wayne PSC expects to re-position this space and re-lease it to a new tenant (or multiple tenants) at market rents, which are currently higher than the rent provided for under the terminated Macy’s lease. FREIT will lose total consolidated annual rental income, including reimbursements, of approximately $0.2 million until such time as the space is fully re-leased. FREIT anticipates increased revenue from the space when it is re-leased. (See Note 15 to FREIT’s consolidated financial statements.)
 The Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company and its affiliates, including Pathmark Stores, Inc. (“A&P”), filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code as disclosed in the bankruptcy filings, and Pathmark’s lease at FREIT’s Patchogue, New York property was rejected as of December 31, 2015. As a result of the lease having been rejected, FREIT is losing annual rents of approximately $1.4 million (related to the prior A&P lease) until the store is re-leased. FREIT continues to explore various options for this property.
 There were no other material lease expirations during Fiscal 2018 and Fiscal 2017. There are no additional material lease expirations expected during Fiscal 2019.
 
(D) | Illiquidity of Real Estate Investments; Possibility that Value of FREIT's Interests may be less than its Investment
----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Equity real estate investments are relatively illiquid. Accordingly, the ability of FREIT to vary its portfolio in response to changing economic, market or other conditions is limited. Also, FREIT's interests in its partially owned subsidiaries are subject to transfer constraints imposed by the operating agreements which govern FREIT’s investment in these partially owned subsidiaries. Even without such restrictions on the transfer of its interests, FREIT believes that there would be a limited market for its interests in these partially owned subsidiaries.
 If FREIT had to liquidate all or substantially all of its real estate holdings, the value of such assets would likely be diminished if a sale were required to be completed in a limited time frame. The proceeds to FREIT from any such sale of the assets in FREIT’s real estate portfolio would therefore be less than the fair market value of those assets.
 Impact of Governmental Laws and Regulations on Registrant's Business
 FREIT’s properties are subject to various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, including those relating to the environment and local rent control and zoning ordinances.

(A) | Environmental Matters
----+----------------------

 Both federal and state governments are concerned with the impact of real estate construction and development programs upon the environment. Environmental legislation affects the cost of selling real estate, the cost to develop real estate, and the risks associated with purchasing real estate.
 Under various federal, state and local environmental laws, statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations, an owner of real property may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances at, on, in or under such property, as well as certain other potential costs relating to hazardous or toxic substances (including government fines and penalties and damages for injuries to persons and adjacent property). Such laws often impose such liability without regard to whether the owners knew of, or were responsible for, the presence or disposal of such substances. Such liability may be imposed on the owner in connection with the activities of any operator of, or tenant at, the property. The cost of any required remediation, removal, fines or personal injury or property damages and the property owner's liability for same could exceed the value of the property and/or the aggregate assets of the owner. In addition, the presence of such substances, or the failure to properly dispose of or remediate such substances, may adversely affect the owner's ability to sell or rent such property or to borrow using such property as collateral. If FREIT incurred any such liability, it could reduce FREIT's revenues and ability to make distributions to its shareholders.
  9

A property can also be negatively impacted by either physical contamination or by virtue of an adverse effect upon value attributable to the migration of hazardous or toxic substances, or other contaminants that have or may have emanated from other properties.
 At this time, FREIT is aware of the following environmental matters affecting its properties:
 
(i) | Westwood Plaza Shopping Center, Westwood, NJ
----+---------------------------------------------

 This property is in a Flood Hazard Zone. FREIT maintains flood insurance in the amount of $500,000 for the subject property, which is the maximum available under the Flood Program for the property. Any reconstruction of that portion of the property situated in the flood hazard zone is subject to regulations promulgated by the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection ("NJDEP"), which could require extraordinary construction methods.
 
(ii) | Franklin Crossing, Franklin Lakes, NJ
-----+--------------------------------------

 The redeveloped Franklin Crossing shopping center was completed during the summer of 1997. Also in 1997, a historical discharge of hazardous materials was discovered at Franklin Crossing. The discharge was reported to the NJDEP in accordance with applicable regulations. FREIT completed the remediation required by the NJDEP.
 In November 1999, FREIT received a No Further Action Letter from the NJDEP concerning the contaminated soil at Franklin Crossing. Monitoring of the groundwater will continue pursuant to a memorandum of agreement filed with the NJDEP.
 
(iii) | Preakness Shopping Center, Wayne, NJ
------+-------------------------------------

 Prior to its purchase in November 2002 by Wayne PSC, a Phase I and Phase II Environmental Assessment of the Preakness shopping center revealed soil and ground water contamination with Percloroethylene (Dry Cleaning Fluid) caused by the mishandling of this chemical by a former dry cleaner tenant. The seller of the center to Wayne PSC has paid for and completed all required remediation work in accordance with the NJDEP standards, and this matter is now closed.
 
(iv) | Other
-----+------

 a) The State of New Jersey has adopted an underground fuel storage tank law and various regulations with respect to underground storage tanks.
 FREIT no longer has underground storage tanks on any of its properties.
 In prior years, FREIT conducted environmental audits for all of its properties except for its undeveloped land and retail properties in Franklin Lakes (Franklin Crossing) and Glen Rock, New Jersey. Except for the environmental matters related to the Preakness Shopping Center and Franklin Crossing described in subsection A(ii) and A(iii) above, the environmental reports secured by FREIT have not revealed any environmental conditions on its properties which require remediation pursuant to any applicable federal or state law or regulation.
 b) FREIT has determined that several of its properties contain lead based paint (“LBP”). FREIT believes that it complies with all federal, state and local requirements as they pertain to LBP.
 FREIT does not believe that the environmental conditions described in subparagraphs (i) - (iv) above will have a material adverse effect upon the capital expenditures, revenues, earnings, financial condition or competitive position of FREIT.
 
(B) | Rent Control Ordinances
----+------------------------

 Each of the apartment buildings or complexes owned by FREIT is subject to some form of rent control ordinance which limits the amount by which FREIT can increase the rent for renewed leases, and in some cases, limits the amount of rent which FREIT can charge for vacated units, except for The Regency, Westwood Hills, The Boulders at Rockaway, Station Place and Icon which are not subject to any rent control law or regulation.
 
(C) | Zoning Ordinances
----+------------------

 Local zoning ordinances may prevent FREIT from renovating, expanding or converting its existing properties for their highest and best use as determined by the Board.
 
(D) | Financial Information about Foreign and Domestic Operations and Export Sale
----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 FREIT does not engage in operations in foreign countries and it does not derive any portion of its revenues from customers in foreign countries.
