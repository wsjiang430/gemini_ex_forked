Item 1. | Business

General
United Technologies Corporation was incorporated in Delaware in 1934. UTC provides high technology products and services to the building systems and aerospace industries worldwide. Growth is attributable primarily to the internal development of our existing businesses and to acquisitions. The following description of our business should be read in conjunction with "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in our 2018 Annual Report, including the information contained therein under the heading "Business Overview."
Our operations for the periods presented herein are classified into four segments: Otis, Carrier (formerly known as UTC Climate, Controls & Security), Pratt & Whitney, and Collins Aerospace Systems (a new segment comprised of the former UTC Aerospace Systems segment and the Rockwell Collins businesses following UTC's acquisition of Rockwell Collins, Inc. in November 2018), with each segment comprised of groups of similar operating companies. References to each segment include the various operating companies established worldwide through which the operations for each segment are conducted.
Otis and Carrier (collectively referred to as the "commercial businesses") serve customers in the commercial, government, infrastructure and residential property sectors and refrigeration and transport sectors worldwide. Pratt & Whitney and Collins Aerospace Systems (collectively referred to as the "aerospace businesses") primarily serve commercial and government customers in both the original equipment and aftermarket parts and services markets of the aerospace industry. For 2018, our commercial and industrial sales (generated principally by the commercial businesses) were approximately 47 percent of our consolidated sales, and our commercial aerospace sales and military aerospace sales (generated exclusively by our aerospace businesses) were approximately 39 percent and 14 percent, respectively, of our consolidated sales. International sales for 2018, including U.S. export sales, were 62 percent of our net sales.
On November 26, 2018, the Company announced its intention to separate into three independent companies: (1) UTC, an aerospace company comprised of the Collins Aerospace Systems and Pratt & Whitney businesses, (2) Otis, and (3) Carrier. The proposed separations are expected to be effected through spin-offs by UTC of Otis and Carrier that are intended to be tax-free for the Company’s shareowners for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The Company expects to complete the separation transactions by mid-year 2020. Separation of Otis and Carrier from UTC via spin-off transactions will be subject to the satisfaction of customary conditions, including, among others, final approval by the Company’s Board of Directors, receipt of tax rulings in certain jurisdictions and/or a tax opinion from external counsel (as applicable), the filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and effectiveness of Form 10 registration statements, and satisfactory completion of financing. 
This Form 10-K and our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and all amendments to those reports are available free of charge through the Investor Relations section of our Internet website (http://www.utc.com) under the heading "SEC Filings" as soon as reasonably practicable after these reports are electronically filed with, or furnished to, the SEC. In addition, the SEC maintains an Internet site (http://www.sec.gov) containing reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC.

Description of Business by Segment
Each segment's business, including its principal products and services and other material developments and information, is described below. Segment financial data for the years 2016 through 2018, including financial information about foreign and domestic operations and export sales, appears in Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2018 Annual Report. Segment sales as discussed below include intercompany sales, which are ultimately eliminated within the "Eliminations and other" category as reflected in the segment financial data in Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2018 Annual Report. Similarly, total segment backlog as discussed below includes intercompany backlog. Beginning in 2018, for each of our segments, we have elected to quantify backlog in a manner that is consistent with the definition of remaining performance obligation (RPO) under Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 606: Revenue from Contracts with Customers. This change did not result in a material impact to the RPO balances of Otis, Carrier or Collins Aerospace Systems. However, as described below, Pratt & Whitney's RPO was adjusted to exclude airline engine orders previously included in backlog for which we have not received the associated firm manufacturing purchase orders. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2018 Annual Report for further discussion of the accounting for RPO under ASC Topic 606: Revenue from Contracts with Customers.
Otis
Otis is the world’s largest elevator and escalator manufacturing, installation and service company. Otis designs, manufactures, sells and installs a wide range of passenger and freight elevators as well as escalators and moving walkways. In addition to new equipment, Otis provides modernization products to upgrade elevators and escalators as well as maintenance and repair services for both its products and those of other manufacturers. Otis serves customers in the commercial, residential and infrastructure property sectors around the world. Otis sells direct and through sales representatives and distributors.
Sales generated by Otis’ international operations was 73 percent of total Otis net sales in both 2018 and 2017. At December 31, 2018, Otis’ RPO was $16.4 billion as compared to a backlog of $16.2 billion at December 31, 2017. Of the total Otis RPO at December 31, 2018, approximately $8.8 billion is expected to be realized as sales in 2019. 
Carrier
Carrier is a leading provider of heating, ventilating, air conditioning (HVAC), refrigeration, fire, security, and building automation products, solutions, and services for commercial, government, infrastructure, and residential property applications and refrigeration and transportation applications. Carrier provides a wide range of building systems, including cooling, heating, ventilation, refrigeration, fire, flame, gas, and smoke detection, portable fire extinguishers, fire suppression, intruder alarms, access control systems, video surveillance, and building control systems. Carrier also provides a broad array of related building services, including audit, design, installation, system integration, repair, maintenance, and monitoring services. Carrier also provides refrigeration and monitoring products and solutions to the transport industry.
Carrier sells its HVAC and refrigeration products and solutions either directly, including to building contractors and owners, transportation companies, retail stores and food service companies, or indirectly through joint ventures, independent sales representatives, distributors, wholesalers, dealers, and retail outlets. These products and services are sold under the Carrier name and other brand names. Carrier’s security and fire safety products and services are used by governments, financial institutions, architects, building owners and developers, security, and fire consultants, homeowners, and other end-users requiring a high level of security and fire protection for their businesses and residences. Carrier provides its security and fire safety products and services under Chubb, Kidde and other brand names, and sells directly to customers as well as through manufacturer's representatives, distributors, dealers, value-added resellers and retail distribution. 
Certain Carrier HVAC businesses are seasonal, and sales and service activity can be impacted by weather. Carrier customarily offers its customers incentives to purchase products to ensure an adequate supply of its products in the distribution channels. The principal incentive program provides reimbursements to distributors for offering promotional pricing and contract terms on Carrier products. 
Sales generated by Carrier’s international operations, including U.S. export sales, were 54 percent and 55 percent of total Carrier net sales in 2018 and 2017, respectively. At December 31, 2018, Carrier’s RPO was $5.3 billion as compared to a backlog of $4.4 billion at December 31, 2017. Of the total Carrier RPO at December 31, 2018, approximately 70% is expected to be realized as sales in 2019.

Pratt & Whitney
Pratt & Whitney is among the world’s leading suppliers of aircraft engines for the commercial, military, business jet and general aviation markets. Pratt & Whitney provides fleet management services and aftermarket maintenance, repair and overhaul services. Pratt & Whitney designs, develops, produces and maintains families of large engines for wide- and narrow-body and large regional aircraft in the commercial market and for fighter, bomber, tanker and transport aircraft in the military market. Pratt & Whitney Canada (P&WC) is among the world's leading suppliers of engines powering general and business aviation, as well as regional airline, and utility airplanes, and helicopters. Pratt & Whitney and P&WC also produce, sell and service auxiliary power units for military and commercial aircraft.
The development of new engines and improvements to current production engines present important growth opportunities. In view of the risks and costs associated with developing new engines, Pratt & Whitney has entered into collaboration arrangements in which revenues, costs and risks are shared with third parties. At December 31, 2018, the interests of third-party participants in Pratt & Whitney-directed commercial jet engine programs ranged from approximately 13 percent to 50 percent. UTC holds a 61 percent program share interest in the IAE International Aero Engines AG (IAE) collaboration with MTU Aero Engines AG (MTU) and Japanese Aero Engines Corporation (JAEC). Pratt & Whitney also holds a 59 percent program share interest in the International Aero Engines, LLC (IAE LLC) collaboration with MTU and JAEC.  Pratt & Whitney sells the PW1100G-JM engine for the Airbus A320neo aircraft and the PW1400G-JM engine for the Irkut MC-21 aircraft through IAE LLC. In addition, Pratt & Whitney has interests in other engine programs, including a 50 percent ownership interest in the Engine Alliance (EA), a joint venture with GE Aviation, which markets and manufactures the GP7000 engine for the Airbus A380 aircraft. Pratt & Whitney has entered into risk and revenue sharing arrangements with third parties for 40 percent of the products and 25 percent of the services that Pratt & Whitney is responsible for providing to the EA. Pratt & Whitney accounts for its interest in the EA joint venture under the equity method of accounting. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2018 Annual Report for a description of our accounting for collaborative arrangements. 
Pratt & Whitney produces the PurePower PW1000G Geared Turbofan engine family, the first of which, the PW1100G-JM, entered into service in January 2016. The PurePower PW1000G engine has demonstrated a significant reduction in fuel burn and noise levels and lower environmental emissions when compared to legacy engines. The PW1100G-JM engine is offered on the Airbus A320neo family of aircraft. PurePower PW1000G engine models also power the Airbus A220 passenger aircraft and Embraer’s E-Jet E2 family of aircraft. Additionally, the PurePower PW1000G engine models have been selected to power the new Mitsubishi Regional Jet, and the new Irkut MC-21 passenger aircraft, which are both scheduled to enter service in 2020. As previously disclosed, Gulfstream announced the selection of the PurePower PW800 engine to exclusively power Gulfstream’s new G500 and G600 business jets. The Gulfstream G500 entered service in 2018, and the Gulfstream G600 is scheduled to enter service in 2019. P&WC's PurePower PW800 engine has also been selected to power the new Falcon 6X business jet by Dassault Aviation, which is scheduled to enter into service in 2022. Pratt & Whitney continues to enhance its programs through performance improvement measures and product base expansion. The success of these aircraft and engines is dependent upon many factors, including technological accomplishments, program execution, aircraft demand, and regulatory approval. As a result of these factors, as well as the level of success of aircraft program launches by aircraft manufacturers and other conditions, additional investment in these engine programs may be required. 
Pratt & Whitney is under contract with the U.S. Government's F-35 Joint Program Office to produce and sustain the F135 engine to power the single-engine F-35 Lightning II aircraft (commonly known as the Joint Strike Fighter) being produced by Lockheed Martin. The two F135 propulsion system configurations for the F-35A, F-35B and F-35C jets are used by the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Marine Corps and U.S. Navy, respectively. F135 engines are also used on F-35 aircraft purchased by Joint Strike Fighter partner countries and foreign military sales countries. Pratt & Whitney is also under contract to build engines for the U.S. Air Force’s B-21 long-range strike bomber and for the development of next-generation adaptive engines for the U.S. Air Force.
Pratt & Whitney’s products are sold principally to aircraft manufacturers, airlines and other aircraft operators, aircraft leasing companies and the U.S. and foreign governments. Pratt & Whitney’s products and services must adhere to strict regulatory and market-driven safety and performance standards. The frequently changing nature of these standards, along with the long duration of aircraft engine development, production and support programs, creates uncertainty regarding engine program profitability. Sales to Airbus (Pratt & Whitney’s largest customer by sales) were 36 percent and 38 percent of total Pratt & Whitney segment sales in 2018 and 2017, respectively, before taking into account discounts or financial incentives offered to customers. Sales to the U.S. Government were approximately 23 percent and 21 percent of total Pratt & Whitney segment sales in 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Sales generated by Pratt & Whitney’s international operations, including U.S. export sales, were 63 percent and 61 percent of total Pratt & Whitney net sales in 2018 and 2017, respectively. At December 31, 2018, Pratt & Whitney’s RPO was $71.1 billion, including $10.0 billion of U.S. Government contracts and subcontracts. At December 31, 2017, Pratt & 
5

Whitney's backlog was $64.3 billion, including $6.0 billion of U.S. Government contracts and subcontracts. As noted above, in conjunction with our adoption of ASC Topic 606: Revenue from Contracts with Customers, we have elected to quantify backlog in a manner that is consistent with the definition of RPO. In prior years, backlog included engine orders from airlines, for which the contractual manufacturing purchase orders had not yet been received from the applicable airframe customers. Effective with the adoption of ASC Topic 606, we no longer include in backlog airline engine orders for which we have not received the associated firm manufacturing purchase orders. The decline in Pratt & Whitney’s RPO at December 31, 2018 as a result of this change has been more than offset by other order activity during the year.
Of the total Pratt & Whitney RPO at December 31, 2018, approximately $10.9 billion is expected to be realized as sales in 2019. Pratt & Whitney’s RPO includes certain contracts for which actual costs may ultimately exceed total sales. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2018 Annual Report for a description of our Revenue Recognition accounting policy which includes discussion of the accounting for long-term contracts and Note 3 for further discussion on RPO under ASC Topic 606: Revenue from Contracts with Customers. 
Collins Aerospace Systems
On November 26, 2018, the Company completed the acquisition of Rockwell Collins pursuant to the merger agreement dated September 4, 2017. As a result of the acquisition, Rockwell Collins became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company and was combined with the legacy UTC Aerospace Systems business segment to form a new business segment, Collins Aerospace Systems. Rockwell Collins' results of operations have been included in UTC’s financial statements for the period subsequent to the completion of the acquisition on November 26, 2018. 
Collins Aerospace Systems is a leading global provider of technologically advanced aerospace products and aftermarket service solutions for aircraft manufacturers, airlines, regional, business and general aviation markets, military, space and undersea operations.

Sales generated by Collins Aerospace Systems’ international operations, including U.S. export sales, was 56 percent of total Collins Aerospace Systems segment sales in both 2018 and 2017.  At December 31, 2018, Collins Aerospace Systems’ 
6

RPO was $26.6 billion, including $6.0 billion of U.S. Government contracts and subcontracts, and $10.7 billion of RPO related to the acquisition of Rockwell Collins. At December 31, 2017, backlog was $13.9 billion, including $3.0 billion of U.S. Government contracts and subcontracts. Of the total Collins Aerospace Systems RPO at December 31, 2018, approximately $12.3 billion is expected to be realized as sales in 2019. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2018 Annual Report for a description of our Revenue Recognition accounting policy which includes discussion of the accounting for long-term contracts and Note 3 for further discussion on RPO under ASC Topic 606: Revenue from Contracts with Customers. 
Other Matters Relating to Our Business as a Whole
Competition and Other Factors Affecting Our Businesses
As worldwide businesses, our operations can be affected by a variety of economic, industry and other factors, including those described in this section, in "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" included in our 2018 Annual Report, in Item 1, "Cautionary Note Concerning Factors That May Affect Future Results," and in Item 1A, "Risk Factors" in this Form 10-K. Each business unit is subject to significant competition from a large number of companies in the U.S. and other countries, and each competes on the basis of price, delivery schedule, product performance and service.
Our aerospace businesses are subject to substantial competition from various domestic and foreign manufacturers, customers and companies that obtain regulatory agency approval to manufacture spare parts, with foreign companies sometimes receiving government research and development assistance, marketing subsidies and other assistance for certain of their products beyond the assistance that may be available in the U.S. Customer selections of aircraft engines, components and systems can also have a significant impact on future sales of parts and services. In addition, the U.S. Government’s and other governments’ policies of purchasing parts from suppliers other than the original equipment manufacturer affect military spare parts sales. Significant elements of our aerospace businesses, such as spare parts sales for engines and aircraft in service, have short lead times. Therefore, backlog information may not be indicative of future demand. Additionally, our aerospace businesses' competitors may offer substantial discounts and other financial incentives, performance and operating cost guarantees, and participation in financing arrangements in an effort to compete for the aftermarket associated with these products. For information regarding customer financing commitments, participation in guarantees of customer financing arrangements and performance and operating cost guarantees, primarily related to Pratt & Whitney, see Notes 5 and 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2018 Annual Report. Pratt & Whitney’s major competitors in the sale of engines are GE Aviation, Honeywell, Safran Helicopter Engines, and CFM International. 
U.S. Government Contracts
Contracting with the U.S. Government entails certain unique risks. U.S. Government contracts are subject to termination by the government, either for convenience or for default in the event of our failure to perform under the applicable contract. In the case of a termination for convenience, we would normally be entitled to reimbursement for our allowable costs incurred and termination costs. If terminated by the government as a result of our default, we could be liable for additional costs the government incurs in acquiring undelivered goods or services from another source and any other damages it suffers. Most of our U.S. Government sales are made under fixed-price contracts, while approximately $2.0 billion or 3 percent of our total sales for 2018 were made under cost-reimbursement type contracts.
Our contracts with the U.S. Government are also subject to audits. Like many defense contractors, we have received audit reports, which recommend that certain contract prices should be reduced, or that certain payments should be delayed, refunded or withheld to comply with various government regulations, including reports alleging that cost or pricing data we submitted in negotiation of the contract prices or that cost accounting practices may not have conformed to government regulations. Some of these audit reports involved substantial amounts. We have made voluntary refunds in those cases we believe appropriate, have settled some allegations and, in some cases, continue to negotiate with the government and/or litigate. For further discussion of risks related to government contracting, see Item 1A, "Risk Factors" and Item 3, "Legal Proceedings," in this Form 10-K and Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2018 Annual Report.
Compliance with Environmental and Other Government Regulations
Our operations are subject to and affected by environmental regulation by federal, state and local authorities in the U.S. and regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over our foreign operations. We have incurred and will likely continue to incur liabilities under various government statutes for the cleanup of pollutants previously released into the environment. We do not anticipate that compliance with current provisions relating to the protection of the environment or that any payments we may be required to make for cleanup liabilities will have a material adverse effect upon our cash flows, competitive position, financial condition or results of operations. Environmental matters are further addressed in "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and Notes 1 and 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2018 Annual Report.
7

Most of the U.S. laws governing environmental matters include criminal provisions. If we were convicted of a violation of the federal Clean Air Act or Clean Water Act, the facility or facilities involved in the violation could be deemed ineligible to be used in performing any U.S. Government contract we are awarded until the Environmental Protection Agency thereafter certifies that the condition giving rise to the violation has been corrected.
In addition, we could be affected by future laws or regulations imposed in response to concerns over climate change. Changes in climate-related concerns, or in the regulation of such concerns, including greenhouse gas emissions, could subject us to additional costs and restrictions, including compliance costs and increased energy and raw materials costs.
We conduct our businesses through subsidiaries and affiliates worldwide. Changes in legislation or government policies can affect our worldwide operations. For example, governmental regulation of refrigerants and energy efficiency standards and fire safety regulations are important to our Carrier businesses, and elevator safety codes are important to the businesses of Otis, while government safety and performance regulations, restrictions on aircraft engine noise and emissions and government procurement practices can impact our aerospace businesses.
U.S. laws, regulations, orders, and other measures concerning the export or re-export of products, software, services and technology to, and other trade-related activities involving, non-U.S. countries and parties affect the operations of UTC and its affiliates. 
For further discussion of risks related to environmental matters and other government regulations, see Item 1A, "Risk Factors" and Item 3, "Legal Proceedings," in this Form 10-K and Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2018 Annual Report.
Intellectual Property and Raw Materials and Supplies
We maintain a portfolio of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, licenses and franchises related to our businesses. While we believe we have taken reasonable measures to protect this portfolio, our efforts may not be sufficient. See Item 1A "Risk Factors" in this Form 10-K for further discussion of intellectual property matters.
We believe we have adequate sources for our purchases of materials, components, services and supplies used in our manufacturing. We work continuously with our supply base to ensure an adequate source of supply and to reduce costs. We pursue cost reductions through a number of mechanisms, including consolidating our purchases, reducing the number of suppliers, strategic global sourcing and using bidding competitions among potential suppliers. In some instances, we depend upon a single source of supply or participate in commodity markets that may be subject to allocations of limited supplies by suppliers. Like other users in the U.S., we are largely dependent upon foreign sources for certain raw materials requirements, such as cobalt, tantalum, chromium, rhenium and nickel. We have a number of ongoing programs to manage this dependence and the accompanying risk, including long-term agreements and the conservation of materials through scrap reclamation and new manufacturing processes. We believe that our supply management practices are based on an appropriate balancing of the foreseeable risks and the costs of alternative practices. Although at times high prices for some raw materials important to our businesses (for example, steel, copper, aluminum, titanium and nickel) have caused margin and cost pressures, we do not foresee near term unavailability of materials, components or supplies that would have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. For further discussion of the possible effects of the cost and availability of raw materials on our business, including the risks associated with more restrictive trade policies in the U.S., and internationally, and other market risks such as the U.K.’s pending withdrawal from the EU, see Item 1A, “Risk factors” and the section titled “Business Overview in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in this Form 10-K and UTC’s 2018 Annual Report.
Employees and Employee Relations
At December 31, 2018, our total number of employees was approximately 240,000, which includes approximately 30,000 employees added as a result of the acquisition of Rockwell Collins. Approximately 63 percent of total employees are based outside the U.S. During 2018, we negotiated 8 domestic collective bargaining agreements, the largest of which covered certain workers at Pratt & Whitney’s West Palm Beach facility. In 2019, numerous collective bargaining agreements are subject to renegotiation, the largest of which covers certain workers at Carrier’s Collierville, Tennessee facility. Although some previous contract renegotiations have had a significant impact on our financial condition or results of operations in prior years, we do not anticipate that the renegotiation of these contracts in 2019 will have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, cash flows, financial condition or results of operations. For discussion of the effects of our restructuring actions on employment, see Item 1A, "Risk Factors" in this Form 10-K and under "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2018 Annual Report.
For a discussion of other matters which may affect our competitive position, cash flows, financial condition or results of operations, including the risks of our international operations, see the further discussion under the headings "General" and
