 Products

For additional information on the products produced and financial information about each segment, see Note 14 (Revenue) and Note 22 (Business Segments) of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
Raw Materials 
 Raw materials used in both segments are generally available from many sources and neither segment is dependent upon any single supplier for any raw material. Substantial volumes of raw materials used by each segment are subject to significant variations in price. The Corporation’s subsidiaries generally do not purchase or commit for the purchase of a major portion of raw materials significantly in advance of the time they require such materials but do make forward commitments for certain commodities (copper and aluminum). See Note 12 (Derivative Instruments) of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
Patents and Trademarks 
 While the Corporation and its subsidiaries hold some patents, trademarks and licenses, in the opinion of management, they are not material to either segment. 
 Backlog
 The backlog of orders at December 31, 2018, was approximately $343 million, compared to a backlog of $325 million at year-end 2017. Approximately 37% of the backlog is expected to be released after 2019.

Competition 
 The Corporation faces considerable competition from a large number of companies in both segments. The Corporation believes, however, that its subsidiaries are significant participants in each of the niche markets which they serve. Competition in both segments is based on quality, service, price and delivery. 
Environmental Protection Compliance Costs 
 Expenditures for environmental control matters were not material to either segment in 2018 and are not expected to be material in 2019. 
 Employees 
 On December 31, 2018, the Corporation and its subsidiaries had 1,922 active employees, of which approximately 120 are employees of ASW.
