Item 1. Business 
Our Company
We incorporated in Texas in 1968 and were reorganized in Bermuda in 1994.  We are a leading global consumer products company offering creative solutions for our customers through a diversified portfolio of well-recognized and widely-trusted brands.  We have built leading market positions through new product innovation, product quality and competitive pricing.
Segment and Geographic Information
We currently have three business segments, which are included in our financial statements in continuing operations:

• | Housewares: Provides a broad range of products to help with food preparation, cooking, cleaning, organization, beverage service, and other tasks to ease everyday living for families. Sales for the segment are primarily to retailers, with some direct-to-consumer product distribution. 


• | Health & Home: Provides healthcare and home environment products. Sales for the segment are primarily to retailers, with some direct-to-consumer product distribution. 


• | Beauty: Provides personal care and beauty appliance products including hair styling appliances, grooming tools, decorative haircare accessories, and liquid, solid and powder-based personal care products. This segment sells primarily to retailers and beauty supply wholesalers. 

Prior to December 20, 2017, we operated a Nutritional Supplements segment.  On December 20, 2017, we completed the divestiture of the Nutritional Supplements segment through the sale of Healthy Directions LLC and its subsidiaries to Direct Digital, LLC.  Following the sale, we no longer consolidate our former Nutritional Supplements segment’s operating results.  The Nutritional Supplements segment’s operating results are included in our financial statements and classified within discontinued operations. We have reallocated corporate overhead expenses to our continuing operating segments that were previously allocated to our former Nutritional Supplements segment. Unless otherwise noted, all amounts presented are from continuing operations. See Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ("MD&A") and Note 4 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for more information.  Discontinued operations in this report on Form 10-K refers only to our discontinued Nutritional Supplements segment’s operations.
For more segment and geographic information concerning our net sales revenue, long-lived assets and operating income, refer to Note 18 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
Our Strategic Initiatives
In fiscal 2015, we launched a five-year transformational strategy designed to improve the performance of our business segments and strengthen our shared service capabilities.  This strategy has driven our decisions on where we will operate and how we will achieve our goals in markets around the world.  The overall design of our business and organizational plan is intended to create sustainable and profitable growth and improve organizational capability.  
Fiscal 2019 marked the completion of Phase I of our multi-year transformation strategy, which delivered performance across a wide range of measures. We improved core sales growth by focusing on our Leadership Brands, made strategic acquisitions, became a more efficient operating company with strong global shared services, upgraded our organization and culture, improved inventory turns and return on invested capital, and returned capital to shareholders. 
Fiscal 2020 begins Phase II of our transformation and is designed to drive the next five years of progress. The long-term objectives of Phase II include improved organic sales growth, continued margin

expansion, and strategic and effective capital deployment. We expect Phase II will include continued investment in our Leadership Brands, with a focus on growing them through consumer-centric innovation, expanding them more aggressively outside the United States, and adding new brands through acquisition. We anticipate building further shared service capability and operating efficiency, as well as attracting, retaining, unifying and training the best people. 
On March 11, 2019, we announced that we are in the process of exploring the divestiture of our Personal Care business, a subset of our Beauty Segment. The Personal Care business includes liquid, powder and aerosol products under brands such as Pert, Brut, Sure and Infusium. This potential divestiture advances our strategy to focus our resources on our Leadership Brands. Leadership Brands are brands which have number-one and number-two positions in their respective categories and include OXO, Honeywell, Braun, PUR, Hydro Flask, Vicks, and Hot Tools.

Our Trademarks
We market products under a number of trademarks that we own and sell certain of our products under trademarks licensed from third parties.  We believe our principal trademarks, both owned and licensed, have high levels of brand name recognition among retailers and consumers throughout the world.  Through our favorable partnerships with our licensors, we believe we have developed stable, enduring relationships that provide access to unique brands that complement our owned and internally developed trademarks.
The Beauty and Health & Home segments rely on the continued use of trademarks licensed under various agreements for a substantial portion of their net sales revenue.  New product introductions under licensed trademarks require approval from the respective licensors.  The licensors must also approve the product packaging.  Many of our license agreements require us to pay minimum royalties, meet minimum sales volumes and some require us to make minimum levels of advertising expenditures.
The following table lists our key trademarks by segment:

Segment | Owned | Licensed 
Housewares | OXO, Good Grips, Hydro Flask, Soft Works, OXO tot | 
Health & Home | PUR | Honeywell , Braun, Vicks
Beauty | Hot Tools, Brut, Pert, Sure, Infusium | Revlon, Bed Head

Patents and Other Intellectual Property
We maintain utility and design patents in the United States and several foreign countries.  We also protect certain details about our processes, products and strategies as trade secrets, keeping confidential the information that we believe provides us with a competitive advantage.
Sales and Marketing
We currently market our products in over 90 countries throughout the world. Sales within the United States comprised approximately 78%, 79% and 79% of total net sales revenue in fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Our segments primarily sell their products through mass merchandisers, drugstore chains, warehouse clubs, home improvement stores, grocery stores, specialty stores, beauty supply retailers, e-commerce retailers, wholesalers, and various types of distributors, as well as directly to consumers.  We collaborate extensively with our retail customers and, in many instances, produce specific versions of our product lines with exclusive designs and packaging for their stores, which are appropriately priced for their respective customer bases.  We market products principally through the use of outside sales representatives and our own internal sales staff, supported by our internal marketing, category management, engineering, creative services, and customer and consumer service staff.  These groups work closely together to develop pricing and distribution strategies, to design packaging and to help develop product line extensions and new products.
Research and Development
Our research and development activities focus on new, differentiated and innovative products designed to drive sustained organic growth.  We continually invest to strengthen our product design and research and development capabilities, including extensive study to gain consumer insight.  Research and development expenses consist primarily of salary and employee benefit expenses and contracted development and testing efforts associated with development of products. 
Manufacturing and Distribution
We contract with unaffiliated manufacturers, primarily in China and Mexico, to manufacture a significant portion of our finished goods for the Beauty appliances and accessories, Housewares, Healthcare, Water Filtration, and Home Environment product categories.  The North American region of the Personal Care category of the Beauty segment sources most of its products from U.S. manufacturers. For fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, finished goods manufactured by vendors in the Far East comprised approximately 74%, 74% and 71%, respectively, of total finished goods purchased.
In total, we occupy approximately 4,219,800 square feet of owned and leased distribution space in various locations to support our operations.  These facilities include a 1,200,000 square foot distribution center in Southaven, Mississippi, and a 1,300,000 square foot distribution center in Olive Branch, Mississippi, used to support a significant portion of our domestic distribution.
Customers
Sales to Walmart, Inc. (including its worldwide affiliates) accounted for approximately 16%, 17% and 17% of our consolidated net sales revenue in fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.  Sales to Amazon.com Inc. accounted for approximately 16%, 13% and 10% of our consolidated net sales revenue in fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.  Sales to Target Corporation accounted for approximately 10% of our consolidated net sales revenue in fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. No other customers accounted for 10% or more of consolidated net sales revenue during those fiscal years.  Sales to our top five customers accounted for approximately 51%, 49% and 48% of our consolidated net sales revenue in fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

Order Backlog
When placing orders, our individual consumer, retail and wholesale customers usually request that we ship the related products within a short time frame.  As such, there usually is no significant backlog of orders in any of our distribution channels.
Seasonality

SEASONALITY AS A PERCENTAGE OF ANNUAL NET SALES REVENUE
 | Fiscal Years Ended February 28,
Fiscal Quarter Ended | 2019 | 2018 | 2017
May | 22.7 | % | 22.0 | % | 22.2 | %
August | 25.2 | % | 23.3 | % | 23.8 | %
November | 27.6 | % | 28.5 | % | 29.3 | %
February | 24.6 | % | 26.2 | % | 24.7 | %

Our sales are seasonal due to different calendar events, holidays and seasonal weather patterns.  Historically, the third fiscal quarter produces the highest net sales revenue during the fiscal year.
Competitive Conditions
We sell our products in markets that are very competitive and mature.  Our products compete against similar products of many large and small companies, including well-known global competitors.  In many of the markets and industry segments in which we sell our products we compete against other branded products as well as retailers' private-label brands.  We believe that we have certain key competitive advantages, such as well recognized brands, engineering expertise and innovation, sourcing and supply chain know-how, and productive co-development relationships with our Far East manufacturers.  We support our products with advertising, promotions and other marketing activities, as well as an extensive sales force in order to build awareness and to encourage new consumers to try our brands and products.  We are well positioned in the industry segments and markets in which we operate, often holding a leadership or significant market share position.  We believe these advantages allow us to bring our retailers a differentiated value proposition.
The following table summarizes our primary competitors by business segment:

Segment | Competitor 
Housewares | Lifetime Brands, Inc. (KitchenAid), Newell Brands Inc., Simple Human LLC, Yeti Holdings, Inc. (Yeti), Can't Live Without It, Inc. (S'well), Bradshaw Home, Inc. (BradshawHome), Hewy Wine Chillers, LLC (Corkcicle) 
Health & Home | Exergen Corporation, Omron Healthcare, Inc., Crane Engineering, Newell Brands, Inc., Lasko Products, LLC., The Clorox Company (Brita), Zero Technologies, LLC, Vornado Air Circulation Systems, Dyson Ltd, Unilever (Blueair), Guardian Technologies LLC.
Beauty | Conair, Spectrum Brands Holdings Inc. (Remington), Newell Brands, Inc., The Procter & Gamble Company, Unilever N.V., Colgate-Palmolive Company 

Environmental and Health and Safety Matters 
Our operations are subject to national, state, local, and provincial jurisdictions’ environmental, health and safety laws and regulations.  Many of the products we sell are subject to a number of product safety laws and regulations in various jurisdictions.  These laws and regulations specify the maximum allowable levels of certain materials that may be contained in our products, provide statutory prohibitions against misbranded and adulterated products, establish ingredients and manufacturing procedures for certain products, specify product safety testing requirements, and set product identification and labeling requirements.
Additionally, an emerging trend with both governments and our retail customers is to prescribe public and private social accountability reporting requirements regarding our worldwide business activities.  In our 
6

product space, some requirements have already been mandated and we believe others may become required.  Examples of current requirements include conflict minerals content reporting, customer reporting of foreign fair labor practices in connection with our supply chain vendors, and evaluating the risks of human trafficking and slavery.
We believe that we are in material compliance with these laws, regulations and other reporting requirements.  Further, the cost of maintaining compliance has not had a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations and consolidated financial condition, nor do we expect it to do so in the foreseeable future.  Due to the nature of our operations and the frequently changing nature of compliance and social reporting standards and technology, we cannot predict with any certainty that future material capital or operating expenditures will not be required in order to comply with applicable laws, regulations and other reporting mandates.
Employees
As of February 28, 2019, we employed approximately 1,500 full-time employees worldwide.  We also use temporary, part-time and seasonal employees as needed.  None of our U.S. employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement.  Certain of our employees in Europe are covered by collective arrangements or works counsel in accordance with local practice.  We have never experienced a work stoppage, and we believe that we have satisfactory working relations with our employees.
