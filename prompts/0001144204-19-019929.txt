ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 
Edison Nation: End-to-end product innovation, development and commercialization
 
Edison Nation is a vertically-integrated, end-to-end, consumer product research and development, manufacturing, sales and fulfillment company.
 
The Company is the aggregation of five wholly owned subsidiaries whose operations and go-to-market strategy are vertically integrated under the Edison Nation corporate umbrella.
 
Edison Nation’s cornerstone business driver is its proprietary web-enabled new product development and licensing platform (www.edisonnation.com) that provides a low risk, high reward process to connect innovators of new product ideas with potential licensing partners.
 
Considered to be the “go-to” resource for independent innovators with great consumer product invention ideas, Edison Nation engages with over 140,000 registered online innovators and entrepreneurs to bring innovative, new products to market focusing on high-interest, high-velocity consumer categories.
 
Since its inception, Edison Nation has received over 100,000 idea submissions, with products selling in excess of $250 million at retail through the management of over 300 client product campaigns with distribution across diverse channels including ecommerce, mass merchandisers, specialty product chains, entertainment venues, national drug chains, and tele-shopping. These clients include many of the largest manufacturers and retailers in the world including Amazon, Bed Bath and Beyond, HSN, Rite Aid, P&G, and Black & Decker.
 
Edison Nation also creates, manufactures and markets its own products for the infant / toddler market under the Cloud b consumer brand name. In addition, the Company leverages its vertically integrated resources and capabilities to create licensed consumer products for large entertainment theme park enterprises, like Disney World and Universal Studios.
 
Business Model
 
New product ideas have little value without the ability and skill required to commercialize them. The considerable investment and executional “know how” needed to initiate a process - from idea to product distribution - has always been a challenge for the individual innovator.
 
Edison Nation’s business model is designed to take advantage of online marketplace and crowdfunding momentum for our future growth mitigating new product development risk while allowing for optimized product monetization based on a product’s likelihood to succeed.
 
To that end, Edison Nation empowers and enables innovators and entrepreneurs to develop and launch products, gain consumer adoption and achieve commercial scale efficiently at little to no cost.
 
The Edison Nation New Product Development & Commercialization Platform
 
Indeed, the cornerstone of Edison Nation’s competitive advantage is its proprietary and web-enabled new product development (“NPD”) and commercialization platform. The platform can take a product from idea through ecommerce final sale in a matter of months versus a year or more for capital intensive and inefficient new product development protocols traditionally used by legacy manufacturers serving “big box” retailers.
 
The Company’s web-enabled NPD platform is designed to optimize product licensing and commercialization through best-in-class digital technologies, sourcing / manufacturing expertise and one of the largest sets of go-to-market solutions. This unique set of resources and capabilities have proven to be a reliable catalyst for sales success.
 
Product Submission Aggregation
 
Interested innovators enter the Edison Nation web site to register for a free account by providing one’s name and email address. The member then creates a username and password to use on the site. Once registered, the member is provided with their own unique, password protected dashboard by which they can begin submitting ideas and join online member forums to learn about industry trends, common questions, engage in member chats, and stay informed of the latest happenings at Edison Nation. They can also track the review progress of ideas they submit through their dashboard.

Edison Nation accepts ideas through a secure online submission process. Once a member explores the active searches in different product categories being run on the platform for potential licensees seeking new product ideas to be commercialized, the member can submit their new product ideas for processing. Edison Nation regularly works with different companies and retailers in various product categories to help them find new product ideas.
 
Registered members pay $25 to submit an idea. This submission fee covers a portion of the cost to review each idea submitted to the platform. There are no additional fees after the submission fee.
 
Although the platform might not have an active search that matches the innovator’s idea, the Edison Nation Licensing Team hosts an ongoing search for new consumer product ideas in all categories.
 
“Insider Membership” is Edison Nation’s premium level of membership. Insiders receive feedback on all their ideas submitted and gain access to online features that aren't available to registered members. In addition, Insiders pay $20 for each idea submitted (20% discount vs. a registered member), can opt-in ideas for free, as well as receive other benefits. An annual membership costs $99, or $9.25 / month automatically debited from a credit card each month. Also included online is feedback to the innovator on the status of each stage of the process and notification when ideas are not selected to move forward during any stage in the review process.
 
Insiders also have access to the Insider Licensing Program (the “ILP”). The primary benefit of the ILP is having the Edison Nation Licensing team working directly on an innovator’s behalf to help secure a licensing agreement with one of the company’s manufacturing partners. If an idea is selected for commercialization by a retail partner, Edison Nation will invest in any necessary patent applications, filings and maintenance. The innovator’s name is included on any patent or patent application that Edison Nation files on the member’s behalf after the idea has been selected.
 
In addition to the above member programs, Edison Nation ASOTV (“As Seen on TV”) Team hosts a search for new products suitable for marketing via DRTV and subsequent distribution in national retail chains including mass merchandisers, specialty retail, drug chains and department stores.
 
Product Submission Review
 
Led by the Company’s NPD Licensing Team (which has over 150 years of combined experience in a variety of industries and product categories), all ideas submitted by innovators through the Company’s website are reviewed and assessed through an 8-stage process. Edison Nation’s product idea review process is confidential with non-disclosure agreements executed with every participating registered or “Insider” member.
 

The NPD platform’s database of over 85,000 product ideas helps determine which inventions have a substantial market opportunity quickly through proprietary algorithms that have been developed incorporating continuous learning from marketplace experience and changes in category requirements.
 
Selected ideas are assessed by the NPD Licensing Team based on nine key factors: competing products, uniqueness, retail pricing, liability & safety, marketability, manufacturing cost, patentability, consumer relevant features and benefits, and commercial-ability.
 
The time required to review ideas depends upon different variables, such as: the number of searches concurrently running on Edison Nation platform, idea volume and complexity of the search, how many presentation dates to licensees are pending, the date an idea is submitted, etc.
 

6
-

 

Presentation dates to potential licensees are usually set a few weeks following the close of the search. After the presentation has been given to a licensing / retail partner, the partner has 45 days to 6 months to select ideas on which they will move forward.
 
The Insider Licensing Program (ILP program) incorporates a four-stage process:
 

· | Stage #1 — Preliminary Review: The NPD licensing team performs a preliminary review to ensure an invention meets the program criteria. Factors that might stall an idea from moving forward include: an invention is cost-prohibitive, has engineering challenges, and/or major players in the marketplace have already launched products like it. If none of these apply, an idea will be approved and move on to the preparation phase. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Stage #2 — Preparation: The NPD licensing team performs a best partner review. Edison Nation’s retail and manufacturing contacts are assessed, and the team begins to plan which licensors would be the best fit for an idea. A gap analysis and visits the store shelves are executed to gain greater understanding of marketplace potential.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Stage #3 — Pitching: At this phase, an idea can become a “Finalist.” The NPD team begins to proactively pitch an idea to potential licensees using a proprietary presentation system. When a company expresses interest, the team proceeds into term sheets and negotiations while staying in constant contact with the prospect until the best possible deal is struck for the innovator.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Stage #4 — Outcome: In the end, the market decides what products will be successful. There are no guarantees. If for some reason Edison Nation is not successful in finding a licensing partner, a complete debrief is given to the Insider.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Due to the public nature of licensing, Edison Nation only accepts ideas from Insiders that are patented or patent-pending. A valid provisional patent application is required. The cost of submitting an idea to the Insider Licensing Program is $100, and a member must be an “Insider” to be considered.
 
The Edison Nation ASOTV new product development process follows a six-stage protocol appropriate for the broadcast-based sales channel. For more information regarding the ASOTV process, the Edison Nation NPD platform, its features and member benefits, visit https://app.edisonnation.com/faq.
 
Acquisition of Intellectual Property
 
Once an innovator’s idea is judged to be a potentially viable, commercial product and selected for potential commercialization, the Company acquires intellectual property rights from the innovator.
 
Once an innovator’s intellectual property is secured, the innovator’s product idea can then either be licensed to a manufacturer or retailer, or developed and marketed directly by Edison Nation. In either case, Edison Nation serves as the point-of-contact with the innovator for term sheets, royalty negotiation and concluding licensing agreements. Edison Nation also maintains contact with the innovator to keep them engaged during product development.
 
In general, innovators are paid a percentage of the Company’s revenue from the commercialization of the innovator’s intellectual property. This percentage varies with the Company’s investment in the development of the intellectual property, including whether the Company decides to license the innovator’s idea for commercialization or instead, to directly develop and market the innovator’s idea.
 
Product Design and Development
 
With product design, product prototyping and creation of marketing assets all resourced with expert Edison Nation in-house capabilities, we have made protracted, high-cost, high-risk research and development models obsolete.
 
Edison Nation custom designs most products in-house for specific customers and their needs. We utilize our existing tooling to produce samples and prototypes for customer reviews, refinement and approval, as well as our in-house packaging design and fabrication resources.
 
The Company’s design and product development professionals are dedicated to the commercialization and marketability of new product concepts advanced through the company’s NPD platform and for licensors / partners like Disney World and Universal Studios.
 

7
-

 

No matter the product, Edison Nation’s objective is to optimize its marketability, function, value and appearance for the benefit of the consumer end user. From concept and prototyping, through design-for-manufacture, special attention is paid to a product’s utility, ease of use, lowest cost bill of materials, and how it “communicates” its features and benefits through design.
 
The combined experience and expertise of the Company’s team spans many high-demand categories including household items, small appliances, kitchenware, and toys. The company’s in-house capabilities are complimented by third-party engineering and prototyping contractors, like Enventys Partners, and category-specific expert resources within select manufacturers.
 
Paths to Market
 
After an innovator’s idea has been selected and then developed, Edison Nation’s NPD and commercialization platform - powered by team of experienced licensing experts and backed by our scalable manufacturing and fulfillment supply chain infrastructure - provides innovators with a clear and unencumbered set of paths to market.
 
Matching the Innovation with the Licensing Community
 
Edison Nation partners with many of the biggest and most well-known consumer products companies and retailers. They use the Company’s platform as a “think engine” to develop targeted products, significantly reduce research and development expense, and expedite time to market.
 
Each potential licensee of an innovator’s idea publishes an exclusive page on the Edison Nation web site with innovation goals and timeline for their search. Appropriate new product ideas are submitted in 100% confidence with all intellectual property safely guarded.
 
Once the search concludes, Edison Nation presents each with the best patent protected, or patentable ideas that can be selected for development.
 
Licensing partners and customers include Amazon, Bed, Bath & Beyond, Church & Dwight, Black & Decker, HSN, Worthington Industries, Pampered Chef, Boston America Corp., Walmart, Target, PetSmart, “As Seen on TV,” Sunbeam, Home Depot, and Apothecary Products.
 
Crowdfunding
 

Edison Nation has established a commercialization path to include the development and management of crowdfunding campaigns. This is evolving to be a strong engine for future growth.
 
The benefits of crowdfunding include increased product testing efficiency, decrease financial risk, and the ability to get closer to the end consumer, simultaneously.
 
The ability for consumers to re-order product not only gauges marketplace demand, but it can also be leveraged as a quantitative “proof point” for potential sales to licensees. Most importantly, the money pledged for orders can be used to finance manufacturing and ecommerce launch marketing costs as negative working capital.
 
Edison Nation’s experience with crowdfunding is extensive and with significant success. To date, our crowdfunding strategic partner, Enventys, has executed approximately 600 crowdfunding campaigns with an estimated average revenue of up to $250,000 per campaign, with online consumer acquisition leading to such revenue lasting only 30 days. The average cost of a crowdfunding campaign run by Edison Nation is as low as approximately $25,000.



One recent example of a successful Kickstarter campaign run by the Company is last year’s introduction of the MasterSous, 8-in-1 Smart Cooker. This Wi-Fi-connected multi-cooker can sous vide, deep fry, simmer, sear, sauté, boil, steam and slow cook while autonomously stirring food. The owner can use the MasterSous mobile app to remotely adjust cooking times and control the automatic stirring mechanism that keeps food in constant motion for even cooking.

The successful Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign for the 8-in-1 Smart Cooker resulted in approximately $200,000 in deferred revenue to Edison Nation (300%+ than anticipated) from 738 backers. The 8-in-1 Smart Cooker product is now in production funded by the revenue gained (negative capital) in the Kickstarter campaign.


The product will be available to consumers in October 2019.
 
Manufacturing, Materials and Logistics
 
Once a product’s path to market is successfully identified, Edison Nation produces and commercializes the product either through (i) licensing partnerships, or (ii) through a direct-to-market path via ecommerce or traditional retail distribution.
 
To provide greater flexibility in the manufacturing and delivery of products, and as part of a continuing effort to reduce manufacturing costs, Edison Nation has concentrated production of most of the Company’s products in third-party manufacturers located in China and Hong Kong. The Company maintains a fully staffed Hong Kong office for sourcing, overseeing manufacturing and quality assurance.
 
Edison Nation’s contracted manufacturing base continues to expand, from two major facilities to 4 to-date. These include two manufacturers required to produce Cloud b children’s sleep products and one for the MasterSous kitchen appliance. Based on anticipated manufacturing requirements, this footprint may expand significantly by the end of 2019. The Company also continues to explore more efficient and expert manufacturing partners to gain greater economies of scale, potential consolidation, and cost savings on an on-going basis.
 
Products are also purchased from unrelated enterprises with specific expertise in the design, development, and manufacture those specialty products.
 
We base our production schedules on customer orders and forecasts, considering historical trends, results of market research, and current market information. Actual shipments of ordered products and order cancellation rates are affected by consumer acceptance of product lines, strength of competing products, marketing strategies of retailers, changes in buying patterns of both retailers and consumers, and overall economic conditions. Unexpected changes in these factors could result in a lack of product availability or excess inventory in a product line.
 
Most of our raw materials are available from numerous suppliers but may be subject to fluctuations in price.
 
Sales, Marketing and Advertising
 
Edison Nation sells products through a diverse network of manufacturers, distributors and retailers. New customer prospects are gained through outbound sales calls, trade show participation, web searches, referrals from existing customers and “crowd-funded” websites such as Kickstarter and Indiegogo.
 
In order to expand the Company’s universe of registered innovators and entrepreneurs submitting ideas on the Edison Nation NPD web platform, the Company has entered a global agreement for distribution of two existing 13-episode seasons of the Company’s Everyday Edison TV series with a leading digital media service company. The series will be available in its original English version as well as voiceover adaptations in German, French, and Spanish. Distribution is planned for Europe and the Middle East through digital content providers such as Amazon Prime Video.
 
Sources of Revenue
 
The Company aggressively pursues three sources of sales volume:
 

· | Member idea submission and ILP program fees: $25 per submission (registered members); $20 per submission (Insider members); $100 per submission (ILP members)
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Licensing agents: We match an innovator’s intellectual property with vertical product category leaders in a licensing structure whereby the innovator can earn up to 50% of the contracted licensing fee. Product categories include kitchenware, small appliances, toys, pet care, baby products, health & beauty aids, entertainment venue merchandise, and housewares.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Product principals: We work with innovators directly, providing such innovators direct access to all of Edison Nation’s resources. Depending on case-by-case factors, innovators may receive a range of up to 35% - 50% of profits.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Market Overview
 
The process for developing and launching consumer products has changed significantly in recent years. Previously, Fortune 500 and specialty consumer product companies funded multimillion-dollar NPD divisions to develop and launch products. These products were sold primarily on “big box” retail shelves supported by large marketing investments.
 
The emergence of ecommerce giants, including Amazon and Walmart.com, has disrupted traditional NPD and commercialization paths and has accelerated a consumer shift away from “brick and mortar” retailers. The result has been the bankruptcy or downsizing of many iconic retailers, including Toys R Us, JC Penney, Macy’s, Sears, Kmart, Office Depot, Family Dollar, and K-B Toys, with a commensurate loss of shelf space and accessible locations.
 
Moreover, crowdfunding sites, like Kickstarter and Indiegogo, have also disrupted NPD process cycles and are now “main stream.” In fact, as of October 2018, Kickstarter’s cumulative pledged funding exceeded $3.9 billion according to Kickstarter published data. Statista.com estimates that crowdfunded sales of products will exceed $18.9 billion by 2021.
 
These crowdfunding sites have enabled individual innovators and entrepreneurs to design, prototype and market unique products to millions of potential customers with significantly lower acquisition costs when compared to the capital and time required by legacy NPD processes.
 
Leveraging Evolving Market Opportunities for Growth
 
The Company believes that its anticipated growth will be driven by five macro factors including:
 

· | The significant growth of ecommerce (14% CAGR, estimated to reach $4.9 trillion by 2021 (eMarketer 2018);
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The increasing velocity of “brick and mortar” retail closures, now surpassing Great Recession levels (Cushman & Wakefield / Moody’s Analytics 2018);
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Product innovation and immediate delivery gratification driving consumer desire for next-generation products with
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 distinctive sets of features and benefits without a reliance on brand awareness and familiarity;
 

· | The rapid adoption of crowdsourcing to expedite successful new product launches; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Utilizing the opportunities to market products over the internet, rather than through traditional, commercial channels, to reach a much broader, higher qualified target market for brands and products.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In addition, we believe that by leveraging our expertise in helping companies launch thousands of new products and our ability to create unique, customized packaging, we intend to acquire small brands that have achieved approximately $1 million in retail sales over the trailing twelve-month period with a track record of generating free cash flow. In addition, we will seek to elevate the value of these acquired brands by improving each part of their launch process, based on our own marketing methodologies.
 
We believe our acquisition strategy will allow us to acquire small brands using a combination of shares of our common stock, cash and other consideration, such as earn-outs. We intend to use our acquisition strategy in order to acquire ten or more small brands per year for the next three years. In situations where we deem that a brand is not a “fit” for acquisition or partnership, we may provide the brand with certain manufacturing or consulting services that will assist the brand to achieve its goals.
 
One example is Cloud b (www.cloudb.com), a leading manufacturer of products and accessories that help parents and children sleep better. The Company distributes its products nationally and in over 100 countries worldwide.
 

Founded in 2002 and acquired by Edison Nation in October 2018, Cloud b’s highly regarded, award-winning products are developed in consultation with an Advisory Board of pediatricians and specialists. The Company recently won the Toy of the Year award from The Toy Association. Cloud b’s best-known products are Twilight Turtle™ and Sleep Sheep™.
 
Cloud b’s products can be purchased on-line (through its own ecommerce site and other online e-tailers), in specialty boutiques, gift stores, and worldwide at major retailers including Barnes & Noble, Bloomingdales, Dillard’s, Nordstrom, Von Maur, Harrods of London, and FNAC in France.

Immediate synergies include expanding Edison Nation’s West coast footprint by leveraging Cloud b’s sizeable distribution, sales and fulfillment operations. In addition, Cloud b is leveraging the Edison Nation proprietary NPD platform, Hong Kong-based manufacturer sourcing and management capabilities, and marketing and packaging resources.
 
Initial focus since acquisition has been to optimize existing product performance, while helping to develop new product lines leveraging the Edison Nation NPD platform.
 
Competition and Industry Background
 
In terms of the Company’s consumer products business, competition is intensifying due to trends towards shorter life cycles for the development, production and marketability of consumer products. Competition is also intensifying due to the availability of online-only distributors, including Amazon.com, which can promote a wide variety of consumer products and represent a wide variety of manufacturers at low cost and limited overhead.
 
Edison Nation’s competitive set includes other online inventor platforms (e.g., InventHelp, Quirky, Mako Design + Invent, Davison, and Invention City). Each of these companies operate different types of business models that combine different consulting, development and service fees, and royalty structures.
 
Edison Nation was originally founded by the creators of the Emmy Award winning PBS television show, Everyday Edisons. One of the original founders, Louis Freeman, is currently a member of the Edison Nation Inc. board of directors. The Company’s model differs significantly from others in the inventor space in that it assumes the considerable financial risk, manpower and time required to monetize a product, from concept selection through sale. A portion of the commercialized product’s net profit is shared with the inventor through a variety of forms of licensing agreements.
 
The Company also competes with large manufacturing companies who develop and commercialize their own products in categories in which Edison Nation currently participates. However, we also are increasing the Company’s “co-op-etition” footprint with companies, like Black & Decker, who not only compete in product development but also have become active “cooperative” participants on the Edison Nation online innovation platform.
 
Customers
 
We sell our products to a diverse network of customers. Domestically, we sell our products to specialty retailers, mass-market retailers and e-commerce sites. Internationally, we sell our products directly to similar retailers and distributors. One customer, Walt Disney World, represented 21% and 31% of our revenues for 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Intellectual Property
 
We believe that Edison Nation’s intellectual property rights have significant value in the marketplace, and that in order to maintain a competitive advantage in the marketplace, that we must continue to develop and maintain the proprietary aspects of our technologies. We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, trade secret, copyright and other intellectual property rights and measures to protect our intellectual property.
 
We seek protection on our products in as many countries as practical, through registered trademarks, copyrights and patents to the extent that such protection is available, cost effective and valuable to our products and brands. We also rely on other forms of intellectual property rights and measures, including trade secrets and nondisclosure agreements, to maintain and protect proprietary aspects of our products and technologies. We require our employees and consultants to execute confidentiality agreements in connection with their employment or consulting relationships with us. We also require our employees and consultants to disclose and assign to us all inventions conceived during the term of their employment or engagement which relate to our business.
 
Although we believe we are sufficiently protected, the failure to obtain or the loss of some of these intellectual property rights could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Seasonality
 
The consumer products business is highly seasonal with consumers making a large percentage of purchases during the traditional holiday season.
 
These seasonal purchasing patterns and requisite production lead times create risk to our business associated with the underproduction of popular consumer products and the overproduction of less popular consumer products that do not match consumer demand.
 These factors increase the risk that the Company may not be able to meet demand for certain products at peak demand times or that our own inventory levels may be adversely impacted by the need to pre-build products before orders are placed. Additionally, as retailers manage their inventories, we may experience cyclical ordering patterns for products and product lines that may cause our sales to vary significantly from period to period.
 
E-commerce has partially reduced traditional seasonality to moderate seasonality. We intend to expand this flattening of traditional seasonality from e-commerce channels to our business as well, including through the continued emergence of crowd-funded “micro brands” that we believe will further delink demand for our products and services from historical demand fluctuation.
 
Government Regulations and Environmental Quality
 
Our products sold in the United States are subject to the provisions of the Consumer Product Safety Act, as amended by the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008, the Federal Hazardous Substances Act, and the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008, and may also be subject to the requirements of the Flammable Fabrics Act or the Food, Drug, and Cosmetics Act and the regulations promulgated pursuant to such statutes. These statutes and the related regulations ban from the market consumer products that fail to comply with applicable product safety laws, regulations, and standards. The Consumer Product Safety Commission may require the recall, repurchase, replacement, or repair of any such banned products or products that otherwise create a substantial risk of injury and may seek penalties for regulatory noncompliance under certain circumstances. Similar laws exist in some states. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with these laws and regulations. Our products sold worldwide are subject to the provisions of similar laws and regulations in many jurisdictions, including the European Union and Canada. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with these laws and regulations.
 
We maintain a quality control program to help ensure compliance with applicable product safety requirements. Nonetheless, we may in the future experience, issues in products that result in recalls, withdrawals, or replacements of products. A product recall could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition, depending on the product affected by the recall and the extent of the recall efforts required.
 
Our advertising is subject to the Federal Trade Commission Act, The Children’s Television Act of 1990, the rules and regulations promulgated by the Federal Trade Commission, and the Federal Communications Commission, as well as laws of certain countries that regulate advertising and advertising to children. In addition, our web-based products and services and other online and digital communications activity are or may be subject to US and foreign privacy-related regulations, including the US Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 and the EU Data Protection Directive (Directive 95/46/EC) and related national regulations. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with these laws and regulations.
 
Our worldwide operations are subject to the requirements of various environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions where those operations are located. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with these laws and regulations. Our operations are from time to time the subject of investigations, conferences, discussions, and negotiations with various federal, state and local environmental agencies within and outside the United States with respect to the discharge or cleanup of hazardous waste. We are not aware of any material cleanup liabilities.
 
Furthermore, we are subject to various other federal, state, local and international laws and regulations applicable to its business. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with these laws and regulations.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2018, we had 54 total employees, 52 of whom were full-time employees. None of our employees are represented by a union or parties to a collective bargaining agreement. We believe our employee relations to be in good standing.

Pursuant to the terms of such Stock Purchase Agreement, the Company purchased 72.15% of the outstanding capital stock of Cloud B in exchange for 489,293 shares of restricted common stock of the Company. In addition, the Company entered into an Earn Out Agreement with the Cloud B Sellers, whereby, beginning in 2019, the Company will pay the Cloud B Sellers an annual amount equal to 8% multiplied by the incremental gross sales of Cloud B over its 2018 gross sales level (the “Earn Out Agreement”). The Earn Out Agreement expires on December 31, 2021.
 
Segment Information
 
We identify our reportable segments according to how the business activities are managed and evaluated, for which discrete financial information is available and is regularly reviewed by our Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”), Christopher B. Ferguson, to allocate resources and assess performance.
 
In the fourth quarter of 2018, we revised our reportable segments in connection with the acquisition of Edison Nation Holdings, LLC and Cloud B, Inc. In connection with both of these acquisitions and our existing business the Company will be a vertically-integrated, end-to-end, consumer product research and development, manufacturing, sales and fulfillment company. The CODM reviews financial performance and allocates resources at a consolidated level on a regular basis, therefore we have determined we have one reportable segment consisting of multiple product offerings.
