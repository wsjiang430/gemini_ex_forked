Item 1. BUSINESS
In this report, “ViewRay”, the “Company”, “we”, “us” and “our” refer to ViewRay, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiary, ViewRay Technologies, Inc.
Company Overview
ViewRay, Inc. designs, manufactures, and markets the MRIdian MRI-guided Radiation Therapy System. MRIdian is built upon a proprietary high-definition magnetic resonance (“MR”) imaging system designed from the ground up to address the unique challenges and clinical workflow for advanced radiation oncology. Unlike MR systems used in diagnostic radiology, MRIdian's high-definition MR was purpose-built to address specific challenges, including beam distortion, skin toxicity, and other concerns that may arise when high magnetic fields interact with radiation beams. The MRIdian MRI-guided Radiation Therapy System integrates diagnostic-quality MR imaging with radiation therapy delivery to enable on-table adaptive treatments with real-time tissue tracking and automatic beam gating. MRIdian supports the delivery of ablative radiation doses in five or fewer fractions, without implantable markers resulting in lower toxicities in hard-to-treat cancers. There are two generations of the MRIdian: the first generation MRIdian with radiation delivery using Cobalt-60 and the second generation MRIdian Linac, with a more advanced linear accelerator or ‘linac’ to deliver the radiation beams. MRIdian with Cobalt-60 is no longer commercially available.
MRIdian was designed to address the key limitations of existing external-beam radiation therapy technologies. MRIdian employs MRI-based technology to provide real-time imaging that clearly defines the targeted tumor from the surrounding soft tissue and other critical organs, both before and during radiation treatment delivery. We believe this combination of enhanced anatomical visualization and accurate dose calculation and delivery will improve the safety and efficacy of radiation therapy, leading to better outcomes for patients suffering from cancer. 
Both generations of the MRIdian have received 510(k) marketing clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, (“FDA”) and permission to affix the Conformité Européene (“CE”) mark. 
•We received initial 510(k) marketing clearance from the FDA for our treatment planning and delivery software in January 2011.
•We received 510(k) marketing clearance for MRIdian, with Cobalt-60, in May 2012. 
•In September 2016, we received the CE mark for the MRIdian Linac in the European Economic Area ("EEA"). 
•In February 2017, we received 510(k) marketing clearance from the FDA to market MRIdian Linac in the United States (“U.S.”). We have also received regulatory approval for MRIdian Linac in several other markets, including Taiwan, Canada, Israel, and Japan.
•In June 2017, we received 510(k) marketing clearance to market RayZR™, our high-resolution beam-shaping multi-leaf collimator, or MLC. 
•In February 2019, we received 510(k) marketing clearance for advancements in MRI, 8 frames per second cine, Functional imaging (T1/T2/DWI) and High-Speed MLC. In December 2019, we received the CE mark for these advancements in the EEA. 
•In December 2021, the newest version of MRIdian Linac, MRIdian A3i, received 510(k) marketing clearance from the FDA.
•In September 2022, the Company received approval to market the MRIdian Linac in China from the National Medical Products Administration (“NMPA”).
•We are also seeking required regulatory approvals for MRIdian Linac in other countries, including the CE mark for MRIdian A3i in the EEA.
Over 29,000 patients have been treated with MRIdian. As of December 31, 2022, 56 MRIdian systems are installed at hospitals around the world where they are used to treat a wide variety of solid tumors and are the focus of numerous ongoing research efforts. MRIdian has been the subject of hundreds of peer-reviewed publications, scientific meeting abstracts, and presentations.
We currently market MRIdian through a direct sales force in the United States. In the rest of the world, we market MRIdian through a hybrid model of both a direct sales force and distribution network. We market MRIdian to a broad range of worldwide customers, including university research and teaching hospitals, community hospitals, private practices, government institutions and freestanding cancer centers. As with the conventional linac market, our sales and revenue cycles vary based on the particular customer and can be lengthy, sometimes lasting up to 18 to 24 months (or more) from initial customer contact to order contract execution. Following execution of an order contract, it generally takes nine to 15 months upon project commencement for a customer to customize an existing facility or construct a new vault. Upon the 
commencement of installation at a customer’s facility, it typically takes approximately 45 to 60 days for us to install MRIdian and perform on-site testing of the system, including the completion of acceptance test procedures.
As of December 31, 2022, we had installed or delivered 72 MRIdian systems worldwide and had a backlog with total value of $380.2 million. We generated revenue of $102.2 million, $70.1 million, and $57.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. We had net losses of $107.3 million, $110.0 million and $107.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.
We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future, as we:
•navigate our business activities through the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic;
•manage delays experienced by our third-party suppliers and distributors;
•continue our research and development efforts;
•seek regulatory approval for MRIdian in certain foreign countries; and
•operate as a public company.
Accordingly, we may seek to fund our operations through public or private equity, debt financings or other sources. However, we may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other arrangements when needed on favorable terms or at all. Our failure to raise capital or enter into such other arrangements as and when needed would have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to develop enhancements to and integrate new technologies into MR Image-Guided radiation therapy systems.
Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic
The COVID-19 pandemic and its follow-on effects have impacted and will continue to impact business activity across industries worldwide, including ViewRay.
Due to pandemic-related factors including delays in service from our global supply chain partners and travel and quarantine restrictions imposed by government agencies and our customers in response to the spread of COVID-19, we have experienced delays in installation of systems in the United States, Asia and Europe. Similarly, our ability to conduct commercial efforts with our customers has been disrupted due to the impact of COVID-19 on our customers. If the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic persist or travel restrictions are reinstated, our ability to conduct our business and access capital markets will be negatively impacted. Capital equipment sales, which make up the majority of our revenue, and which were negatively impacted by the pandemic, may take longer than other areas of the economy to return to pre-pandemic levels, and this may continue to have a material impact on our business. The impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic have slowed, but they persist globally and may negatively impact our operations in areas that we are not aware of currently.
Impact of Inflation
In recent years, inflation has not had a significant impact on our operations. However, as inflation has increased over the past year, we are monitoring the actual and potential impacts on our business, including increases in product cost in connection with the parts used in our manufacturing process, freight and transportation costs, and wage pressure. Should the increase in inflation persist, it will likely increase the costs of conducting our operations, which would adversely impact our profitability.
Cancer and Radiation Therapy Market
Incidence of Cancer
Cancer is a leading cause of death globally and the second leading cause of death in the United States behind cardiovascular disease. According to the American Cancer Society, over 1.9 million people are expected to be newly diagnosed with cancer in the United States during 2022 and more than 600,000 are expected to die from cancer, which translates to over 1,600 deaths per day. As a result of a growing and aging population, the International Agency for Research on Cancer ("IARC"), part of the World Health Organization, reported that the worldwide cancer burden rose to 19.3 million new cases and 10.0 million cancer deaths estimated in 2020.
Cancer Therapy
The primary goal of cancer therapy is to kill cancerous tissues, while minimizing damage to healthy tissues. There are three main ways to treat cancer: surgery, chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Surgery attempts to remove the tumor from the body, while minimizing trauma to healthy tissue and preventing the spread or translocation of the disease to other parts of the body. Surgery is particularly effective because the surgeon can see the tumor and surrounding healthy tissue directly throughout the course of the procedure and can adapt his or her planned removal approach mid-procedure accordingly. Chemotherapy uses drugs to kill cancer cells. Unlike surgery, most forms of chemotherapy circulate throughout the patient’s body to reach cancer cells almost anywhere in the body systemically. Chemotherapy is most effective at destroying microscopic levels of disease. Radiation therapy is typically used as a local treatment, directed at a tumor and 
surrounding areas where microscopic cancerous cells are assumed to have spread. Radiation may be used as the primary treatment modality, or in combination with either chemotherapy or surgery or both. Radiation therapy works by damaging genetic material in cells and other cell components through interaction with ionizing energy. Effective radiation therapy balances destroying cancer cells with minimizing damage to normal cells. It can be used at high doses to ablate a tumor, an effect similar to surgery, or at moderate doses to target local microscopic disease, as is done with chemotherapy. Other, more recently developed ways of treating cancer include hormone therapy and targeted therapy, such as immunotherapy.
Radiation Therapy
Radiation therapy has become widespread, with nearly two-thirds of all treated cancer patients in the U.S. receiving some form of radiation therapy during the course of their cancer treatments, according to estimates by American Society for Radiation Oncology (“ASTRO”). For most cancer types treated with radiation therapy, at least 75% of the patients are treated with the intent to cure the cancer. For lung and brain cancers, that number is somewhat lower, with 59% of lung cancer patients and 50% of brain cancer patients being treated with the goal of curing cancer. The remainder of cases are treated with palliative intent to relieve pain or other tumor related symptoms. The type of radiation therapy delivered by linac or Cobalt 60 based devices is a non-invasive outpatient procedure with little or no recovery time and can be used on patients who are unable to undergo conventional surgery. 
Radiation is used to kill cancer cells primarily by damaging their DNA but can also kill healthy cells in the same way or cause them to become cancerous themselves. As a result, the goal of curative radiation therapy is to balance delivery of a sufficiently high dose of radiation to a tumor to kill the cancer cells while, at the same time, minimizing damage to healthy cells, particularly those in critical organs. Normal cells are better able to repair themselves after radiation than tumor cells, so doses of radiation are often fractionated, or delivered in separate sessions with rest periods in between. As a result, standard radiation therapy is often given once a day, five times a week, for one to nine weeks. According to a 2021 IMV report, patients made an estimated 17.9 million radiation therapy treatment visits in the U.S. in 2021.
Radiation Therapy Equipment Market
According to the Global Industry Analysts Inc. ("GIA") Radiation Therapy Equipment - Global Market Trajectory & Analytics report published in 2022, the global radiotherapy market is estimated to grow to approximately $7.3 billion by 2026. According to IAEA Directory of Radiotherapy Centres ("DIRAC"), there are over 15,000 linacs installed in over 7,800 centers worldwide. In North America, there are nearly 5,000 linacs installed at nearly 2,300 centers. The annual market for linacs is estimated to be 1,200 units per year globally, the majority of which are replacements for older machines.
Limitations of Conventional Radiation Therapy
Limitations with conventional radiation therapy result from imaging technologies that make accurate visualization of a tumor and its relation to critical organs difficult or impossible during the treatment delivery. Most current conventional systems take images of the tumor before and after treatments, but, not continuously during the treatments in real time. As a result, treatments may not be delivered with the precision assumed by the physician and may not result in the necessary efficacy or reduction in local tumor recurrence. Also, healthy tissues may be exposed to radiation levels different from those predicted by the planning system and can result in patient injury. 
•Inability to accurately visualize a tumor for treatment alignment. To locate a tumor, conventional radiation therapy systems typically rely on CT scans taken while the patient is on the delivery unit treatment table, or “on-table.” Because it is difficult to differentiate between the tumor and nearby soft tissues with CT images, clinicians use surrogate registration markers, including existing bone structures, external marks and surgically implanted fiducials, to align a patient’s tumor to the treatment beams prior to commencing treatment.

However, the spatial relationship between tumors and the registration markers used to locate them often changes between the time of the patient’s initial imaging and the time of his or her first treatment session. This is particularly true for tumors which are located in soft tissue. By relying on a marker as a proxy for the tumor location, rather than on the tumor itself, clinicians risk missing the tumor when they deliver radiation beams into the patient’s body. In addition, placement of surgically implanted fiducial markers comes with inherent risks: the procedures are invasive; there is a risk of pain, 
infection and bleeding; and fiducials may change location and even migrate inside the body. Fiducial marker placement also may add extra costs for payers, providers and patients. Despite placement of fiducials, physicians are often unable to track changes in tumor shape. Also, fiducials made of dense metals, such as gold, may cause artifacts which interfere with imaging.
•Inability to adapt treatment on-table. A physician designs a treatment plan and dose prescription based on images that are captured days or even weeks prior to initiation of radiation therapy. Creating a treatment plan can take up to several weeks in complex cases, and a course of treatment itself can take up to nine weeks. However, during the course of therapy, tumors often change size, orientation or shape, and patient anatomy can change for a variety of reasons such as weight loss or gain. These changes can alter the planned radiation exposure to both the targeted regions and nearby healthy organs; this has the potential to increase the risk of local tumor recurrence and to reduce the safety of the radiation delivery. Adjusting for these changes on conventional delivery units requires re-planning, which includes getting new patient images needed to create a new treatment plan. This process may take several days and is resource intensive. As a result of these limitations, re-planning is infrequently performed.
Due to limitations in imaging technologies, physicians may be unaware of changes in the tumor and surrounding anatomy. Consequently, they may continue to administer radiation dose according to the original treatment plan, without realizing its potential to reduce the effectiveness of the tumor treatment and to increase the risk of patient injury.
•Inability to track tumor and organ motion accurately. In addition to the difficulty of locating a tumor accurately in a patient’s body at the time treatment begins, a further challenge is accounting for ongoing tumor movement that takes place during treatment. Tumors have been shown to move multiple centimeters relative to surrogate registration markers over the course of only a few seconds. Breathing and other normal bodily functions, such as changes in the bladder or bowel during treatment, can cause significant tumor motion. Although physicians use internal markers, external cameras and blocks placed on the patients’ body to track respiratory and other motion, they are typically unable to track the tumor itself. As a result, physicians usually enlarge the total region to be irradiated. This increase in the irradiated region exposes additional healthy tissues to radiation and limits the dose that is delivered to the tumor.
Each of these limitations increases the risk of missing a tumor and hitting healthy tissue during treatment. If a tumor is insufficiently irradiated, it may not respond to treatment, resulting in a greater probability of local tumor recurrence and reduced overall survival for the patient. The ability to avoid irradiating healthy tissue has been shown to reduce side effects. If healthy tissues, particularly critical organs, are irradiated, the side effects can be severe, including: scarring of lung tissue; fibrosis and cardiotoxicity in lung and breast cancers; incontinence and sexual dysfunction in pelvic and prostate cancers; infertility in pediatric cancers; memory loss, seizures and necrosis in brain cancer; secondary cancers, and in serious cases, death. Many of these side effects can be costly for patients and the healthcare system. 
Although MRI technology is an imaging tool broadly used to differentiate between types of soft tissue in diagnostic settings, MRI technology had not been available in radiation treatment before the launch of ViewRay’s MRIdian System. MRI had not been used within the radiation therapy suite because the technologies interfered with each other: the magnetic field generated by MRI interfered with the linac beam, while the radiofrequencies produced by the linac distorted the MRI images. Current forms of CT based radiation therapy have improved over time, but issues with additional radiation dose and image quality have limited the utility of these technologies. Fluoroscopy and cone-beam CT, which is a form of on-board CT, involve the use of X-rays, a form of ionizing radiation, and pose an increased risk of radiation-induced cancer to the patient.
Our Solution
We developed MRIdian to address the key limitations of existing external-beam radiation therapy technologies. MRIdian is the world's first device to integrate a diagnostic-quality MRI with an advanced linear accelerator. MRIdian is the first and only low-field MRI-guided, on-table adaptive radiotherapy system with real-time, tissue tracking-based automated beam gating with an advanced linear accelerator. MRIdian offers:
•MRI-guided imaging that provides advanced tissue visualization compared to cone-beam computed tomography ("CBCT"), to enable precise contouring and reduced margins.
•Fully integrated, on-table adaptive workflow that allows complete re-optimization of the daily treatment plan.
•Real-time tissue tracking that controls the automated beam gating without the need for implanted markers.
MRIdian A3i is the Company's next version of MRIdian. MRIdian A3i streamlines the on-table adaptive workflow by allowing clinicians to intelligently auto-contour, auto-adapt, and auto-gate. The parallel collaborative workflow within MRIdian A3i, allows clinicians to collaborate simultaneously and connect remotely during patient treatment. The automated workflow steps and contouring tools are designed to minimize clinician time and increase patient throughput. 
MRIdian A3i expands existing real-time tissue tracking and automated beam gating functionalities to include multiplanar tracking and gating in up to three planes. Our customers have the flexibility to select up to three different tracking targets in any combination of coronal, sagittal, or axial planes to automatically stop the beam when any single target exceeds the clinician-defined treatment boundaries.
MRIdian A3i, with BrainTxTM, the brain treatment package consists of a dedicated brain coil with an integrated stereotactic brain immobilization system. New, high-resolution volumetric and real-time imaging features are designed to enable customers to treat brain metastases, resection cavities, gliomas, and other cranial lesions. MRIdian A3i with BrainTx is in the process of being CE marked. We currently market the MRIdian A3i with BrainTx is currently only marketed in the US. 
MRIdian represents a new paradigm in the treatment of cancer, providing clinicians with the ability to improve targeting precision and thus deliver higher—and potentially more effective—radiation doses. 
This approach to radiation therapy is called MRIdian SMART (Stereotactic MRI-guided, adaptive radiotherapy). The benefits of MRIdian SMART include: 
•safe delivery of ablative doses; 
•tight margins;
•ability to treat patients, often with five or fewer fractions;
•elimination of the need for invasive fiducials; and
•demonstrated clinical outcomes with no to low grade three toxicities.
In order for clinicians to deliver high precision adaptive radiotherapy, the MRIdian Linac was designed with a purpose-built magnet, high precision double stacked double focused MLC, a high dose rate linear accelerator, and a Treatment Planning and Delivery System (TPDS) software suite built from the ground up. We believe that MRIdian provides the following clinical and commercial benefits to physicians, hospitals and patients:
•The ability to SEE: SmartVISION® 
Unlike MRI systems used for diagnostic radiology, MRIdian's SmartVISION MR imaging was purpose-built for radiation oncology and MRIdian’s SmartVISION was designed specifically to not interfere with high-fidelity beam delivery. Most importantly, SmartVISION provides diagnostic-quality, multi-sequence MR imaging while coexisting in close proximity with the integrated linear accelerator. MRIdian’s proprietary magnetic and radiofrequency shielding design ensures minimal interaction between the linear accelerator and magnetic field. SmartVISION virtually eliminates the risk of skin toxicities and trapped or distorted doses. With a proprietary split-magnet design exclusive to SmartVISION, MRIdian provides an unobstructed radiation beam path and optimal source-axis distance (“SAD”) enabling sophisticated beam dosimetry, exceptionally sharp penumbra tailored for stereotactic radiosurgery ("SRS") and stereotactic body radiotherapy ("SBRT"), and high-dose rate beam delivery.
•The ability to SHAPE: SmartADAPT®™
Patient anatomy changes from day to day resulting in significant changes to the position, shape, and size of the tumor and surrounding healthy tissue between treatment sessions. Using MRIdian's SmartADAPT adaptive radiotherapy software, clinicians can now acquire daily on-table MR setup scans in seconds and leverage high-contrast, high-definition imaging to rapidly reshape dose delivery to accommodate the anatomical changes that occur throughout the course of treatment. Taking advantage of groundbreaking advances in computing technology, SmartADAPT calculates a new individualized Monte Carlo simulation to predict the probability of a variety of outcomes and plans in seconds based on the anatomy at that time—all while the patient is in the treatment position.
•The ability to STRIKE: SmartTARGET®™
While the patient is on the table during beam delivery, transient gas bubbles, filling bladders and respiratory motion may cause tumors and surrounding organs at risk (OARs) to rapidly change position and shape. MRIdian’s SmartTARGET continuously acquires MR images and tracks target tissue and OARs faster than human reaction time. SmartTARGET’s real-time tissue tracking controls the automated beam gating by delivering the radiation dose only when the tumor is located in the pre-defined treatment boundary. If the tumor moves outside the pre-defined treatment boundary and OARs move into the treatment boundary, the beam automatically stops. When the tumor moves back into the boundary, the beam is turned on and the treatment resumes. SmartTARGET provides confidence that prescribed doses reach the target while avoiding critical structures. 
•The ability to SIZE: SmartSITE™
MRIdian's compact SmartSITE footprint addresses common physical space limitations and challenges associated with large-scale vaults and the need for a custom-built solution. MRIdian’s SmartSITE design allows MRIdian to fit within almost any existing standard linear-accelerator vault and shielding configuration, helping reduce prolonged installation schedules and additional costs necessary to build custom, large-scale vaults. MRIdian components are also able to fit through conventional vault doorways, so there is no need to remove walls, raise ceilings, or dig trenches, minimizing interruptions and delays.
MRIdian can treat a broad spectrum of radiation therapy indications and disease sites with its ability to perform three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy, or 3D-conformal radiation therapy (“CRT”), IMRT, IGRT, SBRT/SABR and SRS. MRIdian treatments are supported by existing radiation therapy payment codes in almost all countries in which we offer MRIdian. We believe MRIdian’s increased tumor target accuracy will allow physicians to treat patients with higher 
radiation doses over fewer treatment fractions; this potentially enables the clinic to treat more patients with greater overall efficiency and patient throughput.

As we advance our strong intellectual property portfolio, our innovation pipeline includes projects to address treatment delivery speed, machine vision and biological imaging. We continue to work with key opinion leaders, clinicians, hospitals and free-standing centers to refine and improve MRIdian’s features, optimize clinical workflow and increase patient throughput while incorporating our advanced features.
•Clinical data. MRIdian customers are developing an impressive compendium of clinical data. Over the last seven years, more than 65 different types of cancer have been treated on MRIdian systems. MRIdian users have generated hundreds of peer reviewed articles and abstracts highlighting thousands of patients with clinically reported outcomes. There are over 70 investigator lead clinical trials ongoing on MRIdian. Radiation oncologists and medical physicists have expanded treatment to areas such as abdominal oligometastatic cancer, tumors in the central lung, and non-invasive heart ablations.
•Training. Training remains paramount to adoption. We invest in peer-to-peer symposia and training courses to facilitate sharing of best practices of key opinion leaders with new customers. We also plan to invest in our clinical field team. In order to drive awareness and adoption, we will continue to work with current customers and their respective institutions to host visiting physicians, train new users in best-practices, and engage in outreach events worldwide. In 2022, we invested in educating patient advocacy groups focused on prostate, pancreas, and lung cancers in order to help bring greater awareness of MRIdian's benefits to patients and clinicians alike. 
The MRIdian System
The MRIdian is comprised of three major components, (i) the MRI system, (ii) the radiation delivery system, and an (iii) integrated treatment planning and delivery software.

MRIdian MRI System
The heart of the MRIdian is the MRI system which captures soft tissue images of the patient’s body. To address the technical complications that arise from combining an MRI with an external-beam radiation delivery unit, we have designed a proprietary split superconducting magnet that allows radiation doses to be delivered through a central gap, which places the MRI components away from the path of the beam. Our MRI system captures and displays live, high-quality images in one plane, eight or four times per second or in three planes, two times per second. These real-time images automatically track selected structures and control radiation treatment beam delivery. Features in MRIdian A3i include multi-planar tissue tracking, automated beam gating on multiple planes simultaneously, BrainTx, a new brain treatment package, and the integration of a real-time patient feedback display. The Company received FDA 510(k) clearance for MRIdian A3i and 
BrainTx in December 2021. The Company is able to market A3i in the EEA and is working to obtain CE Mark for the BrainTx package.
We have engineered our MRI system to be able to produce clear images using a low-field strength 0.35 Tesla magnet, which helps enable us to minimize image and radiation dose distortions.
MRIdian Radiation Delivery System
In the first-generation MRIdian, which we no longer make available for sale, radiation was delivered from three Cobalt-60 radiation therapy heads symmetrically mounted on a rotating ring gantry.
In the second generation MRIdian, our currently available system, we developed solutions to two long-standing problems that had prevented compact integration of a linac beam with an MRI system: 1) linac radiofrequency interference with the operation of the MRI; and 2) MRI magnetic interference with the operation of the linac. First, linacs utilize high-powered microwave generators similar to equipment used in radar at airports. These “radar stations” inside the linac create radiofrequency emissions, or “noise” that can corrupt the delicate signals measured from the patient’s body to generate MR images. We addressed this problem by introducing technology similar to that used in stealth aircraft. Airplanes built with stealth technology can hide from radar by using a coating that absorbs microwaves, thus preventing radar beams that strike the aircraft from bouncing back to the radar station. In a similar manner, we absorb the output of the linac “radar station” to hide it from the MRI, producing images as noise-free as those created without an integrated linac.
Second, MRIs utilize high-powered superconducting magnets required to image the patient’s tissues that must be placed close to the linac components used for radiation therapy. But many linac components will not operate properly when placed close to or inside these strong magnetic fields. We overcame this challenge by creating magnetic shielding shells that create voids in the magnetic field, without significantly disturbing the magnetic field used for imaging. This allows the linac to operate on the MRIdian gantry as if there were no magnetic field present. MRIdian Linac uses the same split-magnet MRI system used in the first generation MRIdian system. It is specifically designed to fit in standard radiotherapy vaults so that customers do not need to build new vaults in order to replace an X-ray guided linear accelerator with a MRIdian. 
Integrated Treatment Planning and Delivery Software
Our proprietary treatment planning and delivery adaptive treatment software works with the integrated patented split-magnet MRI System, unobstructed radiation beam path and optimal SAD of the Radiation Delivery System to unlock beam dosimetry, sharp SRS and SBRT-tailored penumbra, and high dose rate beam delivery. MRIdian A3i includes enhanced on-table adaptive workflow efficiency through, workflow automation, auto-contouring tools, intrafraction “scan and adapt” option and a collaborative on-table adaptation integrated remote access platform.
Installed Base and Clinical Use
At December 31, 2022, a total of 56 MRIdian systems are in operation worldwide, of which 55 are MRIdian Linac systems and one is a MRIdian with Cobalt-60 system. We have 26 in the United States and 30 outside the United States. In addition, 16 MRIdian Linacs have been delivered to customers that are in varying stages of deployment. 
New Orders and Backlog
New orders are defined as the sum of gross product orders, representing MRIdian contract price, recorded in backlog during the period. Backlog is the accumulation of all orders for which revenue has not been recognized and which we consider valid. Backlog includes customer deposits or letters of credit, except when the sale is to a customer where a deposit is not deemed necessary or customary. Deposits received are recorded as customer deposit, which is a liability on the balance sheet. Orders may be revised or cancelled according to their terms or upon mutual agreement between the parties. Therefore, it is difficult to predict with certainty the amount of backlog that will ultimately result in revenue. The determination of backlog includes objective and subjective judgment about the likelihood of an order contract becoming revenue. We perform a quarterly review of backlog to verify that outstanding orders in backlog remain valid, and based upon this review, orders that are no longer expected to result in revenue are removed from backlog. Among other criteria we use to determine whether a transaction qualifies for inclusion in backlog, we must possess both an outstanding and effective written agreement for the delivery of a MRIdian signed by a customer. We also require a minimum customer deposit or a letter of credit requirement, except when the sale is to a customer where a deposit is not deemed necessary or customary (e.g., sale to a government entity, a large hospital, group of hospitals or cancer care group that has sufficient credit, sales via tender awards, or indirect channel sales that have signed contracts with end-customers). We decide whether to remove or add back an order from or to our backlog by evaluating the following criteria: changes in customer or distributor plans or financial conditions; the customer’s or distributor’s continued intent and ability to fulfill the order contract; changes to regulatory requirements; the status of regulatory approval required in the customer’s jurisdiction, if any; and other reasons for potential cancellation of order contracts.
We received new orders for MRIdian systems, totaling $191.0 million, $158.9 million and $94.6 million in fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Based on our periodic assessments, we removed $36.4 million, $30.4 million and $36.1 million from the backlog for fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. At December 31, 2022, we had a backlog with 
a total value of $380.2 million. There can be no assurance that backlog will result in revenue in any particular time period or at all.
Installation Process
Following execution of an order contract, upon project commencement, it generally takes nine to 15 months for a customer to customize an existing facility or construct a new vault, although in some cases customers may request installation for a date later in the future to meet their own clinical or business requirements. After the customer completes its vault customization, it typically takes approximately 45 to 60 days for us to install MRIdian and perform on-site testing of the system, including the completion of acceptance test procedures. MRIdian is designed to fit into a typical radiation therapy vault, similar to other replacement linear accelerators. MRIdian’s components all fit through standard hospital vault entrances for assembly. On-site training takes approximately one week and can be conducted concurrent with installation and acceptance testing.
Our customers are responsible for removing any outgoing linear accelerator equipment and preparing the room for the MRIdian system unless otherwise stipulated within the contract with the customer. This includes ensuring adequate radiation and radio frequency shielding, preparing the floor for the mounting plate, and upgrading facility utilities to meet system requirements.
Clinical Development
To date, we have primarily relied on clinical symposia and case studies presented at ASTRO and the European Society for Radiotherapy and Oncology ("ESTRO"), to raise awareness of MR Image-Guided radiation therapy and to market MRIdian to leading cancer centers. Additionally, centers have published hundreds of peer-reviewed articles on the technical and clinical benefits of MRIdian.
In order to promote broader adoption rates at other cancer centers and hospitals, we plan to work with our customers to continue to collect and publish data on clinical efficacy, treatment times and clinical results for patients who have been treated on a MRIdian. ViewRay sponsored a prospective trial, Stereotactic MRI-guided On-table Adaptive Radiation Therapy ("SMART") for Locally Advanced Pancreatic Cancer, and completed enrollment between January 2019 and January 2022. The initial study results were presented at ASTRO 2022. The primary endpoint of this study was met with no patients having acute grade ≥ 3 GI toxicity definitely attributed to SMART.  Early efficacy outcomes are promising and additional follow-up is ongoing to evaluate late toxicity and long-term efficacy.
The results of the SMART study have prompted ViewRay to further investigate the treatment of pancreatic cancer. A phase III randomized controlled trial titled "Locally Advanced Pancreatic cancer treated with ABLATivE stereotactic MRI-guided adaptive radiation therapy" – also known as LAP-ABLATE – is intended to begin in the first half of 2023. LAP-ABLATE will compare stand-alone multi-agent chemotherapy, which is the current standard of care for patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer, to patients receiving a combination of chemotherapy and 5-fraction MRIdian SMART (stereotactic MR-guided adaptive radiotherapy). The study is designed to demonstrate superior overall survival in patients receiving post-chemotherapy MRIdian SMART. The anticipated enrollment target is 267 patients over an estimated three-year period.
The MIRAGE trial is a single-center, randomized study conducted at the University of California, Los Angeles ("UCLA") and successfully met the primary superiority endpoint that MR-guided SBRT versus CT-guided SBRT results in statistically significant reduction in acute toxicity. On January 12, 2023 it was reported that the study enrolled 156 patients (77 receiving CT and 79 receiving MRIdian treatments). UCLA concluded that MRI-guided prostate SBRT affords significantly reduced toxicity compared with CT-guided therapy.
While we do not currently have statistically significant, prospective evidence that MRIdian improves patient outcomes or decreases healthcare costs relative to CT-based radiotherapy, we believe our sponsorship and support for studies will demonstrate the benefits of MR Image-Guided radiation therapy and adaptive treatment planning. As data accumulate from the use of MRIdian, we plan to work with professional healthcare organizations to support further global marketing efforts, additional product clearances, approvals and/or registrations, potential improvements in reimbursement and delivery system reforms.
Selling and Marketing
We currently market MRIdian through a direct sales force in the United States. In the rest of the world, we market MRIdian through a hybrid model of both a direct sales force and distribution network. We market MRIdian to a broad range of worldwide customers, including university research and teaching hospitals, community hospitals, private practices, government institutions and freestanding cancer centers. As with the conventional linac market, our sales and revenue cycles vary based on the particular customer and can be lengthy, sometimes lasting up to 18 to 24 months (or more) from initial customer contact to order contract execution.
To sell MRIdian globally, we use a combination of sales executives, sales directors and a network of international third-party distributors with internal support from sales operations, product management and application specialists. A targeted group of sales directors are responsible for selling MRIdian within the United States. Our product management function helps market MRIdian and works with our engineering group to identify and develop upgrades and enhancements. We also have a team of program development managers who provide post-sales support.
We engage in various physician-targeted advertising efforts, and our selling and marketing practices include virtual symposia, webinars, participating in trade shows and symposia, as well as direct marketing efforts and patient education.
Competition
We compete with companies marketing IGRT devices for the treatment of cancer using MRI, CT, ultrasound, optical tracking and X-ray imaging. We also compete with companies developing next-generation IGRT devices, specifically those developing MR Image-Guided devices, among others. We expect the following to drive worldwide competitive market dynamics; technological advances, including the ability to provide real-time imaging; clinical outcomes; reimbursement; system size, price, and operational complexity; and operational efficiency.
Our major competitors with devices approved for distribution in the U.S. or globally include Accuray Incorporated (“Accuray”), Elekta AB (“Elekta”), and Siemens Healthineers, through its Varian Medical Systems division. Many of our direct competitors have greater financial, sales and marketing, service infrastructure and research and development capabilities than we do, as well as more established reputations and current market share. 
Other Image Guided therapy devices. Oncology Solutions Ltd. ("MagnetTX") received FDA 510(k) clearance for its MRI linac product, Aurora-RT, and in February 2023, the FDA authorized RefleXion Medical Inc. to market its biology-guided radiotherapy product, Scintix, for tumors in the lung and bone. Although early-stage companies may not present significant competition, if they were to progress commercially, it could impact our sales negatively.
Elekta and MagnetTX are currently the only competitors that also market an MRI-guided device combined with a linear accelerator. 
The limited capital expenditure budgets of our customers result in all suppliers to these entities competing for a limited follow-on effects potential customers may consider more expensive proton therapy systems, which could consume a significant portion of their capital expenditure budgets.
Manufacturing
We have adopted a model in which we rely on subsystem manufacturing, assembly and testing by our key suppliers. The MRIdian subsystems are then fully integrated at the customer site. Through this approach, we avoid the majority of the fixed cost structure of manufacturing facilities. We purchase major components and subsystems for MRIdian from national and international third-party original equipment manufacturers suppliers and contract manufacturers. These major components include the magnet, MRI electronics, ring gantry, radiation therapy heads, linear accelerator, multi-leaf collimators, patient-treatment table and computers. We also purchase minor components and manufacture parts directly ourselves. For sales for which we are responsible for installation, we assemble and integrate these components with our proprietary software and perform multiple levels of testing and qualification at the customer site. The system undergoes a final acceptance test, which is performed in conjunction with the customer.
Many of the major subsystems and components of MRIdian are currently procured through single and sole source suppliers. Among these are the magnet, MRI electronics, MRI coils, ring gantry, linear accelerator and the patient-treatment table. We have entered into multi-year supply agreements for most of our major components and subsystems. 
We manage our supplier relationships with scheduled business reviews and periodic program updates. We closely monitor supplier quality and delivery performance to ensure compliance with all MRIdian system specifications. We believe our supply chain has adequate capacity to meet our projected sales over the next several years; however, the follow-on impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic have had negative effects on our supply chain which have negatively impacted our costs and gross margin.
Intellectual Property
The proprietary nature of, and protection for, MRIdian components, new technologies, processes and know-how are important to our business. Our policy is to seek patent protection in the United States and in certain foreign jurisdictions for our MRIdian systems and other technology where available and when appropriate. We also in-license technology, inventions and improvements we consider important to the development of our business.
We hold an exclusive license to five issued U.S. patents, four issued foreign patents, and one pending U.S. application as of February 1, 2023. We own an additional 43 issued U.S. patents, 122 issued foreign patents (70 of which were issued in Great Britain, Germany, France, Italy, and the Netherlands as a result of 14 patent applications filed and allowed through the European Patent Office), 19 pending U.S. applications and 45 pending foreign applications as of February 1, 2023. 
Assuming all required fees are paid, individual patents or patent applications owned or licensed by us will expire between 2025 and 2042. We also have a joint ownership interest with Case Western Reserve University in two U.S. issued patents.
Our portfolio includes patents and patent applications directed to system-wide aspects of MRIdian and to key aspects of its subsystems and components. The initial licensed patents for our core technology broadly cover the simultaneous use of MR imaging and isotopic external-beam radiation therapy and we have issued U.S. and foreign patents and pending continuation applications that extend this core technology to alternate beam technologies. Additionally, we have patents and patent applications that cover critical design elements including, among others, our methods for integrating MRI with the radiation delivery system, and the design of our disassemble, or “pop apart,” magnet which enables the MRI sub-system to fit into most standard radiation therapy vaults. In addition, we have U.S., and foreign patents and patent applications that cover technologies enabling the use of MR-imaging at a frequency sufficient to account for real-time organ motion to provide video-rate tissue tracking in disciplines in and outside of radiation therapy. Furthermore, we have patents issued in the U.S., Canada, Europe, Japan, and China, and additional applications pending in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions, specifically directed to technology enabling the MRIdian Linac combination of MRI and linear accelerator technology.
We continue to review new technological developments in our system and in the field as a whole, in order to make decisions about what filings would be most appropriate for us. An additional key component of our intellectual property is our proprietary software used in planning and delivering MRIdian’s therapeutic radiation dose.
In December 2004, we entered into a licensing agreement with the University of Florida Research Foundation, Inc. ("UFRF"), whereby UFRF granted us a worldwide exclusive license to certain of UFRF’s patents in exchange for 33,653 shares of common stock and a royalty from sales of products developed and sold by us utilizing the licensed patents. Royalty payments are based on 1% of net sales, defined as the amount collected on sales of licensed products and/or licensed processes after deducting trade and/or quantity discounts, credits on returns and allowances, outbound transportation costs paid and sales tax. Minimum quarterly royalty payments of $50,000 commenced with the quarter ended March 31, 2014 and are payable in advance. Minimum royalties paid in any calendar year will be credited against earned royalties for that calendar year. The royalty payments continue until the earlier of (i) the date that no licensed patents remain enforceable; or (ii) the payment of earned royalties, once begun in 2014, cease for more than four consecutive calendar quarters. In addition to our patents, we also rely upon trade secrets, know-how, trademarks, copyright protection and continuing technological and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive position. We have periodically monitored and continue to monitor the activities of our competitors and other third parties with respect to their use of intellectual property. We require our employees, consultants and outside scientific collaborators to execute confidentiality and invention assignment agreements upon commencing employment or consulting relationships with us. Despite these safeguards, any of our know-how or trade secrets not protected by a patent could be disclosed to, or independently developed by, a competitor.
Coverage and Reimbursement
We believe that reimbursement rates in the United States have generally supported a favorable return on investment for the purchase of new radiotherapy equipment, including MRIdian. Standard radiation therapy treatments using MRIdian, including 3D-CRT, IMRT and SBRT, are generally reported under existing Current Procedural Terminology ("CPT") codes. Most payers, including Medicare, generally cover standard radiation therapy treatments furnished in outpatient hospital and free-standing centers. 
Third-party payors, including public programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, establish coverage policies and reimbursement rates for procedures performed by physicians in hospitals and free-standing clinics. For example, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) publishes annual updates to the hospital outpatient prospective payment system (“HOPPS”) which is used to pay for services performed in hospital outpatient departments. CMS also publishes annual updates to the Medicare physician fee schedule (“MPFS”) which is used to pay for services performed by physicians in all sites of service. The MPFS is also used by Medicare to pay for services furnished in free-standing radiation therapy centers. The U.S. Congress from time to time considers various Medicare and other healthcare reform proposals that could affect both private and public third-party payor coverage and reimbursement for healthcare services provided in hospitals and clinics. Private insurers often model their payment rates and coverage policies based on those established by Medicare. These third-party payors regularly update reimbursement amounts, including annual updates to payments to physicians, hospitals and clinics for medical procedures, including radiation treatments using MRIdian.
In 2019, CMS proposed an alternative payment model, the Radiation Oncology Model ("RO Model"), for a majority of cancers that are typically treated with radiation therapy ("RT"). However, after several delays, CMS announced in late 2022 that the RO model has been indefinitely delayed. 
Foreign Reimbursement Regulations
Healthcare delivery, financing and payment systems vary from country to country and include single-payor and multiple public and private payors as well as public and private ownership of hospitals and centers. Our ability to achieve adoption 
of MRIdian, as well as significant sales volume in international markets we enter will depend in part on the availability of reimbursement for procedures performed using MRIdian, demonstrating the value of MRIdian for payers and purchasers, and in some countries, funding for capital equipment purchases.
Research and Development
Continued innovation and development of advanced technologies is critical to our goal of making MR Image-Guided radiation therapy a standard of care for cancer treatment. Our current development activities include improvements in and expansion of product capabilities, continued clinical workflow refinements, design improvements to reduce system costs and improvements in reliability.
The modular design of MRIdian enables the development of new capabilities and performance enhancements by generally allowing each subsystem to evolve within the overall platform design. Access to regular MRIdian upgrades protects customer investment in MRIdian and facilitates customer adoption of new features and capabilities. In addition, we believe our IP portfolio will enable us to continuously develop innovative technologies to further differentiate MRIdian.
Government Regulation
U.S. Medical Device Regulation and Nuclear Materials Regulation
As a manufacturer and seller of medical devices and devices that deliver radiation, we and some of our suppliers and distributors are subject to extensive and rigorous regulation by the FDA, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, (“NRC”), other federal, state, and local authorities in the U.S. and foreign regulatory authorities. The U.S. Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”) and the regulations promulgated by the FDA relating to medical devices and radiation-producing devices govern, among other things, the following activities that we perform or that are performed on our behalf, and that we will continue to perform or have performed on our behalf:
•product design, development and testing;
•manufacturing;
•approval or clearance;
•packaging, labeling and storage;
•marketing, advertising and promotion, sales;
•distribution, including importing and exporting;
•installation;
•possession and disposal;
•record keeping; 
•service and surveillance, including post-approval monitoring and reporting;
•complaint handling; and
•repair or recall of products and issuance of field safety corrective actions.
FDA Clearance and Approval of Medical Devices
The FDA regulates medical devices in the United States to ensure that medical products distributed domestically are safe and effective for their intended uses. Unless an exemption applies, the FDA requires that all new medical devices and all marketed medical devices that have been significantly changed, or that will be marketed with a new indication for use, obtain either clearance via a 510(k) premarket notification or approval via a Premarket Approval ("PMA") application before the manufacturer may commercially market or distribute the product in the United States. 
The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes, Class I, Class II, and Class III. All generations of the MRIdian system have been classified as Class II medical devices subject to the 510(k) clearance process. 
Devices deemed to pose the lowest risk are placed in Class I. 
Moderate risk devices are placed in Class II, for which safety and effectiveness can be reasonably assured by adherence to: (i) a set of regulations referred to as General Controls, which require compliance with the applicable portions of the FDA’s Quality System Regulation ("QSR") (ii) Special Controls, which can include performance standards, guidelines and post-market surveillance; and (iii) regulations regarding facility registration and product listing, reporting of adverse events and malfunctions, and appropriate, truthful and non-misleading labeling and promotional materials. Most Class II devices are subject to 510(k) premarket review and clearance by the FDA.
Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices, or devices deemed not substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510(k) devices are placed in Class III. 
510(k) clearance process. Most Class II devices are subject to premarket review and clearance by the FDA, which is accomplished through the 510(k) premarket notification process. Under the 510(k) process, the manufacturer must 
submit to the FDA a premarket notification, demonstrating that the device is “substantially equivalent” to a “predicate” device, which is a legally marketed similar device that is not subject to PMA requirements.
To be “substantially equivalent,” the proposed device must have the same intended use as the predicate device and either have the same technological characteristics as the predicate device or have different technological characteristics and not raise different questions of safety or effectiveness than the predicate device. Clinical data are sometimes required to support substantial equivalence. The FDA is in the process of evaluating and implementing significant reforms to the device premarket review process, such as encouraging 510(k) applicants to use newer predicate devices to demonstrate substantial equivalence, and other policies that are intended to promote the use of modern technologies, improve the efficiency of the review process, and protect the public health.
The process of obtaining 510(k) clearance usually takes from three to 12 months from the date the application is filed and generally requires submitting supporting design and test data, which can be extensive and can prolong the process for a considerable period of time. If the FDA agrees that the device is substantially equivalent, it will grant clearance to commercially market the device.
After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a new or major change in the intended use of the device, may require a new 510(k) clearance or, depending on the modification, could require approval of a PMA. The FDA requires each manufacturer to make this determination in the first instance, but the FDA can review any such decision. If the FDA disagrees with the manufacturer’s decision, it may retroactively require the manufacturer to submit a request for 510(k) clearance or PMA approval and can require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or recall the product in the United States until 510(k) clearance or PMA approval is obtained.
We received 510(k) clearances for the treatment planning and delivery software system in January 2011 and for MRIdian in May 2012. Since obtaining 510(k) clearances in 2011 and 2012, we have made changes to MRIdian that we believe do not require further 510(k) clearance.
In February 2017, we received 510(k) clearance from the FDA to market the MRIdian Linac system in the U.S. We received 510(k) clearance from the FDA for modifications of the MRIdian Linac system in June 2017 and February 2019.
In December 2021, we received 510(k) clearance for MRIdian A3i and BrainTx, which includes multi-planar tissue tracking, automated beam gating on multiple planes simultaneously, a new brain treatment package, and the integration of a real-time patient feedback display.
Clinical trials. Clinical trials are sometimes required for 510(k) clearance. Clinical trials are subject to extensive monitoring, record keeping and reporting requirements. Clinical trials must be conducted under the oversight of an institutional review board ("IRB") for the relevant clinical trial sites and must comply with FDA regulations, including but not limited to those relating to good clinical practices. To conduct a clinical trial, the patient’s informed consent must be obtained in form and substance that complies with both FDA requirements and state and federal privacy and human subject protection regulations. The clinical trial sponsor, the FDA or the IRB could suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Even if a trial is completed, the results of clinical testing may not adequately demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the device or may otherwise not be sufficient to obtain FDA clearance or approval to market the product.
Continuing FDA regulation. Any devices we manufacture or distribute pursuant to 510(k) clearance or PMA approval by the FDA are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA and certain state agencies. These include product listing and establishment registration requirements, which help facilitate FDA inspections and other regulatory actions.
In addition, our manufacturing operations for medical devices and those of our suppliers must comply with the FDA’s Quality System Regulation ("QSR"). The QSR requires that each manufacturer, including third party manufacturers, establish and implement a quality system by which the manufacturer monitors the manufacturing process and maintains records that show compliance with FDA regulations and the manufacturer’s written specifications and procedures. Among other things, the QSR requires that manufacturers establish performance requirements before production and follow stringent requirements applicable to the device design, testing, production, control, record keeping, documentation, labeling and installation, as well as supplier/contractor selection, complaint handling and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the manufacturing process. Compliance with the QSR is necessary to be able to continue to market medical devices that have received FDA approval or clearance, and to receive FDA clearance or approval to market new or significantly modified medical devices. The FDA makes announced and unannounced inspections of medical device manufacturers, and these inspections may include the manufacturing facilities of subcontractors. Following an inspection, the FDA may issue a FDA Form 483 report that describes the conditions or practices that the FDA investigator believes are in violation of FDA’s requirements. For example, we received a Voluntary Action Indicated (“VAI”) FDA Form 483 in December 2021, which included seven (7) inspectional observations. We promptly responded to the FDA with completed corrective actions for four of the inspectional observations and detailed our plan to address the remaining three inspectional observations in a timely manner. FDA may also issue warning letters documenting regulatory violations observed during an inspection, for failure to adequately address inspectional observations, or for other violations of the FDCA. The 
manufacturer’s failure to adequately and promptly respond to such reports or warning letters may result in further FDA enforcement action against the manufacturer and related consequences, including, among other things, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, recalls or seizures of products, total or partial suspension of production, FDA refusal to grant 510(k) clearance or PMA approval, withdrawal of existing clearances or approvals, and criminal prosecution.
Manufacturers must also comply with post-market surveillance regulations, including medical device reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers review and report to the FDA any incident in which their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur. In addition, corrections and removals reporting regulations require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA that may present a risk to health. The FDA may also order a mandatory recall if there is a reasonable probability that the device would cause serious adverse health consequences or death.
The FDA and the Federal Trade Commission ("FTC"), also regulate the promotion and advertising of MRIdian. In general, we may not promote or advertise MRIdian for uses not within the scope of our clearances or approvals or make unsupported safety and effectiveness claims.
Failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements, including delays in or failures to report incidents to the FDA or for promoting devices for unapproved or uncleared uses, can result in enforcement action by the FDA, such as:
•warning letters, untitled letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties;
•customer notifications or repair, replacement, refunds, recall, administrative detention or seizure of our MRIdian systems;
•operating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production;
•refusing or delaying requests for 510(k) clearance or PMA approval of new or modified products;
•withdrawing 510(k) clearances or PMA approvals that have already been granted;
•refusal to grant export approval for products; or
•criminal prosecution.
Radiological health. We are also regulated by the FDA under the Electronic Product Radiation Control provisions of the FDCA because MRIdian contains radiation producing components, and because we assemble these components during manufacturing and service activities. The Electronic Product Radiation Control provisions require radiation producing products to comply with certain regulations and applicable performance standards. Manufacturers are required to certify in product labeling and reports to the FDA that their products comply with all necessary standards as well as maintain manufacturing, testing and sales records for their products. The Electronic Product Radiation Control provisions also require manufacturers to report product defects and affix appropriate labeling to covered products. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in enforcement action by the FDA, which can include any of the sanctions described above.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission and U.S. State Agencies
In the United States, as a manufacturer of a medical device utilizing radioactive byproduct material (i.e. depleted uranium shielding and Cobalt-60 sources), we are subject to extensive regulation by not only federal governmental authorities, such as the NRC, but also by state and local governmental authorities, such as the Ohio Department of Health, to ensure such device is safe and effective. In Ohio, the Department of Health, by agreement with the NRC, regulates the possession, use, and disposal of radioactive byproduct material as well as the manufacture of devices containing radioactive sealed sources to ensure compliance with state and federal laws and regulations. We have received sealed source device approval from the Ohio Department of Health for MRIdian and have entered into a standby letter of credit with PNC to provide certification of financial assurance for decommissioning Cobalt-60 radioactive materials in accordance with Ohio Department of Health regulations. We and/or our supplier of radiation sources must also comply with NRC and U.S. Department of Transportation regulations on the labeling and packaging requirements for shipment of radiation sources to hospitals or other users of MRIdian. Compliance with NRC, state and local requirements is required for distribution, installation, use and service within each state that we intend to install MRIdian systems.
Existing radiation therapy facilities practicing nuclear medicine, brachytherapy or other therapies are already required to have necessary NRC and/or state licenses and a radiation safety program requiring compliance to various provisions under NRC regulations at Part 35 of Title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations (“Medical uses of byproduct material”). Use of MRIdian is regulated under Section 35.1000 of the NRC’s regulations (“Other medical uses of byproduct material or radiation from byproduct material”). In 2013, the NRC released licensing guidance under its regulations to guide our customers in the NRC requirements applicable to the use of MRIdian. We believe that this guidance is favorable in that it is consistent with clinical use of existing image-guided radiation therapy devices.
Moreover, our use, management, and disposal of certain radioactive substances and wastes are subject to regulation by several federal and state agencies depending on the nature of the substance or waste material. We believe that we are in compliance with all federal and state regulations for this purpose.
Outside the United States, various laws apply to the import, distribution, installation and use of MRIdian, in consideration of the nuclear materials within MRIdian. In this regard, we believe that the MRIdian Linac complies with applicable regulations.
U.S. Privacy and Security Laws
We may also be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 ("HIPAA") as amended by the Health Information Technology and Clinical Health Act ("HITECH"), and their respective implementing regulations, including the final omnibus rule published on January 25, 2013, imposes specified requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Further, “business associates,” defined as independent contractors or agents of covered entities that create, receive, maintain or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity are also subject to certain HIPAA privacy and security standards. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.
U.S. Fraud and Abuse Laws and Regulations
The healthcare industry is also subject to a number of fraud and abuse laws and regulations, including physician anti-kickback, false claims and physician payment transparency laws. Violations of these laws can lead to civil and criminal penalties, including exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs and significant monetary penalties, among others. These laws, among other things, constrain the sales, marketing and other promotional activities of manufacturers of medical products, such as us, by limiting the kinds of financial arrangements we may have with hospitals, physicians and other potential purchasers of medical products who may seek reimbursement from a federal or state health care program such as Medicare or Medicaid.
Anti-kickback laws. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute makes it a criminal offense to knowingly and willfully solicit, offer, receive or pay any remuneration in exchange for, or to induce, the referral of business, including the purchase, order, lease of any good, facility, item or service, that are reimbursable by a state or federal health care program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to the purchase of medical devices from a particular manufacturer or the referral of patients to a particular supplier of diagnostic services utilizing such devices. Although, there are established statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors that define certain financial transactions and practices that are not subject to the Anti-Kickback Statute, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all its facts and circumstances.
Generally, courts have taken a broad interpretation of the scope of the Anti-Kickback Statute, holding that the statute may be violated if merely one purpose of a payment arrangement is to induce referrals or purchases. Further, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
Violations of this law are punishable by up to five years in prison, and can also result in criminal fines, administrative civil money penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. In addition, a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act. Many states have also adopted statutes similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, some of which apply to payments in connection with the referral of patients for healthcare items or services reimbursed by any source, not only governmental payor programs.
False Claims Act. The federal civil False Claims Act prohibits anyone from knowingly and willfully presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment, that are false or fraudulent, such as claims for payment of services not provided as claimed. In addition to actions initiated by the government itself, the statute authorizes actions to be brought on behalf of the federal government by a private party having knowledge of the alleged fraud called a “relator”. Because the complaint is initially filed under seal, the action may be pending for some time before the defendant is even aware of the action. If the government is ultimately successful in obtaining redress in the matter or if the relator succeeds in obtaining redress without the government’s involvement, then the relator is typically entitled to receive a percentage of the recovery. When an entity is determined to have violated the False Claims Act, it may be required to pay up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus civil penalties for each separate false claim, and may be excluded from participation in federal health care programs, and, although the federal False Claims Act is a civil statute, violations may also implicate various federal criminal statutes. Several states have also adopted comparable state false claims act, some of which apply to all payors.
Civil monetary penalties laws. The civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person or entity that, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent.
Other fraud and abuse laws. HIPAA also created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Further, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statue or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. 
Physician payment transparency laws. There has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians and other healthcare providers and entities. The Affordable Care Act, among other things, imposed new reporting requirements on certain manufacturers, including certain device manufacturers, for payments provided to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Failure to submit timely, accurately, and completely the required information may result in civil monetary penalties for “knowing failures.” Device manufacturers must submit reports by the 90th day of each calendar year.
Certain states also mandate implementation of compliance programs, impose restrictions on device manufacturer marketing practices and/or require the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to healthcare providers and entities.
The laws and regulations and their enforcement are constantly undergoing change, and we cannot predict what effect, if any, changes may have on our business. In addition, new laws and regulations may be adopted which adversely affect our business. There has been a trend in recent years, both in the United States and internationally, toward more stringent regulation and enforcement of requirements applicable to medical device manufacturers and requirements regarding protection and confidentiality of personal data.
State Certificate of Need Laws
In some states, a certificate of need ("CON"), or similar regulatory approval is required by hospitals and other healthcare providers prior to the acquisition of high-cost capital items, including MRIdian, or the provision of new services. These laws generally require appropriate state agency determination of public need and approval prior to the acquisition of such capital items or addition of new services. CON requirements may preclude our customers from acquiring, or significantly delay acquisition of, MRIdian and/or from performing treatments using MRIdian. CON laws are the subject of ongoing legislative activity, and a significant increase in the number of states regulating the offering and use of MRIdian through CON or similar requirements could adversely affect us.
Healthcare Reform
In the United States and foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and we expect there will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system seeking, among other things, to reduce healthcare costs that could affect our results of operations.
Congress may seek changes in the Affordable Care Act, Medicare, RO Model and other federal health care programs that impact our business. Any changes in the Affordable Care Act, Medicare, RO Model or other federal health care programs may affect how state and federal governments and employers pay for health care products and services. Such changes could result in reduced demand for MRIdian or additional pricing pressure.
Similarly, we expect governments in other countries to continue introducing changes in their delivery, financing, and payment systems to reduce costs and improve outcomes. Some of these changes could result in reduced demand for MRIdian and bring additional price pressure.
Foreign Regulation of Medical Devices
Our activities outside the United States are subject to regulatory requirements that vary from country to country and frequently differ significantly from those in the United States. Failure to obtain and maintain regulatory approval or clearance in any foreign country in which we market or plan to market MRIdian and MRIdian Linac may have a negative effect on our ability to generate revenue and harm our business.
In general, MRIdian and MRIdian Linac are regulated outside the United States as medical devices by foreign governmental agencies similar to the FDA and the FTC. In addition, in foreign countries where we have operations or sell MRIdian, we are subject to laws and regulations applicable to manufacturers of medical devices, radiation producing devices and to the healthcare industry, and laws and regulation of general applicability relating to environmental protection, safe working conditions, manufacturing practices and other matters. These laws and regulations are often comparable to, or more stringent than U.S. laws and regulations. Our sales of MRIdian in foreign countries are also subject to regulation of 
matters such as product standards, packaging requirements, labeling requirements, import restrictions, tariff regulations, duties and tax requirements. We rely in some countries on our foreign distributors to assist us in complying with applicable regulatory requirements.
Regulation in the EU
In the European Union (the "EU") we are required under the European Medical Device Directive (Council Directive 93/42/EEC) to affix the CE mark to our MRIdian systems in order to sell the MRIdian systems in member countries of the EU. The CE mark is an international symbol that represents adherence to certain essential principles of safety and effectiveness mandated in the European Medical Device Directive (the so-called “essential requirements”). Once affixed, the CE mark enables a product to be sold within the EEA, which is composed of the 27 Member States of the EU plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein.
To demonstrate compliance with the essential requirements, we must undergo a conformity assessment procedure which varies according to the type of medical device and its classification. Except for certain low risk medical devices where the manufacturer can issue an EC Declaration of Conformity based on a self-assessment of the conformity of its products with the essential requirements of the Medical Devices Directive, a conformity assessment procedure requires the intervention of an organization accredited by a Member State of the EEA to conduct conformity assessments, or a Notified Body. Depending on the relevant conformity assessment procedure, the Notified Body would typically audit and examine the technical file and the quality system for the manufacture, design and final inspection of our devices. The Notified Body issues a CE Certificate of Conformity following successful completion of a conformity assessment procedure conducted in relation to the medical device and its manufacturer and their conformity with the essential requirements. This Certificate entitles the manufacturer to affix the CE mark to its medical devices after having prepared and signed a related EC Declaration of Conformity.
In September 2016, we received approval for CE mark for our MRIdian Linac (with a linear accelerator as the radiation source) in the EEA. In December 2019, we received approval for CE mark for modifications of the MRIdian Linac system.
If we modify MRIdian we may need to undergo a new conformity assessment procedure to be able to affix the CE mark to the modified product. Additionally, we will need to undergo new conformity assessments for any new products that we may develop in the future before we are able to affix the CE mark to these new products. We cannot be certain that the outcome of these conformity assessments will be positive and that we will be able to affix the CE mark for modified or new products or that we will continue to meet the quality and safety standards required to maintain the CE marks that we already have or may have in the future. In addition, if we are unable to affix the CE mark to our future products, we would be unable to sell them in EU member countries. 
In September 2012, the European Commission published proposals for the revision of the EU regulatory framework for medical devices. The proposals would replace the Medical Devices Directive and the Active Implantable Medical Devices Directive with two new regulations: the Medical Devices Regulation and the In-Vitro Diagnostic Medical Devices Regulation. Unlike directives, which must be implemented into the national laws of the EU Member States, the regulations would be directly applicable, i.e., without the need for adoption of EU Member State laws implementing them, in all EEA Member States and are intended to eliminate current differences in the regulation of medical devices among EEA Member States.
The Medical Devices Regulation applied to ViewRay starting on May 26, 2020. The new regulation among other things:
•strengthens the rules on placing devices on the market and reinforce surveillance once they are available;
•establishes explicit provisions on manufacturers' responsibilities for the follow-up of the quality, performance and safety of devices placed on the market; 
•improves the traceability of medical devices throughout the supply chain to the end-user or patient through a unique identification number; and
•sets up a central database to provide patients, healthcare professionals and the public with comprehensive information on products available in the EU.
Regulation in Other Countries
We will be subject to additional regulations in foreign countries in which we intend to market, sell and import MRIdian. We or our distributors must receive all necessary approvals or clearance prior to marketing and importing MRIdian in those international markets. We received a license and permission to import MRIdian into 15 countries and MRIdian A3i into 1 country. We will seek approvals in other countries as may be required in the future.
The International Standards Organization ("ISO") promulgates internationally recognized standards, including those for the requirements of quality systems. We are certified to the ISO 13485:2016 standard, which specify the quality system requirements for medical device manufacturers. To support our ISO certifications, we are subject to surveillance audits by a Notified Body yearly and recertification audits every three years that assess our continued compliance with the relevant ISO standards. Our most recent recertification audit occurred in February 2021.
