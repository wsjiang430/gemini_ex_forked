Item 1. Business
Corporate History
 
Photozou Holdings, Inc., ("Photozou Holdings," or the "Company"), was incorporated in the State of Delaware on September 29, 2014, with the purposes to engage in any lawful act or activity for which corporations may be organized under the General Corporation Law of Delaware (the "DGCL").
 
The Company was formed by Thomas DeNunzio, our former sole officer and director, for the purpose of creating a corporation which could be used to consummate a merger or acquisition.
 
On January 13, 2017, Thomas DeNunzio sold 8,000,000 shares of our restricted common stock, which represented all of our issued and outstanding shares at the time, to Photozou Co., Ltd., a Japan corporation.
 
The shares were sold for an aggregate purchase price of $100,000. Photozou Co., Ltd. is controlled by Koichi Ishizuka, a Japanese citizen. The aforementioned shares were sold pursuant to Regulation S of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended ("Regulation S"). No directed selling efforts were made in the United States.
 
On January 13, 2017, Mr. Thomas DeNunzio resigned as our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, President, Director, Secretary, and Treasurer. 
 
On January 13, 2017, Mr. Koichi Ishizuka was appointed as Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, President, Director, Secretary, and Treasurer.
 
On January 18, 2017, we changed our name from Exquisite Acquisition, Inc. to Photozou Holdings, Inc. 
 
Pursuant to our Registration Statement deemed effective on June 20, 2017, we, “the Company,” sold a total of 3,037,300 shares of our common stock. The proceeds totaled $75,933. These shares were sold pursuant to Rule 419.
 
On May 8, 2018, the Company conducted a stock cancellation of the above 3,037,300 shares and the total funds of $75,933 were returned to investors. The cancellation of the shares and return of funds was due to the fact that we did not make an acquisition in the allotted time granted by Rule 419.
 
On May 31, 2018, the Company entered into and consummated a Stock Purchase Agreement (the “Stock Purchase Agreement”) with Koichi Ishizuka, our President, CEO, and Director. At the closing of the Stock Purchase Agreement, Koichi Ishizuka transferred to the Company, 10,000 shares of common stock of Photozou Koukoku Co., Ltd., a Japan corporation (“Photozou Koukoku”), which represented all of its issued and outstanding shares, in consideration of 1,000,000 JPY ($9,190 USD as of the exchange rate May 31, 2018). The Company has since gained a 100% interest in the issued and outstanding shares of Photozou Koukoku’s common stock and Photozou Koukoku is now a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. The Company and Photozou Koukoku were under common control at the time of the acquisition.
 
Photozou Koukoku Co., Ltd. was incorporated under the laws of Japan on March 14, 2017. Currently, Photozou Koukoku is headquartered in Tokyo, Japan. The Company’s primary business is focused on online advertising and the sale of used cameras.
 
Overview
 
Our principal executive offices are located at 4-30-4F, Yotsuya, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo, 160-0004, Japan.
 
The Company has elected November 30th as its fiscal year end.
 
Currently, we operate through our wholly owned subsidiary, Photozou Koukoku Co., Ltd., “Photozou Koukoku” of which is engaged in advertising services and selling used cameras. 
 
Photozou Koukoku was incorporated under the laws of Japan on March 14, 2017.
 
Currently, Photozou Koukoku is headquartered at 4-30-4F, Yotsuya, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo, 160-0004, Japan. Photozou Koukoku’s office space is provided rent free by our Chief Executive Officer, Koichi Ishizuka.
 
Photozou Koukoku Co., Ltd.’s business operations are primarily focused around the sale of used cameras sold through the website https://shop.photozou.co.jp/, and online advertising through various channels. On April 17, 2017, Photozou Koukoku obtained a license to operate as a used goods merchant in Japan.
Background of Operations - Sale of Cameras
 
Photozou Koukoku deals used cameras as its primary business, which include mainly high-class digital single lens reflex cameras produced by well-known Japanese camera makers, e.g. Canon, Nikon, Fujifilm, etc.
 
The camera industry in Japan is a multi-billion dollar industry and cameras made in Japan have worldwide appeal and recognition. This is due to the fact that common household name camera manufacturers such as Canon, Nikon, Sony and several others, are headquartered in Japan and sell high end, digital cameras, generally associated with high quality.
 
The Company believes that due to the high quality of cameras created by Japanese camera makers that these will be the most appealing products to offer to the Japanese market.
 
However, should market trends shift and the demand for cameras of other companies see a surge in popularity then Photozou Koukoku may consider the possibility of acquiring and reselling cameras by other manufacturers. It may also consider the possibility of selling electronics that serve other purposes other than taking photographs, but have a camera embedded in them, such as camera phones. At this time however, the focus is to sell used high-class digital single lens reflex cameras.
 
 Purchasing
 
Photozou Koukoku primarily purchases used cameras from used camera dealers and individual consumers in Japan. Photozou Koukoku’s supporting website at http://photozou.jp/kaitori/top/ can be used by interested parties to access pertinent information relating to selling their cameras. For example, there is a section of the website which discloses a price list by product. Through the website they can also request an estimate, review Photozou Koukoku’s procedure for purchasing cameras and fill out an application to sell their camera. Currently, Photozou Koukoku has hired, as an independent contractor, Mr. Takaharu Ogami to handle the entirety of all purchasing and selling activities of Photozou Koukoku’s camera business. Relating to his services to Photozou Koukoku, Mr. Takaharu is paid a monthly fee in amount of JPY 400,000 ($3,600). Mr. Ogami’s efforts is responsible for the sale and shipping of the cameras at the expense of Photozou Koukoku. Photozou Koukoku is the legal owner of the camera(s) until the point of sale to the purchaser or purchaser(s).

Inventory
 
The Company consigns its operations regarding the sale of cameras to Mr. Ogami. Inventory however, remains under legal ownership of the Company.
 
As of November 30, 2018 and 2017, the Company held inventory comprised solely of used cameras in the amount of $10,740 and $44,207.
 
Selling
 
Photozou Koukoku sells used cameras to individual consumers through the supporting website at https://shop.photozou.co.jp/. Visitors to the site can view Photozou Koukoku’s current inventory which includes the specific brand and features of the cameras offered for sale. Additionally, from time to time cameras are sold online utilizing Yahoo auctions. Cameras are then shipped to the purchaser for a fee that is determined at a later date, and may differ on a case by case basis depending on the type of camera and method of delivery. In addition, Photozou Koukoku sells cameras to distributors through the sales efforts of Mr. Ogami.
 
Photozou Koukoku plans to expand its target customers to outside of Japan and intends to continuously evaluate the possibility of selling cameras directly to additional distributors.
 
 Advertising Services
 
At present, Photozou Koukoku conducts two types of advertising services. These services include managing online photo contests and web advertising services specifically geared toward advertisements that are placed on what is known as “The Photozou-Social Networking Service.” The aforementioned is a social networking website, primarily for photo sharing. Its web address can be found here: http://photozou.jp/?lang=en. The online social networking website is owned entirely by Photozou Co., Ltd., a Japan Corporation, which our CEO and Director, Koichi Ishizuka, also owns and controls in its entirety.
 
Herein, we may refer to the aforementioned social networking website as “the Photozou-SNS”, “SNS”, “the website” or “the social networking site.”
 
Photozou Koukoku develops banner ads for third party companies and subsequently assists those clients with having those advertisements placed on the Photozou-SNS. Fees are determined on a case by case basis and vary depending on whether or not Photozou Co., Ltd contracts Photozou Koukoku to work with a pre-existing client, or if Photozou Koukoku obtains the client on their own accord.
 
It is possible that the Company will expand into offering additional online advertising services, and will create advertisements in forms other than banner ads, but no such plans have been fully developed at this point in time.
 
As mentioned above the Company also manages and operates photo contests that take place on the SNS. The photo contests are funded by third parties and are used as a way to promote and advertise the business operations of the third party companies hosting the photo contest(s), through the social networking site. Fees for this service are also on a case by case basis and vary depending on whether or not Photozou Co., Ltd contracts Photozou Koukoku to work with a pre-existing client, or if Photozou Koukoku obtains the client on their own accord.
 
The typical model for photo contest(s) follows several steps. Initially the photo contest, and any applicable themes and guidelines, are announced on the Photozou-SNS (which has more than 7 million registered users). Secondly, the participants have about two to three months to submit their photographs to the photo contest. Subsequently, the photographs will be judged on certain criteria depending on the type of contest and then the announcement of results (winners) will take place on Photozou-SNS. In order to attract individuals to take part in the photo contest incentives like prizes are offered. The prizes differ on a case by case basis but may consist of a combination of cash, gift cards, or other goods.
 
For the year ended November 30, 2018, Photozou Koukoku managed and operated the “Wi-Ho Photo Contest” sponsored by Telecom Square Taiwan, Inc. This service was completed in May 2018.
 
Promotional activity
 
Our CEO, Koichi Ishizuka has verbally consented that we may utilize the SNS to promote and advertise our own services.
 
We believe there to be a clear synergy between the operations of Photozou Koukoku and the Photozou-SNS, as Photozou-SNS is a website where users can upload and share pictures taken with their cameras. It is our belief that many individuals who are sharing, browsing and evaluating photographs online will have an interest in purchasing cameras for personal use and potentially to upload more photos on the website. They may also potentially own a business that seeks to run a photo contest via the SNS which we may benefit from should they decide to do so.

Gross revenues from customers accounting for 10% or more of total revenues are as follows:
 
For the year ended November 30, 2018, 90.9% of the revenue from the sale of cameras was generated from one customer whose name was Hiroshi Funada in the amount of $605,217.

Future Plans
 
Over the next three months we, Photozou Koukoku, plan to develop our website further and begin advertising our inventory on Photozou-SNS. Additionally, we intend to increase our current level of inventory comprised of used cameras.
 
Subsequently, and over the next six months, we plan to increase the number of distributors and individual customers to whom we are directly selling used cameras. Additionally, there are plans, which are not fully developed, to expand the business and explore foreign markets.
