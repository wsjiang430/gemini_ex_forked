Item 1.  Business
Description of the Business and Background 
LivaNova PLC, headquartered in London, (collectively with its subsidiaries, the “Company,” “LivaNova,” “we” or “our”), is a global medical device company focused on the development and delivery of important therapeutic solutions for the benefit of patients, healthcare professionals and healthcare systems throughout the world. Working closely with our global team of medical professionals in the fields of cardiovascular disease and neuromodulation, we design, develop, manufacture and sell innovative therapeutic solutions that are consistent with our mission to improve our patients’ quality of life, increase the skills and capabilities of healthcare professionals and minimize healthcare costs. 
We were organized under the laws of England and Wales on February 20, 2015 for the purpose of facilitating the business combination of Cyberonics, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and Sorin S.p.A., a joint stock company organized under the laws of Italy. The business combination became effective in October 2015. LivaNova’s ordinary shares are listed for trading on the NASDAQ Global Market under the symbol “LIVN.”
Business Franchises
LivaNova is comprised of two principal business franchises, which are also our reportable segments: Cardiovascular (“CV”) and Neuromodulation (“NM”), corresponding to our primary therapeutic areas. Other corporate activities include corporate shared service expenses for finance, legal, human resources, information technology and New Ventures. New Ventures is focused on new growth platforms and identification of other opportunities for expansion. 
For further information regarding our business segments, historical financial information and our methodology for the presentation of financial results, please refer to “Item 15. Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Cardiovascular
Our CV business franchise is engaged in the development, production and sale of cardiopulmonary products, heart valves and advanced circulatory support products. Cardiopulmonary products include oxygenators, heart-lung machines, autotransfusion systems, perfusion tubing systems, cannulae and other related accessories. Heart valves include mechanical heart valves, tissue heart valves and related repair products. Advanced circulatory support, which represents our recently acquired TandemLife (“TandemLife”) business, includes temporary life support product kits that can include a combination of pumps, oxygenators and cannulae.
Cardiopulmonary Products
During conventional coronary artery bypass graft procedures and heart valve surgery, the patient’s heart is temporarily stopped, or arrested. The patient is placed on an extracorporeal circulatory support system that temporarily functions as the patient’s heart and lungs and provides blood flow to the body. Our products include systems to enable cardiopulmonary bypass, including heart-lung machines, oxygenators, perfusion tubing sets, cannulae and accessories, as well as related equipment and disposables for autotransfusion and autologous blood washing for neonatal, pediatric and adult patients. Our primary cardiopulmonary products include: 
 Heart-lung machines. The heart-lung machine product group includes heart-lung machines, heater coolers, related cardiac surgery equipment and maintenance services. 
Oxygenators and perfusion tubing systems. The oxygenators product group, which includes oxygenators and other disposable devices for extracorporeal circulation, includes the Inspire systems. The Inspire range of products, comprised of 12 models, provides perfusionists with a customizable approach for the benefit of patients. 
Autotransfusion systems. One of the key elements for a complete blood management strategy is autologous blood transfusion, which involves the collection, processing and reinfusion of the patient’s own blood lost at the surgical site during the perioperative period. 
Cannulae. Our cannulae product family, part of the oxygenator product group, is used to connect the extracorporeal circulation to the heart of the patient during cardiac surgery.
Connect. Connect is our perfusion charting system. Focused on real time and retrospective calculations and trending tools, Connect assists perfusionists with data management during and after cardiopulmonary bypass.

Heart Valves and Repair Products
We offer a comprehensive line of products to treat a variety of heart valve disorders, including a complete line of surgical tissue and mechanical valve replacements and repair products for damaged or diseased heart valves. Our heart valves and repair product offerings include: 
Self-anchoring tissue heart valves. Perceval is our sutureless bioprosthetic device designed to replace a diseased native valve or a malfunctioning prosthetic aortic valve using either traditional or minimally invasive heart surgery techniques. Perceval incorporates a unique technology that allows 100% sutureless positioning and anchoring at the implantation site. This, in turn, offers the potential benefit of reducing the time the patient spends in cardiopulmonary bypass.
Tissue heart valves. Our tissue valves include the Mitroflow aortic pericardial tissue valve with phospholipid reduction treatment (“PRT”), which is designed to mitigate valve calcification, and the Crown PRT and Solo Smart aortic pericardial tissue valves. Our Solo Smart aortic pericardial tissue valve is an innovative, completely biological aortic heart valve with no synthetic material and a removable stent. Solo Smart provides the ease of implantation of a stented valve with the hemodynamic performance of a stentless valve. 
Mechanical heart valves. Our wide range of mechanical valve offerings includes the Carbomedics Standard, Top Hat and Reduced Series Aortic Valves, as well as the Carbomedics Carbo-Seal and Carbo-Seal Valsalva aortic prostheses. We also offer the Carbomedics Standard, Orbis and Optiform mechanical mitral valves and Bicarbon Slimline, Bicarbon Fitline and Bicarbon Overline aortic and mitral valves.
Heart valve repair products. Mitral valve repair is a well-established solution for patients suffering from a leaky mitral valve, or mitral valve regurgitation (“MR”). We offer a wide range of mitral valve repair products, including the Memo 3D and Memo 3D ReChord, AnnuloFlo and AnnuloFlex. 
Advanced Circulatory Support Products
Our recently acquired TandemLife business simplifies temporary extracorporeal cardiopulmonary life support solutions for critically ill patients. Temporary life support kits can include a combination of pumps, oxygenators and cannulae.
Neuromodulation
Our NM business franchise designs, develops and markets NM-based medical devices for the treatment of epilepsy, depression and obstructive sleep apnea. We are also focused on the development and clinical testing of the VITARIA System for treating heart failure through vagus nerve stimulation (“VNS”). 
Our seminal NM product, the VNS Therapy System, is an implantable device authorized for the treatment of drug-resistant epilepsy and treatment-resistant depression (“TRD”). The VNS Therapy System consists of: an implantable pulse generator and connective lead that work to stimulate the vagus nerve; surgical equipment to assist with the implant procedure; equipment and instruction manuals enabling a treating physician to set parameters for a patient’s pulse generator; and for epilepsy, magnets to manually suspend or induce nerve stimulation. The VNS Therapy pulse generator and lead are surgically implanted in a subcutaneous pocket in the upper left chest area, generally during an out-patient procedure; the lead, which does not need to be removed to replace a generator with a depleted battery, is connected to the pulse generator and tunneled under the skin to the vagus nerve in the lower left side of the patient’s neck. 
Epilepsy
Globally, there are several broad types of treatment available to patients with epilepsy: multiple seizure medications; various forms of the ketogenic diet; vagus nerve stimulation; resective brain surgery; trigeminal nerve stimulation; responsive intracranial neurostimulation; and deep brain stimulation. Seizure medications typically serve as a first-line treatment and are prescribed for virtually all patients diagnosed with epilepsy. After two seizure medications fail to deliver seizure control, the epilepsy is defined as drug-resistant, at which point, adjunctive non-drug options are considered, including VNS therapy, brain surgery and a ketogenic diet. 
Our VNS Therapy System was the first medical device treatment approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) in 1997 for refractory, drug-resistant epilepsy in adults and adolescents over 12 years of age and is indicated for use as an adjunctive therapy in reducing the frequency of seizures. In June 2017, the FDA approved our VNS Therapy device for use in patients who are at least four years of age and have partial onset seizures that are refractory to antiepileptic medications. In addition, in June 2017, we received FDA approval, and in August 2017, we received CE Mark approval, for our VNS Therapy device for expanded magnetic resonance imaging (“MRI”) labeling affirming VNS Therapy as the only epilepsy device approved by the FDA for MRI scans. Currently, SenTiva, AspireHC and AspireSR models of VNS Therapy technology provide 
6

for this expanded MRI access. Other worldwide regulatory bodies have also approved the VNS Therapy System for the treatment of epilepsy, many without age restrictions or seizure-type limitations. 
We sell a number of VNS Therapy System product models for the treatment of epilepsy, including our Model 102 (Pulse), Model 102R (Pulse Duo), Model 103 (Demipulse), Model 104 (Demipulse Duo), Model 105 (AspireHC) and Model 106 (AspireSR) and the Model 1000 (SenTiva) pulse generators. Our AspireSR generator provides the benefits of VNS Therapy, with an additional feature: automatic stimulation in response to detection of changes in heart rate potentially indicative of a seizure. The SenTiva generator is the smallest and lightest device capable of delivering responsive therapy for epilepsy. 
Depression
In July 2005, the FDA approved the VNS Therapy System for the adjunctive treatment of chronic or recurrent depression for patients 18 years or older who are experiencing a major depressive episode and have not had an adequate response to four or more antidepressant treatments. In May 2007, the United States (“U.S.”) Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) issued a national determination of non-coverage within the U.S. with respect to reimbursement of the VNS Therapy System for patients with TRD, significantly limiting access to this therapeutic option for most patients. In May 2018, CMS published a tracking sheet to reconsider its National Coverage Determination (“NCD”) of our VNS Therapy System for TRD in response to a letter that we submitted to CMS requesting a formal reconsideration of the NCD. We requested this review after a significant body of new evidence emerged about TRD and the role of VNS Therapy in its treatment. On February 15, 2019, we announced that CMS finalized its NCD to expand Medicare coverage for VNS Therapy for TRD. With the decision, CMS initiated coverage for Medicare beneficiaries through Coverage with Evidence Development when offered in a CMS-approved, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial with a follow-up duration of at least one year, with the possibility of extending the study to a prospective longitudinal study. We intend to commence a clinical study that meet these requirements. Enrollment will likely begin in the third quarter of 2019 and could take as long as 18 months to enroll approximately 500 patients. 
Obstructive Sleep Apnea
In January 2018, we acquired ImThera Medical, Inc. (“ImThera”), a privately held emerging-growth company developing an implantable neurostimulation device system for the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea. The NM product line now includes ImThera’s implantable device for the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea that stimulates multiple tongue muscles via the hypoglossal nerve, which opens the airway while a patient is sleeping. ImThera has a commercial presence in the European market, and an FDA pivotal study is ongoing in the U.S. 
Corporate Activities and New Ventures
Corporate activities include shared services for finance, legal, human resources and information technology and New Ventures. The New Ventures group evaluates growth opportunities and new potential areas of investment to expand our product portfolio to meet emerging patient needs. 
Discontinued Operations
We completed the sale of our Cardiac Rhythm Management (“CRM”) business franchise to MicroPort Cardiac Rhythm B.V. and MicroPort Scientific Corporation (the “CRM Sale”) on April 30, 2018. We previously concluded that the sale of CRM represents a strategic shift in our business that will have a major effect on future operations and financial results. Accordingly, the results of operations of the CRM business franchise are reflected as discontinued operations for all periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and related assets and liabilities are presented as held for sale at December 31, 2017. For further information, refer to “Note 5. Discontinued Operations” in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes, beginning on page F-1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Research and Development (“R&D”)
The markets in which we participate are subject to rapid technological advances. Product improvement and innovation are necessary to maintain market leadership. Our R&D efforts are directed toward maintaining or achieving technological leadership in each of the markets we serve to help ensure that patients using our devices and therapies receive the most advanced and effective treatment possible. We remain committed to developing technological enhancements and new uses for existing products and less invasive and new technologies for new and emerging markets to address unmet patient needs. That commitment leads us to initiate and participate in many clinical trials each year as the demand for clinical and economic evidence remains high. We also expect our development activities to help reduce patient care costs and the length of hospital stays in the future. 
Approximately 16% of our employees work in R&D improving existing products and therapies, expanding their uses and applications and developing new products. We continue to focus on optimizing innovation and assessing the ability of our R&D 
7

programs to deliver economic value to the customer. More specifically, our current R&D expenses consist of product design and development efforts, clinical study programs and regulatory activities, which are essential to our strategic portfolio initiatives, including transcatheter mitral valve replacement (“TMVR”), TRD and heart failure. 
Acquisitions and Investments
Our strategy of providing a broad range of therapies requires a wide variety of technologies, products and capabilities. The rapid pace of technological development in the medical industry and the specialized expertise required in different areas of medicine make it difficult for one company alone to develop a broad portfolio of technological solutions. In addition to internally generated growth through R&D efforts, we have historically relied, and expect to continue to rely, on acquisitions, investments and alliances to provide access to new technologies in both new and existing markets. 
We expect to further our strategic objectives and strengthen our existing businesses by making future acquisitions or investments in areas that we believe we can acquire or stimulate the development of new technologies and products. Mergers and acquisitions of medical technology companies are inherently risky, and no assurance can be given that any of our previous or future acquisitions will be successful or will not materially adversely affect our consolidated operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. 
Caisson Interventional, LLC (“Caisson”)
In May 2017, we acquired the remaining 51% equity interest in Caisson, a clinical-stage medical device company focused on the design, development and clinical evaluation of a novel TMVR implant device. The device is designed for treating MR through replacement of the native mitral valve using a fully transvenous delivery system. 
ImThera
In January 2018, we acquired the remaining 86% outstanding interest in ImThera; we previously held 14% of ImThera’s outstanding equity. ImThera is focused on neurostimulation for the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea. ImThera manufactures an implantable device that stimulates multiple tongue muscles via the hypoglossal nerve, which opens the airway while a patient is sleeping. The financial results of ImThera are included within NM. 
TandemLife 
In April 2018, we acquired CardiacAssist, Inc., doing business as TandemLife. TandemLife is focused on the delivery of leading-edge temporary life support systems, including cardiopulmonary and respiratory support solutions. The financial results of TandemLife are included within CV. 
Patents and Licenses 
We rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, and non-disclosure and non-competition agreements to protect our intellectual property. We generally file patent applications in the U.S. and countries where patent protection for our technology is appropriate and available. As of December 31, 2018, we held more than 1,200 issued patents worldwide, with approximately 250 pending patent applications that cover various aspects of our technology. Patents typically have a 20-year term from the application filing date. In addition, we hold exclusive and non-exclusive licenses to a variety of third-party technologies covered by patents and pending patent applications. There can be no assurance that pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents, that patents issued to or licensed by us will not be challenged or circumvented by competitors, or that these patents will be found to be valid or sufficiently broad to protect our technology or to provide us with a competitive advantage. We have also obtained certain trademarks and trade names for our products and maintain certain details about our processes, products and strategies as trade secrets. In the aggregate, these intellectual property assets are considered to be of material importance to our business segments and operations. We regularly review third-party patents and patent applications in an effort to protect our intellectual property and avoid disputes over proprietary rights. 
We rely on non-disclosure and non-competition agreements with employees, consultants and other parties to protect, in part, trade secrets and other proprietary technology. There can be no assurance that these agreements will not be breached, that we will have adequate remedies for any breach, that others will not independently develop equivalent proprietary information or that third parties will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets and proprietary knowledge.
For additional information, please refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, under the section entitled “We are substantially dependent on patent and other proprietary rights and failing to protect such rights or to be successful in litigation related to our rights or the rights of others may result in our payment of significant monetary damages and/or royalty payments, negatively impact our ability to sell current or future products, or prohibit us from enforcing our patent and other proprietary rights against others.”

Markets and Distribution Methods
The three largest markets for our medical devices are the U.S., Europe and Japan. Emerging markets are an area of increasing focus and opportunity for us. We sell most of our medical devices through direct sales representatives in the U.S. and a combination of direct sales representatives and independent distributors in markets outside the U.S.
Our marketing and sales strategy is focused on rapid, cost-effective delivery of high-quality products to a diverse group of customers worldwide, including perfusionists, neurologists, neurosurgeons and other physicians, hospitals and other medical institutions and healthcare providers. To achieve this objective, we maintain a highly knowledgeable and dedicated sales staff that is able to foster strong relationships with such a broad range of customers. We maintain excellent working relationships with professionals in the medical industry, which provides us with a detailed understanding of therapeutic and diagnostic developments, trends and emerging opportunities, enabling us to respond quickly to the changing needs of providers and patients. We actively participate in medical meetings and conduct comprehensive training and educational activities in an effort to enhance our presence in the medical community, and we believe that these activities also contribute to healthcare professionals’ expertise. 
Due to the emphasis on cost-effectiveness in healthcare delivery, the current trend among hospitals and other medical device customers is to consolidate into larger purchasing groups in order to enhance purchasing power. As a result, customer transactions have become increasingly complex. Enhanced purchasing power may also lead to pressure on pricing and an increase in the use of preferred vendors. Our customer base continues to evolve to reflect such economic changes across the geographic markets we serve.
Competition and Industry
We compete in the medical device market in more than 5,000 hospitals in more than 100 countries. This market is characterized by rapid change resulting from technological advances and scientific discoveries. Our competitors across our product portfolio range from large manufacturers with multiple business lines to small manufacturers offering a limited selection of specialized products. In addition, we face competition from providers of alternative medical therapies, such as pharmaceutical companies and providers of cannabis.
Product problems, physician advisories, safety alerts and publications about our products can cause major shifts in industry market share, reflecting the importance of product quality, product efficacy and quality systems in the medical device industry. In addition, because of developments in managed care, economically motivated customers, consolidation among healthcare providers, increased competition and declining reimbursement rates, we may be increasingly required to compete on the basis of price. In order to continue to compete effectively, we must continue to create or acquire advanced technology, incorporate this technology into proprietary products, obtain regulatory approvals in a timely manner, maintain high-quality manufacturing processes and successfully market these products. 
Cardiovascular
Our primary medical device competitors in the CV product group are Terumo Medical Corporation, Maquet Medical Systems, Medtronic plc, Haemonetics Corporation, Edwards Lifesciences Corp. and Abbott Laboratories, Inc. (formerly St. Jude Medical, Inc.), although not all competitors are present in all product lines. 
Neuromodulation
Our primary medical device competitors in the NM product group are NeuroPace, Inc. and Medtronic plc.
Production, Quality Systems and Raw Materials
We manufacture a majority of our products at nine manufacturing facilities located in Italy, Germany, the U.S., Canada, Brazil and Australia. We purchase raw materials and many of the components used in our manufacturing facilities from numerous suppliers in various countries. For quality assurance, sole source availability or cost effectiveness purposes, we may procure certain components and raw materials from a sole supplier. We work closely with our suppliers to ensure continuity of supply while maintaining high quality and reliability. The quality systems we utilize in the design, production, warehousing and distribution of our products are designed to ensure that our products are safe and effective. In addition, we utilize environmental management systems and safety programs to protect the environment and our employees. For additional information related to our manufacturing facilities, refer to “Item 2. Properties” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Government Regulation and Other Considerations
Our medical devices are subject to regulation by numerous government agencies, including the FDA and counterpart agencies outside the U.S. To varying degrees, each of these agencies require us to comply with laws and regulations governing 
9

the research, development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, pre-market clearance or approval, marketing, distribution, advertising, promotion, record keeping, reporting, tracking, and importing and exporting of medical devices. Our business is also affected by patient privacy and security laws, cost containment initiatives, and environmental health and safety laws and regulations worldwide.
The laws applicable to us are subject to changing and evolving interpretations. If a governmental authority were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, we and our officers and employees could be subject to severe civil and criminal penalties, including substantial fines and damages, and exclusion from participation as a supplier of product to beneficiaries covered by government programs, among other potential enforcement actions. 
Product Approval and Monitoring
Many countries where we sell medical devices subject such medical devices and technologies to their own approval and other regulatory requirements regarding performance, safety and quality of our products. The following provides a brief overview of the oversight and requirements to which we are subject for the commercial distribution of our products in the U.S., Europe and Japan, the largest markets for our medical devices. 
Each medical device we seek to distribute commercially in the U.S. must receive 510(k) clearance or pre-market approval (“PMA”) from the FDA, unless specifically exempted by the agency. The first, known as pre-market notification or the 510(k) process, requires us to demonstrate that our new medical device is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed medical device. The second, and more rigorous PMA process, requires us to independently demonstrate that a medical device is safe and effective for its intended use. The PMA process is generally much more time-consuming and expensive than the 510(k) process. One or more clinical studies may be required to support a 510(k) application and are almost always required to support a PMA application.
In the European Union (“EU”), a single regulatory approval process exists, and conformity with the legal requirements is represented by the CE Mark. To obtain a CE Mark, defined products must meet minimum standards of performance, safety and quality (i.e., the essential requirements), and then, according to their classification, comply with one or more of a selection of conformity assessment routes. To demonstrate compliance with the essential requirements, we must undergo a conformity assessment procedure, which varies according to the type of medical device and its classification. As a general rule, demonstration of conformity of medical devices and their manufacturers with the essential requirements must be based, among other things, on the evaluation of clinical data supporting the safety and performance of the products during normal conditions of use. The competent authorities of the EU countries separately regulate the clinical research for medical devices and the market surveillance of products once they are placed on the market and manufacturers with CE marked devices are subject to regular inspections to monitor compliance with the applicable directives and essential requirements. A new Medical Device Regulation (“Reg MDR”) was published by the EU in 2017, which will impose significant additional premarket and postmarket requirements. The regulation has a three-year implementation period. At the end of this transition period, national competent authorities and manufacturers must implement and ensure compliance with the changes enacted in Reg MDR. Among other things, this new regulation imposes additional reporting requirements on manufacturers of high-risk medical devices and provides for more strict clinical evidence requirements. We have initiated activities to ensure compliance with Reg MDR in the applicable timeframe.
To be sold in Japan, our medical devices must undergo thorough safety examinations and demonstrate medical efficacy before they are granted approval. The Japanese government, through the ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, regulates medical devices under the Pharmaceutical Affairs Law (“PAL”). Penalties for a company’s noncompliance with PAL can be severe, including revocation or suspension of a company’s business license and criminal sanctions. Japanese regulatory bodies also assess the quality management systems of the manufacturer and product conformity to the requirements of PAL. We are subject to compliance investigations by these agencies.
Many countries in which we sell our products (outside of the U.S., the EU and Japan) have their own regulatory requirements for medical devices. Most of these countries require that product approvals be recertified on a regular basis, generally every four to five years. The recertification process requires that we evaluate any device changes and any new regulations or standards relevant to the device and, where needed, conduct appropriate testing to document continued compliance. Where recertification applications are required, they must be approved in order to continue selling our products in those countries.
The global regulatory environment is increasingly stringent and unpredictable. Several countries that did not have regulatory requirements for medical devices have established such requirements in recent years, and other countries have expanded, or plan to expand, their existing regulations. While harmonization of global regulations has been pursued, requirements continue to differ significantly among countries. We expect this global regulatory environment will continue to evolve, which could 
10

impact the cost, the time needed to approve, and ultimately, our ability to maintain existing approvals or obtain future approvals for our products.
Promotional Restrictions
Both before and after we release a product for commercial distribution, we have ongoing responsibilities under various laws and regulations governing medical devices. Regulations of the FDA and other regulatory agencies in and outside the U.S. impose extensive compliance and monitoring obligations on our business. These agencies review our design and manufacturing practices, labeling, record keeping, and manufacturers’ required reports of adverse experiences and other information to identify potential problems with marketed medical devices. We are also subject to periodic inspections for compliance with applicable quality system regulations, which govern the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the design, manufacture, packaging and servicing of finished medical devices intended for human use. In addition to FDA regulatory requirements, the FDA and other U.S. regulatory bodies (including the Federal Trade Commission, the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Justice and various state Attorneys General) monitor the manner in which we promote and advertise our products. Although physicians are permitted to use their medical judgment to employ medical devices for indications other than those cleared or approved by the FDA, we are prohibited from promoting products for such “off-label” uses and can only market our products for cleared or approved uses. 
Any adverse regulatory action, depending on its magnitude, may limit our ability to effectively market and sell our products, limit our ability to obtain future premarket approvals or result in a substantial modification to our business practices and operations. For additional information, see "Item 1A. Risk Factors" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, under the section entitled “We are subject to costly and complex laws and governmental regulations and any adverse regulatory action may materially adversely affect our financial condition and business operations.”
Governmental Trade Regulations 
The sale and shipment of our products and services across international borders, as well as the purchase of components and products from international sources, subjects us to extensive governmental trade regulations. A variety of laws and regulations apply to the sale, shipment and provision of goods, services and technology across international borders. Many countries control the export and re-export of goods, technology and services for public health, national security, regional stability, antiterrorism and other reasons. Some governments may also impose economic sanctions against certain countries, persons or entities. In certain circumstances, governmental authorities may require that we obtain an approval before we export or re-export goods, technology or services to certain destinations, to certain end-users and for certain end-uses. Because we are subject to extensive regulations in the countries in which we operate, we are subject to the risk that laws and regulations could change in a way that would expose us to additional costs, penalties or liabilities. These laws and regulations govern, among other things, our import and export activities.
We also sell and provide goods, technology and services to agents, representatives and distributors who may export such items to customers and end-users, and if these third parties violate applicable export control and economic sanctions laws and regulations when engaging in transactions involving our products, we may be subject to varying degrees of liability depending on the extent of our participation in the transaction. The activities of these third parties may cause disruption or delays in the distribution and sales of our products or result in restrictions being placed on our international distribution and sales of products, which may materially impact our business activities.
Patient Privacy and Security Laws 
We are subject to various laws worldwide that protect the confidentiality of certain patient health information, including patient medical records, and restrict the use and disclosure of patient health information by healthcare providers. Privacy standards in Europe and Asia are becoming increasingly strict, enforcement action and financial penalties related to privacy in the EU are growing, and new laws and restrictions are being passed. The management of cross-border transfers of information among and outside of EU member countries is becoming more complex, which may complicate our clinical research activities, as well as product offerings that involve transmission or use of clinical data. We will continue our efforts to comply with those requirements and to adapt our business processes to those standards.
In the U.S., the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), as amended by the Health Information Technology and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”) and their respective implementing regulations impose specified requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to “business associates,” defined as independent contractors or agents of covered entities that create, receive, maintain or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. We may be deemed to operate as a business associate to covered entities in a limited number of instances. In those cases, the patient data that we receive may include protected 
11

health information, as defined under HIPAA. Enforcement actions can be costly and interrupt regular operations of our business. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways, thus complicating compliance efforts.
In the EU, Regulation 2016/679 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (“General Data Protection Regulation” or “GDPR”) came into effect in May 2018. The GDPR replaces Directive 95/46/EC (“Data Protection Directive”). While many of the principles of the GDPR reflect those of the Data Protection Directive, for example in relation to the requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information, there are a number of changes. In particular: (1) proactive compliance measures are introduced, such as the requirement to carry out a Privacy Impact Assessment and to appoint a Data Protection Officer where health data is processed on a “large scale.” Although “large scale” is not defined, it is likely that clinical trials involving substantial numbers of patients (or healthy volunteers if applicable) would mean that such requirements apply to us; and (2) the administrative fines that can be levied are significantly increased, the maximum being the higher of €20 million (approximately $22.9 million), or 4%, of the total worldwide annual turnover of the group in the previous financial year.
Cost Containment Initiatives 
Government and private sector initiatives to limit the growth of healthcare costs, including price regulation, competitive pricing, bidding and tender mechanics, coverage and payment policies, comparative effectiveness of therapies, technology assessments and managed-care arrangements are continuing in many countries where we do business. These changes are causing the marketplace to put increased emphasis on the delivery of more cost-effective medical devices and therapies. Government programs, private healthcare insurance and managed-care plans have attempted to control costs by limiting the extent of coverage or amount of reimbursement available for particular procedures or treatments, tying reimbursement to outcomes, shifting to population health management, and other mechanisms designed to constrain utilization and contain costs. Hospitals, which purchase implants, are also seeking to reduce costs through a variety of mechanisms, including, for example, creating centralized purchasing functions that set pricing and, in some cases, limit the number of vendors that can participate in the purchasing program. Hospitals are also aligning their interests with those of physicians through employment and other arrangements, such as gainsharing, whereby a hospital agrees with physicians to share certain realized cost savings resulting from the physicians’ collective change in practice patterns, such as standardization of devices where medically appropriate, and participation in affordable care organizations. Such alignment has created increasing levels of price sensitivity among customers for our products. 
Some third-party payers must also approve coverage and set reimbursement levels for new or innovative devices or therapies before they will reimburse healthcare providers who use the medical devices or therapies. Even though a new medical device may be cleared for commercial distribution, we may find limited demand for the device until coverage and sufficient reimbursement levels have been obtained from governmental and private third-party payers. In addition, some private third-party payers require that certain procedures or the use of certain products be authorized in advance as a condition of coverage. 
For example, in the U.S., the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively, the “Affordable Care Act”), has the potential to substantially change healthcare financing and delivery by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impact the pharmaceutical and medical device industries. The Affordable Care Act imposed, among other things, an annual excise tax of 2.3% on any entity that manufactures or imports medical devices offered for sale in the U.S. Due to subsequent legislative amendments, the excise tax has been suspended for the period January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2019, and, absent further legislative action, will be reinstated starting January 1, 2020.
International examples of cost containment initiatives and healthcare reforms in markets significant to our business include Japan, where the government reviews reimbursement rate benchmarks every two years. Such reviews may significantly reduce reimbursement for procedures using our medical devices or result in the denial of coverage for those procedures. As a result of our manufacturing efficiencies, cost controls and other cost-savings initiatives, we believe we are well-positioned to respond to changes resulting from this worldwide trend toward cost containment; however, uncertainty remains as to the nature of any future legislation or other reforms, making it difficult for us to predict the potential impact of cost-containment trends on future operating results. 
Applicability of Anti-Corruption Laws and Regulations
Our worldwide business is subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (the “FCPA”), the United Kingdom (the “UK”) Bribery Act of 2010 (the “UK Bribery Act”) and other anti-corruption laws and regulations applicable in the jurisdictions where we operate. The FCPA can be used to prosecute companies in the U.S. for arrangements with physicians or other parties outside the U.S. if the physician or party is a government official of another country and prohibited payments are

made to obtain or retain business. The UK Bribery Act prohibits both domestic and international bribery, as well as bribery across both public and private sectors. There are similar laws and regulations applicable to us outside the U.S. and the UK, all of which are subject to evolving interpretations. For additional information, please refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, under the section entitled “The failure to comply with anti-bribery laws could materially adversely affect our business and result in civil and/or criminal sanctions.”
Health Care Fraud and Abuse Laws 
We are also subject to U.S. federal and state government healthcare regulation and enforcement and government regulations in other countries in which we conduct our business.
The U.S. Anti-Kickback Statute (the “Anti-Kickback Statute”) is subject to evolving interpretations. In the past, the U.S. government has enforced the Anti-Kickback Statute to reach large settlements with healthcare companies based on sham consulting and other financial arrangements with physicians. The majority of states in the U.S. also have anti-kickback laws with similar prohibitions, and in some cases may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers. 
Additionally, violations of the U.S. False Claims Act (the “False Claims Act”) can result in significant monetary penalties and treble damages. The federal government is using the False Claims Act, and the accompanying threat of significant financial liability, in its investigation and prosecution of device and biotechnology companies throughout the U.S., for example, in connection with the promotion of products for unapproved uses and other sales and marketing practices. The U.S. government has obtained multi-million and multi-billion-dollar settlements under the False Claims Act, in addition to individual criminal convictions under applicable criminal statutes. Given the significant size of actual and potential settlements, we anticipate that the U.S. government will continue to devote substantial resources to investigating healthcare providers’ and manufacturers’ compliance with applicable fraud and abuse laws. 
HIPAA includes federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors; knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program; willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense; and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
There has also been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians and other healthcare providers. The Affordable Care Act, among other things, imposes additional reporting requirements on certain device manufacturers for payments made by them to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of $150,000 per year (or up to an aggregate of $1 million per year for “knowing failures”), for all payments, transfers of value, or ownership or investment interests that are not timely, accurately and completely reported in an annual submission. Device manufacturers must submit reports to the government by the 90th day of each calendar year. Certain states also mandate implementation of compliance programs, impose restrictions on device manufacturer marketing practices and/or require the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to physicians. 
The shifting commercial compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust systems to comply with different compliance and/or reporting requirements in multiple jurisdictions increase the possibility that a healthcare company may violate one or more of the requirements. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to it, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, and exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. 
Environmental Health and Safety Laws 
We are also subject to various environmental health and safety laws and regulations worldwide. Like other medical device companies, our manufacturing and other operations involve the use and transportation of substances regulated under environmental health and safety laws including those related to the transportation of hazardous materials. To the best of our knowledge at this time, we do not expect that compliance with environmental protection laws will have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

Working Capital Practices
Our goal is to carry sufficient levels of inventory to ensure adequate supply of raw materials from suppliers and meet the product delivery needs of our customers. To meet the operational demands of our customers, we also provide payment terms to customers in the normal course of business and rights to return product under warranty. 
Disclosure Pursuant to Section 13(r) of the Exchange Act of 1934
Section 13(r) of the Exchange Act requires issuers to disclose in their annual reports certain types of dealings with Iran, including transactions or dealing with government-owned entities, even when those activities are lawful and do not involve U.S. persons. LivaNova has sold medical devices to Iran since we were formed in 2015. Two of our non-U.S. subsidiaries currently sell medical devices, including cardiac surgery and cardiopulmonary products, to privately held distributors in Iran.
We have limited visibility into the identity of these distributors’ customers in Iran. It is possible that their customers include entities, such as government-owned hospitals or sub-distributors, that are owned or controlled directly or indirectly by the Iranian government. To the best of our knowledge at this time, we do not have any contracts or commercial arrangements with the Iranian government.
For the year ended December 31, 2018, our gross revenues and net profits attributable to the above-mentioned Iranian activities were $10.3 million and $3.7 million, respectively. 
We believe our activities are consistent with applicable law, including U.S., EU, and other applicable sanctions laws, though such laws are complex and continue to evolve rapidly. We intend to continue our business in Iran.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we employed approximately 4,000 employees worldwide. Our employees are vital to our success, and we are engaged in an ongoing effort to identify, hire, manage and maintain the talent necessary to meet our business objectives. We believe that we have been successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel in a highly competitive labor market due, in large part, to our competitive compensation and benefits and our rewarding work environment, fostering employee professional training and development and providing employees with opportunities to contribute to our continued growth and success. 
Seasonality
For both of our segments, the number of medical procedures incorporating our products is generally lower during the summer months, particularly in European countries, due to summer vacation schedules.
