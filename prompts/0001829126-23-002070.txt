ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
 
Plandaí Biotechnology, Inc. (the “Company”) and its subsidiaries focus on the production of proprietary botanical extracts for the nutriceutical and pharmaceutical industries. The company grows the green tea used in its products on a 3,000-hectare estate in the Mpumalanga region of South Africa. Plandaí uses a proprietary extraction process that is designed to yield highly bioavailable products of pharmaceutical-grade purity. The first product brought to market is Phytofare™ Catechin Complex, a green-tea derived extract that has multiple potential wellness applications.
 
The Company was incorporated as Jerry’s Inc., in the State of Florida on November 30, 1942. The company catered airline flights and operated coffee shops, lounges and gift shops at airports and other facilities located in Florida, Alabama, and Georgia. The company’s airline catering services included the preparation of meals in kitchens located at, or adjacent to, airports and the distribution of meals and beverages for service on commercial airline flights. The company also provided certain ancillary services, including, among others, the preparation of beverage service carts, the unloading and cleaning of plates, utensils and other accessories arriving on incoming aircraft, and the inventory management and storage of airline-owned dining service equipment. In March of 2004 we moved our domicile to Nevada and changed our name to Diamond Ranch Foods, Ltd. Diamond Ranch Foods, Ltd. was engaged in the meat processing and distribution industry focusing on the eastern seaboard of the United States. Operations consisted of packing, processing, custom meat cutting, portion-controlled meats, private labeling, and distribution of our products to a diversified customer base, including, but not limited to: in-home food service businesses, retailers, hotels, restaurants and institutions, deli and catering operators, and industry suppliers. On November 17, 2011, the Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary, Plandaí Biotechnologies, Inc. consummated a share exchange with Global Energy Solutions Corporation Limited, an Irish corporation. Under the terms of the Share Exchange, GES received 76,000,000 shares of Diamond Ranch that had been previously issued to Plandaí Biotechnologies, Inc. in exchange for 100% of the issued and outstanding capital of GES. On November 21, 2011, the Company filed an amendment to the Articles of Incorporation to change the name of the company to Plandaí Biotechnology, Inc. GES was subsequently folded up into Plandaí and the legal status terminated, leaving Plandaí Biotechnology, Inc. as the surviving entity.
 
During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, the Company began shipping product to customers and recording sales. However, a hailstorm at during the quarter destroyed much of the crop of tea and there was insufficient time remaining in the growing season for another harvest. As a result, sales for the final quarter were limited. The Company is actively pursuing additional financing and has had discussions with various third parties, although no firm commitments have been obtained. Management believes these efforts, combined with projected sales for fiscal 2016, will generate sufficient cash flows from future operations to pay the Company’s obligations and realize positive cash flow. There is no assurance any of these transactions will occur. In April 2012, through our subsidiary companies, we secured a 100 million Rand financing (approximately $13 million at time of financing, $7.24 million at then current exchange rates) with the Land and Agriculture Bank of South Africa which has been used to build infrastructure and further operations. During the year ended June 30, 2015, the Company borrowed a total of $6,490,000 from third parties to sustain operations and complete the construction of the production facility in South Africa.
 
PRODUCTS AND SERVICES
 
Gaelic for “plant food”, Plandaí is a biotech company dedicated to taking all-natural nutraceutical ingredients and unlocking their pharmaceutical potential. We believe that by delivering a therapeutic level of essential plant-based nutrients to human cells, we can treat many of the diseases that plague mankind. From viruses to cancers to neural disorders like Alzheimer’s, science has shown that plants have tremendous curative properties. However, current extraction methods fail to produce products that can be properly absorbed and remain in the system long enough for a therapeutic effect. Plandaí’s technology restructures plant nutrients into a highly purified form that the body can more easily process while also increasing their absorption into the blood plasma and the length of time those nutrients remain present and active in your system.
 

Many common pharmaceutical products have their origins rooted in plants and “natural” medicine. For example, the active ingredient of aspirin was first discovered from the bark of the willow tree. In 1763 Edward Stone of Wadham College, University of Oxford, discovered salicylic acid, the active ingredient of aspirin, which was later synthesized by the German company Bayer® in 1897. The reason that these “natural” medicines are usually supplanted by synthetic drugs can be attributed to a few things but most notably the need to increase the absorption of the active ingredient by the human body, which is called bioavailability.

Our Phytofare® products are all specially formulated to have extremely high bioavailability, which was validated in in human clinical trials completed in June 2015. In practical terms, this means that we are able to deliver more of the vital plant nutrients to the blood plasma where it remains at a therapeutic level for over 24 hours.
 
Compared with generic green tea extract, Plandaí’s Phytofare® Catechin Complex exhibits specific advantageous properties:
 

1. | Phytofare® contains all of the phytonutrients in a stable, active extract. For example, with green tea, Phytofare® has all 8 catechins compared to just 2 in generic. The difference is greater efficacy and improved synergy.
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Because Phytofare® consists of mostly nano-sized particles, we can achieve greater cellular uptake.
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | Phytofare® is more bioavailable than generic extracts. In fact, it has 10 times greater bioavailability.
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4. | Phytofare has 4 times greater residency in the blood plasma, 24 hours compared to 6. This means it can be an effective “once a day” dose.
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


5. | Phytofare® offers greater stability over generic. In fact, studies have shown that Phytofare® still retains over 70% of its catechin efficacy after 90-day exposure, whereas generic catechins are completely gone.
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


6. | Our cost per dose is a fraction of our nearest competitor.
---+-----------------------------------------------------------

 
Many botanical extracts have demonstrated varying degrees of health benefit, and many pharmaceutical drugs are either derived directly from plant extracts or are synthetic analogs of phytonutrient molecules. Green tea catechins, for example, have shown promising in-vitro results as an antioxidant, with hundreds of different published studies demonstrating its potential usefulness in weight loss, anti-viral, anti-cancer, and anti-parasitic applications, amongst others.
 
The company recently concluded human clinical study on Plandaí’s inaugural product, Phytofare® Catechin Complex made from green tea. The test results forced us to coin a new term to describe what our extraction process was accomplishing: phyto-availability™. Phyto-availability™ is the combination of Phyofare’s® unique properties:
 

1. | Demonstrates Ultra-high bioavailability. Test results showed that Phytofare® delivered 10x higher levels of active phyto-nutrients into the blood.
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Exhibits the presence of complete phyto-complexes. With green tea, all eight catechins were detected in the blood as opposed to just one or two as is present in generic extracts.
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | Greatly prolongs the presence of the phyto-complexes in the blood. With most botanical extracts, all traces are eliminated from the blood in just a few hours. With Phytofare® all eight catechins remained in in the blood at therapeutic levels even after an unprecedented 24 hours.
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Plandaí’s Phytofare® Catechin Complex is derived from green tea harvested locally on the Senteeko Tea Estate in Mpumalanga, South Africa, and then processed on a state-of-the-art extraction facility constructed onsite using funds obtained from the Land and Agriculture Bank of South Africa. The facility became operational in late 2014, with initial sales commencing in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015.

The company is actively developing additional products including a Phytofare® citrus complex. The citrus processing and formulation investigations are expected to commence at the Senteeko research facility in October 2015, after which it will be validated and tested in anticipated for a mid-2016 release to market.
 
On August 30, 2013, Plandaí entered into a world license agreement with North-West University in Potchefstroom, South Africa, which granted the company the exclusive right to use manufacture and formulate the University’s Pheroid® technology, an Omega 3 and Omega 6 long-chain fatty acid entrapment system, for protecting botanical compounds against metabolism in the stomach acids in both humans and animals. The company believes that incorporating Pheroid® technology, which has demonstrated in separate human clinical trials its ability to protect entrapped material from metabolization and increase cellular uptake, will enable it to develop products with much higher absorption coefficients in both topical use and oral consumption. The combination of Phytofare® entrapped in Pheroid® will be brought to market in Q4 2015 and marketed under the tradename “Ph2 ™.”
 
The Company is actively pursuing research on additional botanical extracts that have known or suspected pharmaceutical properties. This research includes developing a non-psychoactive cannabinoid extract through the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Plandaí Biotechnology – Uruguay, SA. Plandaí Uruguay is the first and only company to receive a license from the Republic of Uruguay to product cannabis-based extract for pharmaceutical research. Provided that the company can produce such an extract, the plan is to commence animal research on neural disorders such as Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, MS, epilepsy, and post-concussion syndrome in order to determine definitively if cannabis possesses medicinal properties meriting further human trials.
 
COMPETITION
 
The Company faces competition from a variety of sources. There are several large companies that develop and market nutraceutical products that include bio-available compounds including those from green tea and citrus extracts. Many of these competitors benefit from established distribution, market-ready products, and greater levels of financing. Plandaí intends to compete by producing higher quality extracts that exhibit greater bioavailability and longer blood-plasma residency, producing at lower costs, and controlling a vertically integrated business approach that includes all stages from farming through production and marketing. The company’s unique Phyto-availability™, combined with the patented Pheroid® technology, should provide several unique market advantages in the form of higher absorption, increased bioavailability, and lower dosage requirements.
 
CUSTOMERS
 
Plandaí markets direct to nutraceutical and supplement companies that require high-quality bio-available extracts for their products and also sells through several third-party distributors who, in turn, sell to their customers which typically also include contract manufacturers, nutraceutical and supplement companies. In addition, the Company anticipates developing a finished, direct-to-consumer product in 2016 that is based on one or more Phytofare® ingredients.
