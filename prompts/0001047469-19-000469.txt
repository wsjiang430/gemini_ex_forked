     Item 1.    Business 
        Principal Financial Group, Inc. ("PFG") is a leader in global investment management offering businesses, individuals and institutional clients a wide range of financial products and services, including retirement, asset management and insurance through our diverse family of financial services companies. We had $626.8 billion in assets under management ("AUM") and approximately 24.2 million customers worldwide as of December 31, 2018. 
         Our global asset management businesses serve a broad range of investors in 86 countries through offices in 25 countries, including in the major financial centers worldwide. We provide long-term investment strategies to institutional, retirement, high net worth and retail clients by offering a range of capabilities including equity, fixed income, real estate and other alternative investments, as well as fund offerings. 
         In the U.S., we primarily focus on small and medium-sized businesses, which we define as companies with fewer than 1,000 employees, by offering a broad array of retirement and employee benefit solutions and individual insurance solutions to meet the needs of the business owner and their employees. We are a leading provider of corporate defined contribution plans. We are also a leading employee stock ownership plan ("ESOP") consultant. In addition, we are a leading provider of nonqualified plans, defined benefit plans and plan termination annuities. We are also one of the largest providers of specialty benefits insurance product solutions. We believe small and medium-sized businesses are an underserved market, offering attractive growth opportunities in the retirement and employee benefit markets. 
         Additionally, we believe we have a significant opportunity to leverage our U.S. retirement expertise in select international markets that have adopted or are moving toward private sector defined contribution pension systems. Our international asset management and accumulation businesses focus on the opportunities created as aging populations around the world drive increased demand for retirement accumulation, retirement asset management and retirement income management solutions. 
       Our Reportable Segments 
        We organize our businesses into the following reportable segments:
 

 Retirement and Income Solutions; 
 Principal Global Investors; 
 Principal International and 
 U.S. Insurance Solutions. 

         We also have a Corporate segment, which consists of the assets and activities that have not been allocated to any other segment. 
         See Item 8. "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 16, Segment Information" for financial results of our segments. 
       Retirement and Income Solutions Segment 
        Our asset accumulation activities in the U.S. date back to the 1940s when we first began providing pension plan products and services. We now offer a comprehensive portfolio of products and services for retirement savings and retirement income:


 To businesses of all sizes with a concentration on small and medium-sized businesses, we offer products and services for defined contribution
plans, including 401(k) and 403(b) plans, defined benefit plans, nonqualified executive benefit plans, ESOP services and pension risk transfer (formerly known as full service payout) services. For
more basic retirement services, we offer SIMPLE Individual Retirement Accounts ("IRA") and payroll deduction plans; 
 To large institutional clients, we also offer investment only products, including investment only guaranteed investment contracts ("GICs"); and 
 To employees of businesses and other individuals, we offer the ability to accumulate savings for retirement and other purposes through mutual
funds, individual annuities and bank products. 

         We organize our Retirement and Income Solutions operations into two business groupings:
 

 Retirement and Income Solutions  Fee: includes full service accumulation, trust services and individual variable annuities;
and 
 Retirement and Income Solutions  Spread: includes individual fixed annuities, investment only, pension risk transfer and
banking services.

         Retirement and Income Solutions  Fee 
  Full Service Accumulation 
         We offer a wide variety of investment and administrative products and services for defined contribution plans, including 401(k) and 403(b) plans; defined benefit plans; nonqualified executive benefit plans and ESOPs. A 403(b) plan is a plan described in Section 403(b) of the Internal Revenue Code that provides retirement benefits for employees of tax-exempt organizations and public schools. 
 Products 
         Full service accumulation products respond to the needs of plan sponsors seeking both administrative and investment services for defined contribution plans or defined benefit plans. The investment component of both the defined contribution and defined benefit plans may be in the form of a guaranteed account, separate account, a mutual fund offering or a collective investment trust. In addition, defined contribution plan sponsors may also offer their own employer securities as an investment option under the plan. 
         We deliver both administrative and investment services to our defined contribution plan and defined benefit plan customers through annuity contracts, collective investment trusts and mutual funds. Group annuity contracts and collective investment trusts used to fund qualified plans are not required to be registered with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). Our mutual fund service platform is called Principal Advantage. It is a qualified plan service package based on our series mutual fund, Principal Funds, Inc. ("PFI"). We offer investments covering the full range of stable value, equity, fixed income, real estate and international investment options managed by our Principal Global Investors segment as well as third party asset managers. In addition, full service accumulation offers plan sponsors trust services through an affiliated trust company. 
         As of December 31, 2018, we provided full service accumulation products to (a) over 38,500 defined contribution plans including $153.9 billion in assets and covering 5.2 million eligible plan participants, and (b) to over 2,000 defined benefit plans, including $19.1 billion in assets and covering over 315,000 eligible plan participants. As of December 31, 2018, approximately 52% of our full service accumulation account values were managed by our Principal Global Investors segment. Third party asset managers provide asset management services with respect to the remaining assets. As it relates to our full service accumulation account values, 33% were managed entirely by the third party asset managers that were not under contract to sub-advise a PFG product, 8% were sub-advised and 7% represented employer securities. 
   Markets and Distribution 
         We offer our full service accumulation products and services to plans, including qualified and nonqualified defined contribution plans and defined benefit plans. Our primary target market is plans sponsored by small and medium-sized businesses, which we believe remains under-penetrated. According to Cerulli Associates, in 2016, only 9% of businesses with less than 99 employees, 57% of businesses with between 100 and 499 employees and 78% of businesses with between 500 and 999 employees offered a 401(k) plan. The same study indicates that 85% of employers with between 1000 and 4999 employees and 100% of employers with 5,000 or more employees offered a 401(k) plan in 2016. Cerulli Associates has yet to release updated statistics on the percentage of businesses offering a 401(k) plan in years subsequent to 2016. 
         We distribute our full service accumulation products and services nationally, primarily through a captive retirement services sales force. As of December 31, 2018, 95 retirement services sales representatives in 41 offices, operating as a wholesale distribution network, maintained relationships with over 14,100 independent advisors, consultants and agents. Retirement services sales representatives are an integral part of the sales process alongside the referring consultant or independent advisor. We compensate retirement services sales representatives through a blend of salary and production-based incentives, while we pay independent advisors, consultants and agents a commission or fee. 
         As of December 31, 2018, we had a separate staff of over 240 service and education specialists located in the sales offices. These specialists play a key role in the ongoing servicing of plans by providing local services to our customers, such as reviewing plan performance, investment options and plan design; communicating the customers' needs and feedback to us and helping employees understand the benefits of their plans. The following summarizes our distribution channels:
 

 We distribute our annuity-based products through intermediaries who are primarily state licensed individuals. 
 Principal Advantage platform is targeted at defined contribution plans through broker-dealer distribution channels. Principal Advantage gives
us access to Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ("FINRA")-registered distributors who are not traditional sellers of annuity-based products and broadens opportunities for us in the investment
advisor and broker-dealer distribution channels. 
 Through our Retire Secure strategy we provide financial education and other assistance to individual investors who are participants/members of
employer-based accumulation solutions to help them achieve financial security. 

         We believe our approach to full service accumulation plan services distribution, which gives us a local sales and service presence, differentiates us from many of our competitors. We have also established a number of marketing and distribution relationships to increase the sales of our products and services.

     Individual Variable Annuities 
         Individual variable annuities, which are savings vehicles through which the customer makes one or more deposits of varying amounts and intervals, are offered to individuals. 
   Products 
         Our individual variable deferred annuities provide customers with the flexibility to allocate their deposits to mutual funds managed by the Principal Global Investors segment or unaffiliated third party asset managers. As of December 31, 2018, 94% of our $9.0 billion in variable annuity account balances was allocated to mutual funds managed by the Principal Global Investors segment and our guaranteed option. The remaining 6% was allocated to mutual funds managed by unaffiliated third party asset managers. Generally speaking, the customers bear the investment risk for the variable options and have the right to allocate their assets among various separate mutual funds. The value of the annuity fluctuates in accordance with the experience of the mutual funds chosen by the customer. Customers have the option to allocate all or a portion of their account to our guaranteed option, in which case we credit interest at rates we determine, subject to contractual minimums. 
         Customers may elect a living benefit guarantee (commonly known in the industry as a guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit, or "GMWB"). We bear the GMWB investment risk. Our goal is to hedge the GMWB investment risk through the use of sophisticated risk management techniques. As of December 31, 2018, $6.2 billion of the $8.7 billion of variable annuity separate account values had the GMWB rider. Our major source of revenue from individual variable annuities is mortality and expense fees we charge to the customer, generally determined as a percentage of the market value of the assets held in a separate investment sub-account. Account balances of variable annuity contracts with the GMWB rider were invested in separate account investment options as follows: 

   
 | | December 31, 2018 | | December 31, 2017 | 
 | | (in millions) | 
Balanced funds | | $ | 5,902.3 | | $ | 6,512.2 |

  Markets and Distribution 
         Our target markets for individual variable annuities include owners, executives and employees of small and medium-sized businesses and individuals seeking to accumulate and/or eventually receive distributions of assets for retirement. We market variable annuities to individuals for both qualified and nonqualified retirement savings. 
         We sell our individual variable annuity products through our affiliated financial representatives, including Principal Connection, who collectively accounted for 97%, 97% and 96% of annuity sales for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The remaining sales were made primarily through unaffiliated broker-dealer firms. Principal Connection is our direct distribution channel for retail financial services products to individuals. Principal Connection's services are available by phone, email or mail. Affiliated financial representatives continue to be the primary distribution channel of our variable deferred annuities. 
       Retirement and Income Solutions  Spread 
  Individual Fixed Annuities 
         Individual fixed annuities may be categorized in two ways: (1) deferred, in which case assets accumulate until the contract is surrendered, the customer dies or the customer begins receiving benefits under an annuity payout option, or (2) payout, in which case payments are made for a fixed period of time or for life. 
 Products 
  Fixed Deferred Annuities.    Our individual fixed deferred annuities consist of both single premium deferred annuity contracts and flexible premium deferred annuity contracts ("FPDAs"). The majority of FPDA contracts limit the period of time deposits are allowed to one year. For certain contracts, the principal amount is guaranteed. We credit the customer's account with a fixed interest rate for a specified number of years. Thereafter, we reset the interest rate credited to the contract based upon our discretion, subject to contractual minimums, by taking into account market and other conditions. We also offer a fixed deferred annuity where the interest credited is linked to an external equity index, subject to maximum and minimum values. One source of income from fixed deferred annuities is the difference between the investment income earned on the underlying general account assets and the interest rate credited to the contracts. We bear the investment risk because, while we credit customers' accounts with a stated interest rate, we cannot be certain the 
 6

   investment income we earn on our general account assets will exceed that rate. The Principal Global Investors segment manages the assets supporting these contracts. 
  Fixed Income Annuities.    Our individual fixed income annuities consist of single premium immediate annuity contracts ("SPIAs") and deferred income annuity contracts ("DIAs"). SPIAs and DIAs are products where the customer pays a premium in return for periodic benefit payments. SPIA payments begin immediately and DIA payments begin after a deferral period, during which a return-of-premium death benefit is included. Payments may be contingent upon the survival of one or two individuals or payments may be fixed, meaning payments are contractually guaranteed and do not depend on the continuing survival of any individual. Our major source of income from fixed immediate annuities is the difference between the investment income earned on the underlying general account assets and the interest rate implied in the calculation of annuity benefit payments. We bear the investment risk because we cannot be certain the investment income we earn on our general account assets will exceed the rate implied in the SPIA and DIA contracts. The Principal Global Investors segment manages the assets supporting these contracts. 
   Markets and Distribution 
         Our target markets for individual fixed annuities include owners, executives and employees of small and medium-sized businesses and individuals seeking to accumulate and/or eventually receive distributions of assets for retirement. We market fixed annuities to individuals for both qualified and nonqualified retirement savings. 
         We sell our individual fixed annuity products through our affiliated financial representatives, including Principal Connection, who collectively accounted for 7%, 7% and 7% of annuity sales for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The remaining sales were made through banks, brokerage general agencies, mutual fund companies and unaffiliated broker-dealer firms. The majority of overall annuity sales were from non-affiliated distribution channels, as a result of focused efforts to increase fixed annuity sales through these channels. 
   Investment Only 
   Products 
         The two primary products for which we provide investment only services are GICs and funding agreements. 
         GICs and funding agreements pay a specified rate of return. The rate of return can be a floating rate based on an external market index or a fixed rate. Our investment only products contain provisions disallowing or limiting early surrenders, including penalties for early surrenders and minimum notice requirements. 
         Deposits to investment only products are predominantly in the form of single payments. As a result, the level of new deposits can fluctuate from one fiscal quarter to another. The amounts earned by us are derived in part from the difference between the investment income earned by us and the amount credited to the customer. The Principal Global Investors segment manages the assets supporting the contractual promises. 
   Markets and Distribution 
         We issue traditional GICs and funding agreements primarily to retirement plan sponsors and other institutions. We also offer GICs as part of our full service accumulation products which are issued primarily to tax-qualified retirement plans. Funding agreements are issued directly to non-qualified institutions, the Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines ("FHLB Des Moines") and unconsolidated special purpose entities. As part of our funding agreement-backed note programs, U.S. and foreign institutional investors purchase debt obligations from the special purpose entity which, in turn, purchases the funding agreement from us with terms similar to those of the debt obligations. The strength of this market is dependent on debt capital market conditions. As a result, our sales through this channel can vary widely from one quarter to another. 
 Pension Risk Transfer 
   Products 
         Pension risk transfer products respond primarily to the needs of pension plan sponsors in the form of single premium group annuities, which are immediate or deferred annuities that provide a current or future specific income amount, fully guaranteed by us. The majority of our business originates from defined benefit plans that are being terminated. In these situations, the plan sponsor transfers all its obligations under the plan to an insurer by paying a single premium. Generally, plan sponsors restrict their purchases to insurance companies with superior or excellent financial quality ratings because the Department of Labor ("DOL") has mandated that annuities be purchased only from the "safest available" insurers. 
         Since premium received from pension risk transfer products is generally in the form of single payments, the level of premiums can fluctuate depending on the number of large-scale annuity sales in a particular quarter. The Principal Global Investors segment manages the assets supporting pension risk transfer account values. 
 7

     Markets and Distribution 
         Our primary distribution channel for pension risk transfer products is comprised of several specialized home office sales consultants working through consultants and brokers that specialize in this type of business. Our sales consultants also make sales directly to institutions. Our nationally dispersed retirement services sales representatives act as a secondary distribution channel for these products. 
 Banking Services 
         IRAs are provided by Principal Bank, primarily funded by retirement savings rolled over from qualified retirement plans. Principal Bank is a U.S. federal savings bank that was formed in February 1998. As of December 31, 2018, Principal Bank had nearly 400,000 customers and approximately $3.1 billion in assets. Principal Bank operates under a limited purpose charter and may only accept deposits held in a fiduciary capacity, may not hold demand deposits or own commercial loans and cannot originate loans. 
 Products 
         The IRAs offered by Principal Bank provide Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC")-insured retirement solutions for its customers. The IRAs are held in savings accounts, money market accounts and certificates of deposit. The deposit products provide a relatively stable source of funding and liquidity for Principal Bank and are backed by purchases of investment securities and residential mortgage loans. 
 Markets and Distribution 
         Principal Bank offers bank products and services to participants rolling out of qualified retirement plans primarily serviced by affiliates of PFG. Principal Bank services customers by telephone, mail and internet.

Mutual funds are sold through 
 10

   independent distributors, including banks, and directly through proprietary sales offices. Digital platforms are also being developed to enhance customer experience. As of December 31, 2018, our subsidiary in India had $1.0 billion of AUM. 
  Southeast Asia.    We offer mutual funds, asset management services and pension accumulation products through our joint ventures CIMB-Principal Asset Management Berhad ("CPAM") and CIMB-Principal Islamic Asset Management ("CPIAM"). The partner is CIMB Group ("CIMB"), a leading ASEAN universal bank which has a strong presence in the region. CPAM also manages a significant amount of institutional asset mandates. The joint ventures had $19.1 billion of AUM as of December 31, 2018. 
         CPAM distributes conventional and Islamic mutual funds through the branches of its partner bank (around 850 bank branches throughout ASEAN and beyond) and through an agency sales force of over 7,000 agents selling to retail customers as of November 30, 2018. CPAM also distributes its mutual funds through third party institutions including other banks and security houses. 
         CPAM has wholly owned subsidiaries in Singapore (CIMB-Principal Asset Management (S) Pte. Ltd.), Indonesia (PT CIMB-Principal Asset Management) and Thailand (CIMB-Principal Asset Management Company Limited). CPIAM also has a Dubai International Financial Centre Representative Office, CIMB-Principal Islamic Asset Management, which commenced effective May 31, 2018. 
         In May 2018, Principal and CIMB completed agreements for Principal to increase ownership of CPAM and CPIAM to 60% in both companies. The joint ventures will continue to be co-managed by both companies. 
       U.S. Insurance Solutions Segment 
        Our U.S. Insurance Solutions segment activities date back to 1879 when we first began selling individual life insurance products. We expanded our offering to include group insurance products in the 1940s and have continued to expand our product portfolio over time. We help businesses and individuals by offering solutions that grow and protect their assets, and enable them to live their best lives:


 To small and medium sized businesses, we offer employer paid and voluntary group benefits, multi-life individual disability insurance and
solutions to protect the business and personal insurance needs of owners and executives. 
 To individuals, we offer individual life and individual disability insurance solutions. 

         We organize our operations into two divisions: Specialty Benefits insurance and Individual Life insurance. However, we share key resources in our core areas such as strategic leadership, distribution and marketing. 
       Specialty Benefits Insurance 
        Specialty Benefits insurance, which includes group dental, vision, life, critical illness, accident and disability insurance and individual disability insurance, is an important component of the employee benefit offering at small and medium-sized businesses. We offer voluntary products for group dental, vision, life, critical illness, accident and disability. We also offer group dental, vision and disability on a fee-for-service basis. Our individual disability insurance is also sold on an individual or multi-life basis. 
 Products and Services 
  Group Dental and Vision Insurance.    Our plans provide partial reimbursement for dental and vision expenses. As of December 31, 2018, we had almost 65,000 group dental and vision insurance policies in force covering over 1.7 million employees. According to Life Insurance and Market Research Association ("LIMRA"), we were the 6th largest group dental insurer in terms of number of contracts/employer groups in force in 2017. In addition to indemnity and preferred provider organization dental offered on both an employer paid and voluntary basis, we offer a prepaid dental plan in Arizona through our Employers Dental Services, Inc. subsidiary. We also offer a discount dental product nationally. Our indemnity vision and our managed care vision products are offered on both an employer paid and voluntary basis. 
  Group Life Insurance.    Our group life insurance provides coverage to employees and their dependents for a specified period. As of December 31, 2018, we had over 65,000 group policies providing nearly $152 billion of group life insurance in force to approximately 2.5 million employee lives. According to LIMRA, in 2017 we were ranked 3rd in the U.S. in terms of the number of group life insurance contracts in force. We currently sell traditional group life insurance that does not provide for accumulation of cash values on both an employer paid and voluntary basis. Our group life insurance business remains focused on the traditional, annually renewable term product. Group term life and group universal life accounted for 99% and 1%, respectively, of our total group life insurance in force as of December 31, 2018. We no longer market group universal life insurance to new employer groups. 
         Group Disability Insurance.    Our group disability insurance provides a benefit to insured employees who become disabled. In most instances, this benefit is in the form of a monthly income. Our group disability products include both short-term and long-term disability, offered on both an employer paid and voluntary basis. As of December 31, 2018, long-term disability represented 61% of total group disability premium, while short-term disability represented 39% of total group disability premium. We also provide disability management services, called rehabilitation services, to assist individuals in returning to work as quickly as possible following disability. We work with disability claimants to improve 
 11

   the approval rate of Social Security benefits, thereby reducing payment of benefits by the amount of Social Security payments received. As of December 31, 2018, we served approximately 1.9 million employee lives through more than 47,000 contracts. According to LIMRA, our group short-term disability business was ranked 4th and our group long-term disability business was ranked 3rd in the U.S. as of December 31, 2017, in terms of number of contracts/employer groups in force. We also offer voluntary critical illness insurance, which provides a lump-sum cash benefit to pay for additional expenses associated with the five most common critical illnesses, and voluntary accident insurance, which pays a lump sum when covered injuries occur because of an accident. 
  Individual Disability Insurance.    Individual disability insurance has been sold since the early 1950s. Our individual disability insurance products provide income protection to the insured member and/or business in the event of disability. In most instances, this benefit is in the form of a monthly income. In addition to income replacement, we offer products to pay business-related costs such as overhead expenses for a disabled business owner, buy-out costs for business owners purchasing a disabled owner's interest in the business, expenditures for replacement of a key person and business loan payments. We also offer a product to protect retirement savings in the event of disability. As of December 31, 2018, we served approximately 196,000 individual disability policyholders. According to LIMRA, our individual disability business was ranked 5th in the U.S. in terms of premium in force in the non-cancellable segment of the market and 5th overall, as of December 31, 2017. 
  Fee-for-Service.    We offer administration of group dental, disability and vision benefits on a fee-for-service basis. 
       Individual Life Insurance 
        We specialize in providing solutions for small to medium-sized businesses to protect against risk and loss, assist with succession planning and wealth transfer and to build and protect wealth for retirement. We also provide solutions to meet the personal needs of business owners, executives, key employees and affluent individuals. Our U.S. operations administered approximately 638,000 individual life insurance policies with over $377 billion of individual life insurance in force as of December 31, 2018. 
 Products and Services 
         Our Business Owner and Executive Solutions platform as well as our nonqualified deferred compensation offering combines administration and consulting to service our clients' needs. We target the business and personal insurance needs of owners, executives and key employees of small and medium-sized businesses with an increasing focus on providing insurance solutions for nonqualified executive benefits. In addition, we market our products to meet traditional retail insurance needs. We offer a variety of individual life insurance products, both interest sensitive (including universal life, variable universal life and indexed universal life insurance) and traditional. 
  Interest Sensitive.    Our interest sensitive products include universal life, variable universal life and indexed universal life insurance. These products offer the policyholder the option of adjusting both the premium and the death benefit amounts of the insurance contract. Universal life insurance typically includes a cash value account that accumulates at a credited interest rate based on the investment returns of the block of business. Variable universal life insurance is credited with the investment returns of the various investment options selected. Indexed universal life is credited with investment returns tied to an external index, subject to a contractual minimum and maximum. For the year ended December 31, 2018, interest sensitive products represented 24% of individual life insurance in force and generated 68% of individual life insurance annualized first year premium sales. 
         After a deduction for policy level expenses, we credit net deposits to an account maintained for the policyholder. For universal life contracts, the entire account balance is invested in the general account. Interest is credited to the policyholder's account based on the earnings on general account investments, subject to contractual minimums. For variable universal life contracts, the policyholder may allocate the account balance among our general account and a variety of mutual funds underlying the contract. Interest is credited on amounts allocated to the general account in the same manner as for universal life. Net investment performance on mutual funds is allocated directly to the policyholder accounts; the policyholder bears the investment risk. For indexed universal life, the policyholder may allocate the account balance among our general account and two index accounts. Interest is credited on amounts allocated to the general account in the same manner as for universal life. Net investment performance on the index accounts is allocated directly to the policyholder accounts, subject to the contractual minimum and maximum. Some of our interest sensitive contracts contain what are commonly referred to as "secondary" or "no-lapse" guarantee provisions. These no-lapse guarantees keep the contract in force, even if the contractholder's account balance is insufficient to cover all of the contract charges, provided that the contractholder has continually paid a specified minimum premium. 
  Traditional Life Insurance.    Traditional life insurance includes participating whole life, adjustable life and non-participating term life insurance products. Non-participating term life insurance products represented 32% of our individual life insurance annualized first year premium sales for the year ended December 31, 2018, and 72% of individual life insurance in force as of December 31, 2018. Adjustable life insurance products provide a guaranteed benefit in return for the payment of a fixed premium and allow the policyholder to set the coverage period, premium and face amount combination. Term insurance products provide a guaranteed death benefit for a specified period of time in return for the payment of a fixed premium. Policyholder dividends are not paid on term insurance.

     U.S. Insurance Solutions Markets and Distribution 
         For each of our products, administration and distribution channels are customized to meet customer needs and expectations for that product. 
         We market our group dental, vision, life, critical illness, accident and disability insurance products to small and medium-sized businesses, primarily targeting our sales toward owners and human resources professionals. We sell our group products in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. We continually adapt our products and pricing to meet local market conditions. We market our fee-for-service capabilities to employers that self-insure their employees' dental, disability and vision benefits. We market our fee-for-service businesses in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. 
         The group insurance market continues to see a shift to voluntary/worksite products due to various pressures on employers. In keeping with this market change, which shifts the funding of such products from the employer to the employee, we continue to place an enhanced focus on our voluntary benefits platform. We believe the voluntary/worksite market presents growth opportunities and we will continue to develop strategies to capitalize on this expanding market. 
         As of December 31, 2018, we had 134 sales representatives and 163 service representatives in 26 local markets. Our sales representatives accounted for 99% of our group insurance sales for the year ended December 31, 2018. The service representatives play a key role in servicing the case by providing local, responsive services to our customers and their brokers, such as renewing contracts, revising plans, solving administrative issues and communicating the customers' needs and feedback to us. 
         We sell our individual life and individual disability insurance products in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, primarily targeting owners, executives and key employees of small and medium-sized businesses. Small and medium-sized business sales represented 63% of individual life sales and 59% of individual disability sales for the year ended December 31, 2018. Much of our life insurance sales efforts focus on the Business Owner and Executive Solutions market. This strategy offers solutions to address business owner financial challenges such as exiting the business, business transition, retaining key employees and retirement planning. Key employees also have needs to supplement retirement income, survivor income, and business protection. We believe the Business Owner and Executive Solutions segment offers growth opportunities and we will continue to develop strategies to capitalize on this expanding market. 
         We distribute our individual life and individual disability insurance products through our affiliated financial representatives and independent brokers, as well as other marketing and distribution alliances. Affiliated financial representatives were responsible for 14% of individual life insurance sales based on first year annualized premium and 10% of individual disability sales for the year ended December 31, 2018. We had 1,185 affiliated financial representatives in 27 offices as of December 31, 2018. Although they are independent contractors, we have a close tie with affiliated financial representatives and we offer them benefits, training and access to tools and expertise. To meet the needs of the various marketing channels, particularly the independent brokers, we employ wholesale distributors  Regional Vice Presidents for individual life and Regional Vice Presidents for individual disability. A key differentiator in the nonqualified executive benefit sale is our Regional Vice Presidents-Nonqualified Plans, who are not only wholesalers but also consultants and subject-matter experts providing point-of-sale support in closing cases. 
       Corporate Segment 
        Our Corporate segment manages the assets representing capital that has not been allocated to any other segment. Financial results of the Corporate segment primarily reflect our financing activities (including financing costs), income on capital not allocated to other segments, inter-segment eliminations, income tax risks and certain income, expenses and other adjustments not allocated to the segments based on the nature of such items. Results of Principal Securities, Inc., our retail broker-dealer and registered investment advisor; RobustWealth, Inc. ("RobustWealth"), our financial technology company; and our exited group medical and long-term care insurance businesses are reported in this segment. 
       Competition 
        Competition in our segments is based on a number of factors including: scale, service, product features, price, investment performance, commission structure, distribution capacity, financial strength ratings and name recognition. We compete with a large number of financial services companies such as banks, mutual funds, broker-dealers, insurers and asset managers. Some of these companies offer a broader array of products, more competitive pricing, greater diversity of distribution sources, better brand recognition or, with respect to insurers, higher financial strength ratings. Some may also have greater financial resources with which to compete or may have better investment performance at various times. We believe we distinguish ourselves from our competitors through our:


 full service platform; 
 strong customer relationships; 
 focus on investment performance and 
 expansive product portfolio.

         Ratings 
        Insurance companies are assigned financial strength ratings by rating agencies based upon factors relevant to policyholders. Financial strength ratings are generally defined as opinions as to an insurer's financial strength and ability to meet ongoing obligations to policyholders. Information about ratings provides both industry participants and insurance consumers meaningful insights on specific insurance companies. Higher ratings generally indicate financial stability and a stronger ability to pay claims. 
         Principal Life and Principal National Life Insurance Company ("PNLIC") have been assigned the following insurer financial strength ratings: 

   
Rating Agency | Financial Strength Rating | Rating Structure 
A.M. Best Company, Inc. | A+ ("Superior") with a stable outlook | Second highest of 13 rating levels
Fitch Ratings Ltd. | AA ("Very Strong") with a stable outlook | Fourth highest of 19 rating levels
Moody's Investors Service | A1 ("Good") with a stable outlook | Fifth highest of 21 rating levels 
S&P Global Ratings | A+ ("Strong") with a stable outlook | Fifth highest of 20 rating levels 


        A.M. Best Company, Inc. ("A.M. Best") ratings for insurance companies range from "A++" to "S". A.M. Best indicates that "A++" and "A+" ratings are assigned to those companies that in A.M. Best's opinion have superior ability to meet ongoing insurance obligations. Fitch Ratings Ltd. ("Fitch") ratings for insurance companies range from "AAA" to "C". Fitch "AA" ratings indicate very strong capacity to meet policyholder and contract obligations. Moody's Investors Service ("Moody's") ratings for insurance companies range from "Aaa" to "C". Moody's indicates that "A" ratings are assigned to those companies that offer good financial security. S&P Global Ratings ("S&P") has ratings that range from "AAA" to "D" for insurance companies. S&P indicates that "A" ratings are assigned to those companies that have strong financial security characteristics. In evaluating a company's financial and operating performance, these rating agencies review its profitability, leverage and liquidity, as well as its book of business, the adequacy and soundness of its reinsurance, the quality and estimated market value of its assets, the adequacy of its policy reserves, the soundness of its risk management programs, the experience and competency of its management and other factors. 
         In the fourth quarter of 2018, A.M. Best changed its outlook on the U.S. life insurance sector to 'stable' from 'negative' due to increased profitability, improved regulatory and tax environments and a strengthening U.S. economy, along with overall reduced balance sheet risk due to a proactive approach taken by companies in recent years. Fitch, S&P and Moody's continue to maintain a 'stable' outlook as well. 
         We believe our strong ratings are an important factor in marketing our products to our distributors and customers, as ratings information is broadly disseminated and generally used throughout the industry. Our ratings reflect each rating agency's opinion of our financial strength, operating performance and ability to meet our obligations to policyholders and are not evaluations directed toward the protection of investors. Such ratings are neither a rating of securities nor a recommendation to buy, hold or sell any security, including our common stock. For more information on ratings, see Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Liquidity and Capital Resources  Financial Strength and Credit Ratings." 
       Regulation 
        Our businesses are subject to regulation and supervision by U.S. federal and state regulatory authorities as well as non-U.S. regulatory authorities for our operations and customers outside the U.S., which can have a significant effect on our business. Our businesses are also affected by U.S. federal, state and local tax laws as well as tax laws for jurisdictions outside the U.S. 
         PFG, our parent holding company, is not licensed as an insurer, investment advisor, broker-dealer, bank or other regulated entity. However, because it is the holding company for all of our operations, it is subject to regulation in connection with our regulated entities, including as an insurance holding company. We are subject to legal and regulatory requirements applicable to public companies, including public reporting and disclosure, securities trading, accounting and financial reporting and corporate governance. 
   U.S. Insurance Regulation 
         We are subject to the insurance holding company laws in the states where our insurance companies are domiciled. Principal Life and PNLIC are domiciled in Iowa and their principal insurance regulatory authority is the Insurance Division of the Department of Commerce of the State of Iowa. Our other U.S. insurance companies are principally regulated by the insurance departments of the states in which they are domiciled. These laws generally require each insurance company directly or indirectly owned by the holding company to register with the insurance department in the insurance company's state of domicile and to furnish financial and other information about the operations of the companies within the holding company system. Transactions affecting the insurers in the holding company system must be fair and at arm's length. Most states have insurance laws that require regulatory approval of a direct or indirect change in control of an insurer or an insurer's holding company and laws that require prior notification to state insurance departments of a change in control of a non-domiciliary insurance company doing business in that state. 
 14



        Annually, our U.S. insurance companies must submit an opinion from a board-appointed qualified actuary to state insurance regulators, where licensed, on whether the statutory assets held backing statutory reserves are sufficient to meet contractual obligations and related expenses of the insurer. If such an opinion cannot be rendered noting the sufficiency of assets, the insurance company must set up additional statutory reserves drawing from available statutory surplus until such an opinion can be given. 
         State insurance departments have broad administrative powers over the insurance business, including insurance company licensing and examination, agent licensing, establishment of reserve requirements and solvency standards, premium rate regulation, admittance of assets to statutory surplus, policy form approval, unfair trade and claims practices regulation and other matters. State insurance statutes also typically place restrictions and limitations on the amount of dividends or other distributions payable by insurance company subsidiaries to their parent companies. See Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Liquidity and Capital Resources" for further details. 
         In order to enhance the regulation of insurer solvency, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners ("NAIC") has established risk-based capital ("RBC") standards. The standards require life insurers to submit a report to state regulators on an annual basis regarding their RBC based upon categories of risk including the following: asset risk, insurance risk, interest rate risk and business and operational risk. As of December 31, 2018, the statutory surplus of each of our U.S. life insurance companies exceeded the minimum RBC requirements. 
         State and federal insurance and securities regulatory authorities and other state law enforcement agencies and attorneys general regularly make inquiries and conduct examinations or investigations regarding our compliance with, among other things, insurance laws and securities laws. 
         Each state has insurance guaranty association laws under which insurers doing business in a state can be assessed, up to prescribed limits, in order to cover contractual benefit obligations of insolvent insurance companies. The guaranty associations levy assessments on each member insurer in a jurisdiction on the basis of the proportionate share of the premiums written by such insurer in the lines of business in which the insolvent insurer is engaged. Some jurisdictions permit the member insurers to recover the assessments paid through full or partial premium tax offsets. 
   Securities Regulation 
         Insurance and investment products such as variable annuities, variable life insurance and some funding agreements that constitute securities and mutual fund products are subject to securities laws and regulations, including U.S. state securities regulation as well as U.S. federal regulation under the SEC, FINRA and other regulatory authorities. These regulations affect investment advice, sales and related activities for these products. 
         We also have entities that are registered as investment advisers with the SEC under, and are therefore subject to, the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. 
   Employee Retirement Income Security Act 
         As we provide products and services for U.S. employee benefit plans, we are subject to regulation under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act ("ERISA"). ERISA provisions include reporting and disclosure requirements and standards of conduct. 
 Banking Regulation 
         Principal Bank, a wholly owned subsidiary, is a U.S. federal savings bank regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Principal Bank's deposits are insured by the FDIC, making the Bank subject to certain of the FDIC's regulations. 
 Environmental Regulation 
         As we own and operate real property, we are subject to U.S. federal, state and local environmental laws, as well as international environmental laws and could be subject to environmental liabilities and costs associated with required remediation of our properties. We routinely have environmental assessments performed for real estate being acquired or used as collateral for commercial mortgages we use for investment. 
 Regulation of International Businesses 
         Our international businesses are supervised by regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions in which they operate, including regulation and supervision by insurance, securities, tax and privacy regulatory authorities. The purpose of these regulations is similar to the U.S., to protect our customers and the overall financial system. Regulations such as the revised Markets in Financial Instruments Directive and the General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR") have a global impact on our businesses.

         Risk Management 
        Like all financial services companies, we are exposed to a wide variety of financial, operational and other risks, as described in Item 1A. "Risk Factors." Effective enterprise risk management is, therefore, a key component of our business model. 
         Enterprise risk management helps us to manage risk to meet our customer obligations, satisfy regulatory requirements, adequately provide for contingencies in case of stress, optimize shareholder returns, support our core values and maintain our reputation. 
         We utilize an integrated risk management framework to help us identify, assess, monitor, report, manage and aggregate our material risks within established risk appetites and risk tolerances. The framework delivers important perspective that is used in strategic and tactical decision making and is adaptable to changes in our businesses and in the external environments in which we operate. Our approach also requires a commitment to continuous improvement and periodic validation. 
         Our governance structure includes Board of Directors oversight, internal risk committees, a corporate risk management function and embedded risk professionals in our business units and functional areas. Our Board of Directors, Audit Committee, Finance Committee, Human Resource Committee and Nominating and Governance Committee provide oversight no less frequently than quarterly, addressing relevant aspects of our risk profile. 
         Our internal risk committees meet on a regular and frequent basis to discuss various issues and review profile status. Each business unit has its own committee that is responsible for oversight of the material risks within the unit or area. These committees may include corporate leaders. We also have internal committees that provide oversight around a certain risk or group of related risks across the organization. This matrix approach helps us maintain comprehensive risk coverage and preserve an integrated view of risks. The Enterprise Risk Management Committee, comprised of members from the executive management team, exercises enterprise-wide oversight for our most significant risk profiles. 
         The business units and functional areas are responsible for identifying, assessing, monitoring, reporting and managing their own risks. Chief Risk Officers embedded within each business unit or risk professionals in functional areas help align risk management practice with the strategies of the unit as well as with enterprise-wide objectives. The Corporate Chief Risk Officer and supporting staff are separate from the business units and provide objective oversight, framework enablement and aggregated risk analysis. Internal Audit provides independent assurance around effective risk management design and control execution. 
         Risk appetites, tolerances and limits have been established from an enterprise-wide and business unit perspective for specific risk categories, where appropriate. We monitor a variety of risk metrics on an ongoing basis and take the appropriate steps to manage our established risk appetites and tolerances. Quarterly risk reporting provides a feedback loop between business units, functional areas, our internal risk committees and the corporate risk management function. This reporting also includes perspectives on emerging risk. To the extent potentially significant business activities or operational initiatives are considered, analysis of the possible impact on our risk profile takes place. This analysis includes, but is not limited to, the capital implications; the impact on near term and long-term earnings; the ability to meet our targets with respect to return on equity, liquidity, debt/capital, cash coverage, business risk and operational risk; and the impact to our reputation. 
       Employees 
        As of December 31, 2018, we had 16,475 employees. None of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements except a group of employees within our Cuprum organization in Chile. We believe that our employee relations are satisfactory. 
       Internet Website 
        Our internet website can be found at www.principal.com. We make available free of charge, on or through our internet website, access to our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is filed with or furnished to the SEC. These reports are also available on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov. Also available free of charge on our internet website is our code of business conduct and ethics, corporate governance guidelines and charters for the Audit, Finance, Human Resources and Nominating and Governance committees of our Board of Directors.
