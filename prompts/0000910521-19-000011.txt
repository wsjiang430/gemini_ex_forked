Item 1. Business
General
Deckers Outdoor Corporation was incorporated in 1975 under the laws of the State of California and, in 1993, reincorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware. We are a global leader in designing, marketing, and distributing innovative footwear, apparel and accessories developed for both everyday casual lifestyle use and high-performance activities. We market our products primarily under five proprietary brands: UGG, HOKA, Teva, Sanuk and Koolaburra. We believe that our products are distinctive and appeal broadly to women, men and children. We sell our products through quality domestic and international retailers, international distributors, and directly to our consumers both domestically and internationally through our Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) business, which is comprised of our retail stores and E-Commerce websites. We seek to differentiate our brands and products by offering diverse lines that emphasize authenticity, functionality, quality, and comfort, and products tailored to a variety of activities, seasons, and demographic groups. All of our products are currently manufactured by independent manufacturers. 
Recent Developments
Restructuring Plan. During February 2016, we announced the implementation of a multi-year restructuring plan which was designed to realign our brands across our Fashion Lifestyle and Performance Lifestyle groups, optimize our worldwide owned retail store fleet, and consolidate our management and operations. The Fashion Lifestyle group includes the UGG and Koolaburra brands. The Performance Lifestyle group includes the HOKA, Teva, and Sanuk brands. In general, the intent of our restructuring plan was to reduce overhead costs and create operating efficiencies while improving collaboration across brands. 
 As of March 31, 2019, we have completed our restructuring plan and achieved cumulative selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense savings to date along with cumulative restructuring charges. We currently do not anticipate incurring additional restructuring charges in connection with this restructuring plan. 
Refer to Part II, Item 7, “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” and Note 1, “General,” under the heading “Restructuring Plan” of our consolidated financial statements in Part IV within this Annual Report for further information on our restructuring efforts and its impact on our results of operations and reportable operating segments.
Operating Profit Improvement Plan. During February 2017, we announced that, in addition to continuing to execute on our restructuring plan, we would implement various business transformation initiatives to further reduce expenses and improve gross margins, the projected combined impact of which was expected to be approximately $100,000 of net annualized operating profit improvement by the end of the fiscal year ending March 31, 2020. As of March 31, 2019, we have successfully completed our plan and achieved in excess of $100,000 of net annualized operating profit improvement under both our restructuring and operating profit improvement plans. We will continue to apply the lessons learned in our completed plans by pursuing opportunities to optimize profitability and seeking to enhance operating results throughout our business.

Products and Brands
We currently market our products primarily under five propriety brands, composed of our four primary brands and our Other brands. Collectively, our brands compete across the fashion and casual lifestyle, performance, running and outdoor markets.
UGG. The UGG brand is one of the most iconic and recognized brands in our industry, which highlights our successful track record of building niche brands into lifestyle and fashion market leaders. With loyal consumers around the world, the UGG brand has proven to be a highly resilient line of premium footwear, apparel and accessories with expanded product offerings and a growing global audience that attracts women, men and children. We intend to continue diversifying the UGG brand to drive year-round product sales, including expansion of women’s spring and summer footwear, men’s products, apparel, home goods and accessories. The UGG brand is sold both domestically and internationally in key markets including the United States (US), Europe, Asia-Pacific, Canada and Latin America.
HOKA. The HOKA brand is an authentic, premium line of year-round performance footwear and apparel that offers enhanced cushioning and inherent stability with minimal weight, originally designed for ultra-runners, and now appeals to athletes around the world, regardless of activity. The HOKA brand is quickly becoming a leading brand within the specialty community with strong marketing fueling both domestic and international sales growth. We intend to leverage our domestic specialty strategy to expand and invest in international sales growth. The HOKA brand is sold both domestically and internationally in key markets, including the US, Canada, Europe, and Asia-Pacific.
Teva. The Teva brand, which pioneered the sport sandal category, is born from the outdoors and rooted in adventure. The Teva brand is a global leader within the sport sandal and modern outdoor lifestyle categories by fueling the expression of freedom. The Teva brand’s product line includes sandals, shoes, and boots. 
Sanuk. The Sanuk brand originated in Southern California surf culture and has emerged into a lifestyle brand with a presence in the relaxed casual shoe and sandal categories. The Sanuk brand’s use of unexpected materials and unconventional constructions, combined with its fun and playful branding, are key elements of the brand’s identity.
Other Brands. Other Brands currently consists of the Koolaburra by UGG brand, as well as other discontinued brands during the periods presented. The Koolaburra brand is a casual footwear fashion line using sheepskin and other plush materials, sold primarily through our wholesale channel and is intended to target the value-oriented consumer in order to complement our UGG brand offering.
Sales and Distribution
US Distribution. In our wholesale channel, we distribute our products in the US through sales representatives, who are organized by account type or geographically and by brand. In addition to our wholesale channel, we also sell products directly to consumers through our DTC business. 
Currently, our sales force is typically separated by brand, as each brand generally has certain specialty consumers that expect a dedicated sales team with specialized knowledge of our brands’ product offerings. However, there is some overlap between the sales teams and customers, and we have aligned our brands’ sales forces to position them for the future success of each of our brands. 
We distribute products sold in the US through our distribution centers in Moreno Valley and Camarillo, California, as well as through a third-party logistics provider (3PL) in Pennsylvania. Our distribution centers feature a warehouse management system that enables us to efficiently pick and pack products for direct shipment to customers. 
While we continue to operate our distribution center in Camarillo, we are currently working to move all of our Camarillo distribution operations to our Moreno Valley location. Once the migration of our distribution center operations from Camarillo to our Moreno Valley location is complete, we will be closing our Camarillo distribution center. We anticipate this closure to be completed in the first half of fiscal year 2020.
Refer to Item 2, “Properties,” and Note 7, “Commitments and Contingencies,” of our consolidated financial statements in Part IV within this Annual Report for further disclosure and discussion.

International Distribution. Internationally, in our wholesale channel, we distribute our products through independent distributors and wholly-owned subsidiaries in many regions and countries, including Europe, Asia-Pacific, Latin America, and Canada, among others. We also sell products internationally, particularly in China, through partner retail stores, which are branded stores that are wholly-owned and operated by third parties. In addition, in certain countries we sell products through our DTC business. For our wholesale and DTC businesses, we distribute our products through a number of distribution centers managed by 3PLs in certain international locations. 
UGG Wholesale. We sell our UGG brand products primarily through domestic higher-end department stores such as Nordstrom, Dillard’s, and Macy’s, as well as lifestyle retailers such as Journeys, and online retailers such as Amazon.com, Zappos.com, and Zalando.com. As the retail marketplace continues to evolve to reflect changing consumer preferences, we continually review and evaluate our UGG wholesale distribution and product segmentation approach.
HOKA Wholesale. We sell select HOKA brand footwear primarily through full-service domestic specialty retailers and select online retailers, including Fleet Feet, Road Runner Sports, Running Specialty Group, REI, Zappos.com, Amazon.com, and Running Warehouse. We expect to expand our HOKA brand wholesale distribution into international markets, including through strategic partners such as Intersport and Sport 2000 in Europe and Xebio Group in Japan.
Teva Wholesale. We sell our Teva brand footwear primarily through specialty outdoor retailers, sporting goods and department stores, including REI, Famous Footwear, DSW, Urban Outfitters, Free People, and online retailers such as Amazon.com and Zappos.com. 
Sanuk Wholesale. We sell our Sanuk brand footwear primarily through domestic independent action sports and outdoor specialty footwear retailers, larger national retail chains, and online retailers, including Journeys, Dillard’s, DSW, REI, and online retailers such as Amazon.com and Zappos.com. 
Other Brands Wholesale. We sell our other brands’ footwear primarily through department stores and online retailers. Key accounts of the Koolaburra brand include Kohl’s, DSW, QVC, and Rack Room Shoes.
 Direct-to-Consumer. Our DTC business is comprised of our retail stores and E-Commerce websites. Our retail stores and websites are largely intertwined and interdependent. In an Omni-Channel marketplace, we believe many of our consumers interact with both our retail stores and our websites before making purchasing decisions. For example, consumers may feel or try on products in our retail stores and then place an order online later. Conversely, they may initially research products online, and then view inventory availability by store location and make a purchase in store. Some examples that demonstrate the extent to which the sales channels are combined, which are designed to engender brand loyalty while increasing product sales and improving our inventory productivity, include the following:

• | “UGG Rewards”: We have implemented a consumer loyalty program under which points and awards are earned across the DTC business.


• | “Infinite UGG”: We provide online shopping access inside retail stores for all SKUs available on our E-Commerce websites.


• | “Ship from Store”: Inventory that is available in our stores but is out of stock online can be shipped from our stores. We expect future advancements in this capability will use algorithms to select the optimal fulfillment source.


• | “UGG Closet”: A limited E-Commerce outlet channel that offers an online portal designed to provide an efficient way to closeout inventory through direct sales to consumers.


• | “Buy Online / Return in-Store”: Our consumers can buy online and return products to our retail stores.


• | “Click and Collect”: Our consumers can buy online and have products delivered to certain retail stores for pick-up.


• | “Retail Inventory Online”: Our consumers can view specific store location inventory online before visiting the store.

Our retail stores enable us to expose consumers to a greater selection of products, directly impact our consumers’ experience with our brands, and sell our products at retail prices thereby generating larger gross margins. Our retail stores are predominantly UGG brand concept stores and UGG brand outlet stores. Through our outlet stores, we sell some of our discontinued styles from prior seasons, full price in-line products, as well as products made specifically for the outlet stores. 
As of March 31, 2019, we had a total of 156 company-owned global retail stores, which includes 88 concept stores and 68 outlet stores. Included in the total count of retail stores worldwide are nine UGG brand flagship stores, which are lead concept stores in our retail channel. In certain key markets and prominent locations, we have opened flagship stores to showcase our UGG brand products. These stores are typically larger and have broader product offerings and greater traffic than our general concept stores as they are primarily located in major tourist areas. Included in the total count of retail stores worldwide are concession stores, which are concept stores that are operated by us within a department or other store, which we lease from the store owner by paying a percentage of concession store sales. Partner retail stores are excluded from the total count of worldwide company-owned retail stores.
Refer to Part II, Item 7, “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” within this Annual Report for further disclosure and discussion.
Product Design and Development
The design and development functions for all of our brands are performed by a combination of internal design and development staff and outside freelance designers. Our design and development staff work closely with brand management to develop new styles for our product lines. Throughout the development process, we have multiple design and development reviews, which we then coordinate with our independent manufacturers. To ensure quality, consistency, and efficiency in our product design and development process, we continually evaluate the availability and cost of raw materials, the capabilities and capacity of our independent manufacturers, and the target retail price of new products. 
Manufacturing and Supply Chain
We outsource the production of our products to independent manufacturers, which are primarily located in Asia. We generally purchase products from our manufacturers on the basis of individual purchase orders or short-term purchase commitments, rather than maintaining long-term purchase commitments, which provides us greater flexibility to adapt to changing consumer preferences, changes in international trade relations, and manage our inventory. However, we do have long-standing relationships with most of these independent manufacturers, and we may not be able to identify substitute alternative manufacturers to satisfy our desire for such flexibility. We require our independent manufacturers and designated suppliers to adopt our Ethical Supply Chain Supplier Code of Conduct, which specifies that they comply with all local laws and regulations governing human rights, working conditions, and environmental compliance before we are willing to conduct business with them. We also require our manufacturing partners and licensees to comply with our Restricted Substances Policy, Anti-Corruption Policy and Conflict Minerals Policy, as well as other compliance policies and procedures, as a condition to conducting business with us.
Production by our independent manufacturers is performed in accordance with our detailed product specifications and rigorous quality control standards. We maintain a buying office in Hong Kong, as well as on-site supervisory offices in China and Vietnam, which collectively serve as a strong link to our independent manufacturers. We believe our strong regional presence enhances our manufacturing processes by providing predictability of material availability, compliance with laws and regulations, and adherence to quality control standards and final design specifications. In addition, we have instituted pre-production, in-line, and post-production inspections to meet or exceed our product quality requirements, as well as the expectations of our consumers. Our quality assurance program includes our own employee on-site inspectors at our independent manufacturers, who oversee the production process and perform quality assurance inspections. We also routinely inspect our products upon arrival at our distribution centers.
The majority of the materials and components used in the production of our products by these independent manufacturers are purchased from independent suppliers that we designate. At our direction, our manufacturers currently purchase the majority of the sheepskin used in our products from two tanneries in China, which source their sheepskin primarily from Australia and the United Kingdom (UK). We maintain routine communication with the tanneries to closely monitor the supply of sufficiently high-quality sheepskin for our projected UGG brand production. To ensure an adequate supply of sheepskin, we forecast our expected usage in advance at a forward price. We also enter into purchasing contracts and other pricing arrangements with certain sheepskin and leather suppliers to manage the supply 
6

of sheepskin. We believe current supplies are sufficient to meet our current and anticipated demand, but we continually monitor our supply chain and investigate options to accommodate our expected growth, as well as unexpected supply chain issues. Refer to Note 7, “Commitments and Contingencies,” of our consolidated financial statements in Part IV within this Annual Report for further information on our minimum purchase commitments.
In an effort to partially reduce our dependency on sheepskin, we use a proprietary raw material, UGGpure, which is a re-purposed wool woven into a durable backing, in some of our UGG brand products. In addition, as part of an ongoing effort to eliminate waste as part of our corporate sustainability efforts, most of the wool in UGGpure is sheared from the hides we are already using in our products. In addition, we are continuing to drive our strategy of introducing counter-seasonal products through category expansion, including the UGG brand’s spring and summer products, as well as the year-round performance footwear product offering of the HOKA brand, which we believe will help further reduce our dependency on sheepskin and UGGpure. Excluding sheepskin and UGGpure, we believe that substantially all raw materials and components used to manufacture our products, including wool, rubber, leather, and nylon webbing, are generally available from multiple sources at competitive prices. 
Inventory Management and Product Returns
We have an extended design and manufacturing process, which involves the initial design of our products, the purchase of raw materials, the accumulation of inventories, the subsequent sale of the inventories, and the collection of the resulting accounts receivable. This production cycle results in significant liquidity requirements and working capital fluctuations throughout our fiscal year. Because our production cycle typically involves long lead times, which requires us to make manufacturing decisions several months in advance of an anticipated purchasing decision by the consumer, it is challenging for us to estimate and manage our inventory and working capital requirements.
We seek to manage our inventory levels by considering existing customer orders, forecasted sales and budgets, and the delivery requirements of our customers. As part of our operating profit improvement plan, we have implemented systems and processes designed to improve our product forecasting, inventory control and supply chain management capabilities. In addition, added discipline around product purchasing decisions, the reduction of production lead times, and the sale of excess inventory through our liquidation channels, are key areas of focus that we expect will further enhance inventory performance. 
Our practice, and the general practice in our industry, is to offer retail customers the right to return defective or improperly shipped merchandise.
Backlog
We encourage our wholesale and distributor customers to place a significant portion of orders as pre-season orders, which are typically placed up to 12 months prior to the anticipated shipment date, as well as in-season fill-in orders that can be shipped immediately. We work with our customers through pre-season programs to enable us to better plan our production schedule, inventory and shipping requirements. 
We have historically defined backlog as unfilled customer orders from our wholesale customers and distributors as of any particular date, which represent orders scheduled to be shipped at a future date, some of which are subject to cancellation prior to shipment. Our calculation of backlog also includes bulk orders, which generally comprise larger volume orders from significant customer accounts. These types of orders typically have terms that allow customers to vary the location and timing of shipments.
As of March 31, 2019, our backlog was $978,200, which represents a 14.4% annual increase over our backlog as of March 31, 2018. The backlog increase primarily relates to timing where certain top customers placed orders earlier versus the prior comparative period rather than an indication of an expected significant increase in sales.

We believe backlog is an imprecise indicator of our actual product shipments and future operating results and is not material to an overall understanding of our business, especially given that backlog excludes sales within our DTC segment, as well as in-season orders. The backlog as of a particular date is affected by a number of factors, including seasonality, the timing of customer orders, the timing of product shipments, the potential that certain orders may be cancelled, and our manufacturing schedule. As a result, comparisons of backlog from period-to-period are not necessarily indicative of our future operating results.

Our People and our Culture
Employees. As of March 31, 2019, we employed approximately 3,500 employees in North America, Europe, and Asia. This includes approximately 1,600 employees in our retail stores worldwide, which includes part-time and seasonal employees. For a variety of reasons, including those discussed below, we believe that our relationship with our employees is favorable. 
Encouraging Diversity. We strive to create a culture of inclusion where employees are able to freely contribute equally regardless of gender, age, race, disability or sexual orientation. Our Code of Ethics, which all employees are trained on bi-annually, codifies these values. Our employee-led initiative, VOICES, is an avenue that elevates employee issues and celebrates our uniqueness. 
Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability
As a global leader in designing, marketing and distributing innovative footwear, apparel and accessories, our worldwide scope and impact is significant. Equally significant is the responsibility we believe we have to our stakeholders, including our consumers, employees, shareholders, and the communities we serve to employ socially conscious operations and sustainable business practices, with the goal of continuing to deliver quality products to our consumers and sound financial performance to our shareholders, while minimizing the environmental impact of our business footprint. Achieving measurable sustainability success is key to our future economic and business growth, and we constantly work to establish sustainable development goals (SDGs) that we believe will make the most significant impact for our business, our shareholders and our communities. Our sustainability policies and strategies are aligned with, and informed by, our ongoing efforts with multi-stakeholder initiatives, which involve our employees, our suppliers and our customers, as well as other brands and non-governmental organizations.

In 2010, we launched our Corporate Responsibility Program, and in October 2016 we announced our participation in the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC), which is the world’s largest voluntary corporate citizenship initiative. Our Compliance Officer is tasked with identifying specific SDGs set forth in the UNGC, which guide our supply chain and brand business teams’ efforts to address environmental and social challenges, while the three independent members of the Corporate Governance Committee will oversee our corporate responsibility and sustainability efforts. Our internal audit team provides periodic targeted reviews of our policies and procedures to the Audit Committee to help us remain focused on our approach to our SDG’s and to ensure appropriate leadership involvement. 
We assess risks related to environmental, social and governance issues annually as part of our overall enterprise risk management approach. This assessment informs the annual targets established for our SDGs, which are currently focused on seven categories where we believe we can make the most impact, namely, materials; waste; water; gender equality and quality education; chemicals; climate and clean energy; and human rights. We have been recognized by Barron’s as one of the Top 100 most sustainable US companies in calendar year 2019. We encourage our key manufacturing partners and suppliers to adopt sustainable business practices, which are intended to minimize adverse impact on the environment. We also have an Ethical Supply Chain Supplier Code of Conduct and Animal Welfare Policy which guides our partners to act responsibly when sourcing materials on our behalf. We also audit our operations, and the operations of key partners within our supply chain, to ensure workers are treated with dignity and respect. 
The following is a brief overview of our current SDGs and fiscal year 2019 related achievements:

• | Materials: We sourced 97% of our leather supplies from Leather Working Group-certified tanneries, which promote sustainable and environmentally friendly business practices within the leather industry.


• | Materials: We continue to seek sustainable alternatives for key product materials, with a goal to source at least 90% of materials from suppliers certified by third-party benchmarking organizations.


• | Water: We have reduced our water usage through manufacturing process improvements and have encouraged our manufacturing partners and suppliers to do the same by measuring their water output. Our sustainable development goal mandates that at least 90% of our core factory partners and suppliers apply industry best practices regarding water treatment and usage.


• | Chemicals: We seek to achieve environmentally sound management of chemicals and reduce the discharge of hazardous substances among our key business partners. We are on track to eliminate PFCs from our supply chain by calendar year 2020.


• | Climate and Clean Energy: We strive to increase our year-over-year solar power usage at our headquarters and distribution centers, as well as to integrate climate change measures into our policies

8

and planning. We measure energy usage by certain of our partners to encourage reduced energy consumption.

• | Gender Equality and Quality Education: We promote diversity, gender equality, female empowerment, and inclusion through our annual Women’s Leadership Summit, our partnership with the HERproject, and our initiation of the EDGE Certification process, the leading global assessment and business certification for gender equality.


• | Human Rights: We have established robust ethical supply chain criteria based on International Labor Organization standards and audit our supply chain pursuant to such criteria on an ongoing basis. Audit results are included on performance scorecards for regular review by executive management.

Our fiscal year 2019 Corporate Responsibility Report will provide more information on our achievements this year.
Charitable Giving and Volunteering. Our charitable contributions, product donations, and employee volunteer efforts are an essential part of our culture. During fiscal year 2019, we have dedicated out strategic giving and engagement efforts to categories related to our SDGs, our business and our communities because we believe that is where we can make the most impact, including arts and culture, human services, education, international affairs, environment and animal welfare, and health and society. During fiscal year 2019, we donated over $1,300 to various non-profit organizations. Since 2006, we have donated over 900,000 pairs of shoes to Soles4Souls and Good360, non-profit organizations that distribute shoes to those in need. We encourage our employees to volunteer by compensating them for up to 24 hours of volunteer time each year. 
Reportable Operating Segments and Geographic Areas
Our six reportable operating segments include the strategic business units responsible for the worldwide operations of the wholesale divisions of our brands (UGG, HOKA, Teva, Sanuk, and Other brands), as well as our DTC business. Refer to Note 12, “Reportable Operating Segments,” for further discussion of our reportable operating segments and to Note 13, “Concentration of Business,” of our consolidated financial statements in Part IV within this Annual Report for financial information about geographic areas and concentration of related business risks.
Seasonality
Our business is seasonal, with the highest percentage of UGG brand net sales occurring in the quarters ending September 30th and December 31st and the highest percentage of Teva and Sanuk brand net sales occurring in the quarters ending March 31st and June 30th. Due to the size of the UGG brand relative to our other brands, our aggregate net sales in the quarters ending September 30th and December 31st have significantly exceeded net sales in the quarters ending March 31st and June 30th. While we have taken steps to diversify our product offerings, both by creating more year-round styles and expanding product offerings within our existing brands, and by acquiring and developing new brands, we expect this trend to continue for the foreseeable future.
For further discussion of the factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from our expectations, as well as factors that may impact our future results of operations, refer to Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” and Part II, Item 7, “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” within this Annual Report.
Competition
The markets in which we operate are highly competitive. Our competitors include athletic and footwear companies, branded apparel companies and retailers with their own private labels. Although the footwear industry is fragmented to a certain degree, many of our competitors are larger and have substantially greater resources than us, several of which compete directly with some of our products. In addition, access to offshore manufacturing and the growth of E-Commerce has made it easier for new companies to enter the markets in which we compete, further increasing competition in the footwear, apparel and accessories industry. In particular, and in part due to the popularity of our UGG brand and HOKA brand products, we face increasing competition from a significant number of domestic and international competitors selling products designed to compete directly or indirectly with our products. We believe that our ability to successfully compete depends on numerous factors, including our ability to assess and respond quickly to changing consumer tastes and preferences, produce appealing products that meet expectations for product quality and technical performance, maintain and enhance the image and strength of our brands, price our products competitively, and adjust to changing legal and social standards, among others. 
9

In addition, we believe that our key customers face intense competition from other department stores, sporting goods stores, retail specialty stores, and online retailers, among others, which could negatively impact the financial stability of their businesses and their ability to conduct business with us.
Refer to Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” within this Annual Report for further discussion of the potential impact of competition on our business and results of operations.
Patents and Trademarks
We utilize trademarks for virtually all of our products and believe that having distinctive marks that are readily identifiable is an important factor in creating a market for our products, promoting our brands, and distinguishing our products from the products of others. We currently hold trademark registrations for “UGG,” “Teva,” “Sanuk,” “HOKA One One,” “Koolaburra,” “Ahnu,” “UGGpure,” and other marks in the US, and for certain of the marks in many other countries, including Canada, China, the UK, various countries in the European Union, Japan and Korea. As of March 31, 2019, we hold 182 designs and inventions with corresponding design or utility patent registrations, plus ten designs and inventions which are currently pending registration. These patents expire at various times. We regard our proprietary rights as valuable assets and vigorously protect such rights against infringement by third parties.
Government Regulation
Compliance with federal, state, and local environmental regulations has not had, and it is not expected to have, any material effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, or competitive position based on information and circumstances known to us at this time.
