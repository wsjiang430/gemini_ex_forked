Item 1. Business.

BUSINESS OVERVIEW
OneMain Holdings, Inc. is referred to in this report as “OMH” or, collectively with its subsidiaries, whether directly or indirectly owned, “the Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our.”
As one of the nation’s largest consumer finance companies, we:

• | provide responsible personal loan products;


• | offer optional credit and non-credit insurance products;


• | service loans owned by us and service loans owned by third-parties;


• | pursue strategic acquisitions and dispositions of assets and businesses, including loan portfolios or other financial assets; and


• | may establish joint ventures or enter into other strategic alliances.

We provide origination, underwriting and servicing of personal loans, primarily to non-prime customers. We believe we are well positioned for future growth, with an experienced management team, proven access to the capital markets, and strong demand for consumer credit. At December 31, 2018, we had $16.2 billion of personal loans due from approximately 2.4 million customer accounts across 44 states.
Our network of over 1,600 branches and expert personnel is complemented by our online personal loan origination capabilities and centralized operations, which allows us to reach customers located outside our branch network. Our digital platform provides our current and prospective customers the option of obtaining a personal loan via our website, www.omf.com.
We also pursue strategic acquisitions and dispositions of assets and businesses, including loan portfolios and other financial assets, as well as fee-based opportunities in servicing loans for others in connection with potential strategic portfolio acquisitions through our centralized operations. See “Centralized Operations” below for further information on our centralized servicing centers. We service loans acquired through a joint venture in which we previously owned a 47% equity interest in the SpringCastle Portfolio. On March 31, 2016, the SpringCastle Portfolio was sold in connection with the SpringCastle Interests Sale. 
Prior to June 25, 2018, Springleaf Financial Holdings, LLC (“SFH”), owned approximately 44% of OMH’s common stock. SFH was owned primarily by a private equity fund managed by an affiliate of Fortress.
On June 25, 2018, an investor group led by funds managed by affiliates of Apollo and Värde (the “Apollo-Värde Group”) completed its purchase from SFH of 54,937,500 shares of our common stock at a purchase price per share of $26.00 for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $1.4 billion in cash (the “Apollo-Värde Transaction”). Upon closing of the Apollo-Värde Transaction, we entered into an Amended and Restated Stockholders’ Agreement, the terms of which are described in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on June 25, 2018. As provided for in the Amended and Restated Stockholders’ Agreement, the Apollo-Värde Group has designated six of our nine directors.
At December 31, 2018, the Apollo-Värde Group owned approximately 40.5% of OMH’s common stock and is OMH’s largest stockholder.
On June 22, 2018, Springleaf Finance, Inc. (“SFI”), a separate wholly owned direct subsidiary of OMH, entered into a contribution agreement with Springleaf Finance Corporation (“SFC”), a wholly owned direct subsidiary of SFI and a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of OMH, pursuant to which all of the common interests of Independence Holdings, LLC (“Independence”) were contributed to SFC (the “Contribution”). As a result of the Contribution and effective as of June 22, 2018, (i) Independence became a wholly owned direct subsidiary of SFC and (ii) Independence’s direct and indirect subsidiaries, including OMFH, became indirect subsidiaries of SFC. Independence, through its principal subsidiary OMFH, engages in the consumer finance and insurance businesses.

The following chart summarizes our organization structure. The chart is provided for illustrative purposes only and does not represent all of OMH’s subsidiaries or obligations.
INDUSTRY AND MARKET OVERVIEW
We operate in the consumer finance industry serving consumers who have limited access to credit from banks, credit card companies and other traditional lenders. Using November 2018 data from Experian, we estimated that there are approximately 100 million U.S. borrowers in our target market, who collectively have approximately $1.2 trillion of outstanding borrowings in the form of personal installment loans, vehicle loans and leases, and credit cards. We believe this large market provides for an attractive market opportunity. 
We are one of the few national participants in the consumer installment lending industry. Our national branch network, combined with the capabilities resident in our centralized operations, provide a platform to efficiently and responsibly serve this market of consumers. We believe we are well-positioned to capitalize on the significant growth and expansion opportunity within our industry. See also “Competition” included in this report.
SEGMENTS
Our segments coincide with how our businesses are managed. At December 31, 2018, our two segments include:

• | Consumer and Insurance; and


• | Acquisitions and Servicing.

The remaining components (which we refer to as “Other”) consist of our non-originating legacy operations, which include our liquidating real estate loans and our liquidating retail sales finance portfolios. See Note 22 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report for more information.
On September 30, 2018, our real estate loans previously classified as Other Receivables were transferred from held for
investment to held for sale. Subsequent to the transfer, we sold a portfolio of real estate loans with a carrying value of $82 million (the “December 2018 Real Estate Loan Sale”). See Notes 2, 5, 6 and 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report for more information. 
 11


Consumer and Insurance
We originate and service secured and unsecured personal loans and offer optional credit and non-credit insurance and related products through our combined branch network, our digital platform, and our centralized operations. Personal loan origination and servicing, along with our insurance products, forms the core of our operations. Our branch operations included over 1,600 branch offices in 44 states as of December 31, 2018. In addition, our centralized support operations provide underwriting and servicing support to branch operations.
Our insurance business is conducted through our insurance subsidiaries, AHL, Merit, and Triton, which are wholly owned subsidiaries. As of September 30, 2018, the Company sold all of the issued and outstanding shares of its former insurance subsidiary, Yosemite, to a third party. Merit and AHL are life and health insurance companies licensed to write credit life, credit disability, and non-credit insurance products. Merit is licensed in 46 states, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, and AHL is licensed in 49 states, the District of Columbia, and Canada. Triton is a property and casualty insurance company licensed to write credit involuntary unemployment and collateral protection insurance. Triton is licensed in 50 states, the District of Columbia, and Canada. See Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report for further information. 
Products and Services. Our personal loan portfolio is comprised of assets that have performed through various market conditions. Our personal loans are non-revolving, with a fixed-rate, a fixed term of three to six years, and are secured by automobiles, other titled collateral, or are unsecured. Our secured personal loans include direct auto loans which are typically larger in size based on the collateral of newer cars with higher values. Our loans have no pre-payment penalties.
We offer the following optional credit insurance products to our customers:

• | Credit life insurance — Insures the life of the borrower in an amount typically equal to the unpaid balance of the finance receivable and provides for payment to the lender of the finance receivable in the event of the borrower’s death.


• | Credit disability insurance — Provides scheduled monthly loan payments to the lender during borrower’s disability due to illness or injury.


• | Credit involuntary unemployment insurance — Provides scheduled monthly loan payments to the lender during borrower’s involuntary unemployment.

We offer optional non-credit insurance policies, which are primarily traditional level-term life policies with very limited underwriting.
We offer optional membership plans for home and auto from an unaffiliated company. We have no risk of loss on these membership plans, and these plans are not considered insurance products. We recognize income from this product in other revenues — other. The unaffiliated company providing these membership plans is responsible for any required reimbursement to the customer.
We also offer a Guaranteed Asset Protection (“GAP”) waiver product. GAP waiver is a non-insurance product for coverage in an event of a total loss to the auto, all or part of the difference between what the customer owes on their auto loan and the payment amount made by the customer’s primary auto insurance.
Should a customer fail to maintain required insurance on property pledged as collateral for the finance receivable, we obtain collateral protection insurance, at the customer’s expense, that protects the value of that collateral. 
Customer Development. We staff each of our branch offices with local, well-trained personnel who have significant experience in the industry. Our business model revolves around an origination, underwriting, and servicing process that leverages our local community presence. Our customers often develop a relationship with their local office representatives, which we believe not only improves the credit performance of our personal loans but also leads to additional lending opportunities.
We solicit prospective customers, as well as current and former customers, through a variety of direct mail offers, targeted online advertising, and local marketing. We use proprietary modeling, along with data purchased from credit bureaus, alternative data providers, and our existing data/experience to acquire and develop new and profitable customer relationships.
 12


Our digital platform allows current and prospective customers the ability to apply for a personal loan online, at omf.com. Many of our new customer applications are sourced online, delivered via targeted marketing, search engine tools, banner advertisements, e-mail, and internet loan aggregators. Most online applications are closed in a branch; however, we do close a small portion of our loans remotely outside the branch.
Credit Risk. Credit quality is driven by our long-standing underwriting philosophy, which considers each prospective customer’s household budget, and his or her willingness and capacity to repay the loan. We use credit risk scoring models at the time of the credit application to assess the applicant’s expected willingness and capacity to repay. We develop these models using numerous factors, including past customer credit repayment experience and application data, and periodically revalidate these models based on recent portfolio performance. Our underwriting process in the branches and for loan applications received through our website that are not automatically declined includes the development of a budget (net of taxes and monthly expenses) for the applicant. We obtain a security interest in titled property for our secured personal loans.
Our customers are primarily considered non-prime and often require significantly higher levels of servicing than prime customers. As a result, we tend to charge these customers higher interest rates to compensate us for the related credit risks and servicing costs.
Account Servicing. Account servicing and collections for personal loans are handled at the branch office where the personal loans were originated, or in our centralized service centers. All servicing and collection activity is conducted and documented on proprietary systems which log and maintain, within our centralized information systems, a permanent record of all transactions and notations made with respect to the servicing and/or collection of a personal loan and may be also be used to assess a personal loan application. The proprietary systems permit all levels of branch office management to review on a daily basis the individual and collective performance of all branch offices for which they are responsible.
Acquisitions and Servicing
We service the SpringCastle Portfolio that was acquired through a joint venture in which we previously owned a 47% equity interest. On March 31, 2016, we sold our interest in the SpringCastle Portfolio in connection with the SpringCastle Interests Sale. These loans consisted of unsecured loans and loans secured by subordinate residential real estate mortgages and included both closed-end accounts and open-end lines of credit. Unless we are terminated, we will continue to provide the servicing for these loans pursuant to a servicing agreement, which we service as unsecured loans due to the fact that the liens are subordinated to superior ranking security interests.
CENTRALIZED OPERATIONS
We continually seek to identify functions that could be more effective if centralized to achieve reduced costs or free our lending specialists to service our customers and market our products. Our centralized operational functions support the following:

• | mail and telephone solicitations;


• | payment processing;


• | originating “out of network” loans;


• | servicing of delinquent real estate loans and certain personal loans;


• | bankruptcy process for loans in Chapter 7, 11, 12 and 13 proceedings;


• | litigation requests for wage garnishments and other actions against borrowers;


• | collateral protection insurance tracking;


• | repossessing and re-marketing of titled collateral;


• | sales and retention of customers; and


• | charge-off recovery operations.

We currently have servicing facilities in Mendota Heights, Minnesota; Tempe, Arizona; London, Kentucky; Evansville, Indiana; Fort Mill, South Carolina; and Fort Worth, Texas. We believe these facilities position us for additional portfolio purchases or fee-based servicing, as well as additional flexibility in the servicing of our lending products.
 13


OPERATIONAL CONTROLS
We continuously strive to strengthen our system of internal controls to ensure compliance with laws, rules, and regulations, and to improve the oversight of our operations. We evaluate internal systems, processes and controls to mitigate operational risk and control and monitor our businesses through a variety of methods including the following:

• | Our operational policies and procedures standardize various aspects of lending and collections.


• | Our branch finance receivable systems control amounts, rates, terms, and fees of our customers’ accounts; create loan documents specific to the state in which the branch office operates or to the customer’s location if the loan is made electronically through our centralized operations; and control cash receipts and disbursements.


• | Our accounting personnel reconcile bank accounts, investigate discrepancies, and resolve differences.


• | Our credit risk management system reports allow us to track individual branch office performance and to monitor lending and collection activities.


• | Our privacy and information security incident response plan establishes a privacy and information security response team that responds to information security incidents by identifying, evaluating, responding to, investigating, and resolving information security incidents impacting our information systems.


• | Our executive information system is available to headquarters and field operations management to review the status of activity through the close of business of the prior day.


• | Our branch operations management structure, Regional Quality Coordinators and Compliance Field Examination team are designed to control a large, decentralized organization with succeeding levels of supervision staffed with more experienced personnel.


• | Our branch operations compensation plan aligns with corporate strategies and is based on profitability, credit quality, and compliance.


• | Our compliance department assesses our compliance with federal and state laws and regulations, as well as our compliance with our internal policies and procedures; oversees training to ensure team members have a sufficient level of understanding of the laws and regulations that impact their job responsibilities; and manages our regulatory examination process.


• | Our Executive Office of Customer Care maintains our consumer complaint resolution and reporting process.


• | Our internal audit department audits our business for adherence to operational policy and procedure and compliance with federal and state laws and regulations.

PRIVACY, DATA PROTECTION, INFORMATION AND CYBER SECURITY 
Regulatory and legislative activity in the areas of privacy, data protection and information and cyber security continues to increase worldwide. We have established and continue to maintain policies that provide a framework for compliance with applicable privacy, data protection and information and cyber security laws and meet evolving customer privacy expectations.
Our regulators, including the CFPB, are increasingly focused on ensuring that our privacy, data protection and information and cyber security-related policies and practices are adequate to inform customers of our data collection, use, sharing and/or security practices, to provide them with choices, if required, about how we use and share their information, and to appropriately safeguard their personal information and account access.

Our consumer loan business is subject to the privacy, disclosure and safeguarding provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) and the CFPB’s Regulation P, which implements the statute. Among other things, the GLBA imposes certain limitations on our ability to share consumers’ nonpublic personal information with nonaffiliated third parties and requires us to develop, implement and maintain a written comprehensive information security program containing safeguards that are appropriate to the size and complexity of our business, the nature and scope of our activities and the sensitivity of customer information that we process. Various states also have adopted laws, rules and regulations pertaining to privacy and/or information and cyber security that may be more stringent and/or expansive than federal requirements. Certain of these requirements may apply to the personal information of our employees and contractors as well as to our customers. Various U.S. federal regulators and U.S. states and territories have also enacted data security breach notification requirements that are applicable to us.

REGULATION
Federal Laws
Various federal laws and regulations govern loan origination, servicing and collections, including:

• | the Dodd-Frank Act (which, among other things, created the CFPB);


• | the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (which, among other things, prohibits discrimination against creditworthy applicants) and the CFPB’s Regulation B, which implements this statute;


• | the Fair Credit Reporting Act (which, among other things, governs the use of credit bureau reports and reporting information to credit bureaus);


• | the Truth in Lending Act (which, among other things, governs disclosure of applicable charges and other terms of consumer credit) and the CFPB’s Regulation Z, which implements this statute;


• | the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (which, among other things, governs practices in collecting certain debts);


• | the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (which, among other things, governs the handling of personal financial information) and the CFPB’s Regulation P, which implements this statute;


• | the Military Lending Act (which, among other things, governs certain consumer lending to active-duty military servicemembers and their spouses and covered dependents and limits, the interest rate and certain fees, charges and premium they may be charged on certain loans);


• | the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, which, among other things, can impose limitations on the interest rate and the servicer’s ability to collect on a loan originated with an obligor who is on active duty status and up to nine months thereafter;


• | the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act and the CFPB’s Regulation X (both of which regulate the making and servicing of closed end residential mortgage loans);


• | the Federal Trade Commission’s Consumer Claims and Defenses Rule, also known as the “Holder in Due Course” Rule (which, among other things, allows a consumer to assert, against the assignees of certain credit contracts, certain claims that the consumer may have against the originator of the credit contracts); and


• | the Federal Trade Commission Act (which, among other things, prohibits unfair and deceptive acts and practices).

The Dodd-Frank Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder have affected and are likely in the future to affect our operations in terms of increased oversight of financial services products by the CFPB and the imposition of restrictions on the terms of certain loans. Among regulations the CFPB has promulgated are mortgage servicing regulations that became effective January 10, 2014 and are applicable to the remaining real estate loan portfolio serviced by or for Springleaf. Amendments to some sections of these mortgage servicing regulations became effective on October 19, 2017 and some became effective on April 19, 2018. The CFPB has significant authority to implement and enforce federal consumer finance laws, including the new protections established in the Dodd-Frank Act, as well as the authority to identify and prohibit unfair, deceptive, and abusive acts and practices. In addition, under the Dodd-Frank Act, securitizations of loan portfolios are subject to certain restrictions and additional requirements, including requirements that the originator retain a portion of the credit risk of the securities sold and the reporting of buyback requests from investors. We also utilize third party debt collectors and will continue to be responsible for oversight of their procedures and controls.
The CFPB has supervisory, examination and enforcement authority with respect to various federal consumer protection laws for some providers of consumer financial products and services, such as any nonbank that it has reasonable cause to determine has engaged or is engaging in conduct that poses risks to consumers with regard to consumer financial products or services. In addition to the authority to bring nonbanks under the CFPB’s supervisory authority based on risk determinations, the CFPB also has authority under the Dodd-Frank Act to supervise nonbanks, regardless of size, in certain specific markets, such as mortgage companies (including mortgage originators, brokers and servicers) and payday lenders. Currently, the CFPB has supervisory authority over the Company with respect to mortgage servicing and mortgage origination, which allows the CFPB to conduct an examination of our mortgage servicing practices and our prior mortgage origination practices.
The Dodd-Frank Act also gives the CFPB supervisory authority over entities that are designated as “larger participants” in certain financial services markets, including the auto financing market and the consumer installment lending market. On June 30, 2015, the CFPB published its final rule for designating “larger participants” in the auto financing market. With the adoption of this regulation, we are considered a larger participant in the auto financing market and are subject to supervision and examination by the CFPB for our direct auto loan business, including loans that are secured by autos and refinances of loans secured by autos that were for the purchase of autos. In its Spring 2018 rulemaking agenda, the CFPB stated that it had decided 
 15


to classify as “inactive” certain rulemakings previously identified in the expectation that the final decisions on proceeding will be made by the next permanent director. The larger-participant rule for consumer installment loans was one of the rulemaking initiatives designated as inactive. It is not known if or when the CFPB may consider reactivating the rulemaking process for the larger participant rule for consumer installment loans.
On October 5, 2017, the CFPB issued its final rule for Payday, Vehicle Title, and Certain High-Cost Installment Loans (the “small-dollar rule”). The final small-dollar rule does not apply to any loan made by the Company because our loans have a term of 46+ days, no balloon payment, and an APR limit of 36%. The proposed rule, published in 2016, had covered a relatively small segment of our loans because it calculated the 36% high-cost coverage threshold as an “all-in” APR, a term that included the cost of insurance and other ancillary products purchased within 3 days of the loan closing date. The final rule calculates the 36% figure under the traditional method prescribed by the Truth-In-Lending Act (TILA). Because the final rule replaced the proposed rule’s “all-in” APR calculation with a TILA APR calculation - a change that the Company advocated in the public comment letter it submitted to the CFPB - the final rule covers no loan made by the Company, even if the loan is both sold with insurance and secured by a vehicle or recurring ACH authorization.
The investigation and enforcement provisions of Title X of the Dodd Frank Act may adversely affect our business if the CFPB or one or more state attorneys general or state regulators believe that we have violated any federal consumer financial protection laws, including the prohibition in Title X against unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices. The CFPB is authorized to conduct investigations to determine whether any person is engaging in, or has engaged in, conduct that violates federal consumer financial protection laws, and to initiate enforcement actions for such violations, regardless of its direct supervisory authority. Investigations may be conducted jointly with other regulators. The CFPB has the authority to impose monetary penalties for violations of federal consumer financial laws, require remediation of practices and pursue administrative proceedings or litigation for violations of federal consumer financial laws (including the CFPB’s own rules). In these proceedings, the CFPB can obtain cease and desist orders (which can include orders for restitution or rescission of contracts, as well as other kinds of affirmative relief) and monetary penalties for minor, reckless and knowing violations of federal consumer financial laws (including the CFPB’s own rules). Also, the Dodd-Frank Act empowers state attorneys general and state regulators to bring civil actions against state-chartered companies, among others, for enforcement of the provisions of Title X of the Dodd-Frank Act, including CFPB regulations issued under Title X, and to secure remedies provided under Title X or other law.
The Dodd-Frank Act also requires that a securitizer generally retain not less than 5% of the credit risk for certain types of securitized assets that are created, transferred, sold, or conveyed through issuance of asset-backed securities with an exception for securitizations that are wholly composed of “qualified residential mortgages.” The risk retention requirement has reduced the amount of financing typically obtained from our securitization transactions and has imposed compliance costs on our securitizations and costs with respect to certain of our financing transactions, as we describe in Note 13 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report. In addition, the SEC adopted significant revisions to Regulation AB, imposing new requirements for asset-level disclosures for asset-backed securities backed by real estate related assets, auto related assets, or backed by debt securities. This could result in sweeping changes to the commercial and residential mortgage loan securitization markets, as well as to the market for the re-securitization of mortgage-backed securities.
State Laws
Various state laws and regulations also govern personal loans and real estate secured loans. Many states have laws and regulations that are similar to the federal laws referred to above, but the degree and nature of such laws and regulations vary from state to state. While federal laws preempt similar state laws in some instances, many times compliance with state laws and regulations is still required.
 16


In general, these additional state laws and regulations, under which we conduct a substantial amount of our lending business:

• | provide for state licensing and periodic examination of lenders and loan originators, including state laws adopted or amended to comply with licensing requirements of the federal Secure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing Act of 2008 (which, in some states, requires licensing of individuals who perform real estate loan modifications);


• | require the filing of reports with regulators and compliance with state regulatory capital requirements;


• | impose maximum term, amount, interest rate, and limit other charges;


• | impose consumer privacy rights and other obligations that may require us to notify customers, employees, state attorneys general, regulators and others in the event of a security breach;


• | regulate whether and under what circumstances we may offer insurance and other ancillary products in connection with a lending transaction; and


• | provide for additional consumer protections.

There is a clear trend of increased state regulation on loan origination, servicing and collection, as well as more detailed reporting, more detailed examinations, and coordination of examinations among the states.
State authorities also regulate and supervise our insurance business. The extent of such regulation varies by product and by state, but relates primarily to the following:

• | licensing;


• | conduct of business, including marketing and sales practices;


• | periodic financial and market conduct examination of the affairs of insurers;


• | form and content of required financial reports;


• | standards of solvency;


• | limitations on the payment of dividends and other affiliate transactions;


• | types of products offered;


• | approval of policy forms and premium rates;


• | formulas used to calculate any unearned premium refund due to an insured customer;


• | permissible investments;


• | deposits of securities for the benefit of policyholders;


• | reserve requirements for unearned premiums, losses, and other purposes; and


• | claims processing.

The Canadian federal and provincial insurance regulators regulate and supervise the insurance made available to borrowers through a third party Canadian lender. Its regulation and supervision relate primarily to the following:

• | licensing;


• | conduct of business, including marketing and sales practices;


• | periodic financial and market conduct examination of the affairs of insurers;


• | form and content of required financial reports;


• | standards of solvency;


• | limitations on the payment of dividends and other affiliate transactions;


• | types of products offered; and


• | reserve requirements for unearned premiums, losses, and other purposes.

COMPETITION
We operate primarily in the consumer installment lending industry, focusing on the non-prime customer. As of December 31, 2018, we maintained a national network of brick and mortar branches. 
There are a number of local, regional and internet competitors in the consumer installment lending industry serving the large population of non-prime customers. We also compete with other types of financial institutions within our geographic network and over the Internet, including community banks and credit unions, that offer similar products and services. We believe that competition between consumer installment lenders occurs primarily on the basis of price, speed of service, flexibility of loan terms offered, and the quality of customer service provided.
We believe that we possess several competitive strengths that position us to capitalize on the significant growth and expansion opportunity within our industry, and to compete effectively with other lenders in our industry. The capabilities resident in our national branch system provide us with a proven distribution channel for our personal loan and optional insurance products, allowing us to provide same-day fulfillment to approved customers and giving us a distinct competitive advantage over many industry participants who do not have—and cannot replicate without significant investment—a similar network. Our digital platform and our centralized operations also enhance our nationwide network by allowing us to serve customers who reside outside of our branch network. We believe our deep understanding of local markets and customers, together with our proprietary underwriting process, data analytics, and decisioning tools allow us to price, manage and monitor risk effectively through changing economic conditions. In addition, our high-touch relationship-based servicing model is a major contributor to our superior loan performance and distinguishes us from our competitors.
