ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

The Company and the Operating Partnership
Tanger Factory Outlet Centers, Inc. and subsidiaries, which we refer to as the Company, is one of the largest owners and operators of outlet centers in the United States and Canada. We are a fully-integrated, self-administered and self-managed REIT, which focuses exclusively on developing, acquiring, owning, operating and managing outlet shopping centers. As of December 31, 2018, our consolidated portfolio consisted of 36 outlet centers, with a total gross leasable area of approximately 12.9 million square feet, which were 97% occupied and contained over 2,600 stores representing approximately 400 store brands. We also had partial ownership interests in 8 unconsolidated outlet centers totaling approximately 2.4 million square feet, including 4 outlet centers in Canada. 
Our outlet centers and other assets are held by, and all of our operations are conducted by, Tanger Properties Limited Partnership and subsidiaries, which we refer to as the Operating Partnership. The Company owns the majority of the units of partnership interest issued by the Operating Partnership through its two wholly-owned subsidiaries, Tanger GP Trust and Tanger LP Trust. Tanger GP Trust controls the Operating Partnership as its sole general partner. Tanger LP Trust holds a limited partnership interest. 
As of December 31, 2018, the Company, through its ownership of the Tanger GP Trust and Tanger LP Trust, owned 93,941,783 units of the Operating Partnership and the Non-Company LPs collectively owned 4,960,684 Class A common limited partnership units. Each Class A common limited partnership unit held by the Non-Company LPs is exchangeable for one of the Company's common shares, subject to certain limitations to preserve the Company's status as a REIT. Class B common limited partnership units, which are held by Tanger LP Trust, are not exchangeable for common shares of the Company.
Ownership of the Company's common shares is restricted to preserve the Company's status as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. Subject to certain exceptions, a person may not actually or constructively own more than 4% of our common shares. We also operate in a manner intended to enable us to preserve our status as a REIT, including, among other things, making distributions with respect to our then outstanding common shares and preferred shares, if applicable, equal to at least 90% of our taxable income each year. 
The Company is a North Carolina corporation that was incorporated in March 1993 and the Operating Partnership is a North Carolina partnership that was formed in May 1993. Our executive offices are currently located at 3200 Northline Avenue, Suite 360, Greensboro, North Carolina, 27408 and our telephone number is (336) 292-3010.

Recent Developments
Financing Transactions 
Increased Borrowing Capacity and Extension of Unsecured Lines of Credit
In January 2018, we closed on amendments to our unsecured lines of credit, which increased the borrowing capacity from $520.0 million to $600.0 million and extended the maturity date from October 2019 to October 2021, with a one-year extension option. We also reduced the interest rate spread over the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") from 0.90% to 0.875%, and increased the incremental borrowing availability through an accordion feature on the syndicated line from $1.0 billion to $1.2 billion. 
Southaven Mortgage
In February 2018, the consolidated joint venture that owns the Tanger outlet center in Southaven, Mississippi amended and restated the $60.0 million mortgage loan secured by the property that was scheduled to mature in April 2018. The amended and restated loan reduced the principal balance to $51.4 million, increased the interest rate from LIBOR + 1.75% to LIBOR + 1.80% and extended the maturity to April 2021, with a two-year extension option. In March 2018, the consolidated joint venture entered into an interest rate swap, effective March 1, 2018, that fixed the base LIBOR rate at 2.47% on a notional amount of $40.0 million through January 31, 2021.
Unsecured Term Loan
In October 2018, we amended and restated our unsecured term loan, increasing the size of the loan from $325.0 million to $350.0 million, extending the maturity from April 2021 to April 2024, and reducing the interest rate spread over LIBOR from 0.95% to 0.90%. The $25.0 million of proceeds were used to pay down the balances outstanding under our unsecured lines of credit. 
Unconsolidated Real Estate Joint Ventures
Charlotte
 In June 2018, the Charlotte joint venture closed on a $100.0 million mortgage loan with a fixed interest rate of approximately 4.3% and a maturity date of July 2028. The proceeds from the loan were used to pay off the existing $90.0 million mortgage loan with an interest rate of LIBOR + 1.45%, which had an original maturity date of November 2018. The joint venture distributed the incremental net loan proceeds of $9.3 million equally to the partners. 
National Harbor
In December 2018, the National Harbor joint venture closed on a $95.0 million mortgage loan with a fixed interest rate of approximately 4.6% and a maturity date of January 2030. The proceeds from the loan were used to pay off the $87.0 million construction loan with an interest rate of LIBOR + 1.65%, which had an original maturity date of November 2019. The joint venture distributed the incremental net loan proceeds of $7.4 million equally to the partners. 
The Outlet Concept
Outlet centers generally consist of stores operated by manufacturers and brand name retailers that sell primarily first quality, branded products, some of which are made specifically for the outlet distribution channel, to consumers at significant discounts from regular retail prices charged by department stores and specialty stores. Outlet centers offer advantages to manufacturers and brand name retailers as they are often able to charge customers lower prices for brand name and designer products by eliminating the third party retailer. Outlet centers also typically have lower operating costs than other retailing formats, enhancing their profit potential. Outlet centers enable retailers to optimize the size of production runs while continuing to maintain control of their distribution channels. Outlet centers also enable manufacturers and brand name retailers to establish a direct relationship with their customers.

We believe that outlet centers present an attractive opportunity for capital investment as many retailers view the outlet concept as a profitable distribution channel. However, due to present economic conditions, the availability of multiple retail channels, and the potential for increased competition from other outlet center developers, new developments or expansions may not provide an initial return on investment as high as has been historically achieved. 
Our Outlet Centers
Each of our outlet centers, except one joint venture property, carries the Tanger brand name. We believe that our tenants and consumers recognize the Tanger brand as one that provides outlet shopping centers where consumers can trust the brand, quality and price of the merchandise they purchase directly from the manufacturers and brand name retailers.
As one of the original participants in this industry, we have established long-standing relationships with many of our tenants that we believe is critical in developing and operating successful outlet centers.
Our consolidated outlet centers range in size from 82,161 to 739,109 square feet and are typically located at least 10 miles from major department stores and manufacturer-owned, full-price retail stores. Historically, manufacturers prefer these locations so that they do not compete directly with their major customers and their own stores. Many of our outlet centers are located near tourist destinations to attract tourists who consider shopping to be a recreational activity. Additionally, our centers are often situated in close proximity to interstate highways that provide accessibility and visibility to potential customers.
We have a diverse tenant base throughout our consolidated portfolio, comprised of approximately 400 different well-known, upscale, national designer or brand name concepts, such as Ann Taylor, American Eagle Outfitters, Banana Republic Factory Store, Barneys New York, Brooks Brothers, Calvin Klein, Coach, Gap Outlet, Giorgio Armani, Hugo Boss Factory Store, Kate Spade New York, Lululemon Athletica, Michael Kors, Nike Factory Store, North Face, Polo Ralph Lauren Factory Store, Saks Fifth Avenue Off 5th, Tommy Hilfiger, Under Armour, Victoriaâ€™s Secret, Vineyard Vines and others.
No single tenant, including all of its store concepts, accounted for 10% or more of our combined base and percentage rental revenues during 2018, 2017 or 2016. As of December 31, 2018, no single tenant accounted for more than 8% of our leasable square feet or 7% of our combined base and percentage rental revenues. Because many of our tenants are large, multinational manufacturers or retailers, losses with respect to rent collections or lease defaults historically have been immaterial.
Only small portions of our revenues are dependent on contingent revenue sources. Revenues from fixed rents and operating expense reimbursements accounted for approximately 90% of our total revenues in 2018. Revenues from contingent sources, such as percentage rents, vending income and miscellaneous income, accounted for approximately 10% of our total revenues in 2018. 
Business History
Stanley K. Tanger, the Company's founder, entered the outlet center business in 1981. Prior to founding our company, Stanley K. Tanger and his son, Steven B. Tanger, our Chief Executive Officer, built and managed a successful family owned apparel manufacturing business, Tanger/Creighton, Inc., which included the operation of five outlet stores. Based on their knowledge of the apparel and retail industries, as well as their experience operating Tanger/Creighton, Inc.'s outlet stores, they recognized that there would be a demand for outlet centers where a number of manufacturers could operate in a single location and attract a large number of shoppers.
Steven B. Tanger joined the predecessor company in 1986, and by June 1993, the Tangers had developed 17 outlet centers totaling approximately 1.5 million square feet. In June 1993, we completed our initial public offering, making Tanger Factory Outlet Centers, Inc. the first publicly traded outlet center company. Since our initial public offering, we have grown our portfolio through the strategic development, expansion and acquisition of outlet centers and are now one of the largest owner operators of outlet centers in the United States and Canada.

Business Strategy
Our company has been built on a firm foundation of strong and enduring business relationships coupled with conservative business practices. We partner with many of the world's best known and most respected retailers and manufacturers. By fostering and maintaining strong tenant relationships with these successful, high volume companies, we have been able to solidify our position as a leader in the outlet industry for well over a quarter century. The confidence and trust that we have developed with our retail partners from the very beginning has allowed us to forge the impressive retail alliances that we enjoy today with our brand name retailers and manufacturers.
We have had a solid track record of success in the outlet industry for the past 38 years. In 1993, Tanger led the way by becoming the industry's first outlet center company to be publicly traded. Our seasoned team of real estate professionals utilize the knowledge and experience that we have gained to give us a competitive advantage in the outlet business. 
As of December 31, 2018, our consolidated outlet centers were 97% occupied with average tenant sales of $385 per square foot. Our portfolio of properties has had an average occupancy rate of 95% or greater on December 31st of each year since the predecessor company was founded in 1981. We believe our ability to achieve this level of performance is a testament to our long-standing tenant relationships, industry experience and our expertise in the development, leasing and operation of outlet centers.
Growth Strategy
Our goal is to build shareholder value through a comprehensive, conservative plan for sustained, long-term growth. We focus our efforts on increasing rents in our existing outlet centers, renovating and expanding selected outlet centers and reaching new markets through ground-up developments or acquisitions of existing outlet centers. We expect new development to continue to be important to the growth of our portfolio in the long-term. Future outlet centers may be wholly-owned by us or developed through joint venture arrangements.
Increasing rents at existing outlet centers
Our leasing team focuses on the marketing of available space to maintain our standard for high occupancy levels. The majority of our leases are negotiated to provide for inflation-based contractual rent increases or periodic fixed contractual rent increases and percentage rents. We have historically been able to renew most, but not all, leases at higher base rents per square-foot and attract new tenants to replace underperforming tenants. 
Developing new outlet centers 
We believe that there continue to be opportunities to introduce the Tanger brand in untapped or under-served markets across the United States and Canada in the long-term. We believe our 38 years of outlet industry experience, extensive development expertise and strong retail relationships give us a distinct competitive advantage. 
In order to identify new markets across North America, we follow a general set of guidelines when evaluating opportunities for the development of new outlet centers. This typically includes seeking locations within markets that have at least 1 million people residing within a 30 to 40 mile radius with an average household income of at least $65,000 per year, frontage on a major interstate or roadway that has excellent visibility and a traffic count of at least 55,000 cars per day. Leading tourist, vacation and resort markets that receive at least 5 million visitors annually are also closely evaluated. Although our current goal is to target sites that are large enough to support outlet centers with approximately 60 to 90 stores totaling at least 250,000 to 350,000 square feet, we maintain the flexibility to vary our minimum requirements based on the unique characteristics of a site, tenant demand and our prospects for future growth and success. 
In order to help ensure the viability of proceeding with a project, we gauge the interest of our retail partners first. We typically prefer to have signed leases or leases out for negotiation with tenants for at least 60% of the space in each outlet center prior to acquiring the site and beginning construction; however, we may choose to proceed with construction with less than 60% of the space pre-leased under certain circumstances. Construction of a new outlet center has typically taken us nine to twelve months from groundbreaking to grand opening of the outlet center.

Expanding and renovating existing outlet centers
Keeping our outlet shopping centers vibrant and growing is a key part of our formula for success. In order to maintain our reputation as the premiere outlet shopping destination in the markets that we serve, we have an ongoing program of renovations and expansions taking place at our outlet centers. Construction for expansion and renovation to existing properties typically takes less time, usually between six to nine months depending on the scope of the project.
Acquiring outlet centers
As a means of creating a presence in key markets and to create shareholder value, we may selectively choose to acquire individual properties or portfolios of properties that meet our strategic investment criteria. We believe that our extensive experience in the outlet center business, access to capital markets, familiarity with real estate markets and our management experience will allow us to evaluate and execute our acquisition strategy successfully over time. Through our tenant relationships, our leasing professionals have the ability to implement a re-merchandising strategy when needed to increase occupancy rates and value. We believe that our managerial skills, marketing expertise and overall outlet industry experience will also allow us to add long-term value and viability to these outlet centers. 
Operating Strategy
Increasing cash flow to enhance the value of our properties and operations remains a primary business objective. Through targeted marketing and operational efficiencies, we strive to improve sales and profitability of our tenants and our outlet centers as a whole. Achieving higher base and percentage rents and generating additional income from temporary leasing, vending and other sources also remains an important focus and goal.
Leasing
Our long-standing retailer relationships and our focus on identifying emerging retailers allow us the ability to provide our shoppers with a collection of the world's most popular outlet stores. Tanger customers shop and save on their favorite brand name merchandise including men's, women's and children's ready-to-wear, lifestyle apparel, footwear, jewelry and accessories, tableware, housewares, luggage and home goods. In order for our outlet centers to perform at a high level, our leasing professionals continually monitor and evaluate tenant mix, store size, store location and sales performance. They also work to assist our tenants through re-sizing and re-location of retail space within each of our outlet centers for maximum sales of each retail unit across our portfolio.
Marketing

Our marketing plans deliver compelling, well-crafted messages and enticing promotions and events to targeted audiences for tangible, meaningful and measurable results. Our plans are based on a basic measure of success - increase sales and traffic for our retail partners and we will create successful outlet centers. Utilizing a strategic mix of print, radio, television, direct mail, our consumer website, Internet advertising, social networks, mobile applications and public relations, we consistently reinforce the Tanger brand. Our marketing efforts are also designed to build loyalty with current Tanger shoppers and create awareness with potential customers. The majority of consumer-marketing expenses incurred by us are reimbursable by our tenants.
Capital Strategy
We believe we achieve a strong and flexible financial position by attempting to: (1) maintain a conservative leverage position relative to our portfolio when pursuing new development, expansion and acquisition opportunities, (2) extend and sequence debt maturities, (3) manage our interest rate risk through a proper mix of fixed and variable rate debt, (4) maintain access to liquidity by using our lines of credit in a conservative manner and (5) preserve internally generated sources of capital by strategically divesting of our non-core assets and maintaining a conservative distribution payout ratio. We manage our capital structure to reflect a long-term investment approach and utilize multiple sources of capital to meet our requirements.

We intend to retain the ability to raise additional capital, including public debt or equity, to pursue attractive investment opportunities that may arise and to otherwise act in a manner that we believe to be in the best interests of our shareholders and unitholders. We are a well-known seasoned issuer with a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 that allows us to register unspecified amounts of different classes of securities. To generate capital to reinvest into other attractive investment opportunities, we may also consider the use of additional operational and developmental joint ventures, the sale or lease of outparcels on our existing properties and the sale of certain properties that do not meet our long-term investment criteria. Based on cash provided by operations, existing lines of credit, ongoing relationships with certain financial institutions and our ability to issue debt or equity subject to market conditions, we believe that we have access to the necessary financing to fund our planned capital expenditures during 2019. 

We anticipate that adequate cash will be available to fund our operating and administrative expenses, regular debt service obligations, and the payment of dividends in accordance with REIT requirements in both the short and long-term. Although we receive most of our rental payments on a monthly basis, distributions to shareholders and unitholders are made quarterly and interest payments on the senior, unsecured notes are made semi-annually. Amounts accumulated for such payments will be used in the interim to reduce the outstanding borrowings under our existing lines of credit or invested in short-term money market or other suitable instruments adhering to our investment policies. 
We believe our current balance sheet position is financially sound; however, due to the uncertainty and unpredictability of the capital and credit markets, we can give no assurance that affordable access to capital will exist between now and when our next significant debt maturity, which is our unsecured lines of credit. The unsecured lines of credit expire in 2021, with a one-year extension option that may extend the maturity to 2022. As a result, our current primary focus is to continually strengthen our capital and liquidity position by controlling and reducing construction and overhead costs, generating positive cash flows from operations to cover our distributions and reducing outstanding debt.
Competition 
We carefully consider the degree of existing and planned competition in a proposed area before deciding to develop, acquire or expand a new outlet center. Our outlet centers compete for customers primarily with outlet centers built and operated by different developers, traditional shopping malls, full- and off-price retailers and e-commerce retailers. We believe that the majority of our customers visit outlet centers because they are intent on buying name-brand products at discounted prices. Traditional full-and off-price retailers and e-commerce retailers are often unable to provide such a variety and depth of name-brand products at attractive prices. 
Because our revenues are ultimately linked to our tenants' success, we are indirectly affected by the same competitive factors, such as consumer spending habits and on-line shopping, as our tenants. Tenants of outlet centers are generally adverse to direct competition with major brick and mortar retailers and their own specialty stores. For this reason, our outlet centers generally compete only to a limited extent with traditional malls in or near metropolitan areas. In recent years, some of our tenants have been adversely impacted by changes in consumer spending habits and on-line shopping.
We compete with institutional pension funds, private equity investors, other REITs, individual owners of outlet centers, specialty stores and others who are engaged in the acquisition, development or ownership of outlet centers and stores. In addition, the number of entities competing to acquire or develop outlet centers has increased and may continue to increase in the future, which could increase demand for these outlet centers and the prices we must pay to acquire or develop them. Nevertheless, we believe the high barriers to entry in the outlet industry, including the need for extensive marketing programs to drive traffic to the centers and relationships with premier manufacturers and brand name retailers, will continue to limit the number of new outlet centers developed each year. 
Financial Information
We have one reportable operating segment. For financial information regarding our segment, see our consolidated financial statements.

Corporate and Regional Headquarters
We rent space in an office building in Greensboro, North Carolina where our corporate headquarters is located as well as a regional office in Miami, Florida.
As of February 1, 2019, we maintain offices and employ on-site managers at 38 consolidated and unconsolidated outlet centers. The managers closely monitor the operation, marketing and local relationships at each of their outlet centers.
Insurance
We believe that as a whole our properties are covered by adequate comprehensive liability, fire, flood, earthquake and extended loss insurance provided by reputable companies with commercially reasonable and customary deductibles and limits. Northline Indemnity, LLC, ("Northline"), a wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary of the Operating Partnership, is responsible for losses up to certain levels for property damage (including wind damage from hurricanes) prior to third-party insurance coverage. Specified types and amounts of insurance are required to be carried by each tenant under their lease. There are however, types of losses, like those resulting from wars or nuclear radiation, which may either be uninsurable or not economically insurable in some or all of our locations. An uninsured loss could result in a loss to us of both our capital investment and anticipated profits from the affected property.
Employees
As of February 1, 2019, we had 285 full-time employees, located at our corporate headquarters in North Carolina, our regional office in Miami and 40 business offices. At that date, we also employed 358 part-time employees at various locations.
