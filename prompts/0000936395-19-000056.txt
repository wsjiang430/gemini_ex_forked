Industry Background
Network Traffic Growth and Increased Capacity Requirements
The markets in which we sell have seen significant changes in recent years. Optical networks – which carry video, data and voice traffic by encoding digital information on multiple wavelengths of light traveling across fiber optic cables – have experienced strong traffic growth. This network traffic growth is being driven by a diverse set of communications services that often require on-demand service levels by their enterprise and consumer end users:

• | Cloud-Based Services. Enterprises and consumers continue to replace locally-housed computing and storage by adopting a broad array of innovative cloud-based models – including Platform as a Service (PaaS), Software as a Service (SaaS) and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) – and an expanding range of cloud-based services that host key applications, store data, enable the viewing and downloading of content and utilize on-demand computing resources.


• | Over-the-Top (“OTT”) Services and Video Streaming. OTT content refers to video, multimedia and other applications provided directly from the content source to the viewer or end user across a third-party network. Traffic from streaming and OTT services, including high definition and ultra-high definition video, has expanded with the increased availability of, and end-user demand for, video content accessible through a variety of devices and media.


• | Mobile Traffic and Applications. Traffic from mobile web applications, including video, internet and data services, has expanded with the proliferation of smartphones and other wireless devices. Because much of wireless traffic ultimately travels across a wireline network to reach its destination, growth in mobile communications continues to place demands upon wireline networks, including the backhaul and fronthaul portions of networks emanating from cell sites.

Emerging services and applications are further impacting or expected to impact network infrastructures, particularly at the edge of networks, where increased computing power and automation are required to meet the quality of experience required by end users. These include:

• | 5G Mobile Networks. Fifth-generation wireless broadband (“5G”) technology is expected to drive meaningful increases in bandwidth and performance, enabling emerging applications and services that 4G/LTE networks cannot support. To fully capitalize on these opportunities, network operators will need to consider the demands 5G technology will place on their wireline infrastructures.


• | Fiber Deep. Fiber deep is a network densification initiative by cable and multiservice operators that seeks to push more digital fiber-closer to the end-user and to increase potential bandwidth, computing capability and data speeds to homes and enterprises, while at the same time decreasing power, space and operating costs.


• | Internet of Things (“IoT”). As networked connections between devices and servers grow, machine-to-machine-related traffic (“M2M”) is expected to represent an increasing portion of traffic. These connections allow sharing of data that can be monitored and analyzed, including in smart grid applications, health care and safety monitoring, resource and inventory management, home entertainment, consumer appliances, connected transportation and other M2M data applications.


• | Ultra-High Definition Video (“UHD”) and Virtual Reality (“VR”) and Augmented Reality (“AR”). UHD video and the advent of immersive technologies like VR, AR and 360° video are likely to place further capacity and capability demands on networks as adoption of these technologies grows. Consumer electronics industries are rapidly advancing these technologies and making them more widely available and affordable to consumers.


• | Edge Computing. Immersive cloud services and gaming using AR and VR technologies require a low latency environment to provide the required user experience. We expect network operators to increase the number and

capabilities of edge computing locations to allow these latency-sensitive workloads to be processed closer to users, which may effect network topologies and traffic patterns.

• | Machine Learning (“ML”) and Artificial Intelligence (“AI”). As broad foundational technologies that increase network intelligence and improve automation, ML and AI enable improvements in network planning, operations, user experience and trouble resolution. Adoption of these technologies, expected to continue to increase as the IoT expands and additional services are created, can be expected to be a driver of further network traffic and solutions innovation.

We believe that increased adoption of these services and applications and their performance requirements will further increase network traffic and place additional service challenges on network infrastructures.
Transition to Programmable Automated Networks
Many networks are still predominately fixed in nature and are generally managed through legacy provisioning, inventory management, planning and fulfillment systems. To address growing service demands and better manage network costs, network operators are looking to adopt next-generation infrastructures that are programmable in real-time, can be accessed and configured via common open interfaces, and are better capable of leveraging data for automation.  To bridge the gap between the operational realities of today and the more responsive and adaptive network infrastructures of the future, we expect network operators to pursue strategies that include additional hardware programmability and software-centric strategies that emphasize one or more of the following:

• | Closed Loop Automation. Network operators are seeking to reduce network operating costs and better leverage analytics, automation and control capabilities to automate end-to-end service creation and delivery. Closed loop automation is a continuous cycle of communications between the network hardware infrastructure and software elements to analyze network conditions, traffic demands, and resource availability and to determine the best placement of traffic for optimal service quality and resource utilization.


• | Software-Defined Networking (“SDN”). SDN seeks to simplify networks to create more open environments that ease management, support automation and quickly deliver customized services to end users, by enabling individual network elements to be directly programmable by standards-based software control. This results in end-to-end visibility of network flows, enabling the optimization of traffic paths and the control of data flows through a network.


• | Network Function Virtualization (“NFV”). NFV is the separation of network services or capabilities from the physical network assets that traditionally provide these services or capabilities to end users. Network operators are increasingly looking for solutions like NFV, which enables network functions through software that runs on industry-standard servers and network and storage platforms, in order to reduce their dependence on single-purpose hardware and accelerate the time to market for new revenue-generating services.

We believe that adoption of these strategies will require network operators and their network solutions vendors to increasingly look to utilize an ecosystem of physical and virtual network resources. We expect that these network architectural approaches, in turn, will drive increased openness and interoperability of multi-vendor, multi-domain network environments, requiring an increased degree of cooperation, collaboration and interoperability among solutions providers.
Industry Consolidation
Our industry has experienced significant consolidation in recent years among our competitors, customers and suppliers alike. To drive scale and market share gains and meet the intense investment capacity required to keep pace with technology innovation, acquisition activity among competing vendors of networking solutions has increased. Among our customers, there have been significant horizontal and vertical consolidation activities by service providers and cable operators, with several such operators acquiring media and content companies. Customer consolidation can increase purchasing power and has in the past resulted in delays or reductions in network spending due to changes in strategy or leadership, the timing of regulatory approvals and debt burdens associated with such transactions. Further, significant consolidation among component suppliers may reduce the number of independent suppliers and could disrupt our supply chain and adversely impact pricing. Consolidation activity across our industry can create opportunities and challenges for our business. We expect this trend to continue and it may have a significant impact on the entire industry, including the competitive landscape, the range of sales opportunities for vendors and their supply chains.
Different Approaches to Design and Procure Network Infrastructure Solutions
Traditionally, network operators looked to purchase fully integrated network solutions including hardware, software and services from the same vendor. Today, network operators are pursuing a diverse range of approaches, or “consumption models,” 
in their design and procurement of network infrastructure solutions. In addition to the traditional approach, new consumption models include the procurement or use of: 

• | a fully integrated hardware solution from one vendor with the separate use of a network operator’s own software or another vendor’s SDN-based control;


• | integrated photonic line systems with open interfaces from one vendor and the separate or “disaggregated” procurement of modem technology from a different vendor; and


• | open source software in concert with or as an alternative to integrated, proprietary third-party software solutions.

Network operators, including certain of our largest customers, are also pursuing the development and use of published reference designs and open source specifications for the procurement of off-the-shelf or commoditized hardware (often referred to as “white box” hardware). This commoditized hardware could be used with in-house developed data path and control software or third-party developed network operating software. Further, a number of network operators are pursuing network strategies that emphasize the deployment of smaller form factor, pluggable modem technology, typically in a switch or router platform, as an alternative to integrated optical platforms. 
The consumption models that ultimately emerge and their level of adoption will depend in significant part on the circumstances and strategies of certain network operators. We expect that continued customer consideration of a variety of consumption models will require network operators and vendors alike to assess, and possibly broaden, their offerings and commercial models over time, thereby placing a premium on a vendor’s ability to provide robust network solutions with the maximum amount of flexibility and choice.
Strategy
Our strategy is to leverage our technology leadership, diversify our business, expand our addressable markets, and drive the profitable growth of our business. Key elements of this strategy include:
Extend Innovation Leadership and Grow our Core Business. We are focused on using our significant research and development investment capacity to push the pace of innovation in our markets and provide market-leading offerings that promote our Adaptive Network vision through further advances in programmable hardware, analytics, and control and automation. In fiscal 2020, we expect to bring to market our fifth-generation coherent modem technology capable of delivering 800 gigabits of capacity per second over a single wavelength and to make this technology available in certain Converged Packet Optical platforms. We are focused on growing our optical and packet infrastructure business by addressing fast-growing markets and applications, including data center interconnection, packet aggregation and switching, network densification including 5G and fiber deep, and access networks and submarine networks. We are introducing Packet Networking solutions with enhanced IP/Ethernet capabilities that enable our Adaptive Network vision and expand our addressable market into additional applications and layers of the network. We are also focused on growing our attached services business to include broader service offerings and engagements involving network migration and optimization and multivendor network integration.
Increase Adoption of Blue Planet Automation Software Platform for Intelligent, Closed Loop Automated Networks. We seek to promote broader adoption of our Blue Planet Automation Software, highlighting its ability to transform network operations and management, reduce the need for manual intervention in key operational processes, and enable closed loop automation of networks as part of our Adaptive Network vision. In so doing, we believe that Blue Planet can help transform legacy networks into “service ready” networks, accelerating the creation, delivery and lifecycle management of new, cloud-based services. We are also investing in Blue Planet-related services and seek to use insights from common business, operational and networking challenges to position Blue Planet as the means by which to achieve the digital network transformation sought by our customers.
Embrace Multiple Consumption Models and Promote Choice. As network operators pursue diverging consumption models, our strategy is to offer a range of networking solutions across those models to drive the evolution of next-generation network infrastructures and to promote choice in our markets. We are currently seeking to make our technology available in both integrated systems and pluggable form factors that address the range of technical and economic requirements of network operators pursuing differing consumption models. Specifically, we are currently pursuing two distinct product development paths for our next-generation coherent optical chipset to enable this range of solutions. Separately, through our Optical Microsystems business we are pursuing sales opportunities that leverage our WaveLogic® technology as a “merchant modem” – the combination of an optical chipset or application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) with other key optical components and sold independently of integrated systems. Merchant modem vendors often sell their modem technology in the form of an optical module or pluggable to a variety of market participants, including other original equipment manufacturers with whom we compete. By addressing multiple consumption models, we seek to secure a larger portion of the world’s optical network wavelengths, expand our addressable market and access new customer verticals and applications. We expect this may require us 
to continue to broaden our existing product offering beyond traditional hardware systems and to expand our commercial models over time.
Focus Diversification on High-Growth Applications and Customer Segments. We believe that the continued diversification of our business is important to address the dynamic industry environment in which we operate, to continue to grow our business, and to better withstand potential slowdowns adversely affecting particular geographies, markets or customer segments. Our strategy is to continue to diversify our solutions offerings, customer base and geographic reach to address fast-growing applications and markets. Our go-to-market strategy seeks to capture additional market share with existing customers and emerging network operators, and to displace competitors, particularly in international markets.

Blue Planet Automation Software and Services
Our Blue Planet Automation Software is a comprehensive, micro-services, standards-based open software suite that allows service providers to drive optimization and increased automation of their network and IT infrastructures, accelerating delivery of services, reducing costs and enabling a more predictive, autonomous network. A number of applications can be deployed on this software platform, either individually or in any combination, including:

• | Multi-Domain Service Orchestration (MDSO). Network infrastructures are comprised of multiple technology layers and domains – such as the data center, cloud, metro, access and core networks – and it is often complex for network operators to offer end-to-end services in this environment. Blue Planet enables service orchestration across multiple

physical and virtual network domains, multiple layers (Optical, Ethernet, IP and Mobile) and multiple hardware and software vendors. 

• | Inventory (“BPI”). By integrating or “federating” data from multiple inventory systems and presenting it in a single dynamic view, BPI allows real-time visibility into the topology and status of network and service resources from end to end. Integrating with legacy operation support systems (“OSS”), BPI helps network providers simplify key operational processes such as service fulfillment, network planning and service assurance.


• | Route Optimization and Analysis (“BP ROA”). BP ROA combines routing, traffic and performance analytics for real-time monitoring of IP services across the cloud. These capabilities enable troubleshooting of latent or transient network problems and modeling to predict the impact of network infrastructure, service and workload changes to build more resilient networks.


• | NFV Orchestration (“NFVO”). Blue Planet provides NFV management and orchestration capabilities for creating and managing virtualized network functions and data center resources. NFVO uses an open, vendor-agnostic approach that allows network operators to select and scale those virtual network functions (VNFs) they wish to offer to customers.


• | Unified Assurance & Analytics (“UAA”). UAA leverages multi-layer/multi-domain assurance and AI-powered analytics to provide insights into the health and performance of network resources and services, ensuring an end customer quality-of-experience and availability to meet dynamic service demands.


• | Blue Planet Services. To complement our software portfolio, we offer a range of related services that include professional services for solution customization and OSS integration, software and solution support services, consulting and design, and technical support relating to our software offerings. These services are focused on enhancing network automation and network analytics, enabling multi-vendor integration and support, and implementing programmable multi-domain next-generation networks.

The Blue Planet portfolio when used together allows operators to fulfill services rapidly and to meet end-customer quality-of-experience expectations via entire services lifecycle approach, thus accelerating network operators towards their vision of self-healing and self-optimizing closed loop automation. Our entrance into the market relating to these software automation capabilities is in the early stages and, as such, revenue from our Blue Planet Automation Software and Services segment remains a small portion of our total revenue. 
Platform Software and Services
Our software offerings also include our Platform Software, which provides domain control management, analytics, data and planning tools to assist customers in managing our Networking Platforms products in their networks. Our Platform Software includes:

• | Manage, Control and Plan (“MCP”). MCP software provides SDN-based domain control of our next-generation packet and optical networks, unifying fault, configuration, accounting, performance and security (FCAPS) management of our multi-layer network infrastructure, with service management and online network planning. MCP integrates with and simplifies network operators’ business processes and lifecycle operations – including equipment commissioning, service provisioning, assurance and performance monitoring.


• | OneControl Unified Management System. OneControl is an integrated network and service management solution that supports certain of our Networking Platform products. OneControl offers end-to-end service creation, activation and assurance, and visualization of performance information for network health status.

• | Platform Software Services. To complement our Platform Software portfolio, we offer a range of related services that include software subscription services, consulting, network migration and integration, installation and upgrade support services, and technical support relating to our Platform Software offerings. These services are focused on enabling our customers to operate their Ciena networks most efficiently, and to modernize their operations.

Our Platform Software offering also includes planning tools and a number of legacy software solutions that support our installed base of network solutions. As we achieve further customer adoption of our MCP software platform and we transition features, functionality and customers to this platform, we expect revenue to decline for our legacy Platform Software solutions.
Global Services
To complement our Networking Platforms portfolio, we offer a broad suite of value-added services that help our customers to build, improve and operate their networks. We believe that our broad set of services offerings is a significant differentiator from our competitors. We believe that our services offerings and our close collaboration with our customers provide us with valuable insight into the network and business challenges they face, allowing us to provide services to meet their desired business outcomes. We have undertaken a multi-year transformation process to enhance our service delivery capability, streamline our services cost structure and portfolio, and include additional advanced networking services and multivendor service capabilities.

• | Integrating the organic and acquired elements of our Blue Planet Automation Software to enable closed loop automation.

Our research and development efforts are also geared toward portfolio optimization and engineering changes intended to drive product and manufacturing cost reductions across our platforms.
We regularly review our existing solutions offering and prospective development of new components, features or products, to determine their fit within our portfolio and broader corporate strategy. We also assess the market demand, technology evolution, prospective return on investment and growth opportunities, as well as the costs and resources necessary to develop and support these products. To ensure that our product development investments and solutions offerings are closely aligned with market demand, we continually seek input from customers and promote collaboration among our product development, marketing and sales organizations. In some cases, where we seek to utilize or gain access to complementary or emerging technologies or solutions, we may obtain technology through an acquisition or, alternatively, through initiatives with third 
parties pursuant to technology licenses, original equipment manufacturer (OEM) arrangements and other strategic technology relationships or investments. In addition, we participate in industry and standards organizations and, where appropriate, incorporate information from these affiliations throughout the product development process.
Sales and Marketing
Our Global Sales and Marketing organization includes a direct sales presence that is organized geographically around the following markets: (i) United States and Canada (“North America”); (ii) Caribbean and Latin America (“CALA”); (iii) Europe, Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”); and (iv) Asia Pacific, Japan and India (“APAC”). Within each geographic area, we maintain specific teams or personnel that focus on a particular region, country, customer or market vertical. These teams include sales management, account salespersons and sales engineers, as well as services professionals and commercial management personnel, who ensure that we maintain a high-touch, consultative relationship with our customers.
We also maintain a global partner program that involves resellers, systems integrators, service providers and other third-party distributors who market and sell our products and services. We utilize these third-party channel partners to market and sell our solutions into specific geographies, applications or customer verticals. We see opportunities to leverage these relationships to expand our addressable market, while at the same time reducing the financial and operational risk of entering additional markets. For third parties in our Ciena Partner Network, we maintain a code of conduct that is available on our website and that sets forth our expectations for the high standards of ethical and legally compliant conduct we require of them in supporting our business. 
To support our sales efforts, we engage in marketing activities to generate demand for our products and services. Our marketing strategy is highly focused on building our brand to create customer preference for Ciena, engaging in thought leadership programs to illustrate how our innovations solve customer business problems, and enabling our sales teams to drive customer adoption of our solutions. Our marketing team supports our sales efforts through a variety of activities, including direct customer interaction, account-based marketing campaigns, portfolio marketing, industry events, media relations, industry analyst relations, social media, trade shows, our website and other marketing vehicles for our customers and channel partners.
Operations and Supply Chain Management
Our operations personnel manage the relationships with our third-party manufacturers and global supply chain, addressing component sourcing, manufacturing, product testing and quality, and fulfillment and logistics relating to the distribution and support of our products.
We utilize a sourcing strategy that emphasizes global procurement of materials and product manufacturing in lower cost regions. We rely upon third-party contract manufacturers, with facilities in Canada, Mexico, Thailand and the United States, to manufacture, support and ship our products, and therefore are exposed to risks associated with their businesses, financial condition and the geographies in which they operate, including political risk and changes in tax and trade policy involving such countries. We also rely upon contract manufacturers and other third parties to perform design and prototype development, component procurement, full production, final assembly, testing and distribution operations. Our manufacturers procure components necessary for assembly and manufacture of our products based on our specifications, approved vendor lists, bills of materials and testing and quality standards. Our manufacturers’ activity is based on rolling forecasts that we provide to them to estimate demand for our products. We work closely with our manufacturers and suppliers to manage material, quality, cost and delivery times, and we continually evaluate their services to ensure performance on a reliable and cost-effective basis. Generally, our agreements with our supply chain and contract manufacturers are frame agreements against which we place purchase orders and do not represent long-term commitments.
We currently use distribution partners to fulfill and deliver our products. We believe that our sourcing, manufacturing and distribution strategies allow us to conserve capital, lower costs of product sales, adjust quickly to changes in market demand and operate without dedicating significant resources to manufacturing-related plant and equipment.
As part of our effort to optimize our operations, we continue to focus on driving cost reductions through sourcing, rationalizing our supply chain, outsourcing or virtualizing certain activities, using lower cost geographies, and consolidating distribution sites and service logistics partners. These efforts also include process optimization initiatives, such as vendor-managed inventory, and other operational models and strategies designed to drive improved efficiencies in our sourcing, production, logistics and fulfillment.
We actively work with our third-party vendors and business partners to promote socially responsible business practices within our own business and those within our global supply chain. To that end, we have adopted the principles set forth in the Responsible Business Alliance (“RBA”) Code of Conduct. The RBA Code of Conduct establishes standards to ensure working 
conditions in the electronics industry supply chain are safe, that workers are treated with respect and dignity, and that business operations are environmentally responsible and conducted ethically. We promote these principles and require our suppliers to adhere to these same standards. Our Corporate Social Responsibility Report, which includes more detail about our efforts to promote responsible business practices, is available on our website.
Backlog
Generally, we make sales pursuant to purchase orders placed by customers under framework agreements that govern the general commercial terms and conditions of the sale of our products and services. These agreements do not obligate customers to purchase any minimum or guaranteed order quantities. Moreover, we are periodically awarded business for new network opportunities or network upgrades following a selection process. In calculating backlog, we only include (i) customer purchase orders for products that have not been shipped and for services that have not yet been performed; and (ii) customer orders relating to products that have been delivered and services that have been performed, but are awaiting customer acceptance under the applicable contract terms. Generally, our customers may cancel or change their orders with limited advance notice, or they may decide not to accept our products and services, although instances of both cancellation and non-acceptance are rare. Backlog may be fulfilled several quarters following receipt of a purchase order, or in the case of certain service obligations, may relate to multi-year support period. As a result, backlog should not necessarily be viewed as an accurate indicator of future revenue for any particular period.
Our backlog was $1.21 billion as of October 31, 2019 as compared to $1.26 billion as of October 31, 2018. Backlog includes product and service orders from commercial and government customers combined. Backlog at October 31, 2019 includes approximately $160.2 million primarily related to orders for products and maintenance and support services that are not expected to be filled or performed within fiscal 2020. Because backlog can be defined in different ways by different companies, our presentation of backlog may not be comparable with figures presented by other companies in our industry.
Seasonality
Like other companies in our industry, we experience quarterly fluctuations in customer activity due to seasonal considerations. We typically experience reductions in order volume toward the end of the calendar year, as the procurement cycles of some of our customers slow and network deployment activity by service providers is curtailed. This period coincides with the first quarter of our fiscal year. This seasonality in our order flows has often resulted in weaker revenue results in the first quarter of our fiscal year. These seasonal effects may not apply consistently in future periods and may not be a reliable indicator of our future revenue or results of operations.
Competition
Competition among networking solution vendors remains intense on a global basis. The markets in which we compete are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, frequent introduction of new solutions and aggressive selling efforts, including using significant pricing pressure to displace incumbent vendors and capture market share. Competition for sales of networking solutions, including our Networking Platforms and Platform Software and Services, is dominated by a small number of very large, multi-national companies. Our competitors include Huawei, Nokia, Cisco, Juniper Networks and ZTE. As compared to us, many of these competitors have substantially greater financial, operational and marketing resources, significantly broader product offerings and more established relationships with service providers and other customer segments. Because of their scale and resources, they may be perceived to be a better fit for the procurement or network strategies of larger network operators. We also continue to compete with several smaller but established companies that offer one or more products that compete directly or indirectly with our offerings or whose products address specific niches within the markets and customer segments we address. These competitors include Infinera, ADVA and ECI, which recently announced an agreement to be acquired by Ribbon Communications. We also compete with a number of smaller companies that provide significant competition for a specific product, application, service, customer segment or geographic market.
Keeping pace with the market’s demands for technology innovation requires considerable research and development investment capacity. As a result, some of our competitors, both large and small, have chosen to rely upon merchant modem technology developed by and procured from third-party providers, including NTT Electronics (NEL), Inphi and Acacia Communications, which has agreed to be acquired by Cisco. We may compete with these providers, either indirectly as a result of their technology being a key enabling technology for our competitors, or directly in merchant modem sales opportunities.
As we promote our corporate strategy and seek increased customer adoption of our Blue Planet Automation Software, we expect to compete more directly with software vendors, IT vendors, and system integrators. Competitors for our Blue Planet Automation Software include Cisco, Nokia, Amdocs, Netcracker and Ericsson.
Across our markets and segments, the principal competitive factors can include:

• | the ability to meet business needs and drive successful outcomes;


• | functionality, speed, capacity, scalability and performance of network solutions;


• | price for performance, cost per bit and total cost of ownership of network solutions;


• | incumbency and strength of existing business relationships;


• | ability to offer comprehensive networking solutions, consisting of hardware, software and services;


• | time-to-market in delivering products and features;


• | technology roadmap and forward innovation capacity;


• | company stability and financial health;


• | flexibility and openness of platforms, including ease of integration, interoperability and integrated management;


• | ability to offer solutions that accommodate a range of different consumption models;


• | operating costs, space requirements and power consumption of network solutions;


• | software and network automation capabilities;


• | manufacturing and lead-time capability; and


• | services and support capabilities.

As a result of the intense environment in which we compete, winning new opportunities can often require that we agree to unfavorable commercial terms or pricing and other onerous contractual commitments. In so doing, our expectation is that we can recover or improve the economics of such relationships over time. However, these terms can adversely affect our results of operations in any period. These terms can also lengthen our revenue recognition or cash collection cycles, add start-up costs to initial sales or deployment of our solutions, require financial commitments or performance bonds and place a disproportionate allocation of risk upon us.
Our competitive landscape has been and is likely to continue to be impacted by pending trade and related matters between the U.S. and China. For example, in May 2019, the U.S. Department of Commerce amended the Export Administration Regulations by adding Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. and certain affiliates to the “Entity List,” resulting in significant new restrictions on export, reexport and transfer of U.S. regulated technologies and products to Huawei. The U.S. has also taken steps to restrict federal agencies from doing business with, and U.S. wireless carriers from using federal subsidies to buy equipment from, Huawei and ZTE. The U.S. has also encouraged other governments to consider similar restrictions. These actions have resulted in escalating tensions between the United States and China and introduce a risk that the Chinese government may take additional steps to retaliate against U.S. industries or companies.
We also expect the competition in our industry to continue to broaden and to intensify as network operators pursue a diverse range of network strategies and consumption models. As these changes occur, we expect that our business will overlap more directly with additional networking solution suppliers, including IP router vendors, data center switch providers and other suppliers or integrators of networking technology traditionally geared toward different network applications, layers or functions.  We may also face competition from system and component vendors, including those in our supply chain, who develop pluggable modem technology or other networking products based on off-the-shelf or commoditized hardware technology, referred to as “white box” hardware, particularly where a customer’s network strategy seeks to emphasize deployment of such product offerings or to adopt a disaggregated approach to the procurement of hardware and software.
Patents, Trademarks and Other Intellectual Property Rights
The success of our business and technology leadership is significantly dependent upon our proprietary and internally developed technology. We rely upon the intellectual property protections afforded by patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secret laws to establish, maintain and enforce rights in our proprietary technologies and product branding. We regularly file applications for patents and have a significant number of patents in the United States and other countries where we do business. As of December 1, 2019, we had more than 2,000 issued patents and more than 350 pending patent applications worldwide.
Enforcing proprietary rights, especially patents, can be costly, and we cannot be certain that the steps that we are taking will detect or prevent all unauthorized use. The industry in which we compete is characterized by rapidly changing technology, a large number of patents, and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. We have been subject to several claims related to patent infringement, and we have been requested to indemnify customers pursuant to contractual indemnity obligations relating to infringement claims made by third parties. Intellectual property infringement assertions could cause us to incur substantial costs, including settlement costs and legal fees in the defense of related actions. If we are not successful in defending these claims, our business could be adversely affected. 
Our operating system software, Platform Software, Blue Planet Automation Software and other solutions incorporate software and components under licenses from third parties, including software subject to various open source software licenses. 
Failure to obtain or maintain such licenses or other third-party intellectual property rights could affect our development efforts and market opportunities, or could require us to re-engineer our products or to obtain alternate technologies. Moreover, there is a risk that open source and other technology licenses could be construed in a manner that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products.
Environmental Matters
Our business and operations are subject to environmental laws in various jurisdictions around the world, including the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) and Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment (RoHS) regulations adopted by the European Union (the “EU”). We are also subject to disclosure and related requirements that apply to the presence of “conflict minerals” in our products or supply chain. We seek to operate our business in compliance with such laws relating to the materials and content of our products and product takeback and recycling. Environmental regulation is increasing, particularly outside of the United States, and we expect that our domestic and international operations may be subject to additional environmental compliance requirements, which could require us to incur additional costs. To date, our compliance actions and costs relating to environmental regulations have not resulted in a material cost or effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.
Our innovation efforts and our environmental sustainability initiatives are closely linked. Our product development efforts focus on innovation leadership that allows network operators to continually “do more with less.” We promote environmental sustainability through our efforts to improve the energy efficiency per gigabit of throughput in our high-performance networking solutions, as well as our initiatives to improve power, space and cooling requirements, and to reduce the total number of network elements required to operate a network. We pursue opportunities to minimize the resource impacts in our product design and sourcing, and to assess and improve efficiencies over the life cycle of our products, including packaging and distribution, and end-of-life reuse, refurbishment, and recycling. We participate in CDP climate change and water disclosures and are a member of the Responsible Business Alliance (“RBA”). We have adopted, and seek to ensure that our key direct suppliers adopt, the standards and principles set forth in the RBA Code of Conduct. 
Employees and Human Capital Management 
We recognize that industry and innovation leadership depend in critical part on our continued ability to recruit, motivate and retain the talented personnel that make up our global workforce. Competition for qualified personnel in our industry is intense and we maintain a progressive set of programs and initiatives designed to attract, develop and engage our human capital. 
In support of these efforts, our Board of Directors oversees management’s design and execution of Ciena’s annual “people strategy.” This strategy seeks to ensure that we continue to have the talent necessary to execute on our strategic imperatives and business plans, and that we have well-aligned programs, initiatives, rewards and recognition, and support to promote these goals. Among other things, our people strategy is focused on: 

• | ensuring competitive, fair and transparent compensation and innovative benefits offerings;


• | supporting the overall well-being of our employees from a physical, emotional, financial and social perspective;


• | creating opportunities for employee growth, development, recognition, training and education; and


• | promoting an inclusive and diverse workplace, where all individuals are respected and feel they belong regardless of their age, race, national origin, gender, religion, disability or sexual orientation.

Because technology is ultimately developed, marketed and sold by people, these initiatives are strategic priorities for our business. As of October 31, 2019, we had a global workforce consisting of 6,383 employees. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider the relationships with our employees to be good.
