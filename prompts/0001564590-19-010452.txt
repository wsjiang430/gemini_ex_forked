Item 1. Business. 
Overview
 We are a consumer-driven, agricultural food ingredient company. We aim to create value across the agricultural production and supply chain beginning with enhanced crop productivity for farmers and ultimately delivering accelerated innovation in nutritional quality foods to consumers.  We use state of the art gene-editing technology and advanced breeding techniques to naturally enhance the nutritional quality of grains and oilseeds to address the rapidly evolving trends in consumer health and nutrition. In addition, we have developed a broad pipeline of high value crop productivity traits designed to enhance farm economics.  
 
Consumers are demanding healthier, high quality foods, naturally and sustainably produced with greater ingredient simplicity, and transparency from food companies. Now more than ever, consumers are paying premium pricing to satisfy their dietary health requirements, such as higher fiber and lower gluten, healthier oils and fewer processed ingredients. Traditional breeding takes years to bring new food varieties or quality traits to market, which has resulted in consumer food companies searching for alternative means to satisfy the evolving customer demands. Consumer demand for rapid product differentiation has created a premium food market opportunity that is one of the fastest growing segments in the food industry. 

To address this large and growing demand, we are building on our industry leading scientific expertise and advanced plant breeding technologies developed over the past 16 years to produce nutrient-dense crops for use in the major foods we eat. By employing gene editing technology or using our proprietary TILLING platform, we believe we can reduce the time to market by half for novel trait ingredients, thereby providing consumer food companies a steady and reliable source of cost effective, healthy natural food options. 
 
We are developing a suite of branded, high value, healthy ingredients in wheat. First to market will be our high fiber Resistant Starch (RS) wheat which has more dietary fiber than conventional wheat. Increased fiber consumption is well recognized as a way to improve gut health and to control excessive weight gain. Concurrently, we are developing four additional wheat traits: a reduced gluten wheat, wheat with improved protein quality, an extended shelf life wheat and a superior yielding wheat. In the traditional American diet more than 500 calories a day come from wheat products, 25 percent of the FDA’s recommended daily caloric intake for women and 20 percent for men, which creates a natural market opportunity for our first two wheat products. We believe these varieties have broad application in the annual global flour market which is estimated by the FDA to be approximately $200 billion of which we believe our addressable market is $8 billion.
 
We also have a history of innovating in crop genetics to improve farmer productivity through more robust crop varieties, creating crop traits designed to counteract the detrimental impact of environmental stresses on har
vest yields. Traditional genetic modification (GM) trait development has concentrated on crops where the combination of large acreage and high input costs (such as pest and weed control chemical costs) create significant economic value for herbicide or insecticidal traits. However, far more deleterious to crop yields are abiotic stresses, such as drought, heat, nutrient deficiency, water scarcity, and soil salinity. Mitigation of these abiotic stresses remain largely unpenetrated by the GM seed industry today. For example, industry estimates indicate greater than 80 percent of wheat yield loss and 65 percent of corn yield loss globally are lost due to abiotic factors. These stresses are prevalent in most agricultural environments with varying degrees of severity and often have material consequences on crop production, quality, and farmer incomes. 
 We devoted much of our early research to building a comprehensive array of abiotic stress traits. Furthermore, through out-licensing arrangements with commercialization partners, many of our traits have been bred into several global crops, including rice, wheat, and soybeans, and we have demonstrated significant yield improvements in multiple years of field testing. However, due to the global variability in acceptance of GM traits and in regulatory systems, the commercial timing and ultimate value of these innovations is difficult to predict. Regardless of the timing and degree of commercial success of our historical transgenic traits, the technical achievements they represent has established the company as a world-class plant transformation organization.  
 2

Our commercial strategy is to migrate forward in the ag-food supply chain from the farmer and seed company to the consumer food company. Due to our early stage focus on the development of abiotic stress traits, we have historically been commercially aligned with farmers and seed companies. However, by also establishing commercial relationships with consumer food companies and developing brand awareness of our high value premium ingredients, we expect to be better positioned to garner a greater share of the market. Consumer food companies are looking to simplify their food ingredient formulations and consumers are demanding “clean labeling” in their foods, paying more for foods having fewer artificial ingredients and more natural, recognizable and healthy ingredients. In 2015, the Food Business News cited ninety-one per cent of U.S. consumers believe food and beverage options with recognizable ingredients are healthier. Because we engineer nutrient density directly into staple grains and oils, we provide the mechanism for food formulation simplification naturally, cost effectively and in a time-frame to meet evolving consumer demands. 
 
This forward migration in the ag-food supply chain will require we build additional organizational capabilities and industry expertise. For instance, we have and continue to expand our in-house commercial grain production and logistics resources for greater scale capacity to bring our identity preserved products to market. We are also continuing to develop product branding strategies to build customer brand recognition and loyalty. 
 
Arcadia Specialty GenomicsTM
 
In February 2019, we announced the establishment of Arcadia Specialty GenomicsTM (“ASG”) a new strategic business unit dedicated to developing and commercializing genetic improvements targeting plant content, quality, climate resiliency and overall yield in cannabis, a new crop for the company. ASG intends to conduct its business in only federal and state markets in which its activities are legal. 
 
The recent passage of the U.S. Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 – also known as the Farm Bill – confirmed the federal legalization of hemp, the term given to non-psychoactive cannabis containing less than 0.3% tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). It also included provisions for legalizing on a federal level hemp’s cultivation, transport and sale for the first time in more than 75 years. Hemp, previously considered a Schedule 1 drug and banned as an agricultural crop, lacks substantive plant biology research and suffers from suboptimal genetics, highly fragmented germplasm and rampant inconsistencies. As with our wheat and soybean products, we plan to create hemp-based solutions that allow farmers to be more productive and enable consumer packaged goods companies to differentiate their brands in the marketplace. In the near term, our focus will be on acquiring federal and state licensure in key geographies to launch our research and pilot programs, for which we expect to begin operations in early 2019. In parallel, we are evaluating key partnerships to extend our capabilities vertically to maximize the value creation potential of our innovations.
 
The Hemp Business Journal estimates the hemp CBD market – the primary non-psychoactive compound in cannabis – totaled $190 million in 2018. By 2022, the Brightfield Group, a cannabis and CBD market research firm, projects sales to reach $22 billion.
 
Our Strengths 
 
We believe we are well positioned among our peers to capitalize on the need to increase the efficiency, quality and speed of innovation in agricultural product differentiation to meet the demand for healthier food choices. Our combination of technological innovation, assets and experience is why we believe we are uniquely positioned to best meet this challenge by improving crop yields to enhancing crop nutrition:

• | World-class research capabilities. Our in-house scientific and product development expertise coupled with our advanced Targeting Induced Local Lesions in Genomes, or TILLING, know-how have resulted in the discovery and development of several traits in our commercialization pipeline. Our TILLING platform enables us to discover and develop value-added traits that are considered non-GM. This platform leverages high-throughput screening of induced genetic diversity in plant populations in major crops. Our TILLING populations currently include wheat, rice, soybean, and canola. These populations include numerous native and induced gene function alterations, which can be exploited rapidly at low cost and with minimal regulatory requirements. While the TILLING approach is also practiced elsewhere, we believe that the combination of our history and specialized background in the technology, highly refined skills in developing and screening genetic diversity in plant populations, and proprietary TILLING process make us a leader in commercial applications of TILLING. In 2017, we obtained a license from the Broad Institute at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Harvard University for research use of the CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing technology. This new platform will enable us to accelerate the time it takes to bring new products to the market from inception.

• | Industry leading early phase trait development. Since the inception of the Company we have successfully advanced, and continue to advance, several potentially high value traits from the proof of concept stage to advanced field testing. More recently, in the case of our HB4 stress tolerant soybeans we have, through our Verdeca joint venture, advanced the trait beyond from field testing in commercial germplasm and into the regulatory submission and approval phase. We have received regulatory approval in Argentina, submitted for import approval in China, FDA approval in the U.S. with submission for USDA approval and regulatory studies are in progress for submission in Europe. By licensing our traits at a later stage of development, we expect to reduce the risk and expense associated with bringing products to market.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | A broad intellectual property portfolio. As of March 1, 2019, Arcadia’s patent portfolio includes 153 issued patents and 63 pending patent applications worldwide in 30 patent families, relating to our trait technologies and business methods that are either owned or exclusively controlled by us. Arcadia had 48 patents issued and has filed 53 new patent applications since January 2015. Our ability to secure exclusive patent rights to our technologies is a key strength for the Company and one that preserves our competitive position.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Expert regulatory affairs capability. Our regulatory team has the proven experience and demonstrated capability to manage regulatory submissions and approvals, including regulatory studies, field trials, regulatory submission, regulatory approvals and commercial launch. Our ability to bring traits through the regulatory process quickly and cost-effectively is a key differentiating factor and a capability we have deployed for our own internal development efforts, as well as in collaboration with our development and commercialization partners.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We have a diverse portfolio of products and partners. Our product portfolio consists of a wide variety of traits that are applicable to major crops in key geographic markets and address agricultural yield and product quality. The applicability of our product portfolio to these major crops provides us access to multiple large end consumer markets that we believe have demonstrated or have the potential for high growth, such as soybeans in North and South America and wheat and rice globally. We have formed partnerships with many of the leading seed companies, grain processors and health and nutrition product companies.

Our Growth Strategy
 
We believe there are significant opportunities to grow our business by executing the following elements of our strategy:
  
• | Accelerate the commercialization of our health and nutrition trait portfolio. In 2018, we made significant advances towards commercialization of Resistant Starch GoodWheat™ achieving key technical milestones, breeding into commercial germplasm, building partnerships across the wheat value chain and meeting FDA requirement for “high in fiber” and “good source of fiber” designations. Our highest priority and primary forward investment is to accelerate the commercialization of our non-GM wheat ingredient trait portfolio, first targeting the bread, pasta and animal feed markets with our high fiber Resistance Starch and Reduced Gluten lines. We believe these products can be launched into the market over the next nine to eighteen months, and we are working with collaborators who are actively advancing the technical and commercial potential of these products.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Develop and introduce novel genetics in hemp. Arcadia Specialty Genomics will develop novel hemp varieties possessing productivity, pest resistance and crop quality traits for license to cultivators, and for derivative products serving the nutraceutical and food industries. We intend to develop these innovations through our TILLING platform initially under the guidelines of the 2014 and 2018 farm bills in the US. Because of our proven ability to innovative traits in some of the most complex plant genomes such as wheat, we believe turning our attention to the critical needs facing the rapidly evolving cannabis industry greatly enhances our growth markets. In the near term, our focus will be on acquiring federal and state licensure in key geographies to launch our research and pilot programs, for which we expect to begin operations in early 2019. In parallel, we are evaluating key partnerships to extend our capabilities vertically to maximize the value creation potential of our innovations. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Advance commercialization of GM traits in regions where regulatory processes are predictable. Our Verdeca joint venture continues to advance our HB4 Drought Tolerance trait in soybeans towards commercialization in the Americas, with Argentina to be the first launch country. Regulatory approvals were obtained in Argentina in 2015 and with US FDA in 2017. Regulatory submissions were made in 2016 for import approval of HB4 soybeans into China. Regulatory approval for Brazil was submitted in 2018 and import approval in the European Union will be submitted in 2019. We are encouraged by recent GM approvals in China as key indication of significant progress towards the advancement of the global GM landscape. We believe commercialization and product launch into the market may occur over the next 18 to 24 months.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Actively support our licensees’ product development, deregulation and commercialization efforts. Part of our longer-term strategy remains the potential to unlock the commercial value of our key agricultural yield traits, such as Nitrogen Use Efficiency (NUE), Water Use Efficiency (WUE), and Salt Tolerance, in key food crops like rice, wheat and sugarcane and fiber crops like cotton. We remain engaged with our partners to determine and execute optimal strategies to advance these traits through deregulation in various territories.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Continue to invest in our human resources and commercialization capabilities. As we become more consumer facing and commercially aligned with consumer food companies, greater in-house consumer product knowledge and industry experience will be required. We will continue to invest in acquisition, development and retention of the requisite management and industry experience and production and logistics capacity to more fully participate in, and control, the route to market for our high value food ingredients. We will continue to build our commercialization expertise, refine go-to-market strategies and execute branding strategy.

Our Products and Product Development Pipeline
 
We are improving the nutrition and quality of food ingredients while improving crop productivity using advanced plant breeding and gene editing technologies and accelerating innovation through industry leading partners.  Our innovations address the challenges facing our food systems as depicted below: 
 

The development and commercialization staging of our health and nutrition ingredient traits reflect the time to market we expect based upon the remaining breeding and production requirements to achieve optimal market penetration. In 2017, we in-licensed the CRISPR-Cas9 technology, substantially augmenting the speed at which we can bring technologies discovered through our tilling technology platform to market as well as new versions of existing traits and entirely new discoveries. Our wheat portfolio development processes shorten the timeline to launch and allow broader globalization as depicted in the table below:
 

We believe our core competencies in plant genomics position Arcadia for unique innovations in new crops. We leverage a research and development team that has over 100 years of combined plant transformation experience across best in class technology platforms. Our competitive advantages allow for accelerated market entry.

Our health and nutrition business model creates value throughout the entire food supply chain as depicted in the graphic below:
 

Enhanced Quality Grains
 
Our GoodWheat™ brand redesigns wheat as a functional food adding value to the wheat supply chain by enabling a wider range of choices to meet consumer demands. We believe our GoodWheat™ products will allow consumers to enjoy unique health benefits in their favorite foods featuring wheat. Our GoodWheat™ product allows consumer food companies to deliver specialty products to discerning consumers. We have multiple programs aimed at developing wheat and other small grains with improved nutritional qualities. One such program generated multiple bread wheat and pasta wheat lines with very high levels of amylose, leading to increased levels of resistant starch. Resistant starch increases the total dietary fiber content of wheat and reduces its glycemic index, which are both desirable nutritional qualities that are important in the management of diabetes and healthy blood glucose levels. High fiber Resistant Starch wheat can deliver fiber and other benefits to refined white flour products and also whole grain food products. In 2016, the FDA approved the use of qualified health claims for corn-based resistant starch in the risk reduction of type-2 diabetes, thus establishing a key precedent for the health benefits associated with this fiber. According to the USDA’s What We Eat in America Survey of 2015-2016, only 5% of the U.S. population meets the recommended level of dietary fiber.  On average, Americans consume only 57% of the daily recommended levels. We believe improving the fiber content of wheat can deliver improved health benefits to a wide population.
 
A second program, in collaboration with Ardent Mills, aims at improving the flavor profile and shelf-life of whole wheat. A third program is aimed at reducing gluten in wheat and other grains. This program additionally targets improved protein quality and amino acid profile in wheat. All of these programs utilize our TILLING platform, and the resulting products are non-GM.

High Fiber Resistant Starch Wheat 
 
Our high fiber Resistant Starch (RS) wheat provides a source of wheat with inherently high levels of resistant starch, increasing the total dietary fiber content of food products without the need for fiber additives from other sources. Currently, corn resistant starch is a product in two market segments: dietary fiber additives and modified starch additives. According to MarketsandMarkets, the global dietary fibers market is projected to reach $6.5 billion by 2022 and the modified starch market is projected to reach $12.4 billion in 2022. Major growth in these markets is being driven by the convenience health food sector and functional food sector. Flour from our RS wheat lines has resistant starch levels that are 12 to 20 times higher than the control wheat, and total dietary fiber, or TDF, which is more than eight times higher than the control. RS wheat flour has been tested in applications in bread, where loaf quality was comparable to bread made with conventional wheat flour, and pasta, where it had the highest consumer preference rankings in tests carried out by a major consumer products company. In 2018, we made significant advances towards commercialization of Resistance Starch GoodWheat™.
 
RS wheat flour is currently being tested in a range of additional bakery, ready-to-eat cereals and pasta products with industrial partners. We have many RS wheat lines that are being evaluated for optimal quality and agronomic characteristics.
 Improved Shelf Life of Whole Grain Flour
 The USDA recommends that “at least one serving of grains per day must be whole grain-rich” due to evidence that a diet containing whole grains provides a multitude of benefits, including lower risk of obesity, cardiovascular disease, and type-2 diabetes. Despite these health benefits, consumption of whole grain products is negatively affected by the bitter and rancid flavors and odors that accumulate in whole wheat flour after milling. Our improved stability and flavor wheat lines greatly reduced the production of rancid and bitter compounds in aged whole grain flour. Whole wheat flour from these lines is being tested further for sensory characteristics and improved shelf life stability. This new trait could help improve the shelf life and flavor profile of whole grain products, thus reducing formulation costs and increasing consumer preference and palatability for whole grains.

 Reduced Gluten (RG) Wheat
 
Many consumers are interested in reducing levels of gluten in their diet. Critically, for some, this is due to having Celiac disease (CD), an autoimmune disease that impacts many people worldwide with estimates from 1% of the population in Europe to 3.5% in Mexico. Furthermore, non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) impacts an estimated additional 6% of the population. Both CD and NCGS are characterized by sensitivity to dietary gluten. The only effective treatment of CD and NCGS requires removal of gluten sources from the diet. Since required adherence to a gluten-free diet is extremely difficult to accomplish for average consumers, efforts to develop alternative approaches are needed.
 
8

Research conducted by the Connell Group in 2018 indicates there is a significant portion of consumers (26% of general population) that choose to reduce gluten levels in their diet despite not having Celiac disease.  
 
Arcadia is developing a new wheat variety with reduced gluten levels. Our proprietary, non-GM wheat variety developed using advanced screening and plant breeding techniques have reduced allergenic glutens and increased essential amino acids such as lysine, along with all the other health benefits of high protein wheat.  This new variety is beneficial for both food and feed applications. We are breeding the trait into commercial wheat varieties and working with food processors to give people a choice to enjoy higher quality wheat in the products they love while reducing gluten in their diet.
 

Nutritional Oils
 Gamma Linolenic Acid (GLA) Oil
 Under a license agreement with Abbott Laboratories, we developed a new source of vegetable oil with very high levels of gamma linolenic acid, or GLA, an omega-6 fatty acid. To our knowledge, our GLA safflower oil product has the highest concentration of GLA available in any plant oil at 65%; conventional plant oils range from 10 to 22% GLA. We sell the oil in the United States to manufacturers of dietary supplements, nutritional supplements, medical foods, dog food, and other products. GLA safflower oil is also approved in Canada as a natural health product. Our key customers include significant participants in those markets, such as GNC, Lindora Nutrition, JumpStart MD and others.
 
GLA has multiple clinically-demonstrated nutritional and medical benefits, including anti-inflammatory effects, improving skin conditions such as atopic dermatitis and healthy weight management. Multiple parties have expressed commercial interest in incorporating an enhanced GLA oil into their foods, dietary supplements, or medical products where conventional sources of GLA are not sufficiently concentrated to deliver amounts that are cost- and performance-effective.
 
9

Against a commercial target of 40% GLA concentration, we developed, deregulated and commercialized GLA safflower oil containing up to 75% GLA concentration in fewer than six years. This is significantly shorter timeline than the 13 years it takes, on average, to commercialize an agricultural biotechnology product, according to Phillips McDougall in 2018. We produce GLA safflower oil by contracting with farmers in Idaho and process the seed under contract with a manufacturer in California to make refined oil. We sell GLA safflower oil under the brand name, SONOVA, with multiple concentrations and formulations.
 
In January 2017 we received notification from the FDA that our GRAS petition (generally recognized as safe) for the use of SONOVA GLA in medical foods and nutritional beverages had been accepted, which means that we can now market and sell this product in a new market segment. In August 2017, the FDA published in the Federal Register a food additive regulation for the use of SONOVA GLA in dog food. The FDA published a similar regulation for cat food in February 2019. These approvals and authorizations are generating additional revenue opportunities for our GLA business. 
 
Agriculture Productivity Traits, the Yield and Stress Pipeline
 
Arcadia is a recognized leader in the area of yield and abiotic stress trait development and our research and development successes are built on the premise that mitigating the impact of environmental stresses, whether chronic or transient, can generate meaningful yield gains in the most important crops in the world. Although our forward development programs are non-GM based, we have historically out-licensed a number of high-performing traits developed using transgenic development platforms to commercialization partners who have been pursuing deregulation in their licensed territories for the last several years. We believe our yield and stress pipeline holds promise, as evidenced by our internal data and data generated by our partners in rice, wheat, soy, corn and cotton varieties. However, due to the continued uncertainty of broad acceptance of GM traits, the commercial timing and value of these innovations is unclear. 
Nitrogen Use Efficiency (NUE) 
 
Our NUE technology enables plants to utilize nitrogen fertilizer much more efficiently than conventional plants. This allows crops to achieve significantly higher yields under normally applied levels of nitrogen fertilizer, or to achieve the same yields as conventional crops while using 30 to 50% less nitrogen fertilizer. 
 
Field trial data to date in multiple major commodity crops has shown yield improvements greater than 10% attributable to our NUE trait. Additionally, NUE rice tests conducted by independent entities in multiple countries over multiple years have demonstrated that NUE rice lines produced significantly higher grain yield than controls at various nitrogen fertilizer rates. In the paddy low-land production environment, NUE rice lines showed an increase in grain yield of 29.5% at full nitrogen application rates when compared to the parental line. In the rainfed up-land production environment, the NUE rice lines demonstrated 33.8% grain increase at 50% nitrogen application rate.
 Water Use Efficiency and Drought Tolerance 
 
Our Water Use Efficiency (WUE) trait enables plants to better tolerate two distinct types of stress: reduced or inconsistent water availability, and severe drought. The WUE trait has been demonstrated to improve crop yield under conditions of episodic water stress and to help crops recover from severe drought conditions. A related but distinct trait, Drought Tolerance, helps plants maintain yields under conditions of prolonged water stress. 
 
Our WUE trait technology was jointly discovered by researchers at the University of California, Davis and Technion—Israel Institute of Technology. We hold an exclusive, global license to the technology, with sublicense rights, for use in all crops. Greenhouse and field trials of our WUE traits have been completed in agronomic crops such as rice, wheat, cotton, peanuts and alfalfa. Our collaborators are working with our traits in potato, sugarcane, and cotton.
 
Our Drought Tolerance (DT) technology in soybeans was discovered by researchers at the National Scientific and Technical Research Council (Argentina), and further developed by Bioceres, S.A. Verdeca, our joint venture with Bioceres, Inc., who holds exclusive global rights and is developing and commercializing this technology in soybeans. 
 
10

Our Drought Tolerance technology is most advanced in soybeans. Multiple seasons of field trials in test germplasm in both North and South America have shown better or equal yield performance of our HB4 drought tolerant trait relative to controls. We expect the optimum performance of this trait will be in the drought stressed regions of South America.  Verdeca and seed company licensees are introgressing the trait into pre-commercial germplasm in Argentina to address this market. The Early Food Safety Evaluation process was completed in 2015 by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the plant protein responsible for our Drought Tolerance trait. The trait has full approval for food safety and international commerce in Argentina (2015) and is pending approval in China. Regulatory approval application was submitted in 2016 to the FDA and the FDA completed its review in August 2017 allowing for food and feed consumption in the US. USDA request for a Determination of Nonregulated Status was submitted in 2017 and is currently pending approval. Additionally, regulatory approval applications have been submitted in Uruguay and are pending final approval. Regulatory submissions were made in 2016 for import approval of our Drought Tolerant HB4 soybeans into China. Regulatory approval for Brazil was submitted in 2018 and import approval in the European Union will be submitted in 2019. 
 Salinity Tolerance 
 Our Salinity Tolerance trait allows plants to maintain yields under conditions of elevated salinity and is applicable to a wide range of crops, including wheat, rice, soybean, and cotton. 
 Our most advanced Salinity Tolerance trait technology is based on technology from the University of Toronto, the University of California, Davis, and the National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences (Japan), all of which have granted us exclusive licenses for all crops. In addition, we are conducting research on additional salinity tolerance genes under a funded research agreement with the United States Agency for International Development, or USAID.
 
Crops with tolerance to soil and water salinity are in various phases of development with our primary licensee and partner for the Salinity Tolerance trait technology. Our partner previously tested the most promising rice lines with our trait in a field in which controlled amounts of salt were applied to the replicated plots. In 2015, a field trial was executed on naturally high saline farmlands in India, where grain yields typically are very low, and we saw results similar to those in prior trials. Our partner has developed wheat lines that show significant salinity tolerance under greenhouse conditions, with some lines outperforming the controls by more than 30%, and additional wheat lines are in development to expand the scope of our partner’s first greenhouse evaluations. 
 

Wheat Yield
 
Our non-transgenic wheat yield program, initially supported by USDA, aims to increase yield in wheat using TILLING, a non-GM reverse genetics tool, to identify novel alleles of candidate wheat yield genes in tetraploid and hexaploid wheat. These alleles are being evaluated for the ability to alter wheat architecture and improve yield in the field. As a non-GM technology, products from TILLING can rapidly advance to commercialization and do not face market or regulatory restrictions. According to the USDA’s estimate in 2017/2018, with a conservative 5% increase in yield, the yearly value creation to the U.S. farmer is estimated at over $30 per hectare. In addition, the value of higher yielding wheat varieties to a seed company arising from this research in the U.S. alone is more than $40 million annually. By incorporating favorable alleles of plant architecture genes into a commercial wheat breeding program, we believe we can make a significant contribution to improving yield in this vital food crop.

Technology Evaluation
 Our technology program teams include scientists who are leaders in their respective fields along with supply chain logistics, quality control and assurance and commercial production and development. These teams contribute to the initial evaluation of new opportunities and are responsible for development of technologies brought onboard or developed in-house. Each of our technology programs involves multiple gene, trait and crop targets, and our process focuses on rapid development of the most promising combinations. In the development of any particular trait, we carry out a series of steps including the direct evaluation of target gene function and the specific evaluation of results in key representative crop species that bring value to commercial product applications. While common core scientific services are provided by functional groups, our technology program team manages overall progress and remains directly involved throughout the development cycle, internally as well as externally with our collaborators.
Product Development Platforms 
 Targeting Induced Local Lesions in Genomes (TILLING)—Non-GM Traits. Our advanced breeding TILLING platform enables us to develop value-added crops without the use of GM methods. The TILLING platform is managed by a dedicated team of scientists able to apply TILLING to multiple crops with complex genomes. TILLING technology utilizes specialized laboratory equipment to carry out high-throughput allele screening of DNA samples from genetic diversity populations created in major crops. Our populations include wheat, rice, soybean, and canola. These populations include numerous native and induced gene function alterations, which can be discovered and evaluated rapidly at low cost and with minimal regulatory requirements. We believe the combination of our background in the technology as the first to apply TILLING to crop plants such as wheat and tomato, and our highly refined skills in developing and screening genetic diversity in plant populations makes us a leader in commercial applications of TILLING.
 
Transformation—GM Traits. For projects involving GM traits, the genetic construct for insertion into plants is designed and built by our relevant program team, and then the gene transfer step is accomplished by our plant transformation functional group. This group has developed a complete physical and methodological infrastructure at our laboratory facility in Davis, California to efficiently transfer genetic materials into key crop species. Our team has demonstrated transformation capabilities in all primary and some secondary agricultural crops, including rice (japonica, indica and NERICA types), wheat, corn, canola, safflower, barley, sorghum, alfalfa, tomato, potato, tobacco and grapes. 
 
Genome Editing. Our genome editing pipeline includes a cross disciplinary group of experienced molecular biologists and plant transformation experts with demonstrated capabilities in using both biological and physical methods of plant transformation. Our expertise in both transformation and TILLING in the application of genome editing has helped to accelerate new product development.
 
In 2017, we obtained a license for research purposes for CRISPR- Cas9 from the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard. We believe this is the leading gene editing technology and using this technology will accelerate product development.
 
Controlled Growth Operations. Our controlled growth operations group manages our growth chamber facilities, where plants are grown under precisely controlled conditions, and our greenhouse facility, consisting of approximately 26,000 square feet of high-quality greenhouse space, which are both at our headquarters in Davis, California. The controlled growth operations group uses these facilities to manage plant experiments and grow-outs under rigorously controlled conditions. They also carry out the initial seed increases and first stages of plant breeding for some projects. For certain projects, such as those relating to oil quality and high fiber Resistant Starch wheat, this group also manages crop pre-breeding programs to develop plant varieties for the production of commercial products.

Research, Field Trials, Breeder & Foundation Seed Production. Our trait evaluation and development group is based in Davis, California and conducts remote field operations in American Falls, Idaho; Yuma, Arizona; Brawley, California and multiple locations in Montana, North Dakota and Washington. The trait evaluation and development group have extensive field and specialized statistical analytical capabilities that we deploy to support field trial execution and data analysis internally and with our collaborators. Late-stage regional and agronomic trials are intended to develop extensive data on a limited number of potential commercial plant varieties and develop the best crop management practices suited for these commercial products. Similarly, regulatory trials develop data for use in submissions for regulatory review and may involve plant varieties developed by our collaborators or our own oil quality and grain quality programs.
 
Commercial Seed, Grain and Oil Production.  The commercial development group is based in Davis, California. The group conducts grower field trials and manages the commercial seed, grain and oil production throughout the United States working through seed production specialists and growers and elsewhere globally with our collaborators and joint venture partners.  Grower field evaluations are designed to test new commercial seed varieties for yield and agronomic performance and as well as characterizing performance of oil and grain quality attributes.
Regulatory Data Generation. Our Analytical Services and Regulatory Science group is located in Davis, California and provides automated DNA preparations, genomic blot analyses, lipid profiling, metabolomics and protein purification services and develops data for use in product selection and validation, certification of SONOVA, GoodWheat™ and other product specifications, and regulatory submissions. These data support regulatory submissions and provide core trait regulatory packages to our collaborators for use in their crop-specific regulatory applications. 
Biological Materials Inventory and Tracking. Our proprietary Pedigree and Inventory Management System, or PIMS, tracks the genetic, phenotypic and location information for all our plant materials. PIMS encompasses genetic elements such as genes and promoters, GM seeds and plant material received by us, as well as seeds and plants developed by us and used in trait development. The performance of our plant materials is recorded through a variety of laboratory and field observations, and the data are stored within PIMS. The location of all plant materials is tracked throughout the plant life cycle. This includes specific seeds planted within a specific plot of a specific field trial, harvest, seed storage location and use by, or distribution of plant material to, our collaborators or elsewhere. PIMS interfaces with our Biotechnology Quality Management System, or BQMS, to manage all movement and release of regulated GM plant materials. This ensures all our plant materials are accounted for, tracked and inventoried, which enables us to maintain control over and documentation of all plant materials.
Regulatory Compliance and Stewardship
 Our regulatory management team provides regulatory services for all our product development programs, as well as joint ventures and selected collaborations. These services include establishing standard operating procedures and best practices, completing regulatory permits and monitoring regulatory and stewardship compliance for all products at all stages. Our regulatory team includes key employees who are directly responsible for leading all global regulatory agency interactions and providing tactical and strategic regulatory direction. Our team collectively has more than 30 years of direct involvement in the development and approvals of GM crops. The key member of our regulatory team was responsible for completing the first FDA and USDA deregulation of a GM whole food. The interactions and processes associated with these first USDA and FDA processes established benchmarks for the regulation of GM products that remain applicable today.
 Our regulatory management and compliance activities encompass three broad categories: deregulation, stewardship, and authorization. In the United States, these activities are regulated by various government agencies, including the USDA, the FDA and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Our regulatory team has completed significant regulatory activities (new dietary ingredient review, food additive regulation, GRAS (generally recognized a safe) notice and GM food consultation) with the FDA Division of Dietary Supplement Programs, with the FDA Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, with the FDA Center for Veterinary Medicine with the Health Canada Natural Health Products Directorate and the Canadian Food Inspection Agency.

Deregulation 
 Our business is subject to regulations related to agriculture, food and the environment. Plant products produced using GM technology are subject to laws and regulations in countries where the plants are grown and in countries where the GM plant-derived food and feed are consumed by humans or animals. Commodity products utilizing our GM traits may require approvals in multiple countries prior to commercialization.
 U.S. Regulatory Agencies:
 U.S. Department of Agriculture. We must obtain USDA authorizations and permits in order to conduct the field releases of GM regulated materials that are necessary to advance the development of GM crops. Obtaining such authorizations and permits is generally routine and delays impacting the planned movement or release of GM material are uncommon. The USDA provides detailed regulations and guidance for obtaining a “Determination of Deregulated Status,” which authorizes the commercial and uncontained growing of GM plants. For regulated GM plants, the USDA requires that a company petition the agency to demonstrate that the product is unlikely to pose a risk. Based on the information provided, the USDA prepares an Environmental Assessment (EA) and/or an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) in order to make its determination. These procedures afford the public an opportunity to submit written comments on the draft EA or EIS for consideration by the USDA before the final version of the EA or EIS is published. For any GM plant product, there may be delays or requests for additional information based on the USDA’s review or the public comments. As of March 2019, USDA has issued 126 Determinations of Nonregulated Status. Submissions received by the USDA from all applicants prior to 2011 averaged more than 2 years for approval. Since then, the USDA has significantly shortened the time to approval, averaging 1 year in 2017.
 U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The FDA is responsible for food safety under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. The FDA recommended in its 1992 Statement of Policy: Foods Derived from New Plant Varieties that developers of GM plant products consult with the agency about the safety of GM products under development. In 1996, the FDA provided additional guidance to the industry on procedures for these consultations. These procedures require a developer intending to commercialize a food or feed product derived from a GM plant to first meet with the agency to identify and discuss relevant safety, nutritional and other regulatory issues regarding the product. Subsequently, the developer submits to the FDA a scientific and regulatory assessment supporting proposed product safety. The FDA evaluates the submission and engages with the developer to resolve any questions, requests for additional data or other informational requirements. Once the FDA has determined that all requirements have been satisfied, the FDA concludes the consultation process by issuing a letter to the developer acknowledging completion of the consultation process with the addition of the product to the list of completed consultations on the FDA website. The completed consultation acknowledges product safety for use as food and feed. To date, over 150 GM products have completed this process with the FDA. This process may have delays if the FDA requires additional data and information for its consultation and to resolve any questions the FDA may have. The FDA completed 21 consultations from 2015 to 2017, with consultation time periods in 2017 ranging from 2 to 15 months and averaging just over one year from first submission to conclusion.
 Environmental Protection Agency. Certain products may also be regulated by the EPA, including plants that contain a plant-incorporated protectant, such as a pesticides or herbicide, or plants engineered to be treated with industrial chemicals.
 International Deregulation:
When products from GM crops are expected to be exported from the United States, commercialization of such crops in the United States will require approvals in those countries into which the crops or derivative products, such as grain, oil or meal, will be exported. The laws and regulations for GM plant products are well defined in most commercially significant countries, including Australia, South American countries, India, China, several African countries and the European Union. Typically, our collaborators are responsible for obtaining all regulatory permits and approvals relevant to product development and commercialization in their licensed countries and for generating crop and transformation event-specific data required by their countries of interest. We provide basic safety data on trait expression products in accordance with generally accepted standards. In addition, we may serve as a regulatory consultant and participate in the design of regulatory protocols, data generation and development of detailed regulatory submissions. In certain countries, we may develop strategic business relationships or employ independent consultants with country-specific knowledge and expertise to support and obtain required approvals.

Stewardship 
 Stewardship, or the careful and responsible management of assets, forms the foundation of our regulatory compliance programs associated with GM plants. Our stewardship framework for GM plants is defined by government regulations and related internal policies and practices. In previous years, Arcadia’s Biotechnology Quality Management System (now identified as ABQMS) was developed by us and then audited/certified by the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, Biotechnology Regulatory Service (APHIS BRS). Recently, USDA updated its BQMS program renaming it the Biotechnology Quality Management Support Program, discontinuing the mandatory auditing/certification standard.
 Our ABQMS program was developed to address all conditions required under USDA authority to ensure containment of regulated plant material. The ABQMS includes standard operating procedures, or SOPs, recording and reporting forms, instructions for managing all compliance related activities, and training requirements for all individuals handling GM plant materials. SOPs are highly detailed and consider all elements of each relevant activity or process. Each field trial site is accompanied by a Field Compliance Guide and Record (GUIDE) containing multiple SOPs and associated forms for each activity. For example, a GM wheat trial requires 19 SOPs and associated verification forms. A GUIDE is completed for each regulated field trial and serves as a completed record to support compliance with government regulations. Example copies of the GUIDE have been provided to our collaborators for use in other countries where they conduct GM field trials.
 Since our ABQMS program was first recognized by the USDA in 2011, each annual independent audit conducted by USDA until discontinuation of their audit program confirmed that our program was functioning as intended. Our ABQMS manager has attended USDA BQMS training programs at the request of the USDA to assist in training personnel at other companies and organizations and to share our experience and the SOPs that form the basis of our program.
 Compliance with the specific parameters of regulatory requirements is only one element of stewardship. Additional activities within each functional group throughout the company are integral to the overall stewardship program. Each of our employees is trained on, and must comply with, relevant stewardship guidelines as defined and described in our ABQMS.
 Authorization 
 The USDA APHIS Biotechnology Regulatory Service (BRS) has legal and regulatory authority over the movement and release of GM plants and seeds. “Movement” includes movement of regulated GM plant material between states and the importation of regulated GM plant material into the United States. “Release” includes field trials of any size and any other use of regulated GM plant material outside of contained greenhouses.
 We have obtained more than 200 authorizations from the BRS for the movement, importation or release of GM plants under development. General and specific conditions to maintain containment during all activities associated with the movement or release are a requirement of each authorization. These conditions are defined, applied and recorded in the GUIDE following our ABQMS program.
 Intellectual Property 
 We rely on patents and other proprietary right protections, including trade secrets and contractual protection of our proprietary know-how and confidential information, to preserve our competitive position.
 As of December 31, 2018, and in summary, we owned or exclusively controlled 141 issued patents and 61 pending patent applications worldwide.  These totals reflect the following:  (i) with respect to the U.S. territory, we owned 11 and exclusively in-licensed 16 U.S. issued patents, and we owned 11 U.S. patent applications relating to our trait technologies and business methods; and (ii) in connection with foreign territories, we owned 14 and exclusively in-licensed 100 foreign issued patents, and owned 45 and exclusively in-licensed five pending foreign patent applications.  With respect to all of the foregoing patent assets, our exclusive licenses afford us control over the prosecution and maintenance of the licensed patents and patent applications. These numbers do not include in-licensed patents for which we either do not have exclusive rights (such as certain enabling technology licenses), or for which we have exclusive rights only in a limited field of use or do not control prosecution and maintenance of the licensed patents.
 15

As of December 31, 2018, we had eight registered trademarks in the United States and also eight registered trademarks in various other countries. 
 We also have entered into in-license agreements enabling the use and commercialization of our traits, including NUE, WUE and Salinity Tolerance, and certain products that we have commercialized or are under development, including GLA safflower oil and ARA safflower oil. Under these licensing arrangements, we are obligated to pay royalty fees on sublicense revenue and net product sales ranging between low single digit percentages and percentages in the mid-teens, subject in certain cases to aggregate dollar caps. The exclusivity and royalty provisions of these agreements are generally tied to the expiration of underlying patents. After the termination of these provisions, we and our collaborators may continue to produce and sell products utilizing the technology under the expired patents. While third parties thereafter may develop products using the technology under the expired patents, in many cases, we have incremental patent rights covering our most important technologies, which we believe mitigate the impact of the expiration of these patents, or the related exclusivity provisions, on our business. We also have numerous in-licenses relating to enabling technologies utilized in our development programs, such as transformation methods (e.g., Japan Tobacco, DuPont Pioneer), genome editing tools (e.g., Broad Institute), promoters (e.g., Corteva Agriscience formerly known as Dow AgroSciences, Louisiana State University) and selectable marker technologies (e.g., Bayer). These in-licenses are non-exclusive and include some combination of upfront and annual license fees, milestone fees, and commercial royalty obligations consisting of low percentages or a low dollar per acre fee.
 Below is a summary of our in-license agreements that we believe are most significant for our more advanced product development programs.
 University of Alberta. We hold an exclusive license from the University of Alberta to the patent portfolio that form the basis of our NUE program, which began in 2002. In exchange for an upfront license fee and royalties on sublicense revenues and net product sales (which are capped at an aggregate amount in the mid-seven figures), and subject to the University’s right to perform academic research using the technology, we exclusively control all research, development, commercialization, and sublicensing of the patented technology globally for all crops.
 The John Sperling Foundation, formerly The John Sperling Revocable Trust. In conjunction with a sponsored research and development agreement entered into in 2003, we obtained an exclusive license from Blue Horse Labs, an affiliate entity of our majority stockholder, Moral Compass Corporation and whose rights were later assigned to the John Sperling Revocable Trust and subsequently The John Sperling Foundation (“JSF”), for technology related to several of our development programs. Under the sponsored research and development agreement, The JSF has an ownership right in patents covering technology that was developed using Blue Horse Labs funds, including certain NUE and GLA safflower patents. In the corresponding license agreement, in exchange for a single-digit royalty on net revenues and management of all aspects of the patent portfolio, we exclusively control all research, development, commercialization, and sublicensing of the patented technology globally for all crops.
 University of California, Davis. Our WUE technology was developed under an exclusive option agreement with the University of California, Davis, pursuant to which we exercised our right to secure an exclusive license in 2010. We also hold an exclusive license from the University of California, Davis, to the patent portfolio that forms the basis, along with the license from the University of Toronto described below, of our Salinity Tolerance program. In exchange for an upfront license fee, license maintenance fees, and royalties on sublicense revenues and net product sales, we exclusively control all for-profit research, development, commercialization, and sublicensing of the patented technology globally for all crops. 
 University of Toronto. We hold an exclusive license from University of Toronto to the patent portfolio that forms the basis, along with the license from the University of California, Davis as described above, of our Salinity Tolerance program. In exchange for an upfront license fee, a royalty on revenues, and payment of all costs associated with the patent portfolio, and subject to the University’s right to use the technology for research and teaching purposes, we exclusively control all for-profit research, development, commercialization and sublicensing of the patented technology globally for all crops.

Key Collaborations 
 Since our founding in 2002, we have established numerous trait collaborations and have developed close relationships with industry-leading seed and consumer product companies. Our partnerships with global strategic seed and consumer product players enable us to further participate in the development and commercialization of innovative products that promise to play significant roles in improving global crop efficiency and enhancing human health. We believe that the expertise and opportunities created by these collaborations represent important assets to our business. Below is a summary of selected collaborative partnerships that we view as key to the achievement of our near-term and mid-term business objectives.
Mahyco
 We have multiple agreements with Mahyco covering numerous programs, using our most advanced traits in multiple major crops, and have been working with Mahyco as a key partner since 2007. Our agreements with Mahyco in NUE rice and salt tolerant rice are in advanced stages of development.
 Under our various agreements relating to our NUE, WUE, and Salinity Tolerance traits, Mahyco has exclusive research and commercial rights in all licensed geographies and must timely meet certain diligence milestones in order to maintain their exclusivity. Each of our agreements with Mahyco includes an upfront technology access fee, technical and regulatory milestone fees, and, once products utilizing our traits are commercialized, we are entitled to receive a portion of the commercial value of seeds sold by Mahyco incorporating our traits. Rights to new intellectual property developed under an agreement are owned by the inventing party or parties.
 In December 2017, we reached agreement with Mahyco for the return of licensed geographies and crops for certain WUE, NUE & Salinity Tolerance traits where Mahyco either lacks the resources or expertise to effectively progress trait deregulation and commercialization. In addition, for other geographies where Mahyco has progressed trait development but does not possess the familiarity with, or influence on, the regulatory environment to affect deregulation, we are currently evaluating the feasibility of redeploying these technologies to a new licensee. As of December 31, 2018, the parties have not completed, modified or added new license agreements, which are targeted for completion in early 2019. 
 Bioceres
 In 2012, we partnered with Bioceres, an Argentina-based technology company, to form Verdeca LLC, a U.S.-based joint venture company engaged in the development and deregulation of soybean traits, of which we own 50%. We selected Bioceres as our partner in soybeans—the world’s fourth largest crop by area grown and the fourth most valuable at —due to their desirable trait portfolio, their presence in key South American markets, and the significant presence of large soybean growers in their ownership structure.
 Our joint venture agreement provides for each of the joint venture partners to license its trait technologies to Verdeca for use in soybeans, with product development and regulatory efforts equitably divided and managed by us and Bioceres under stand-alone service agreements that are executed annually. The first product in the Verdeca pipeline is a drought and abiotic stress tolerance trait that has already completed extensive validation trials and is now in the regulatory phase of development. This trait has been demonstrated to confer a yield advantage over conventional soybeans grown under the same suboptimal conditions. In April 2015, Verdeca received the first regulatory approval of its stress tolerance trait in soybeans in Argentina. This is the world’s first regulatory approval of an abiotic stress tolerance trait in soybeans, which we believe is an important initial step in pursuing additional regulatory approvals that Verdeca intends to seek in multiple geographies globally. Verdeca has successfully negotiated favorable market access in South America through established players and is working on adding market channel partners in the United States, Brazil, Uruguay, Paraguay, South Africa and China.
 In addition to those agreements, we also have negotiated exclusive access to Bioceres’ drought and abiotic stress tolerance trait for use globally, outside of South America, in wheat. Our agreement with Bioceres provides for sharing of trait value once a product is commercialized.

Ardent Mills
 
In November 2018, we announced our collaboration with Ardent Mills, LLC to develop and commercialize wheat innovations.  Ardent Mills, LLC is North America’s leading flour-milling and ingredient company. Our first project focuses on extending the shelf life and improving the flavor of whole wheat products.
 
By using patented Arcadia trait technology, the storage life of whole wheat flour can be extended by slowing the enzymatic processes that reduce shelf life. Because milled flour from wheat carrying Arcadia’s trait technology oxidizes more slowly, it also minimizes the bitterness associated with most whole wheat products. This trait is expected to help improve the taste of whole wheat products and help reduce waste.
 
The extended shelf life wheat trait was developed using our proprietary non-GM wheat genetic diversity TILLING library, an extensive and exclusive resource of trait lines with high-density variations in genetic composition and gene function. Because it is non-GM, the trait has wide application potential across both conventional and organic farming practices. We recently received a U.S. patent for the technology which extends the storage life of whole wheat flour by minimizing oxidation, the latest in our portfolio of wheat trait improvements.  We will continue further collaboration with Ardent Mills, LLC and university partners to bring this trait to commercialization in products.
 Corteva Agriscience
 In August 2017, we entered into a new strategic collaboration with Corteva AgriScience to jointly develop and commercialize a breakthrough improved wheat quality trait in North America. The collaboration leverages our TILLING platform with Corteva Agriscience’s enabling technology platforms, high-quality elite germplasm and global commercial channels.
 Under the collaboration, the companies will further develop and commercialize an improved wheat quality trait, which has completed initial field trials and is advancing to next-stage field trials. Corteva AgriScience will introgress Arcadia’s trait into its proprietary elite germplasm lines and manage all aspects related to the trait commercialization. Certain development costs will be co-funded, and we will share in the commercial value resulting from products produced.
 Scientific Advisory Board 
 We maintain a scientific advisory board consisting of the members identified below. Our scientific advisory board meets on a quarterly basis and is comprised of industry and academic experts that have extensive experience in the analysis, research and development, and commercialization of biotech plants, including experience relating to discovery, transformation, and field trials. We consult with our scientific advisory board on a variety of matters pertaining to our current and future pipeline of products in development, including, for example, trait selection and development, transformation and TILLING methodologies, field trials, regulatory matters, and intellectual property evaluation.
 We currently have a scientific advisory board that consists of three members as follows:
 Luca Comai, Ph.D. is a professor of plant biology at the University of California, Davis Genome Center. Dr. Comai’s lab is involved in two areas pertinent to breeding. In the first, they study genome regulation, hybridization, and heterosis responses in chromosome copy number variants and interspecific hybridization. In the second, they develop methods and resources for functional genomic discovery, including TILLING, which allows targeted inactivation of genes in crop plants. The research combines plant genetics and genomics with the use of next-generation sequencing, bioinformatics and genome editing to identify genes responsible for traits of interest as well as to discover and use natural and induced variation. Dr. Comai is known for his pioneering work creating glyphosate tolerant crops, and as a founding scientist in Calgene Pacific, Targeted Growth, Inc. and Tilligen. He is a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.
 18

Todd Abraham, Ph.D is the former senior vice president of research and nutrition for Mondelēz International (formally Kraft Foods). He was responsible for worldwide technology development and strategy, long term cross category research programs, analytical sciences, open innovation, consumer sciences and knowledge management across the enterprise, as well as the Reading Scientific Services LTD business in Reading, UK. Before joining to Mondelēz International as senior vice president, product development, Nabisco Foods Company, he held previous leadership positions in marketing, general management and R&D at Pillsbury and Procter and Gamble with both North American and international experience. Dr. Abraham completed his Sc.B. in chemistry at Brown University in Providence, RI. He received his Ph.D. in chemistry from the University of Pennsylvania and his M.B.A. in strategic planning from The Wharton School.
 
Scott Haley, Ph.D. is a professor and wheat breeder in the Soil and Crop Sciences Department at Colorado State University (CSU). Since 1999 he has led the Wheat Breeding and Genetics Program focused on developing improved hard red and hard white winter wheat varieties for eastern Colorado and the High Plains region. Among Dr. Haley’s accomplishments are the development of 40 improved wheat varieties and 2 wheat germplasm lines. In addition to research, Dr. Haley is also active in teaching, student advising, and outreach. Following completion of a B.S. degree in botany at Washington State University, Dr. Haley served with the Peace Corps in West Africa prior to joining CSU as a graduate student in wheat breeding. He then completed a post-doctoral appointment in bean breeding at Michigan State University and served 5.5 years as a wheat breeder at South Dakota State University. 
 Competition 
 The markets for seed traits and agricultural biotechnology products are highly competitive, and we face significant direct and indirect competition in several aspects of our business. Competition for improving plant genetics comes from conventional and advanced plant breeding techniques, as well as from the development of advanced biotechnology traits. Other potentially competitive sources of improvement in crop yields include improvements in crop protection chemicals, fertilizer formulations, farm mechanization, other biotechnology, and information management. Programs to improve genetics and chemistry are generally concentrated within a relatively small number of large companies, while non-genetic approaches are underway with broader set of companies.
 In general, we believe that our competitors generally fall into the following categories:
  
• | Specialty health and nutrition ingredient companies: In response to the growing consumer demand for healthier food alternatives, a number of agricultural and food-based companies are augmenting their product and market strategies to bring new quality food ingredients to market. Calyxt, Inc. (formerly known as Cellectis Plant Sciences, Inc) is an agriculture biotechnology company that has a similar strategy as ours and is using gene editing technology to create healthier specialty food ingredients and agriculturally advantageous food crops.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Large Agricultural Biotechnology, Seed, and Chemical Companies: According to Phillips McDougall, the leading 10 seed and trait companies as a group invested $3.9 billion in seed and trait research and development in 2017. This includes conventional and advanced plant breeding, as well as biotechnology and gene-editing trait development. According to Phillips McDougall, only a limited number of companies have been actively involved in new trait discovery, development, and commercialization: Corteva (formerly DuPont Pioneer and Dow), Syngenta, BASF, Bayer (including former Monsanto), KWS, and Genective (a joint venture between KWS and Limagrain). Many of these companies have substantially larger budgets for gene discovery, research, development, and product commercialization than we do. Some of these companies also have substantial resources and experience managing the regulatory process for new GM seed traits. Each of Corteva, Syngenta, and Bayer, which accounted for 87% of the 2017 seed trait research and development spend noted above, also have significant chemical crop protection background and businesses. The trait pipelines of these companies are heavily weighted toward biotic stress traits, although they also have significant programs aimed at development of abiotic stress traits and increasingly on output traits such as nutritional content. While these companies have internal programs that may compete with our own, they also seek new traits externally and, as such, some of them either currently are, or may in the future be, our collaborators.

 19

 
• | Trait Research and Development Companies: There are a number of companies that specialize in research and development of agricultural yield and product quality traits, and we believe that a dozen or more companies, including Ebbu (acquired by Cannopy Growth), Front Range Biosciences, Segra, Yield 10, Arista, Benson Hill Biosystems, Evogene and Keygene, among others, are competitors in our field. We believe that these companies typically focus on a limited number of traits, and do not generally have the product development and regulatory infrastructure necessary to bring traits to market. Therefore, they typically license trait technologies to large industry players with in-house development and regulatory capabilities at a relatively early stage of development. In the development of nutritional traits using non-GM methods, companies like Calyxt and Arista Cereal Technologies are competitors who are also developing quality traits in wheat and other crops.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Companies Focused on the Development and Commercialization of Microbial Crop Enhancements: The use of microbial products to enhance crop performance via application to soil, seed, or to crops directly is an area where increased research and development activity has been underway for the past decade or more. We believe that there are more than 20 companies of varying size working in this space. There have been a number of acquisitions, including Becker Underwood by BASF, and joint collaborations in this space but multiple independent companies remain, including Verdesian, Marrone Bioinnovations, Biagro Agrinos, Indigo Agriculture, and Bioconsortia. While these companies could be considered to compete with us as their products seek to improve crop yields, we believe that such products and our traits may be additive, or synergistic, to our future products in terms of increasing crop yields.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Companies Focused on Farming Data Management, or Precision Agriculture: Within the past several years there has been a rapid increase in technologies and companies focused on acquiring, analyzing, and acting upon data in ways that may improve farm economics via increased crop yield and more efficient management of crop production inputs. Technical approaches include weather prediction and monitoring, high-density field and crop imaging systems, precision field soil and yield mapping, and others. Companies focusing on this space include Climate Corporation (acquired by Monsanto), Granular (acquired by DuPont), Farmers Business Network, Farmers Edge, Trimble, Planet Labs, Ceres Imaging, Blue River Technologies, and others. While these products are potentially competitive with us for increasing crop yields, we believe that certain of these products could also be additive or synergistic with our traits.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Agricultural Research Universities and Institutions: Given the global importance of agriculture, numerous agricultural research universities and institutions around the world focus on basic and applied research aimed at increasing crop yield. Most of this publicly funded research is focused on basic research. Many public research programs aim to understand basic biological processes and do not necessarily engage in further development and commercialization of discovered traits. While these programs are potentially competitive with us, we view them primarily as sources of innovation that are fully compatible with our business model. We have an established track record of working closely and effectively with public research programs, including a number from the U.S., Canada, Bangladesh, Japan, Australia, Ireland, and elsewhere.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We believe that we are uniquely positioned at the nexus of basic research and commercial product development. Unlike many companies in our space, we generally do not compete in the area of basic research. Our focus is on development and validation and, therefore, we provide a value-added link by which basic research can be brought to market. Additionally, uncertainty regarding the classification – as GM or not - of gene-editing technologies like CRISPR by regulatory authorities in certain geographies, may increase interest in our proprietary TILLING platform and libraries as a mechanism for new trait development.   While internal programs at the largest seed and technology companies are competitive with ours in some cases, we are technology providers to some of these companies, and we have numerous collaborations with many of them. To remain competitive, we are pursuing multiple strategies, including further building our non-GM pipeline of new technologies, increasing the scope and range of our field-testing activities, and continuing to protect our intellectual property rights in key jurisdictions globally.

We lease greenhouse space and farm land for agricultural use in Northern California as well as farmland in Idaho. We also lease office and warehouse space in Idaho under a lease that expires on December 31, 2021.  Our Seattle research location closed in March 2017.
 We believe that our leased facilities are adequate to meet our current needs and that, if needed, suitable additional or alternative space will be available to accommodate our operations.
