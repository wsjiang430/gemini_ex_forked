Industry Background
 We participate in the large and growing global market for connectivity and essential communications infrastructure. This market is being driven by the growth in bandwidth demand associated with the continued demand of smartphones, tablets and machine-to-machine (M2M) communication as well as the proliferation of data centers, Big Data, cloud-based services, streaming media content and the Internet of Things (IoT). Telecommunications operators are densifying 4G networks and deploying 5G and fiber optic networks to support the dramatic growth in bandwidth demand. As users consume more data on smartphones, tablets and computers, enterprises face a growing need for higher bandwidth networks, in-building cellular coverage and more robust, efficient and intelligent data centers. Operators are investing in their networks to deliver a competitive triple-play of services (voice, video and high-speed data) and to maintain service quality. There are several major trends that we expect to drive network deployments and investment, including:
Evolving Network Architecture
 The pace of change in networking has increased as consumers and data-driven businesses utilize more bandwidth and shift toward ubiquitous mobile applications. Exponential growth in video and “universal mobility” are revolutionizing how we connect to each other and changing the network architecture needed to support consumer demand. This trend requires better network coverage, greater broadband access, and increased capacity and data storage. 
 Operators are working to transition their networks to become faster and more efficient. CommScope sees several key network trends that will continue to impact CommScope and the industry during 2019 and beyond:
  
1) | Network Convergence: Operators are moving toward converged or multi-use network architectures. Rather than building upon independent wireline and wireless networks, operators are now shifting toward networks that combine voice, video and data communications into a single, converged network. In fact, we are developing solutions that support the convergence of wireline and wireless networks for 5G. These changes are expected to help operators increase the efficiency and capability of the network, improve asset utilization and reduce cost. We expect that fiber and wireless technologies will continue to be essential building blocks of converged networks. Convergence of fiber-based broadband networks and traditional wireless networks will be essential for the success of 5G technologies. 
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2) | Densification: As wireless operators work to meet consumer demand, they utilize three primary tools to increase capacity: a) adding wireless spectrum, b) improving network efficiency and c) increasing network density (i.e., adding more cell sites or sectors to an existing cell site). Although the Company benefits from all three strategies, densification of cell sites is expected to be a key driver as operators transition toward 5G networks. A solid 4G network will be the foundation for 5G. Densification includes enhanced sectorization at macro cell sites, building new metro cell or small cell sites and establishing better in-building coverage. The Company expects that densification will require significant fiber cable and connectivity between wireless cell sites (fronthaul, crosshaul and backhaul). 
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3) | Virtualization and Centralization: Operators are virtualizing and centralizing wireless networks to make them more flexible and efficient. The first step toward capacity virtualization is deploying centralized radio access networks (CRAN). CRAN is a centralized computing architecture for radio networks which requires installation of direct fiber connectivity to individual cell sites. By leveraging the signal carrying capacity of fiber, operators can centrally control dozens or even hundreds of cell sites in the network. Centralizing independent wireless base stations can support the efficient distribution of capacity, improve network response time, reduce the amount of equipment needed at each individual cell site, and lower power and leasing costs. These CRAN nodes will evolve to become “Cloud RAN” nodes as operators “virtualize” the network by combining hardware and software network resources and network functionality into a single, software-based administrative entity. Network virtualization also supports the transition to 5G. 
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4) | Optimization: Deployment of wired and wireless networks is complex and costly. Operators are highly focused on optimizing network resources and reducing the total cost of ownership. Optimization includes techniques such as innovative fiber connectivity solutions to reduce installation time, network intelligence to monitor equipment efficiency, precise antenna patterns to optimize cell site capacity, spectrum reuse, offloading traffic onto Wi-Fi and utilization of unlicensed spectrum—especially inside buildings.

Fiber Deep Deployments 
 Residential and business bandwidth consumption continues to grow substantially. The proliferation of over-the-top video, multiscreen viewing, cloud services and social media are prompting operators to accelerate fiber deployment. Operators can increase network capacity by installing fiber deeper into their networks. Although consumer devices are increasingly connected to the network via a wireless connection such as LTE or Wi-Fi, these wireless access points must have abundant backhaul capacity available to provide consumers the experience they expect. Operators around the globe are deploying fiber deep to build next generation networks. These networks use the capabilities of fiber to enable consumers access to content at higher speeds with lower network response time. As networks improve and deliver higher speed and greater reliability, many operators are choosing to provide both residential and business services over a common physical layer infrastructure, saving them time and money. In addition, with the deployments of metro cells, outdoor small cells and fixed wireless broadband to the home, these same service providers are planning to utilize this common physical layer infrastructure to provide connectivity to these wireless access points. 
Shift in Enterprise Spending
 Several trends in the enterprise market are expected to create opportunities and challenges. First, the shift toward mobility in business enterprises is expected to impact the amount and type of structured copper connectivity needed over the longer-term. As the bandwidth requirements for Wi-Fi and indoor cellular networks increase, more access points will be needed throughout commercial buildings. As a result, enterprises are expected to adjust in-building cabling designs to deliver both power and high-speed data to those devices. Power-over-ethernet is expected to become increasingly important as the number of devices used for Wi-Fi and indoor cellular networks multiplies. While enterprises continue to need copper connectivity to power edge devices, enterprises are deploying fiber more extensively in data centers. Over the next several years, we expect the growing demand for fiber solutions to result in decelerating demand for copper solutions in networks. Due to huge increases in data traffic and migration of applications to the cloud, enterprises are also shifting spending toward multi-tenant (co-located) data centers and hyperscale cloud service providers, which offer cloud data center services as a replacement to in-house corporate data centers. Multi-tenant and hyperscale data center managers are focused on ultra-low loss, high density, scalable fiber connectivity solutions.  
 An increase in average data center size and the number of assets in a data center significantly raises the total cost of ownership and the complexity of managing data center infrastructure. Data center operators strive to manage their resources efficiently and to reduce energy consumption by monitoring all elements within the data center. Automated infrastructure management software helps operators improve operational efficiency, maximize capability and reduce costs by providing clear insight into cooling capacity, power usage, utilization, applications and overall performance. 
 Momentum of 5G
 5G wireless is evolving from an industry vision toward a tangible, next generation wireless technology. Some operators have begun a transition to 5G wireless and have announced trials and pre-standard deployments of 5G technology. The primary benefits of 5G are expected to include:
  
• | Enhanced mobile broadband—to support significant improvement in data rates and user experience,
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | IoT and M2M communications to support the expected billions of connections between machines as well as short bursts of information to other systems, and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Ultra-fast response time—to support applications like public safety, autonomous vehicles and drones.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 6
 

Densification, virtualization and optimization of the network are all required to support 5G. Operators will need to both acquire and launch new spectrum for 5G, as well as continue their strategy of re-allocation of spectrum from one generation to another. Some of this spectrum will be at much higher frequencies and will use new technologies to deliver exceptional amounts of bandwidth to subscribers. 5G also requires significant fiber to connect wireless access points to each other to improve the response time of the network. As operators transition toward 5G, they must also manage the fundamental network deployment issues of site acquisition, power, backhaul and in-building wireless proliferation.
 Metro Cell, DAS and Small Cell Investment to Enhance and Expand Wireless Coverage and Capacity
 The traditional macro cell network requires mobile users to connect directly to macro cell base stations. Macro cells are primarily designed to provide coverage over wide areas and typically transmit high power. Alone, they are not optimal for dense urban areas where physical structures often create coverage gaps and capacity is frequently constrained. Adding new macro cells or increasing the number of sectors on existing sites has been the traditional way to increase mobile capacity and will continue to be a foundational layer of the network. As demand growth continues to outpace macro cell capacity growth, new solutions are required for densely populated areas. Metro cells and indoor networks have emerged as important layers of the network. Metro cells are smaller outdoor cell sites, located closer to the ground, having a lower power level than a traditional macro cell site. Metro cells blend into their environment and are often found integrated with traditional street furniture, which helps alleviate zoning restrictions that have made traditional deployments difficult. Finally, there are small cell and DAS solutions that address the capacity and speed requirements from an indoor perspective. These systems provide coverage and capacity to the indoor environment and reduce the load from the macro and metro layers, which improves overall network performance. Small cell and DAS systems may range from small single operator, single-band, low-capacity systems for use in enterprise buildings to large multi-carrier, multi-technology, multi-band systems for use in high-capacity public venues.
 Wireless operators view in-building coverage as a critical component of their network deployment strategies. Key challenges for wireless operators in providing in-building cellular coverage are signal loss while penetrating building structures and interference created by mobile devices while connected to macro cell sites. In-building DAS solutions bring the antenna significantly closer to the user, which results in better coverage and capacity while simultaneously reducing interference. In-building DAS provides seamless signal handover for users inside buildings and can support multi-operator, multi-frequency and multi-protocol (2G, 3G, 4G and 5G) solutions. Small cells are self-contained radio units that generally provide support for fewer bands from a single service provider to a relatively small area, similar to a Wi-Fi access point. The benefits of small cell technologies are becoming increasingly important with the trend towards mobility in the enterprise market.

Products from our CMS segment are primarily sold to wireless operators, integrators or contractors that deploy elements of wireless networks at the direction of wireless operators or OEMs that sell equipment to wireless operators. Our customer service and engineering groups maintain close working relationships with these customers due to the significant amount of customization associated with some of these products. Direct sales to our top three CMS segment operator customers represented 11% and 13% of our consolidated net sales for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. No CMS segment customer accounted for 10% or more of our consolidated net sales for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. While we sell to most wireless operators globally, our sales are concentrated within a small number of large operators.
 We generally have no minimum purchase commitments with any of our distributors, system integrators, value-added resellers, wireless operators or OEM customers, and our contracts with these parties do not prohibit them from purchasing or offering products or services that compete with ours. Although we maintain long-term relationships with these parties and have not historically lost key customers, we have experienced variability in the level of purchases by our key customers. Any significant reduction in sales to these customers, including as a result of the inability or unwillingness of these customers to continue purchasing our products, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. See Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors.”
 We employ a global manufacturing and distribution strategy to control production costs and provide world-class service to customers. We support our international sales efforts with sales representatives based in Europe, Latin America, Asia and other regions throughout the world. Our net sales from international operations were $2.0 billion, $2.1 billion and $2.3 billion for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. 
 Patents and Trademarks
 We pursue an active policy of seeking intellectual property protection, including patents and registered trademarks, for new products and designs. On a worldwide basis, we held approximately 9,500 patents and patent applications and approximately 2,300 registered trademarks and trademark applications as of December 31, 2018. We consider our patents and trademarks to be valuable assets, and while no single patent is material to our overall operations, we believe the CommScope, Andrew, SYSTIMAX, HELIAX and NETCONNECT trade names and related trademarks are critical assets to our business. We intend to rely on our intellectual property rights, including our proprietary knowledge, trade secrets and continuing technological innovation, to develop and maintain our competitive position. We will continue to protect our key intellectual property rights.
Backlog and Seasonality
 At December 31, 2018 and 2017 we had an order backlog of $500 million and $492 million, respectively. Orders typically fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on customer demand and general business conditions. Our backlog includes only orders that are believed to be firm. Sometimes, unfilled orders may be canceled prior to shipment of goods, but cancellations historically have not been material. However, our current order backlog may not guarantee future demand.
 Due to the variability of shipments under large contracts, customers’ seasonal installation considerations and variations in product mix and in profitability of individual orders, we can experience significant quarterly fluctuations in sales and operating income. Our operating performance is typically weaker during the first and fourth quarters and stronger during the second and third quarters. These variations are expected to continue in the future. It may be more meaningful to focus on annual rather than interim results.

Competition
 The market for our products is highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change. We encounter significant domestic and international competition across both segments of our business. Our competitors include large, diversified companies — some of whom have substantially more assets and greater financial resources than we do. We also face competition from small to medium-sized companies and less diversified companies that have concentrated efforts in one or more areas of the markets we serve. Our competitors include AFL (a subsidiary of Fujikura, Ltd.,); Amphenol Corporation; Belden Inc.; Berk-Tek (a Company of Nexans S.A.); Comba Telecom Systems Holding Ltd.; Corning Incorporated; Emerson Electric Co.; Ericsson Inc.; Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd.; JMA Wireless; KATHREIN-Werke KG; Leviton Manufacturing Co., Inc.; Nokia Corp; Ortronics (a brand of Legrand NA, LLC); Panduit Corp.; RFS (a subsidiary of Nokia Corp); SOLiD Technologies; Sumitomo Corp; and ZTE Corp. We compete primarily on the basis of delivering solutions, product specifications, quality, price, customer service and delivery time. We believe that we differentiate ourselves in many of our markets based on our market leadership, global sales channels, intellectual property, strong reputation with our customer base, the scope of our product offering, the quality and performance of our solutions, and our service and technical support.
Competitive Strengths

We continuously pursue strategic initiatives aimed at optimizing our resources, reducing manufacturing and distribution costs and lowering our overall cost structure.
 Throughout our history, we have successfully complemented our organic growth with strategic acquisitions. We have completed the BNS business integration and we have delivered substantial synergies, completed significant system integrations and re-organized the business. Our management team has effectively integrated other large acquisitions, such as Andrew Corporation in 2007 and Avaya Connectivity Solutions in 2004. We have also executed tuck-in acquisitions, such as Cable Exchange, Airvana, Argus and Alifabs, to help expand our market opportunities and continue to solve our customers’ business challenges in multiple growth areas. We expect the acquisition of ARRIS to accelerate our strategy to drive profitable growth by unlocking high growth markets, increasing the product addressable market and position the combined company to capitalize on key industry trends as a leading global communication infrastructure provider.
 Raw Materials
 Our products are manufactured or assembled from both standard components and parts that are unique to our specifications. Our internal manufacturing operations are largely process oriented and we use significant quantities of various raw materials, including aluminum, bimetals, brass, copper, plastics and other polymers, optical fiber and steel, among others. We use significant volumes of copper, aluminum, steel and polymers in manufacturing coaxial and twisted pair cables and antennas. Other parts are produced using processes such as stamping, machining, molding and pressing from metals or plastics. Portions of the requirements for these materials are purchased under supply arrangements where some portion of the unit pricing may be indexed to commodity market prices for these metals. We may occasionally enter forward purchase commitments or otherwise secure availability for specific commodities to mitigate our exposure to price changes for a portion of our anticipated purchases. Certain of the raw materials utilized in our products may only be available from a few suppliers, and we may enter into longer term agreements to secure access to certain key inputs. We may, therefore, encounter availability issues and/or significant price increases.
 Our profitability may be materially affected by changes in the market price of our raw materials, most of which are linked to the commodity markets. Prices for aluminum, copper, plastics and certain other polymers derived from oil and natural gas have fluctuated substantially during the past several years. We have adjusted our prices for certain products and may have to adjust prices again. Delays in implementing price increases, failure to achieve market acceptance of price increases, or price reductions in response to a rapid decline in raw material costs, could have a material adverse impact on the results of our operations.
 In addition, some of our products are assembled from specialized components and subassemblies manufactured by suppliers. We depend upon sole suppliers for certain key components for some of our products. If these sources could not provide these components in sufficient quantity and quality on a timely and cost efficient basis, it could materially impact our results of operations until another qualified supplier is found. We believe that our supply contracts and our supplier contingency plans mitigate some of this risk.
 Environment
 We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations governing, among other things, discharges to air and water, management of regulated materials, handling and disposal of solid and hazardous waste, and investigation and remediation of contaminated sites. In addition, we are or may be subject to laws and regulations regarding the types of substances allowable in certain of our products and the handling of our products at the end of their useful life. See Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” for additional discussion of our risks related to environmental laws and regulations.

Employees
 As of December 31, 2018, we had a team of over 20,000 people to serve our customers worldwide. The majority of our employees are located outside of the United States (U.S.). As a matter of policy, we seek to maintain good relations with our employees at all locations. We are not subject to any collective bargaining agreements in the U.S. A significant portion of our international employees are members of unions or subject to workers’ councils or similar statutory arrangements. From a companywide perspective, we believe that our relations with our employees and unions or workers’ councils are satisfactory, though we have experienced challenges in certain countries and may encounter more such challenges. Historically, periods of labor unrest or work stoppage have not had a material impact on our operations or results.
