ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
The Company
Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings, Inc. (the “Company,” "we" or "us"), a Delaware corporation, is one of the world's largest outdoor advertising companies, providing clients with advertising opportunities through billboards, street furniture displays, transit displays and other out-of-home advertising displays. Through our extensive display inventory and technology-based enhancements we have the ability to deliver innovative, effective marketing campaigns for advertising partners globally.
We are focused on building the leadership position of our diverse global assets and maximizing our financial performance while serving our local communities. We intend to continue to execute upon our long-standing outdoor advertising strategies, while closely managing expenses and focusing on achieving operating efficiencies throughout our businesses. 
Our History
We were incorporated in August 1995 under the name “Eller Media Company.”  In 1997, Clear Channel Communications, Inc., now iHeartCommunications, Inc. (“iHeartCommunications”), our parent company, entered the outdoor advertising industry with its acquisition of Eller Media Company.  We changed our name to Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings, Inc. in August 2005.
On November 11, 2005, we became a publicly traded company through an initial public offering, or IPO, in which we sold 10%, or 35.0 million shares, of our Class A common stock.  Prior to our IPO, we were an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of iHeartCommunications.  As of December 31, 2018, iHeartCommunications, through its subsidiaries, owned all of our outstanding shares of Class B common stock and 10,726,917 shares of our Class A common stock, collectively representing approximately 89.1% of the outstanding shares of our common stock and approximately 99% of the total voting power of our common stock.
On July 30, 2008, iHeartCommunications completed its merger with a subsidiary of CC Media Holdings, Inc., now iHeartMedia, Inc. (“iHeartMedia”), a company formed by a group of private equity funds sponsored by Bain Capital Partners, LLC and Thomas H. Lee Partners, L.P.  iHeartCommunications is now owned indirectly by iHeartMedia.
Our corporate headquarters are in San Antonio, Texas and we have executive offices in New York, New York. Our headquarters are located at 20880 Stone Oak Parkway, San Antonio, Texas 78258 (telephone: (210) 822-2828).
The iHeart Chapter 11 Cases and the Separation
On March 14, 2018, iHeartMedia, the indirect parent of the Company, and certain of its subsidiaries, including iHeartCommunications (collectively, the “Debtors”), filed voluntary petitions for reorganization (the “iHeart Chapter 11 Cases”) under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code (the “Bankruptcy Code”) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas, Houston Division (the “Bankruptcy Court”). The Company and its direct and indirect subsidiaries did not file voluntary petitions for relief under the Bankruptcy Code and are not Debtors in the iHeart Chapter 11 Cases.
The iHeart Chapter 11 Cases are being jointly administered under the caption In re: iHeartMedia, Inc. et al., Case No. 18-31274 (MI). The Debtors continue to operate their businesses as “debtors-in-possession” under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and orders of the Bankruptcy Court. iHeartMedia’s modified fifth amended Plan of Reorganization (the “iHeart Plan of Reorganization”) was confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court on January 22, 2019. The iHeart Plan of Reorganization contemplates a restructuring of the Debtors whereby our business is proposed to be separated from iHeartCommunications upon consummation of the iHeart Plan of Reorganization and the conclusion of the iHeart Chapter 11 Cases (the “Separation”). Effectiveness of the iHeart Plan of Reorganization and consummation of the Separation is subject to certain conditions, including the receipt of certain governmental approvals. Although the timing of when and if all such conditions will be satisfied or otherwise waived is inherently uncertain, iHeartMedia currently anticipates the iHeart Plan of Reorganization will become effective and iHeartMedia will emerge from Chapter 11 during the second quarter of 2019.
Our board of directors established a special committee consisting of our independent directors (the “Special Committee”) to consider, review and negotiate certain transactions between iHeartCommunications and us in connection with the iHeart Chapter 11 Cases.

The Settlement Agreement
On December 16, 2018, in connection with the iHeart Chapter 11 Cases, the Company, GAMCO Asset Management Inc. (“GAMCO”), Norfolk County Retirement System (“Norfolk”), Bain Capital Partners, LLC, Bain Capital LP and Thomas H. Lee Partners, L.P. (together, the “Sponsor Entities”), the Debtors, the members of the Company’s board of directors and the members of the Special Committee (the “Delaware Settlement Parties”), through their respective counsel, entered into a settlement agreement (the “Settlement Agreement”) that embodies the terms of (i) a global settlement of all direct or derivative claims brought by or on behalf of GAMCO and Norfolk, both individually and on behalf of the putative class of public shareholders of the Company, against certain members of the Company's board of directors, the Sponsor Entities, iHeartCommunications, iHeartMedia, the Company and the Debtors in connection with the iHeart Chapter 11 Cases and (ii) the Separation in accordance with the iHeart Plan of Reorganization.
The Settlement Agreement contemplates that in connection with the Separation (i) the cash sweep arrangement under the Corporate Services Agreement between the Company and iHeartCommunications will terminate, (ii) any agreements or licenses requiring royalty payments to the Debtors by the Company for trademarks or other intellectual property will terminate, which aggregated to $38.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, and (iii) a new transition services agreement will supersede and replace the existing Corporate Services Agreement. In exchange, the Debtors agreed to waive (i) the set-off for the value of the intellectual property transferred, including royalties incurred through December 31, 2018, which aggregated to $31.8 million on a post-petition basis through December 31, 2018 and (ii) the repayment of the post-petition intercompany balance outstanding in favor of the Debtors as of December 31, 2018, which was equal to $21.6 million as of December 31, 2018. These waivers would have resulted in a net payment to us of $10.2 million if paid on December 31, 2018. In addition, the Settlement Agreement provides that after the Separation, (i) iHeartCommunications will provide an unsecured revolving line of credit in an aggregate amount not to exceed $200 million to the Company (the “iHeart Line of Credit”) for a period of no more than three years following the effective date of the iHeart Plan of Reorganization, (ii) iHeartMedia will indemnify the Company for 50% of certain tax liabilities imposed on the Company in connection with the Separation on or prior to the third anniversary of the Separation in excess of $5.0 million, with iHeartMedia’s aggregate liability limited to $15.0 million, and (iii) iHeartMedia will reimburse the Company for one-third of potential costs relating to certain agreements between the Company and third parties in excess of $10.0 million up to the first $35.0 million of such costs such that iHeartMedia will not bear more than $8.33 million of such costs. The parties agreed that the Company will recover 14.44%, or approximately $149.0 million, in cash on its allowed claim of $1,031.7 million under the intercompany note owed by iHeartCommunications to the Company (the “Due from iHeartCommunications Note”), and to mutual releases, including a release of all claims that have been asserted, could have been asserted or ever could be asserted with respect to the iHeart Chapter 11 Cases and the actions brought by or on behalf of GAMCO and Norfolk, both individually and on behalf of the putative class of public shareholders of the Company.
The Separation 
The Separation will be effected with the merger (the “Merger”) of the Company with and into Clear Channel Holdings, Inc. (“CCH”), a Debtor subsidiary of iHeartMedia and the direct parent of the Company, with CCH being the surviving corporation, which will be renamed “Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings, Inc.” Before the Merger, CCH will transfer all of its subsidiaries that operate the iHeartMedia radio businesses to a newly formed subsidiary of CCH and distribute the common stock of that subsidiary to iHeartCommunications (the “Radio Distribution”), all of our shares of Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock held by any subsidiary of CCH will be transferred to CCH and all outstanding shares of our Class B Common Stock will be converted into our Class A Common Stock pursuant to the provisions of our certificate of incorporation. In the Merger our shares of Class A Common Stock (other than shares of Class A Common Stock held by CCH or any direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of CCH) will be converted into an equal number of shares of common stock of the new Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings, Inc. (“New CCOH Common Stock”). The shares of Class A Common Stock held by CCH and its subsidiaries will be canceled and retired, and no shares of New CCOH Common Stock will be exchanged for such shares. The outstanding shares of CCH immediately before the Merger will convert into a number of shares of New CCOH Common Stock equal to the number of shares of our common stock held by CCH immediately before the Merger. As a result, immediately after the Merger, we will have a single class of common stock, the pre-Merger Class A common stockholders (other than CCH and its subsidiaries) will own the same percentage of our capital stock that they owned immediately before the Merger and all of the remaining 325,726,917 outstanding shares of New CCOH Common Stock will be held by iHeartCommunications. The New CCOH Common Stock held by iHeartCommunications will be transferred by iHeartCommunications to certain holders of claims under the iHeart Plan of Reorganization. CCH intends to apply to list the New CCOH Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “CCO” prior to the effective date of the Merger.
The iHeart Plan of Reorganization also contemplates the issuance of preferred stock (the “CCOH Preferred Stock”) in connection with the Separation to one or more third party purchasers. The proceeds of the CCOH Preferred Stock may be used as a source of liquidity for the Company. The terms of the CCOH Preferred Stock have yet to be fully negotiated and remain subject 
2

to approval by the parties. It is expected, however, that an aggregate amount of $45 million in CCOH Preferred Stock will be issued. It is expected that each share of CCOH Preferred Stock will have a liquidation preference equal to $1,000 per share, plus accumulated and unpaid dividends and holders will be entitled to receive such liquidation preference before any distributions on or redemptions of any junior securities are made in connection with any liquidation. Dividends on the CCOH Preferred Stock are expected to begin to accrue and compound quarterly, cumulative from the date of original issuance. We may issue the CCOH Preferred stock before the Merger but the CCOH Preferred Stock will become preferred stock of the new Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings, Inc.
Our Business
We have two reportable business segments, Americas outdoor advertising (“Americas”) and International outdoor advertising (“International”), which represented 44% and 56% of our 2018 revenue, respectively. Our Americas segment consists of operations primarily in the United States and our International segment consists of operations primarily in Europe, Asia and Latin America.
Americas Outdoor Advertising
We are one of the largest outdoor advertising companies in the United States.  As of December 31, 2018, we owned or operated  approximately 79,000 display structures in the United States with operations in 44 of the 50 largest markets, including all of the 20 largest markets. 
Our Americas assets consist of printed and digital billboards, transit displays, including airports, street furniture and wallscapes and other spectaculars. Our Americas business is focused on metropolitan areas with dense populations.
Strategy
We seek to capitalize on our Americas network and diversified product mix to maximize revenue. Our strategy focuses on leveraging our diversified product mix and long-standing presence in our existing markets as well as pursuing the technology of digital displays, which provides us with the ability to launch new products and test new initiatives in a reliable and cost-effective manner.
Promote Outdoor Media Spending.  Given the attractive industry fundamentals of outdoor media and our depth and breadth of relationships with our advertisers, we believe we can drive outdoor advertising's share of total media spending by using our dedicated sales team to highlight the value of outdoor advertising relative to other media.  We have made and continue to make significant investments in research tools like CCO RADAR with mobile insights from third-party providers. The CCO RADAR suite of out-of-home industry-first solutions applies aggregated and anonymized mobile insights to advertising campaign planning, amplification and attribution. Armed with these insights, CCO RADAR helps brands reach desired audiences, reengage those exposed to out-of-home printed and digital displays across other media platforms and measure what happens after exposure to optimize campaign delivery. Through RADARview, Americas is bringing mobile location data insights online, allowing advertisers to explore Americas’ media as mapped to audience behaviors, demos and location. In addition, Americas is experimenting with integrated social and mobile campaigns and Augmented Reality as supplements to its core medium.
Differentiate through Innovation, Sales and Services. Over the last several years, we have developed and hired talent who are helping to redefine how outdoor media is bought and sold. We are working closely with clients, advertising agencies and other diversified media companies to develop more sophisticated approaches to delivering the right audience in the right location at the right time. One example is our programmatic effort to sell digital billboard advertisements using automated advertisement sales technology to introduce ease and efficiency to the out-of-home ad sales process and enable better targeting of digital billboard advertising. Another is our Proposal Team, which provides proposal preparation and marketing support for our key multi-market sales efforts. A third area is our proof of performance delivery platform that is leading the industry in providing transparency when the ad is delivered, accessible via API to allow partners to pull proof of performance information into whatever system they choose.
Capital allocation. A core element of Americas capital allocation strategy focuses on the digitization of its network. Americas long-term strategy for its outdoor advertising businesses includes pursuing the technology of digital displays, including flat screens, LCDs and LEDs, as additions to traditional methods of displaying clients’ advertisements. Digital advertising provides significant advantages over traditional outdoor media. Our electronic displays are linked through centralized systems to simultaneously and rapidly change advertising copy on a large number of displays, allowing us to sell more advertising opportunities to advertisers. The ability to change copy by time of day and quickly change messaging based on advertisers’ needs creates additional flexibility for our customers. Digital displays allow for high-frequency, 24-hour advertising changes in high-traffic locations and allow us to offer our clients optimal flexibility, distribution, circulation and visibility.

Capitalize on Product and Geographic Opportunities. In the United States, Americas has operations in 44 of the top 50 largest markets, including all of the 20 largest markets. However, Americas is focused on growing their relevance to its advertising customers by continuously optimizing its portfolio and targeting investments in its existing markets or expanding to new markets.
Sources of Revenue
Americas generated 44%, 45% and 44% of our revenue in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.  Americas revenue is derived from the sale of advertising copy placed on our printed and digital displays.  Our display inventory consists primarily of billboards, transit displays and street furniture.  The margins on our billboard contracts, including those related to digital billboards, tend to be higher than those on contracts for other displays, due to their greater size, impact and location along major roadways that are highly trafficked.  Billboards comprise approximately two-thirds of our display revenues.  The following table shows the approximate percentage of revenue derived from each category for our Americas inventory:

 | Year Ended December 31,
 | 2018 | | 2017 | | 2016
Billboards: | | | | | 
Bulletins | 61 | % | | 60 | % | 60 | %
Posters | 11 | % | | 11 | % | 11 | %
Transit displays | 16 | % | | 17 | % | 17 | %
Street furniture displays | 4 | % | | 4 | % | 4 | %
Spectaculars/wallscapes | 4 | % | | 4 | % | 4 | %
Other | 4 | % | | 4 | % | 4 | %
Total | 100 | % | | 100 | % | 100 | %

Our Americas segment generates revenues from local and national sales.  Our advertising rates are based on a number of different factors including location, competition, size of display, illumination, market and gross ratings points.  Gross ratings points are the total number of impressions delivered, expressed as a percentage of a market population, of a display or group of displays.  The number of impressions delivered by a display is measured by the number of people passing the site during a defined period of time.  For all of our billboards in the United States, we use independent, third-party auditing companies to verify the number of impressions delivered by a display.
While location, price and availability of displays are important competitive factors, we believe that providing quality customer service and establishing strong client relationships are also critical components of sales.  In addition, we have long-standing relationships with a diversified group of advertising brands and agencies that allow us to diversify client accounts and establish continuing revenue streams.
Billboards
Our billboard inventory primarily includes bulletins and posters.

• | Bulletins. Bulletins vary in size, with the most common size being 14 feet high by 48 feet wide. Digital bulletins display static messages that resemble standard printed bulletins when viewed, but also allow advertisers to change messages throughout the course of a day and may display advertisements for multiple customers. Our digital displays are linked through centralized systems to instantaneously and simultaneously change advertising copy as needed. Because of their greater size, impact and high-frequency advertising changes, we typically receive our highest rates for digital bulletins. Almost all of the advertising copy displayed on printed bulletins is computer printed on vinyl and transported to the bulletin where it is secured to the display surface. Bulletins generally are located along major expressways, primary commuting routes and main intersections that are highly visible and heavily trafficked. Our clients may contract for individual bulletins or a network of bulletins, meaning the clients’ advertisements are rotated among bulletins to increase the reach of the campaign. Our client contracts for bulletins, either printed or digital, generally have terms ranging from four weeks to one year. 


• | Posters. Printed posters can vary in size, but are commonly approximately 11 feet high by 23 feet wide, and the printed junior posters are approximately 5 feet high by 11 feet wide. Digital posters are available in addition to the traditional poster-size and junior poster-size. Similar to digital bulletins, digital posters display static messages that resemble standard printed posters when viewed and are linked through centralized computer systems to instantaneously and simultaneously change messages throughout the course of a day. Advertising copy for printed posters is digitally printed on a single piece of polyethylene material that is then transported and secured to the poster surfaces. Posters generally are located in commercial areas on primary and secondary routes near point-of-purchase 

4

locations, facilitating advertising campaigns with greater demographic targeting than those displayed on bulletins.  Our poster rates typically are less than our bulletin rates, and our client contracts for posters generally have terms ranging from four weeks to one year.  Premiere displays, which consist of premiere panels and squares, are innovative hybrids between bulletins and posters that we developed to provide our clients with an alternative for their targeted marketing campaigns.  The premiere displays use one or more poster panels, but with vinyl advertising stretched over the panels similar to bulletins.  Our intent is to combine the creative impact of bulletins with the additional reach and frequency of posters.
Transit Displays
Our transit displays are advertising surfaces on various types of vehicles or within transit systems, including on the interior and exterior sides of buses, trains, trams, and within the common areas of rail stations and airports, and are available in both printed and digital formats.  Similar to street furniture, contracts for the right to place our displays on such vehicles or within such transit systems and to sell advertising space on them generally are awarded by municipal and public transit authorities in competitive bidding processes governed by local law or are negotiated with private transit operators.  As compensation for the right to sell advertising space on transit displays, we pay the municipality or transit authority a fee or revenue share that is either a fixed amount or a percentage of the revenue derived from the transit displays. Typically, these revenue sharing arrangements include payments by us of minimum guaranteed amounts. Generally, these contracts have terms ranging from five to ten years.  Our client contracts for transit displays generally have terms ranging from four weeks to one year, or longer.
Street Furniture Displays
Our street furniture displays include advertising surfaces on bus shelters, information kiosks, freestanding units and other public structures, are available in both printed and digital formats, and are primarily located in major metropolitan areas and along major commuting routes.  Generally, we are responsible for the construction and maintenance of street furniture structures.  Contracts for the right to place our street furniture displays in the public domain and sell advertising space on them are awarded by municipal and transit authorities in competitive bidding processes governed by local law.  Generally, these contracts have terms ranging from 10 to 20 years.  As compensation for the right to sell advertising space on our street furniture structures, we pay the municipality or transit authority a fee or revenue share that is either a fixed amount or a percentage of the revenue derived from the street furniture displays.  Typically, these revenue sharing arrangements include payments by us of minimum guaranteed amounts.  Client contracts for street furniture displays typically have terms ranging from four weeks to one year and are typically for network packages of multiple street furniture displays.
Other Displays
The balance of our display inventory consists of spectaculars and wallscapes.  Spectaculars are customized display structures that often incorporate video, multidimensional lettering and figures, mechanical devices and moving parts and other embellishments to create special effects.  The majority of our spectaculars are located in Los Angeles, San Francisco and New York City's Times Square.  Client contracts for spectaculars typically have terms of one year or longer.  A wallscape is a display that drapes over or is suspended from the sides of buildings or other structures.  Generally, wallscapes are located in high-profile areas where other types of outdoor advertising displays are limited or unavailable.  Clients typically contract for individual wallscapes for four weeks to one year. 
Advertising Inventory and Markets
As of December 31, 2018, we owned or operated  approximately 79,000 display structures in our Americas segment with operations in 44 of the 50 largest markets in the United States, including all of the 20 largest markets.  Therefore, no one property is material to our overall operations.  We believe that our properties are in good condition and suitable for our operations.
Our displays are located on land we own, lease or for which we have acquired permanent easements or executed long-term management agreements.  The majority of the advertising structures on which our displays are mounted require permits.  Permits are granted for the right to operate an advertising structure as long as the structure is used in compliance with state and local laws and regulations.
Production
In a majority of our markets, our local production staff performs the full range of activities required to create and install advertising copy.  Production work includes creating the advertising copy design and layout, coordinating its printing and installing the copy on displays.  We provide creative services to smaller advertisers and to advertisers not represented by advertising agencies.  National advertisers often use preprinted designs that require only installation.  Our creative and production personnel typically develop new designs or adopt copy from other media for use on our inventory.  Our creative staff also can assist in the development of marketing presentations, demonstrations and strategies to attract new clients.
5

Construction and Operation
We typically own the physical structures on which our clients’ advertising copy is displayed.  We manage the construction of our structures centrally and erect them on sites we either lease or own or for which we have acquired permanent easements.  The site lease terms generally range from one to 20 years.  In addition to the site lease, we must obtain a permit to build new signs or convert existing signs to digital format.  Permits are typically granted in perpetuity by the state and/or local government and typically are transferable or renewable for a minimal, or no, fee. Printed bulletin and poster advertising copy is primarily printed with computer generated graphics on a single sheet of vinyl supplied by the advertiser.  These advertisements are then transported to the site and wrapped around the face of the site or affixed to a hardware anchoring system on the display site.  The operational process also includes conducting visual inspections of the inventory for display defects and taking the necessary corrective action within a reasonable period of time.
Client Categories
In 2018, the top five client categories in our Americas outdoor segment were business services, retail, media, healthcare/medical and banking/financial services.
Competition
The outdoor advertising industry in the Americas is fragmented, consisting of several large companies involved in outdoor advertising, such as OUTFRONT Media Inc. and Lamar Advertising Company, as well as numerous smaller and local companies operating a limited number of displays in a single market or a few local markets.  We also compete with other advertising media in our respective markets, including broadcast and cable television, radio, print media, direct mail, mobile, social media, online and other forms of advertisement. Outdoor advertising companies compete primarily based on ability to reach consumers, which is driven by location of the display.
International Outdoor Advertising
Our International segment includes our operations in Europe, Asia and Latin America. As of December 31, 2018, we owned or operated more than 380,000 displays across 22 countries.
Our International assets consist of street furniture, billboards, transit displays, retail displays, public bike programs and other spectaculars, which we own or operate under lease or license agreements.  Our International business is focused on densely-populated metropolitan areas.
Strategy
Similar to our Americas business, we believe our International business has attractive industry fundamentals, including the ability to reach a broad audience and drive foot traffic to the point-of-sale, making outdoor a cost-effective medium for advertisers as measured by cost per thousand persons reached compared to other traditional media.  Our International business focuses on the following strategies:
Promote Overall Outdoor Media Spending.  Our strategy is to promote growth in outdoor advertising’s share of total media spending by demonstrating the strength of our medium.  We believe that outdoor advertising is strongly positioned to compete with other media, in particular traditional content-based media such as press, TV, radio and magazines, whose audiences are fragmenting to online sources of that content, as well as competing with internet media channels. As part of our effort to promote growth in outdoor advertising’s share of total media, we are focusing on developing and implementing improved outdoor audience delivery measurement systems (such as our C.A.S.T. system in France) to provide advertisers with tools to plan their campaigns and determine how effectively their message is reaching the desired audience. 
Differentiate on Sales and Marketing. For over five years, we have spent time and resources building commercial capabilities through a company-wide sales force effectiveness program and an upgrade in our sales and marketing talent. These capabilities allow us to build and nurture relationships with our clients and their agencies as well as to offer packages and products that meet our clients’ advertising needs. Going forward, areas of focus include pricing, packaging and programmatic selling; in particular pricing and packaging models that leverage the capabilities and benefits of digital display networks. Expanding our proprietary programmatic platform, which enables marketers to buy our out-of-home inventory in audience-based packages, giving them the ability to manage their campaigns on a self-service basis. 
Capital Allocation. A core element of our capital allocation strategy focuses on the digitization of our network. Our digital displays are a dynamic medium, which enables our customers to engage in real-time, tactical, topical and flexible advertising. We will continue our focused and dedicated digital strategy and remain committed to the development of digital out-of-home communication solutions. Through our digital brands, including Clear Channel Play and Adshel Live, we are able to offer networks 
6

of digital displays in multiple formats and multiple environments including bus shelters, billboards, airports, transit, malls and flagship locations. Part of our long-term strategy is to pursue the diversification of our product offering by introducing technologies, such as beacons, small cells, wayfinding stations and provision of Wi-Fi in our street furniture network, as additions to traditional methods of displaying our clients’ advertisements.
Capitalize on Product and Geographic Opportunities. We are also focused on growing our relevance to our advertising customers by continuously optimizing our display portfolio and targeting investments in promising market segments. We have continued to innovate and introduce new products in our markets—such as the digital telephone kiosks in the United Kingdom (the "U.K."). Our street furniture business generates the largest portion of our revenue and that is where we plan to focus much of our investment. We plan to continue to evaluate municipal contracts that may come up for bid and will make prudent investments where we believe we can generate attractive returns.
Sources of Revenue
Our International segment generated 56%, 55% and 56% of our revenue in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.  Our International display inventory consists primarily of street furniture displays, billboards, transit displays and other out-of-home advertising displays. The following table shows the approximate percentage of revenue derived from each inventory category of our International segment:

 | Year Ended December 31,
 | 2018 | 2017 | 2016
Street furniture displays | 52% | 51% | 52% 
Billboards | 18% | 20% | 20% 
Transit displays | 11% | 10% | 9% 
Other (1) | 19% | 19% | 19% 
Total | 100% | 100% | 100%


(1) | Includes advertising revenue from retail displays, other small displays, and non-advertising revenue from sales of street furniture equipment, cleaning and maintenance services, operation of public bike programs and production revenue.

Our International segment generates the majority of its revenue from the sale of advertising space on street furniture displays, billboards, retail displays and transit displays. Similar to our Americas business, advertising rates generally are based on the gross ratings points of a display or group of displays. In some of the countries where we have operations, the number of impressions delivered by a display is weighted to account for such factors as illumination, proximity to other displays and the speed and viewing angle of approaching traffic.
While location, price and availability of displays are important competitive factors, we believe that providing quality customer service and establishing strong client relationships are also critical components of sales.  Our entrepreneurial culture allows local management to operate their markets as separate profit centers, encouraging customer cultivation and service.
Street Furniture Displays
Our International street furniture displays, available in printed and digital formats, are substantially similar to their Americas street furniture counterparts, and include bus shelters, freestanding units, various types of kiosks, telephone boxes and other public structures.  Internationally, contracts with municipal and transit authorities for the right to place our street furniture in the public domain and sell advertising on such street furniture typically provide for terms ranging up to 15 years. The major difference between our International and Americas street furniture businesses is in the nature of the municipal contracts.  In our International outdoor business, these contracts typically require us to provide the municipality with a broader range of metropolitan amenities such as bus shelters with or without advertising panels, information kiosks and public wastebaskets, as well as space for the municipality to display maps or other public information.  In exchange for providing such metropolitan amenities and display space, we are authorized to sell advertising space on certain sections of the structures we erect in the public domain. We pay the municipality or transit authority a fee or revenue share that is either a fixed amount or a percentage of the revenue derived from the street furniture displays. Typically, these revenue sharing arrangements include payments by us of minimum guaranteed amounts. Our International print street furniture is typically sold to clients as network packages of multiple street furniture displays, with contract terms ranging from one to two weeks. Due to its dynamic and real time delivery capabilities, digital street furniture can be sold flexibly, allowing advertisers to buy solutions on a ‘play and impact’ audience-based model to reach and engage their audiences with dynamic, contextually relevant and targeted messages

Billboards
The sizes of our International billboards are not standardized.  The billboards vary in both format and size across our networks, with the majority of our International billboards being similar in size to our posters used in our Americas business.
Our billboard inventory is primarily comprised of premium billboards and classic billboards and is available in printed and digital formats.

• | Premium. Digital premium billboards allow advertisers to dynamically change messages throughout the course of a day to more effectively target and engage audiences in key locations and may display advertisements for multiple customers. Our electronic displays are linked through centralized computer systems to instantaneously and simultaneously change messages throughout the course of a day. Because of their greater size, impact, high frequency and 24-hour advertising changes, digital premium billboards typically deliver our highest rates. Almost all of the advertising copy displayed on printed premium billboards is digitally-printed and transported to the billboard where it is secured to the display surface. Premium billboards generally are located along major expressways, primary commuting routes and main intersections that are highly visible and heavily trafficked. Our clients may contract for individual billboards or a network of billboards.


• | Classic. Digital and printed classic billboards are available in a variety of formats across our markets. Similar to digital premium billboards, classic digital billboards are linked through centralized computer systems to instantaneously and simultaneously change messages throughout the course of a day. Advertising copy for printed classic billboards is digitally printed then transported and secured to the poster surfaces. Classic billboards generally are located in commercial areas on primary and secondary routes near point-of-purchase locations, facilitating advertising campaigns with greater demographic targeting than those displayed on premium billboards. Classic billboards typically deliver lower rates than our premium billboards. Our intent is to combine the creative impact of premium billboards with the additional reach and frequency of classic billboards.

Our billboards are primarily sold to clients as network packages with contract terms typically ranging from one to two weeks. Long-term client contracts are also available and typically have terms of up to one year. We lease the majority of our billboard sites from private landowners, usually for one to ten years.
Transit Displays
Our International transit display contracts are substantially similar to their Americas transit display counterparts. They are advertising surfaces on various types of vehicles or within transit systems, including on the interior and exterior sides of buses, trains, trams and within the common areas of rail stations and airports, and are available in both printed and digital formats. Similar to street furniture, contracts for the right to place our displays on such vehicles or within such transit systems and to sell advertising space on them generally are awarded by public transit authorities in competitive bidding processes or are negotiated with private transit operators. Contracts with public transit authorities or private transit operators typically have terms ranging from two to five years. Our client contracts for transit displays, either printed or digital, generally have terms ranging from one week to one year, or longer. Due to its dynamic and real time delivery capabilities, digital transit can be sold flexibly, allowing advertisers to buy solutions on a ‘play and impact’ audience-based model to reach and engage their audiences with dynamic, contextually relevant and targeted messages.
Retail Displays
Our retail displays are mainly standalone advertising structures in or in close proximity to retail outlets such as malls and supermarkets. The right to place our displays in these locations and to sell advertising space on them generally is awarded by retail outlet operators such as large retailers or mall operators either through private tenders or bilateral negotiations. Upfront investment and ongoing maintenance costs vary across contracts. Contracts with mall operators and retailers generally have terms ranging from three to ten years. Our client contracts for retail displays, either printed or digital, generally have terms ranging from one week to two weeks. Due to its dynamic and real time delivery capabilities, digital retail displays can be sold flexibly, allowing advertisers to buy solutions on a ‘play and impact’ audience-based model to reach and engage their audiences with dynamic, contextually relevant and targeted messages.

Other International Displays and Services
The balance of our revenue from our International segment consists primarily of advertising revenue from other small displays and non-advertising revenue from sales of street furniture equipment, cleaning and maintenance services, and production and creative services revenue.  Our International inventory includes other small displays that are counted as separate displays since they form a substantial part of our network and International outdoor advertising revenue.  We also have a public bicycle rental program which provides bicycles for rent to the general public in several municipalities.  In exchange for operating these bike rental programs, we generally derive revenue from advertising rights to the bikes, bike stations, additional street furniture displays and/or a share of rental income from the local municipalities.  In several of our International markets, we sell equipment or provide cleaning and maintenance services as part of street furniture contracts with municipalities.
Advertising Inventory and Markets
As of December 31, 2018, we owned or operated more than 380,000 displays in our International segment, with operations across 22 countries.  Our International display count includes display faces, which may include multiple faces on a single structure, as well as small, individual displays.  As a result, our International display count is not comparable to our Americas display count, which includes only unique displays.  No one property is significant to our overall operations.  We believe that our properties are in good condition and suitable for our operations.
Production
The majority of our International clients are advertisers targeting national or regional audiences whose business generally is placed with us through media or advertising agencies. These agencies often provide to our International clients creative services to design and produce the advertising copy, which is delivered to us either in digital format or in the traditional format of physical printed advertisements. For digital advertising campaigns, the digital advertisement is received by our content management system and is then distributed to our digital displays. For traditional advertising campaigns, the printed advertisement - whether in paper or vinyl - is shipped to centralized warehouses operated by us or third parties. The copy is then sorted and delivered to sites where it is installed on our displays.
Construction and Operation
The International manufacturing process largely consists of two elements: the manufacture and installation of advertising structures and the weekly preparation of advertising posters for distribution throughout our networks. We generally outsource the manufacturing of advertising structures to third parties and regularly seek competitive bids. We use a wide range of suppliers located in many of our markets, although much of our inventory is manufactured in China and the U.K. The design of street furniture structures (such as bus shelters, bicycle racks and kiosks) is typically done in conjunction with a third party supplier. Our street furniture sites are posted by our own employees or subcontractors who also clean and maintain the sites. The decision to use our own employees or subcontractors is made on a market-by-market basis taking into consideration the mix of products in the market and local labor costs. Digital displays generally use LCD or LED technology. The manufacture and installation process is generally the same as for traditional sites, however, specialist suppliers are used to supply the LED tiles or LCD screen displays, and there may be additional factors, such as electrical supply and network connectivity, involved during design and construction.
Client Categories
In 2018, the top five client categories in our International segment were retail, telecommunications, Internet/E-Commerce, food/food products and entertainment.
Competition
The international outdoor advertising industry is highly competitive, consisting of several large companies involved in outdoor advertising, such as JCDecaux SA and Global Media & Entertainment (who recently acquired ExterionMedia (UK) Limited), as well as numerous smaller and local companies operating a limited number of displays in a single market or a few local markets.  We also compete with other advertising media in our respective markets, including broadcast and cable television, radio, print media, direct mail, online, mobile and other forms of advertisement.  Outdoor companies compete primarily based on ability to reach consumers, which is driven by location of the display.
Our business requires us to obtain and renew contracts with municipalities and other governmental entities, which frequently require us to participate in competitive bidding processes at each renewal. Many of these contracts typically have terms ranging up to 15 years and have revenue share, capital expenditure requirements and/or fixed payment components. Competitive bidding processes are complex and sometimes lengthy.  Substantial costs may be incurred in connection with preparing bids for such processes. Our competitors, individually or through relationships with third parties, may be able to provide municipalities with different or greater capabilities or prices or benefits than we can provide. In the past we have not, and most likely in the future 
9

will not, be awarded all of the contracts on which we bid. There can be no assurance that we will win any particular bid, or that we will be able to replace any revenues lost upon expiration or completion of a contract. Our inability to renew existing contracts can also result in significant expenses from the removal of our displays. Furthermore, if and when we do obtain a contract, we are generally required to incur significant start-up expenses. The costs of bidding on contracts and the start-up costs associated with new contracts we may obtain may significantly reduce our cash flow and liquidity. The success of our business also depends generally on our ability to obtain and renew contracts with private landlords.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 1,500 domestic employees and approximately 4,300 international employees, of which approximately 5,000 were in direct operations and 800 were in administrative or corporate related activities. Approximately 100 of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements in their respective countries. We are a party to numerous collective bargaining agreements, none of which represent a significant number of employees.  We believe that our relationship with our employees is good.

Outdoor Industry
We also compete with other advertising media in our respective markets, including broadcast and cable television, radio, print media, direct mail, mobile, social media, online and other forms of advertisement. Because we do not use content to attract audiences, we believe we are not subject to the same headwinds as many other media. According to data published by Magna Global, since the emergence of the internet in the late 1990s, online advertising has gained market share from traditional content-based mediums. Initially, online advertising gained market share mostly from newspapers and magazines, but more recently it has also gained market share from television in some markets, as the internet has begun to provide alternative sources of content. We believe the outdoor advertising industry is relatively distinct because it does not rely on content, such as news, television shows or editorials, to attract an audience and then interrupt that content with advertising messages. According to data published by Magna Global, throughout the internet-driven transformation of the advertising ecosystem, outdoor advertising has been relatively immune to fragmentation of audiences, maintaining its share of the market. We anticipate that, while the proliferation of content and distribution models will continue to fragment content-based media audiences, outdoor advertising’s distinct model will remain relatively immune to this trend. According to Magna Global, outdoor advertising’s compounded annual growth rate is expected to be 2.8% between 2019 and 2023.
Outdoor advertising’s share of the advertising market varies by country based on a number of factors, including regulation, sophistication, sociocultural aspects and historic media buying trends. Historically, outdoor advertising has had a larger market share in Western Europe (approximately 8% of the media mix, excluding search advertising, according to Magna Global) than in the United States (approximately 5%, excluding search advertising, according to Magna Global). We believe this is the result of the more urban nature of the outdoor advertising market in Europe.
Regulation of our Business
The outdoor advertising industry in the United States is subject to governmental regulation at the federal, state and local levels. These regulations may include, among others, restrictions on the construction, repair, maintenance, lighting, upgrading, height, size, spacing and location and permitting of and, in some instances, content of advertising copy being displayed on outdoor advertising structures.  In addition, international regulations have a significant impact on the outdoor advertising industry.  International regulation of the outdoor advertising industry can vary by municipality, region and country, but generally limits the size, placement, nature and density of out-of-home displays. Other regulations may limit the subject matter and language of out-of-home displays.
From time to time, legislation has been introduced in both the United States and foreign jurisdictions attempting to impose taxes on revenue from outdoor advertising or for the right to use outdoor advertising assets or for the privilege of engaging in the outdoor advertising business. Several jurisdictions have imposed such taxes as a percentage of our outdoor advertising revenue generated in that jurisdiction or based on the size the billboard and type of display technology.  In addition, some jurisdictions have taxed our personal property and leasehold interests in advertising locations using various valuation methodologies. We expect U.S. and foreign jurisdictions to continue to try to impose such taxes as a way of increasing revenue.  In recent years, outdoor advertising also has become the subject of targeted taxes and fees.  These laws may affect prevailing competitive conditions in our markets in a variety of ways.  Such laws may reduce our expansion opportunities or may increase or reduce competitive pressure from other members of the outdoor advertising industry.  No assurance can be given that existing or future laws or regulations, and the enforcement thereof, will not materially and adversely affect the outdoor advertising industry.  However, we 
10

contest laws and regulations that we believe unlawfully restrict our constitutional or other legal rights and may adversely impact the growth of our outdoor advertising business.
In the United States, federal law, principally the Highway Beautification Act (“HBA”), regulates outdoor advertising on Federal-Aid Primary, Interstate and National Highway Systems roads within the United States (“controlled roads”). The HBA regulates the size and placement of billboards, requires the development of state standards, mandates a state’s compliance program, promotes the expeditious removal of illegal signs and requires just compensation for takings on controlled roads.
To satisfy the HBA’s requirements, all states have passed billboard control statutes and regulations that regulate, among other things, construction, repair, maintenance, lighting, height, size, spacing and the placement and permitting of outdoor advertising structures.  We are not aware of any state that has passed control statutes and regulations less restrictive than the prevailing federal requirements on the federal highway system, including the requirement that an owner remove any non-grandfathered, non-compliant signs along the controlled roads, at the owner’s expense and without compensation.  Local governments generally also include billboard control as part of their zoning laws and building codes regulating those items described above and include similar provisions regarding the removal of non-grandfathered structures that do not comply with certain of the local requirements.  Some local governments have initiated code enforcement and permit reviews of billboards within their jurisdiction. In some instances we have had to remove billboards as a result of such reviews.
As part of their billboard control laws, state and local governments regulate the construction of new signs.  Some jurisdictions prohibit new construction, some jurisdictions allow new construction only to replace or relocate existing structures and some jurisdictions allow new construction subject to the various restrictions discussed above.  In certain jurisdictions, restrictive regulations also limit our ability to relocate, rebuild, repair, maintain, upgrade, modify or replace existing legal non-conforming billboards.
U.S. federal law neither requires nor prohibits the removal of existing lawful billboards, but it does mandate the payment of compensation if a state or other government agency or entity compels the removal of a lawful billboard along the controlled roads.  In the past, state governments have purchased and removed existing lawful billboards for beautification purposes using federal funding for transportation enhancement programs, and these jurisdictions may continue to do so in the future. From time to time, state and local government authorities use the power of eminent domain and amortization to remove billboards.  Amortization is the required removal of legal non-conforming billboards (billboards which conformed with applicable laws and regulations when built, but which do not conform to current laws and regulations) or the commercial advertising placed on such billboards after a period of years. Pursuant to this concept, the governmental body asserts that just compensation is earned by continued operation of the billboard over that period of time. Although amortization is prohibited along all controlled roads, amortization has been upheld along non-controlled roads in limited instances where permitted by state and local law. Thus far, we have been able to obtain satisfactory compensation for, or relocation of, our billboards purchased or removed as a result of these types of governmental action, although there is no assurance that this will continue to be the case in the future.
We have introduced and intend to expand the deployment of digital billboards that display static digital advertising copy from various advertisers that change up to several times per minute. We have encountered some existing regulations in the U.S. and across some international jurisdictions that restrict or prohibit these types of digital displays.  However, since digital technology for changing static copy has only recently been developed and introduced into the market on a large scale, and is in the process of being introduced more broadly in our international markets, existing regulations that currently do not apply to digital technology by their terms could be revised to impose greater restrictions. These regulations, or actions by third parties, may impose greater restrictions on digital billboards due to alleged concerns over aesthetics or driver safety.
Privacy and Data Protection
We obtain certain types of information from users of our technology platforms, including, without limitation, our websites, web pages, interactive features, applications, social media pages, and mobile application (“Platforms”), in accordance with the privacy policies and terms of use posted on the applicable Platform.  In addition, we obtain anonymous and aggregated audience behavior information from third-party data providers who represent to us that they are compliant with applicable laws. We use and share this information for a variety of business purposes. In addition, we collect personally identifiable information from our employees, from users of our public bike services, from our business partners and from consumers who interact with our digital panels, including the use of behavioral analysis software.
We are subject to a number of federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations relating to consumer protection, information security, data protection and privacy.  Many of these laws and regulations are still evolving (such as the new California Consumer Privacy Act) and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business or limit the services we are able to offer.  In the area of information security and data protection, the laws in several states in the United States and most other countries require companies to implement specific information security controls and legal protections to protect certain types of personally 
11

identifiable information.  Likewise, most states in the United States and most other countries have laws in place requiring companies to notify users if there is a security breach that compromises certain categories of their personally identifiable information.  Any failure on our part to comply with these laws may subject us to significant liabilities.
We regularly review and implement commercially reasonable organizational and technical security measures that are designed to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of our employees’, clients’ and consumers’ personally identifiable information and to protect our proprietary business information.  In Europe, we have appointed a Chief Data Protection Officer with respect to our European outdoor businesses and are implementing a comprehensive legal and information security-led approach to compliance with the new European Union ("E.U.")-wide General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”) in line with our obligations and our risk profile. Despite our best efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable.  Any failure or perceived failure by us to protect our information or information about our employees, clients and consumers or to comply with our policies or applicable regulatory requirements could result in damage to our business and loss of confidence in us, damage to our brands, the loss of users of our services, consumers, business partners and advertisers, as well as proceedings against us by governmental authorities or others, which could harm our business.
