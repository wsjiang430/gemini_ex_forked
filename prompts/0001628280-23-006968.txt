Unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires, references to the Company, ChromaDex, we, us and our refer to ChromaDex Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries.
Company Background
On May 21, 2008, Cody Resources, Inc., a Nevada corporation and a public company, (Cody) entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (Merger Agreement), by and among Cody, CDI Acquisition, Inc., a California corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of Cody (Acquisition Sub), and ChromaDex, Inc. (Merger). Subsequent to the signing of the Merger Agreement, Cody merged with and into a Delaware corporation. On June 20, 2008, Cody amended its articles of incorporation to change its name to ChromaDex Corporation. ChromaDex Corporation was traded on the over-the-counter market under the symbol “CDXC.” On April 25, 2016, ChromaDex Corporation became listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “CDXC.”
ChromaDex, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of ChromaDex Corporation, was originally formed as a California corporation on February 19, 2000.
On March 12, 2017, ChromaDex Corporation acquired Healthspan Research LLC, a consumer product company offering Tru Niagen® branded products. This marked the strategic shift to become a global bioscience company dedicated to healthy aging. On September 5, 2017, the Company completed the sale of its operating assets that were used with the Company’s quality verification program testing and analytical chemistry business for food and food related products to Covance Laboratories Inc. On January 15, 2021, Healthspan Research LLC was dissolved. Prior to its dissolution, Healthspan Research, LLC contributed its assets and liabilities to ChromaDex, Inc.
Company Overview
ChromaDex is a global bioscience company dedicated to healthy aging. Our team, which includes world-renowned scientists, is pioneering research on nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), an essential coenzyme that is a key regulator of cellular metabolism and is found in every cell of the human body. NAD+ levels in humans have been shown to decline by more than 50% from young adulthood to middle age. In addition to age, other factors linked to NAD+ depletion include poor diet, excess alcohol consumption and a number of disease states. NAD+ levels may be increased through supplementation with NAD+ precursors, such as nicotinamide riboside (NR), calorie restriction and moderate exercise. 
In 2013, we commercialized Niagen®, a proprietary form of NR, a novel form of vitamin B3. Data from numerous preclinical studies and human clinical trials show that NR is a highly efficient NAD+ precursor that significantly raises NAD+ levels in blood and tissue. Niagen® is confirmed safe for human consumption as a dietary supplement and food ingredient. Niagen® has twice been successfully reviewed under the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) new dietary ingredient (NDI) notification program, it has been successfully notified to the FDA as generally recognized as safe (GRAS), and has been approved by Health Canada, the European Commission, the Turkish Ministry of Agriculture and the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) of Australia. Niagen® has also been approved for inclusion in medical foods by both the Brazilian Health Regulatory Agency (ANVISA) and the Food Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ). Clinical studies of Niagen® have demonstrated a variety of outcomes including increased NAD+ levels, altered body composition, increased cellular metabolism and increased energy production. Niagen® is protected by patents to which we are the owner or have exclusive rights.
While best known for its role in cellular energy production, NAD+ is also thought to play an important role in healthy aging. Many cellular functions related to health and healthy aging are sensitive to levels of locally available NAD+ and this represents an active area of research in the field of NAD+. To date, there are over 475 published human clinical studies related to NAD+ and its impact on health. These areas of study include understanding NAD+’s role in Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, neuropathy, sarcopenia, liver disease and heart failure.

Ingredients Segment & Analytical and Reference Standards Segments 
Our ingredients segment is supported through the development of key partnerships since we do not currently offer our ingredients to the broader public. Sales to our partners are predominantly based in the United States, Hong Kong and Europe. Our partners sell multi-ingredient products featuring Niagen® in the U.S. and other international markets. For our analytical reference standards and services segment, we promote our products and services based on a direct, technically-oriented model. We recruit and hire sales and marketing staff with appropriate commercial and scientific backgrounds. Our analytical reference standards and services segment provides products and services to customers both within the United States and internationally. We offer unique and highly-characterized, phytochemicals, natural products and plant-based materials as well as tailored research services as requested through custom “Scope of Work” applications. For our international operations, we partner with international distributors to market and sell to several foreign countries and markets. 
Total sales and marketing expense for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was approximately $28.3 million and $28.4 million, respectively. 
Research and Development
The ChromaDex External Research Program (CERP™) is an essential component of our research and development platform. CERP™ was established to advance the science of nicotinamide riboside and other ChromaDex products. We value and encourage strong scientific rigor behind our products and have cultivated relationships with academic institutions in pursuit of this. Thus far, CERP™ has achieved over 250 research partnership agreements with leading universities and research institutions around the world including the National Institutes of Health, Cornell, Dartmouth, Harvard, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, University of Cambridge, the Mayo Clinic, Chiba University and Sun Yat-sen University. Additional relationships are currently being developed. 
To date, over 300 peer-reviewed studies have been published on the science behind NR, including its NAD+ boosting properties, and there are over 475 published human clinical studies on NAD+ and its impact on health. CERP™ has produced more than 40% of all peer-reviewed NR-focused publications and 75% of the peer-reviewed clinical NR publications so far. To date, 24 peer-reviewed human clinical trials have been published on our proprietary ingredient Niagen® demonstrating its safety and/or efficacy through CERP™. No adverse effects have been attributed to Niagen® in any of the published clinical trials. In both 2015 and 2018, Niagen® was successfully notified to the FDA as an NDI. Niagen® was also successfully notified to FDA as Generally Recognized as Safe in August 2016.
Through our research and development laboratory in Longmont, Colorado, we venture to discover, develop and evaluate new products that we aim to take to market and explore cost saving processes for existing products. Research and development expense for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was approximately $4.8 million and $3.8 million, respectively.
Competitive Business Conditions
The health and wellness, anti-aging and dietary supplement industries are highly competitive, and we have competitors that offer products similar to our products. Many of our competitors may have significantly greater financial and human resources than our own. We seek to differentiate our products and marketing from our competitors by emphasizing product quality, product benefits, scientific rigor, and functional ingredients. Patent and trademark applications that protect brands, product names, and new technologies are pursued whenever possible. While we cannot assure that such measures will block competitive products, we believe our continued emphasis on innovation and new product development targeted at the needs of our consumers will enable us to effectively compete in the marketplace by building a trusted brand.
For our consumer products segment, we are in direct competition with Elysium Health who offers a similar product to Tru Niagen® as well as other providers of NAD+ boosting supplements. Additionally, we have customers who are authorized resellers of Niagen® as a consumer product. We believe these resellers are focused on specific channels that we feel are complementary to our business and expand awareness of the Niagen® ingredient and benefits. We also face strong indirect competition from other ingredient suppliers who may supply alternative ingredients that may have similar characteristics to ingredients we offer. For our analytical reference standards and services segment, we face competition within the standardization and quality testing niche of the markets we serve. These competitors have already developed reference standards or services or are currently taking steps to develop them. We strive to always provide superior products and services to our competition.

Working Capital
ChromaDex’s working capital as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 was approximately $13.5 million and $8.4 million, respectively. We measure working capital by adding trade receivables and inventories and subtracting accounts payable. Our working capital is primarily comprised of assets and liabilities from our consumer products segment and ingredients segment as these operations require a considerable amount of inventory on hand. As each of these segments grow, greater working capital will likely be required to support these operations.
Government Regulation
Some of our operations are subject to regulation by various U.S. federal agencies and similar state and international agencies, including, but not limited to, the FDA, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Department of Commerce, the Department of Transportation and the Department of Agriculture. These regulators govern a wide variety of production activities, from design and development to labeling, manufacturing, handling, selling and distributing of products. From time to time, federal, state and international legislation is enacted that may materially increase our cost of doing business or may limit or expand our permissible activities. We cannot predict whether or when potential legislation or regulations will be enacted, and, if enacted, the effect of such legislation, regulation, implementation, or any implemented regulations or supervisory policies would have on our financial condition or results of operations. In addition, the outcome of any litigation, investigations or enforcement actions initiated by state or federal authorities could result in required changes to our operations and increased compliance costs.
U.S. FDA Regulation
In the U.S., dietary supplements and food are subject to FDA regulations under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FDCA). Areas addressed in these regulations include:
•product safety;
•product testing;
•ingredient testing;
•documentation process, batch records, specifications;
•product labeling;
•manufacturing facility registration;
•product manufacturing and storage;
•product claims, advertising and promotion;
•product sales and distribution; and
•product post-market surveillance.
The FDCA has been amended several times with respect to dietary supplements, most notably by the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (DSHEA). DSHEA generally provides a regulatory framework to help ensure safe, quality dietary supplements and the dissemination of accurate information about such products. In particular, one aspect of the framework established by DSHEA provides that so-called “third-party literature”, for example a reprint of a peer-reviewed scientific publication linking a particular nutritional ingredient with health benefits, may be used in connection with the sale of a nutritional supplement to consumers without the literature being subject to regulation as labeling. Such literature must not be false or misleading; the literature may not promote a particular manufacturer or brand of nutritional supplement; the literature must present a balanced view of the available scientific information on the nutritional supplement; if displayed in an establishment, the literature must be physically separate from the nutritional supplement; and the literature may not have appended to it any information by sticker or any other method. If the literature fails to satisfy each of these requirements, we may be prevented from disseminating it with our products, and any dissemination could subject our products to regulatory action as an illegal drug. Moreover, any written or verbal representation by us that would associate a nutrient in a product that we sell with an effect on a disease will be deemed evidence of intent to sell the product as an unapproved new drug, a violation of the FDCA. We are committed to meeting or exceeding all relevant FDA regulations under the FDCA.

U.S. Advertising Regulations
In addition to FDA regulations, the FTC regulates the advertising of dietary supplements, foods, cosmetics, and over-the-counter drugs. In recent years, the FTC has instituted numerous enforcement actions against dietary supplement companies for failure to adequately substantiate claims made in advertising or for the use of false or misleading advertising claims. These enforcement actions have often resulted in consent decrees and the payment of civil penalties, restitution, or both, by the companies involved. We may be subject to regulation under various state and local laws that include provisions governing, among other things, the formulation, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, advertising and distribution of dietary supplements, foods, cosmetics and over-the-counter drugs.
Additionally, state attorney's general and private plaintiff attorneys also regulate the advertising of dietary supplements, foods, cosmetics, and over-the-counter drugs through enforcement of state consumer protection laws.  State attorney’s general and, to a larger extent, private lawyers specializing in consumer class action litigation have instituted numerous enforcement actions against dietary supplement companies for failure to adequately substantiate claims made in advertising, for the use of false or misleading advertising claims, for underdosed products that don’t meet label claims and allegations related to product safety. These actions have often resulted in consent decrees and the payment of civil penalties, restitution, or both, by the companies involved. We are not aware of, or party to, any action by a state attorney general or consumer class action involving our products.
Further, The National Advertising Division of the Council of Better Business Bureaus reviews national advertising for truthfulness and accuracy. The National Advertising Division of the Council of Better Business Bureaus uses a form of alternative dispute resolution, working closely with in-house counsel, marketing executives, research and development departments and outside consultants to decide whether claims have been substantiated. We are not aware of, or party to, any action by the National Advertising Division of the Council of Better Business Bureaus involving our products.
International Regulations
Our international sales for the consumer products segment and ingredients segment are subject to foreign government regulations, which vary substantially from country to country. Most countries, in particular major markets, have established regulations for (a) authorizing the introduction of novel ingredients to market in the food and/or dietary/food/health supplement sectors and (b) for allowing finished goods to be placed on the market for consumer access. Typically, novel ingredients must go through an extensive safety review process (similar to the NDI notification process in the U.S.) by a regulatory or scientific authoritative body. Finished products typically must either be notified or registered (a limited approval process) with the relevant authorities. In some cases, new products can be brought to market without notifying the authorities.
The time required to obtain approval by a foreign country may be longer or shorter than that required for the FDA notification process, and the requirements may differ. We may be unable to obtain on a timely basis, if at all, any foreign government approvals necessary for the marketing of our products abroad.
Regulation of foods/food supplements in Europe is exercised primarily through the European Union, which regulates the combined market of each of its member states. Other countries, such as Switzerland, have voluntarily adopted laws and regulations that mirror those of the European Union with respect to novel foods or new dietary ingredients.
Regulation in other major and established markets, including Canada, Japan, Brazil, China, Turkey and Australia all maintain and enforce a clear regulatory framework for novel ingredients and dietary supplements (or their equivalent).

Manufacturing, Sources and Availability of Raw Materials
Our finished products are manufactured by third-party FDA-regulated contract manufacturers in the United States with some raw materials sourced internationally. Each contract manufacturer upholds the standards imposed by the International Organization for Standardization as well as the high quality standards we require. We utilize third-party manufacturers to produce NR, encapsulate and bottle NR sold as a dietary supplement and produce and supply other ingredients, products, and services. In most cases, our contract manufacturers purchase raw materials based on our specifications; however, we may also license particular raw material ingredients and supply our own source to the manufacturer. 
Following the receipt of products or product components from third-party manufacturers, in addition to in-house testing performed by the contract manufacturer, we perform independent analysis and testing to ensure conformance to our strict specifications. We continuously monitor and manage supplier performance through a corrective action program developed by us. We believe these manufacturing relationships can minimize our capital investment, help control costs, and allow us to compete with larger volume manufacturers of dietary supplements, phytochemicals and ingredients. From time to time, if our capacity permits and when demand or quality requirements make it appropriate to do so, we manufacture certain products or product components internally. 
W.R. Grace & Co. -Conn. (Grace) is our exclusive manufacturer for the supply of NR. Effective as of December 14, 2022, we entered into an Eighth Amendment (Eighth Amendment) to the Manufacturing and Supply Agreement (such agreement as amended, the “Grace Manufacturing Agreement”), originally effective in January 2016 with Grace. Beginning January 2019, Grace was issued patents related to the manufacturing of the crystalline form of NR. Pursuant to the Eighth Amendment, we are committed to purchase approximately $18.0 million of total inventory during fiscal year 2023, which is our only future purchase commitment with Grace. The Grace Manufacturing Agreement will expire on December 31, 2023, subject to further renewal of the agreement to be negotiated by the parties.
We believe that we have identified reliable sources and suppliers of ingredients, chemicals, phytochemicals and reference materials that will provide products in compliance with our guidelines.
Environmental Compliance
We incur various expenses in complying with Good Manufacturing Practices and safe handling and disposal of materials used in our research and manufacturing activities. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, these expenses totaled approximately $2.1 million and $1.7 million, respectively. We do not anticipate incurring significant additional expense in our compliance with federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations.
Backlog Orders
For our consumer products segment where we ship products internationally to distributors, we may have a backlog from time to time as the production of Tru Niagen® finished bottles require up to three months lead time by our third-party contract manufacturers. As of December 31, 2022 we did not have any significant backlog orders from the distributors that have not been shipped. For products that are directly shipped to consumers, we have minimal backlog orders as we carry sufficient inventory on hand to ship upon the receipt of order.
For our ingredients segment, we also have minimal backlog orders as we carry sufficient inventory on hand for most of the products we offer and we ship upon the receipt of customer’s order.
For our analytical reference standards and services segment, we normally have a small backlog of orders. These orders amount to approximately $20,000 or less. As we list over 1,750 phytochemicals and 400 botanical reference materials in our catalog, we may not always have the items in stock at the time of customers’ orders. These backlog orders are normally fulfilled within two to six weeks.
