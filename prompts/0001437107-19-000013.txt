ITEM 1. Business.
For convenience, the terms “Discovery,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our” are used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to refer to both Discovery, Inc. and collectively to Discovery, Inc. and one or more of its consolidated subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise requires.

OVERVIEW
We are a global media company that provides content across multiple distribution platforms, including linear platforms such as pay-television ("pay-TV"), free-to-air ("FTA") and broadcast television, authenticated GO applications, digital distribution arrangements and content licensing arrangements. As one of the world’s largest pay-TV programmers, we provide original and purchased content and live events to approximately 4 billion cumulative subscribers and viewers worldwide through networks that we wholly or partially own. We distribute customized content in the U.S. and over 220 other countries and territories in nearly 50 languages. Our global portfolio of networks includes prominent nonfiction television brands such as Discovery Channel, our most widely distributed global brand, TLC, Animal Planet, Investigation Discovery, Science Channel, and MotorTrend (previously known as Velocity domestically and currently known as Turbo internationally). As a result of the acquisition of Scripps Networks, we also added a portfolio of networks that include Food Network, HGTV, Travel Channel, and TVN, a Polish media company. Our portfolio also includes Eurosport, a leading sports entertainment provider and broadcaster of the Olympic Games (the "Olympics") across Europe, as well as Discovery Kids, a leading children's entertainment brand in Latin America. We participate in joint ventures including Group Nine Media ("Group Nine"), a digital media holding company home to top digital brands including NowThis News, the Dodo, Thrillist, and Seeker. We operate production studios, and prior to the sale of our Education Business on April 30, 2018, we sold curriculum-based education products and services (See Note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.) 
Our objectives are to invest in high-quality content for our networks and brands to build viewership, optimize distribution revenue, capture advertising sales, and create or reposition branded channels and business to sustain long-term growth and occupy a desired content niche with strong consumer appeal. Our strategy is to maximize the distribution, ratings and profit potential of each of our branded networks. In addition to growing distribution and advertising revenues for our branded networks, we have extended content distribution across new platforms, including brand-aligned websites, online streaming, mobile devices, video on demand (“VOD”) and broadband channels, which provide promotional platforms for our television content and serve as additional outlets for advertising and distribution revenue. Audience ratings are a key driver in generating advertising revenue and creating demand on the part of cable television operators, direct-to-home ("DTH") satellite operators, telecommunication service providers, and other content distributors who deliver our content to their customers. 
Our content spans genres including survival, exploration, sports, general entertainment, home, food and travel, heroes, adventure, crime and investigation, health and kids. We have an extensive library of content and own most rights to our content and footage, which enables us to leverage our library to quickly launch brands and services into new markets and on new platforms. Our content can be re-edited and updated in a cost-effective manner to provide topical versions of subject matter that can be utilized around the world on a variety of platforms. 
Although the Company utilizes certain brands and content globally, we classify our operations in two reportable segments: U.S. Networks, consisting principally of domestic television networks and digital content services, and International Networks, consisting primarily of international television networks and digital content services. In addition, Education and Other consists principally of a production studio, and prior to the sale of the Education Business on April 30, 2018, also included curriculum-based product and service offerings. Our segment presentation aligns with our management structure and the financial information management uses to make decisions about operating matters, such as the allocation of resources and business performance assessments. Financial information for our segments and the geographical areas in which we do business is set forth in Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Note 23 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
Global Network Brands
Subscriber statistics set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K include both wholly-owned networks and networks operated by equity method investees. Domestic subscriber statistics are based on Nielsen Media Research. International subscriber and viewer statistics are derived from internal data coupled with external sources when available. As used herein, a “subscriber” is a single household that receives the applicable network from its cable television operator, DTH satellite operator, telecommunication service provider, or other television provider, including those who receive our networks from pay-TV providers without charge pursuant to various pricing plans that include free periods and/or free carriage. The term “cumulative subscribers” refers to the sum of the total number of subscribers to each of our networks or content services. By way of example, two households that each receive five of our networks from their pay-TV provider represent two subscribers, but 10 cumulative subscribers. The term "viewer" is a single household that receives the signal from one of our networks using the appropriate receiving equipment without a subscription to a pay-TV provider.

U.S. NETWORKS
U.S. Networks generated revenues of $6.4 billion and adjusted operating income before depreciation and amortization ("Adjusted OIBDA") of $3.5 billion during 2018, which represented 60% and 85% of our total consolidated revenues and Adjusted OIBDA, respectively. Our U.S. Networks segment principally consists of national television networks. Our U.S. Networks segment owns and operates 18 national television networks, including fully distributed television networks such as Discovery Channel, TLC, Food Network, HGTV and Animal Planet. 
On March 6, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Scripps Networks Interactive, Inc. (the "Scripps Acquisition"), and added HGTV, Food Network, Travel Channel, DIY Network, Cooking Channel and Great American Country to our U.S. Networks segment.
U.S. Networks generates revenues from fees charged to distributors of our television networks’ first run content, which includes cable, DTH satellite and telecommunication service providers, referred to as affiliate fees; fees from distributors for licensed content and content to equity method investee networks, referred to as other distribution revenue; fees from advertising sold on our television networks and digital products, which include our GO suite of TVE applications and our virtual reality product, Discovery VR; fees from providing sales representation, network distribution services; and revenue from licensing our brands for consumer products. During 2018, distribution, advertising and other revenues were 39%, 59% and 2%, respectively, of total net revenues for this segment.
Typically, our television networks are aired pursuant to multi-year carriage agreements that provide for the level of carriage that our networks will receive and for annual graduated rate increases. Carriage of our networks depends on package inclusion, such as whether networks are on the more widely distributed, broader packages or lesser-distributed, specialized packages, also referred to as digital tiers. We provide authenticated U.S. TV Everywhere streaming products that are available to pay-TV subscribers and connected viewers through GO applications with live and on-demand access to award-winning shows and series from 18 U.S. networks in the Discovery portfolio: Discovery Channel, HGTV, Food Network, TLC, ID, Animal Planet, Travel Channel, MotorTrend (previously known as Velocity), Science Channel, DIY Network, Cooking Channel, Discovery Family Channel, American Heroes Channel ("AHC"), Destination America, Discovery Life, Discovery en Espanol, Discovery Familia, and Great American Country. In addition, the Oprah Winfrey Network ("OWN"), a consolidated subsidiary as of November 30, 2017, is currently on the Watch OWN application. During 2018, we achieved incremental increases in U.S. digital platform consumption. We also provide certain networks to consumers as part of subscription-based over-the-top services provided by DirectTV Now, AT&T Watch, Hulu, SlingTV, fuboTV, Sony Vue and Philo.

Advertising revenue is generated across multiple platforms and is based on the price received for available advertising spots and is dependent upon a number of factors including the number of subscribers to our channels, viewership demographics, the popularity of our programming, our ability to sell commercial time over a portfolio of channels and leverage multiple platforms to connect advertisers to target audiences. In the U.S., advertising time is sold in the upfront and scatter markets. In the upfront market, advertisers buy advertising time for upcoming seasons and, by committing to purchase in advance, lock in the advertising rates they will pay for the upcoming year. Many upfront advertising commitments include options whereby advertisers may reduce or increase purchase commitments. In the scatter market, advertisers buy advertising closer to the time when the commercials will be run, which often results in a pricing premium compared to the upfront rates. The mix of upfront and scatter market advertising time sold is based upon the economic conditions at the time that upfront sales take place, impacting the sell-out levels management is willing or able to obtain. The demand in the scatter market then impacts the pricing achieved for our remaining advertising inventory. Scatter market pricing can vary from upfront pricing and can be volatile.

Our International Networks segment principally consists of national and pan-regional television networks and brands that are delivered across multiple distribution platforms.

Similar to U.S. Networks, a significant source of revenue for International Networks relates to fees charged to operators who distribute our linear networks. Such operators primarily include cable and DTH satellite service providers. International television markets vary in their stages of development. Some markets, such as the U.K., are more advanced digital television markets, while others remain in the analog environment with varying degrees of investment from operators to expand channel capacity or convert to digital technologies. Common practice in some markets results in long-term contractual distribution relationships, while customers in other markets renew contracts annually. Distribution revenue for our International Networks segment is largely dependent on the number of subscribers that receive our networks or content, the rates negotiated in the distributor agreements, and the market demand for the content that we provide.
The other significant source of revenue for International Networks relates to advertising sold on our television networks and across distribution platforms, similar to U.S. Networks. Advertising revenue is dependent upon a number of factors, including the development of pay and FTA television markets, the number of subscribers to and viewers of our channels, viewership demographics, the popularity of our programming, and our ability to sell commercial time over a portfolio of channels on multiple platforms. In certain markets, our advertising sales business operates with in-house sales teams, while we rely on external sales representation services in other markets. 
During 2018, distribution, advertising and other revenues were 50%, 43% and 7%, respectively, of total net revenues for this segment. While the Company has traditionally operated cable networks, in recent years an increasing portion of the Company's international advertising revenue is generated by FTA or broadcast networks, unlike U.S. Networks. During 2018, pay-TV networks generated 38% of International Networks' advertising revenue and FTA or broadcast networks generated 62% of International Networks' advertising revenue.

International Networks' largest cost is content expense for localized programming disseminated via more than 400 unique distribution feeds. While our International Networks segment maximizes the use of programming from U.S. Networks, we also develop local programming that is tailored to individual market preferences and license the rights to air films, television series and sporting events from third parties. International Networks amortizes the cost of capitalized content rights based on the proportion of current estimated revenues relative to the estimated remaining total lifetime revenues, which results in either an accelerated method or a straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the content of up to five years. Content acquired from U.S. Networks and content developed locally airing on the same network is amortized similarly, as amortization rates vary by network. More than half of International Networks' content is amortized using an accelerated amortization method, while the remainder is amortized on a straight-line basis. The costs for multi-year sports programming arrangements are expensed when the event is broadcast based on the estimated relative value of each component of the arrangement.
While International Networks and U.S. Networks have similarities with respect to the nature of operations, the generation of revenue and the categories of expense, International Networks have a lower segment margin due to lower economies of scale from being in over 220 markets requiring additional cost for localization to satisfy market variations. International Networks also include sports and FTA broadcast channels, which drive higher costs from sports rights and production and investment in broad entertainment programming for broadcast networks.
On June 23, 2016, the U.K. held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the European Union (“E.U.”), commonly referred to as “Brexit.” E.U. law provides for a departing member state to have a two-year notice period to negotiate a term of exit, which the U.K. triggered on March 27, 2017. On November 22, 2018, a draft withdrawal agreement was published detailing the framework of the future relationship between the U.K. and the E.U. This agreement has not yet been ratified by the U.K. and European Parliaments and negotiations continue to find a mutually acceptable text in time for the deadline of March 29, 2019. Brexit may have an adverse impact on advertising, subscribers, distributors and employees, as described in Item 1A, Risk Factors, below. We continue to monitor the situation for potential effects to our distribution and licensing agreements, unusual foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, and changes to the legal and regulatory landscape.
EDUCATION AND OTHER
Education and Other generated revenues of $54 million during 2018, which represented 1% of our total consolidated revenues. Our Education Business was comprised of curriculum-based product and service offerings and generates revenues primarily from subscriptions charged to K-12 schools for access to an online suite of curriculum-based VOD tools, professional development services, digital textbooks and, to a lesser extent, student assessments and publication of hard copy curriculum-based content. On April 30, 2018, we sold an 88% controlling equity stake in our Education Business to Francisco Partners for a sale price of $113 million, which resulted in a gain of $84 million upon disposition. We retained a 12% ownership interest in the Education Business, which is accounted for as an equity method investment. (See Note 3 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.) Other is comprised of a production studio that develops content for our networks and other television service providers throughout the world. Our wholly-owned production studio provides services to our U.S. Networks and International Networks segments at cost. The revenues and offsetting expenses associated with these inter-segment production services have been eliminated from the results of operations for Education and Other.
On April 28, 2017, the Company sold Raw and Betty LLC to All3Media. All3Media is a U.K. based television, film and digital production and distribution company. The Company owns 50% of All3Media and accounts for its investment in All3Media under the equity method of accounting. 
CONTENT DEVELOPMENT
Our content development strategy is designed to increase viewership, maintain innovation and quality leadership, and provide value for our network distributors and advertising customers. Our content is sourced from a wide range of third-party producers, which include some of the world’s leading nonfiction production companies, as well as independent producers and wholly-owned production studios. 
Our production arrangements fall into three categories: produced, coproduced and licensed. Produced content includes content that we engage third parties or wholly owned production studios to develop and produce. We retain editorial control and own most or all of the rights, in exchange for paying all development and production costs. Production of digital-first content such as virtual reality and short-form video is typically done through wholly-owned production studios. Coproduced content refers to program rights on which we have collaborated with third parties to finance and develop either because world-wide rights are not available for acquisition or we save costs by collaborating with third parties. Licensed content is comprised of films or series that have been produced by third parties. Payments for sports rights made in advance of the event are recognized as prepaid content license assets.

International Networks maximizes the use of content from our U.S. Networks. Our non-fiction content tends to be culturally neutral and maintains its relevance for an extended period of time. As a result, a significant amount of our non-fiction content translates well across international borders and is made even more accessible through extensive use of dubbing and subtitles in local languages. Our content can be re-edited and updated in a cost-effective manner to provide topical versions of subject matter that can be utilized around the world. International Networks executes a localization strategy by offering content from U.S. Networks, customized content and localized schedules via our distribution feeds. While our International Networks segment maximizes the use of content from U.S. Networks, we also develop local content that is tailored to individual market preferences and license the rights to air films, television series and sporting events from third-party producers. To that end, during 2018, we entered into a 12-year partnership with the PGA Tour that includes TV and online rights to the PGA Tour outside the United States. Effective January 1, 2019, we announced the launch of GOLFTV, a new live and on-demand international video streaming service providing over 2,000 hours of live golf programming each year and extensive premium content on-demand. Discovery plans to invest more than $2 billion over the course of the partnership, including licensing rights and building the GOLFTV platform.
Our largest single cost is content expense, which includes content amortization, content impairment and production costs. We amortize the cost of capitalized content rights based on the proportion that the current year's estimated revenues bear to the estimated remaining total lifetime revenues, which normally results in an accelerated amortization method over the estimated useful lives. However, certain networks also utilize a straight-line method of amortization over the estimated useful lives of the content. Content is amortized primarily over periods of three to four years. The costs for multi-year sports programming arrangements are expensed when the event is broadcast based on the estimated relative value of each season in the arrangement. Content assets are reviewed for impairment when impairment indicators are present, such as low viewership or limited expected use. Impairment losses are recorded when content asset carrying value exceeds net realizable value.
REVENUES
We generate revenues principally from the sale of advertising on our networks and digital products and from fees charged to distributors who distribute our network content, which primarily include cable, DTH satellite, telecommunication and digital service providers. Other transactions include curriculum-based products and services, affiliate and advertising sales representation services, production studios content development and services, content licenses and the licensing of our brands for consumer products. During 2018, distribution, advertising and other revenues were 43%, 52% and 5%, respectively, of consolidated revenues. No individual customer represented more than 10% of our total consolidated revenues for 2018, 2017 or 2016.
Distribution
Distribution revenue includes fees charged for the right to view Discovery's network branded content made available to customers through a variety of distribution platforms and viewing devices. The largest component of distribution revenue is comprised of linear distribution services for rights to our networks from cable, DTH satellite and telecommunication service providers. We have contracts with distributors representing most cable and satellite service providers around the world, including the largest operators in the U.S. and major international distributors. Typically, our television networks are aired pursuant to multi-year carriage agreements that provide for the level of carriage that Discovery’s networks will receive, and, if applicable, for scheduled graduated annual rate increases. Carriage of our networks depends upon package inclusion, such as whether networks are on the more widely distributed, broader packages or lesser-distributed, specialized packages. Distribution revenues are largely dependent on the rates negotiated in the agreements, the number of subscribers that receive our networks or content, the number of platforms covered in the distribution agreement, and the market demand for the content that we provide. From time to time, renewals of multi-year carriage agreements include significant year one market adjustments to re-set subscriber rates, which then increase at rates lower than the initial increase in the following years. In some cases, we have provided distributors launch incentives, in the form of cash payments or free periods, to carry our networks.
In the U.S., more than 96% of distribution revenues come from the top 10 distributors, with whom we have agreements that expire at various times from 2019 through 2023. Outside of the U.S., approximately 39% of distribution revenue comes from the top 10 distributors. Distribution fees are typically collected ratably throughout the year. International television markets vary in their stages of development. Some, notably the U.K., are more advanced digital multi-channel television markets, while others operate in the analog environment with varying degrees of investment from distributors in expanding channel capacity or converting to digital. 
Distribution revenue also includes fees charged for bulk content arrangements and other subscription services for episodic content. These digital distribution revenues are impacted by the quantity, as well as the quality, of the content Discovery provides.

Advertising
Our advertising revenue is generated across multiple platforms and consists of consumer advertising, which is sold primarily on a national basis in the U.S. and on a pan-regional or local-language feed basis outside the U.S. Advertising contracts generally have a term of one year or less.
In the U.S., we sell advertising time in the upfront and scatter markets. In the upfront market, advertisers buy advertising time for the upcoming season and by purchasing in advance often receive discounted rates. In the scatter market, advertisers buy advertising time close to the time when the commercials will be run and often pay a premium. The mix between the upfront and scatter markets is based upon a number of factors, such as pricing, demand for advertising time and economic conditions. Outside the U.S., advertisers typically buy advertising closer to the time when the commercials will be run. In developing pay-TV markets, we expect advertising revenue growth will result from subscriber growth, our localization strategy, and the shift of advertising spending from broadcast to pay-TV. In mature markets, such as the U.S. and Western Europe, high proportions of market penetration and distribution are unlikely to drive rapid revenue growth. Instead, growth in advertising sales comes from increasing viewership and pricing and launching new services, either in pay-TV, broadcast, or FTA television environments.
Advertising revenue is dependent upon a number of factors, including the stage of development of television markets, the popularity of FTA television, the number of subscribers to our channels, viewership demographics, the popularity of our content and our ability to sell commercial time over a group of channels. Revenue from advertising is subject to seasonality, market-based variations and general economic conditions. Advertising revenue is typically highest in the second and fourth quarters. In some cases, advertising sales are subject to ratings guarantees that require us to provide additional advertising time if the guaranteed audience levels are not achieved.
We also generate revenue from the sale of advertising through our digital products on a stand-alone basis and as part of advertising packages with our television networks.
Other
We also generate income associated with content production from our production studio. Prior to the sale of the Education Business on April 30, 2018, we generated income from curriculum-based products and services, the licensing of our brands for consumer products and third-party content sales.
COMPETITION
Providing content across various distribution platforms is a highly competitive business worldwide. We experience competition for the development and acquisition of content, distribution of our content, sale of commercial time on our networks and viewership. There is competition from other production studios, other television networks, and online-based content providers for the acquisition of content and creative talent such as writers, producers and directors. Our ability to produce and acquire popular content is an important competitive factor for the distribution of our content, attracting viewers and the sale of advertising. Our success in securing popular content and creative talent depends on various factors such as the number of competitors providing content that targets the same genre and audience, the distribution of our content, viewership, and the production, marketing and advertising support we provide.
Our networks compete with other television networks, including broadcast, cable and local, for the distribution of our content and fees charged to cable television operators, DTH satellite service providers, and other distributors that carry our content. Our ability to secure distribution agreements is necessary to ensure the retention of our audiences. Our contractual agreements with distributors are renewed or renegotiated from time to time in the ordinary course of business. Growth in the number of networks distributed, consolidation and other market conditions in the cable and satellite distribution industry, and increased popularity of other platforms may adversely affect our ability to obtain and maintain contractual terms for the distribution of our content that are as favorable as those currently in place. The ability to secure distribution agreements is dependent upon the production, acquisition and packaging of original content, viewership, the marketing and advertising support and incentives provided to distributors, the product offering across a series of networks within a region, and the prices charged for carriage.
Our networks and digital products compete for the sale of advertising with other television networks, including broadcast, cable, local networks, and other content distribution outlets for their target audiences and the sale of advertising. Our success in selling advertising is a function of the size and demographics of our audiences, quantitative and qualitative characteristics of the audience of each network, the perceived quality of the network and of the particular content, the brand appeal of the network and ratings as determined by third-party research companies, prices charged for advertising and overall advertiser demand in the marketplace.
20

Our networks and digital products also compete for their target audiences with all forms of content and other media provided to viewers, including broadcast, cable and local networks, pay-per-view and VOD services, DVDs, online activities and other forms of news, information and entertainment.
Our production studios compete with other production and media companies for talent. Prior to the sale of the Education Business on April 30, 2018, our education business competed with other providers of curriculum-based products and services to schools. 
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
Our intellectual property assets include copyrights in content, trademarks in brands, names and logos, websites, and licenses of intellectual property rights from third parties.
We are fundamentally a content company and the protection of our brands and content is of primary importance. To protect our intellectual property assets, we rely upon a combination of copyright, trademark, unfair competition, trade secret and Internet/domain name statutes and laws, and contract provisions. However, there can be no assurance of the degree to which these measures will be successful. Moreover, effective intellectual property protection may be either unavailable or limited in certain foreign territories. Policing unauthorized use of our products and services and related intellectual property is difficult and costly. We seek to limit unauthorized use of our intellectual property through a combination of approaches. However, the steps taken to prevent the infringement of our intellectual property by unauthorized third parties may not work.
Third parties may challenge the validity or scope of our intellectual property from time to time, and the success of any such challenges could result in the limitation or loss of intellectual property rights. Irrespective of their validity, such claims may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources which could have an adverse effect on our operations. In addition, piracy, which encompasses the theft of our signal, and unauthorized use of our content, in the digital environment continues to present a threat to revenues from products and services based on our intellectual property.
REGULATORY MATTERS
Our businesses are subject to and affected by regulations of U.S. federal, state and local government authorities, and our international operations are subject to laws and regulations of the countries and international bodies, such as the E.U., in which we operate. Content networks, such as those owned by us, are regulated by the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) including some regulations that only apply to content networks affiliated with a cable television operator. Other FCC regulations, although imposed on cable television operators and direct broadcast satellite ("DBS") operators and other distributors, affect content networks indirectly. The rules, regulations, policies and procedures affecting our businesses are constantly subject to change. These descriptions are summary in nature and do not purport to describe all present and proposed laws and regulations affecting our businesses.
Program Access
The FCC’s program access rules prevent a satellite-delivered content vendor in which a cable operator has an “attributable” ownership interest from discriminating against unaffiliated multichannel video programming distributors (“MVPDs”), such as cable and DBS operators, in the rates, terms and conditions for the sale or delivery of content. These rules permit the unaffiliated MVPD to initiate a complaint to the FCC against content networks if it believes this rule has been violated. The FCC allowed a previous blanket prohibition on exclusive arrangements between content networks subject to these rules and cable operators to expire in October 2012, but will consider case-by-case complaints that exclusive contracts between cable operators and cable-affiliated programmers significantly hinder or prevent an unaffiliated MVPD from providing satellite or cable programming.
“Must-Carry”/Retransmission Consent
The Communications Act (the “Act”) imposes “must-carry” regulations on cable systems, requiring them to carry the signals of most local broadcast television stations in their market. DBS systems are also subject to their own must-carry rules. The FCC’s implementation of “must-carry” obligations requires cable operators and DBS providers to give broadcasters preferential access to channel space and favorable channel positions. This reduces the amount of channel space that is available for carriage of our networks by cable and DBS operators. The Act also gives broadcasters the choice of opting out of must-carry and invoking the right to retransmission consent, which refers to a broadcaster’s right to require MVPDs, such as cable and satellite operators, to obtain the broadcaster's consent before distributing the broadcaster's signal to the MVPDs' subscribers. Broadcasters have traditionally used the resulting leverage from demand for their must-have broadcast content to obtain carriage for their affiliated networks. Increasingly, broadcasters are additionally seeking substantial monetary compensation for granting carriage rights for their must-have broadcast content. Such increased financial demands on distributors reduce the content funds available for independent programmers not affiliated with broadcasters, such as us.
21

Accessibility and Advertising Restrictions
Certain of our content networks and some of our IP-delivered video content must provide closed-captioning and video description of some of their programming. Our content networks and digital products intended primarily for children 12 years of age and under must comply with certain limits on advertising. Commercials embedded in our networks’ content stream must adhere to certain standards for ensuring that those commercials are not transmitted at louder volumes than our program material. 
Obscenity Restrictions
Network distributors are prohibited from transmitting obscene content, and our affiliation agreements generally require us to refrain from including such content on our networks.
Regulation of the Internet
We operate several digital products and websites that we use to distribute information about our programs and to offer consumers the opportunity to purchase consumer products and services. Internet services are now subject to regulation in the U.S. relating to the privacy and security of personally identifiable user information and acquisition of personal information from children under 13, including the federal Children's Online Privacy Protection Act and the federal Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act. In addition, a majority of states have enacted laws that impose data security and security breach obligations. Additional federal and state laws and regulations may be adopted with respect to the Internet or other on-line services, covering such issues as user privacy, child safety, data security, advertising, pricing, content, copyrights and trademarks, access by persons with disabilities, distribution, taxation and characteristics and quality of products and services. We must design and operate our digital products and websites in compliance with these laws and regulations. In addition, to the extent we offer products and services to on-line consumers outside the U.S., the laws and regulations of foreign jurisdictions, including, without limitation, consumer protection, privacy, advertising, data retention, intellectual property, and content limitations, may impose additional compliance obligations on us.
Foreign Laws and Regulations
The foreign jurisdictions in which our networks are offered have, in varying degrees, laws and regulations governing our businesses. 
EMPLOYEES
As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 9,000 employees, including full-time and part-time employees of our wholly-owned subsidiaries and consolidated ventures. Scripps Networks had approximately 4,000 employees at the date of the acquisition.
