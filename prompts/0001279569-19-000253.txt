Business Cycle
 
Our business, at its current exploration phase, is cyclical. Exploration activities are conducted primarily during snow-free months in Alaska. The optimum field season at the Upper Kobuk Mineral Projects is from late May to late September. The length of the snow-free season at the Upper Kobuk Mineral Projects varies from about May through November at lower elevations and from July through September at higher elevations.
Trilogy’s Strategy
 
Our business strategy is focused on creating value for stakeholders through our ownership and advancement of the Arctic Project and exploration of the Bornite Project and through the pursuit of similarly attractive mining projects. We plan to:

· | advance the Arctic Project towards development with key activities including increased definition of the NI 43-101 mineral resources and reserves contained in the 2018 Arctic Report (as defined below), technical studies to support completion of a pre-feasibility or feasibility study and the advancement of baseline environmental studies; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | advance exploration in the Ambler mining district and, in particular, at the Bornite Project, pursuant to the NANA Agreement (as more particularly described under “History of Trilogy – Agreement with NANA Regional Corporation”) through resource development and initial technical studies; and 
· | pursue project level or corporate transactions that are value accretive. 

Significant Developments in 2018
 

· | On February 20, 2018, we issued a press release to announce Pre-Feasibility study (“PFS”) results and reserves for the Arctic Project. The PFS was based on a conventional 10,000 tonnes per day truck and shovel, single open pit mine and mill design. The sulphide flotation concentration circuit would produce copper, zinc and lead concentrates at recoveries of 90%, 91.7% and 80% for copper, zinc and lead, respectively. The PFS indicates a pre-tax net present value (“NPV”) of $1,935.2 million at the beginning of the three-year construction phase, with an internal rate of return of 38% based on projected long-term metal prices of $3.00/lb copper, $1.10/lb zinc, $1.00/lb lead and $18.00/oz silver. See the 2018 Arctic Report and “Properties” for additional information.

· | On April 6, 2018, we filed the corresponding technical report for the Company’s Arctic Project entitled “Arctic Project, Northwest Alaska, USA, NI 43-101 Technical Report on Pre-Feasibility Study” with an effective date of February 20, 2018, prepared by Ausenco Engineering Canada Inc. (the “2018 Arctic Report”). The technical report describes the PFS on the Arctic Project as discussed above. The 2018 Arctic Report supersedes the Company’s 2017 Arctic Report (as defined below). 
· | On April 20, 2018, we issued a press release to announce the closing of our bought deal financing. The funds raised consisted of 24,784,482 Common Shares issued at $1.16 per share resulting in aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $28.7 million. We intend to use the net proceeds from the offering over the next three years to advance the Arctic Project towards feasibility and permitting, explore the Ambler mining district and for general corporate purposes. 
· | On June 5, 2018, we issued a press release to announce the release of a maiden inferred cobalt resource of 77 million pounds for the Bornite Project. At a base case of 0.50% copper cut-off grade, the Bornite Project is estimated to contain in-pit inferred resources of 124.6 million tonnes grading at 0.017% Co, resulting in 45 million pounds of contained cobalt. Below the pit shell and at a base case copper cut-off grade of 1.5%, the Bornite Project is estimated to contain an additional inferred resource of 57.8 million tonnes grading 0.025% Co, resulting in an additional 32 million pounds of contained cobalt.

· | On April 10, 2017, we entered into an option agreement, as amended (the “South32 Option Agreement”) with South32 Group Operations Pty Ltd (“South32 Operations”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of South32 Limited, which agreement was later assigned by South32 Operations to its affiliate, South32 USA Exploration Inc. (together with South32 Operations, “South32”). The South32 Option Agreement grants to South32 a three-year option to form a 50/50 joint venture with respect to Trilogy’s Alaskan assets which includes the Upper Kobuk Mineral Projects. South32 must contribute a minimum of $10 million each year, for a maximum of three years, to keep the option in good standing (the “Initial Funding”). South32 may exercise its option at any time to form the 50/50 joint venture (“LLC”) until the option expiration date. Provided that all the exploration data and information related to approved programs has been made available to South32 by no later than December 31 of each year in respect of the first two years, South32 must decide by January 31 of the following year whether; (i) to fund a further tranche of a minimum of $10 million, or (ii) to withdraw and not provide any further annual funding. If the election to fund a further tranche is not made in January, South32 has until the end of March to exercise the option to form the LLC and make the subscription payment. If South32 elects to exercise the option, the subscription price less certain deductions for Initial Funding shall be paid in one tranche within 45 business days. Should South32 not make its annual minimum payment or elect to withdraw, the option will lapse and South32 will have no claim to ownership or to the funds it had already spent. In order to exercise its option to form the joint venture, South32 must contribute a minimum of $150 million, plus (i) any amounts Trilogy spends on matched parallel funding to a maximum of $16 million over the three year period and (ii) $5 million if the option is exercised between April 1, 2018 and March 31, 2019 or $10 million if the option is exercised between April 1, 2019 and the expiration date of the option, less the amount of the Initial Funding contributed by South32. South32 made the option payment for the first year and the funds were used for a $10 million exploration program in 2017 at the Bornite Project.

History of Trilogy
 
Spin-Out
 
We were formerly a wholly-owned subsidiary of NovaGold Resources Inc. (“NovaGold”). At a special meeting of securityholders of NovaGold held on March 28, 2012, the securityholders voted in favour of a special resolution approving the distribution of Common Shares of Trilogy to the shareholders of NovaGold as a return of capital through a statutory Plan of Arrangement under the Companies Act (Nova Scotia).
 
On April 30, 2012, all of the outstanding Trilogy Common Shares were distributed to shareholders of NovaGold such that each NovaGold shareholder of record at the close of business on April 27, 2012 received one Trilogy Common Share for every six common shares in the capital of NovaGold held at that time. The Trilogy Common Shares were listed and posted for trading on the TSX and on the NYSE American (formerly the NYSE MKT) under its previous symbol, NCQ, and former name, NovaCopper Inc., on April 25, 2012.
Name Change
 
We changed our corporate name to Trilogy Metals Inc. from NovaCopper Inc. in 2016 to better reflect the diversity of minerals at our UKMP Projects. On September 8, 2016, upon the opening of the markets our shares began trading on the TSX and the NYSE American under the symbol “TMQ”.
 
Agreement with NANA Regional Corporation
 
On October 19, 2011, NANA Regional Corporation, Inc. (“NANA”), an Alaska Native Corporation headquartered in Kotzebue, Alaska, and Trilogy Metals US entered an Exploration Agreement and Option Agreement, as amended (the “NANA Agreement”) for the cooperative development of NANA’s respective resource interests in the Ambler mining district of Northwest Alaska. The NANA Agreement consolidates our and NANA’s land holdings into an approximately 142,831-hectare land package and provides a framework for the exploration and any future development of this high-grade and prospective poly-metallic belt.
 
The NANA Agreement grants Trilogy Metals US the nonexclusive right to enter on, and the exclusive right to explore, the Bornite lands and the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (“ANCSA”) lands (each as defined in the NANA Agreement) and in connection therewith, to construct and utilize temporary access roads, camps, airstrips and other incidental works. In consideration for this right, Trilogy Metals US paid to NANA $4 million in cash. Trilogy Metals US is also required to make payments to NANA for scholarship purposes in accordance with the terms of the NANA Agreement. Trilogy Metals US has further agreed to use reasonable commercial efforts to train and employ NANA shareholders to perform work for Trilogy Metals US in connection with its operations on the Bornite lands, ANCSA lands and Ambler lands (as defined in the NANA Agreement) (collectively, the “Lands”). The NANA Agreement has a term of 20 years, with an option in favour of Trilogy Metals US to extend the term for an additional 10 years. The NANA Agreement may be terminated by mutual agreement of the parties or by NANA if Trilogy Metals US does not meet certain expenditure requirements on the Bornite lands and ANCSA lands.
 
If, following receipt of a feasibility study and the release for public comment of a related draft environmental impact statement, we decide to proceed with construction of a mine on the Lands, Trilogy Metals US will notify NANA in writing and NANA will have 120 days to elect to either (a) exercise a non-transferrable back-in-right to acquire an undivided ownership interest between 16% and 25% (as specified by NANA) of that specific project; or (b) not exercise its back-in-right, and instead receive a net proceeds royalty equal to 15% of the net proceeds realized by Trilogy Metals US from such project (following the recoupment by Trilogy Metals US of all costs incurred, including operating, capital and carrying costs). The cost to exercise such back-in-right is equal to the percentage interest in the project multiplied by the difference between (i) all costs incurred by Trilogy Metals US or its affiliates on the project, including historical costs incurred prior to the date of the NANA Agreement together with interest on the costs; and (ii) $40 million (subject to exceptions). This amount will be payable by NANA to Trilogy Metals US in cash at the time the parties enter into a joint venture agreement and in no event will the amount be less than zero.

In the event that NANA elects to exercise its back-in-right, the parties will as soon as reasonably practicable form a joint venture, with NANA’s interest being between 16% to 25% and Trilogy Metals US owning the balance of the interest in the joint venture. Upon formation of the joint venture, the joint venture will assume all of the obligations of Trilogy Metals US and be entitled to all the benefits of Trilogy Metals US under the NANA Agreement in connection with the mine to be developed and the related Lands. A party’s failure to pay its proportionate share of costs in connection with the joint venture will result in dilution of its interest. Each party will have a right of first refusal over any proposed transfer of the other party’s interest in the joint venture other than to an affiliate or for the purposes of granting security. A transfer by either party of any net proceeds royalty interest in a project other than for financing purposes will also be subject to a first right of refusal. A transfer of NANA’s net smelter return on the Lands is subject to a first right of refusal by Trilogy Metals US.
 
In connection with possible development of a mine on the Bornite lands or ANCSA lands, Trilogy Metals US and NANA will execute a mining lease to allow Trilogy Metals US or the joint venture to construct and operate a mine on the Bornite lands or ANCSA lands. These leases will provide NANA a 2% net smelter royalty as to production from the Bornite lands and a 2.5% net smelter royalty as to production from the ANCSA lands. If Trilogy Metals US decides to proceed with construction of a mine on the Ambler lands, NANA will enter into a surface use agreement with Trilogy Metals US which will afford Trilogy Metals US access to the Ambler lands along routes approved by NANA on the Bornite lands or ANCSA lands. In consideration for the grant of such surface use rights, Trilogy Metals US will grant NANA a 1% net smelter royalty on production and an annual payment of $755 per acre (as adjusted for inflation each year beginning with the second anniversary of the effective date of the NANA Agreement and for each of the first 400 acres (and $100 for each additional acre) of the lands owned by NANA and used for access which are disturbed and not reclaimed.
 
We have formed an oversight committee with NANA, which consists of four representatives from each of Trilogy and NANA (the “Oversight Committee”). The Oversight Committee is responsible for certain planning and oversight matters carried out by us under the NANA Agreement. The planning and oversight matters that are the subject of the NANA Agreement will be determined by majority vote. The representatives of each of Trilogy and NANA attending a meeting will have one vote in the aggregate and in the event of a tie, the Trilogy representatives jointly shall have a deciding vote on all matters other than Subsistence Matters, as that term is defined in the NANA Agreement. There shall be no deciding vote on Subsistence Matters and we may not proceed with such matters unless approved by majority vote of the Oversight Committee or with the consent of NANA, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
 
Principal Markets
 
We do not currently have a principal market. Our principal objective is to become a producer of copper.
 
Specialized Skill and Knowledge
 
All aspects of our business require specialized skills and knowledge. Such skills and knowledge include the areas of geology, mining and accounting. See “Executive Officers of Trilogy” for details as to the specific skills and knowledge of our directors and management.
 
Environmental Protection
 
Mining is an extractive industry that impacts the environment. Our goal is to evaluate ways to minimize that impact and to develop safe, responsible and profitable operations by developing natural resources for the benefit of our employees, shareholders and communities and maintain high standards for environmental performance at our UKMP Projects. We strive to meet or exceed environmental standards at our UKMP Projects. One way we do this is through collaborations with local communities in Alaska, including Native Alaskan groups. Our environmental performance will be overseen at the Board level and environmental performance is the responsibility of the project manager.

· | All new activities and operations will be managed for compliance with applicable laws and regulations. In the absence of regulation, best management practices will be applied to manage environmental risk.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | We will strive to limit releases to the air, land or water and appropriately treat and dispose of waste.

Segment Information
 
The Company’s reportable segments are based on geographic region for the Company’s operations. Segment information relating to our assets is provided under the section heading “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” below.
Competitive Conditions
 
The mineral exploration and development industry is competitive in all phases of exploration, development and production. There is a high degree of competition faced by us in Alaska and elsewhere for skilled management employees, suitable contractors for drilling operations, technical and engineering resources, and necessary exploration and mining equipment, and many of these competitor companies have greater financial resources, operational expertise, and/or more advanced properties than us. Additionally, our operations are in a remote location where skilled resources and support services are limited. We have in place experienced management personnel and continue to evaluate the required expertise and skills to carry out our operations. As a result of this competition, we may be unable to achieve our exploration and development in the future on terms we consider acceptable or at all. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”
 
Available Information
 
We make available, free of charge, on or through our website, at www.trilogymetals.com our annual report on Form 10-K, which includes our audited financial statements, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and our current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.
