Item 1. | Business

We believe we are a leader in the field of synthetic biology, focusing on programming biological systems to alleviate disease, remediate environmental challenges, and provide sustainable food and industrial chemicals. At present rates of global industrialization and population growth, food and energy supplies and environmental and healthcare resources are becoming more scarce and/or costly. We believe it is not a viable option for mankind to continue on this path — new solutions will be necessary to preserve and globally expand a high quality of life. We believe that synthetic biology is a solution.
Synthetic biology is a rapidly evolving discipline that applies engineering principles to biological systems to enable rational, design-based control of cellular function for a specific purpose. Using our suite of proprietary and complementary technologies, we design, build and regulate gene programs, which are DNA sequences that consist of key genetic components. A single gene program or a complex, multi-genic program is fabricated and stored within a DNA vector. Vectors are segments of DNA used as a vehicle to transmit genetic information. DNA vectors can, in turn, be introduced into cells in order to generate a simple or complex cellular system, which are the basic and complex cellular activities that take place within a cell and the interaction of those systems in the greater cellular environment. It is these genetically modified cell systems that can be used to produce biological effector molecules, or be employed directly to enable the development of new and improved products and manufacturing processes across a variety of end markets, including health, food, energy, and environment. Our synthetic biology capabilities include the ability to precisely control the amount, location and modification of biological molecules to control the function and output of living cells and optimize for desired results at an industrial scale.
Working with our subsidiaries, JVs, and collaborators, we seek to create more effective, less costly and more sustainable solutions than can be provided through current industry practices. Our technologies combine the principles of precision engineering, statistical modeling, automation and production at an industrial scale. We efficiently engineer precise and complex gene programs across many cell types. We apply the engineering principle of a design-build-test-learn continuum, through which we accumulate knowledge about the characteristics and performance of gene programs and cell lines. This process of continuous learning allows us to enhance our ability to design and build improved and more complex gene programs and cellular systems.
While the field of synthetic biology is still emerging, the addressable markets that may benefit from this approach are large and well-established. In health, synthetic biology may provide new approaches to treating diseases, as well as improvements to the manufacture of existing products. It is estimated that in 2018 the global biopharmaceuticals market was over $237 billion. While genetically modified salmon or tilapia may be considered new products, the global market for aquaculture was estimated at more than $170 billion in 2017. Genetically modified agricultural plants are already grown on approximately 180 million hectares around the world and have a global market value greater than $15 billion. In energy, we are working to create novel, highly engineered bacteria that utilize specific energy feedstocks, typically pipeline grade natural gas, to synthesize commercial end products, such as isobutanol for gasoline blending, 2,3 Butanediol for conversion to synthetic rubber and 1,4 Butanediol for polyester. In aggregate, the value of such fuel and chemical products are significant, representing the potential of billions of dollars in estimated market opportunity.
We believe our technologies are broadly applicable across many diverse end markets. Historically, we built our business primarily around the formation of ECCs. An ECC is an agreement with a collaborator to develop products based on technologies in a specifically defined field. Through our ECCs, we provide expertise in the engineering of gene programs and cellular systems, and our collaborators are responsible for providing market and product development expertise, as well as sales and marketing capabilities. In addition, we have sometimes executed a research collaboration to develop an early-stage program pursuant to which we received reimbursement for our development costs but the exclusive commercial rights, and related access fees, were deferred until completion of an initial research program.
Over time, our strategy has evolved away from ECC-type collaborations to relationships and structures that provide us with more control and ownership over the development process and commercialization path. In these new relationships and structures, we bear more of the responsibility to fund the projects and execute on product candidate development. For example, in October 2018, through our wholly owned subsidiary, Precigen Therapeutics, Inc., or Precigen, we entered into a license agreement, the ZIOPHARM License Agreement, with ZIOPHARM Oncology, Inc., or ZIOPHARM, which terminated and replaced the terms of an ECC with ZIOPHARM. The ZIOPHARM License Agreement gives us development and commercialization control over certain products previously licensed to ZIOPHARM. Additionally, in December 2018, we reacquired the rights to use Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-cell (CAR-T) technologies that were previously licensed to Ares Trading S.A., a wholly owned subsidiary of Merck KGaA, collectively Merck KGaA. See "Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 5" appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report for further discussion.

In certain strategic circumstances, we may enter into a JV with a third-party collaborator whereby we may contribute access to our technology, cash or both into the JV, which we will jointly control with our collaborator. Pursuant to a JV agreement, we may be required to contribute additional capital to the JV, and we may be able to receive a higher financial return than we would normally receive from an ECC, to the extent that we and our collaborator are successful in developing one or more products. Additionally, we are increasing the resources that we are expending internally on early-stage proof-of-concept programs where we believe we can leverage our competitive edge in gene program creation and host cell and genome expertise. We are also seeking to partner our more mature programs and capabilities or later-stage assets. In this way, we endeavor to leverage our capital resources and ultimately hope to realize significant value from our mature assets.
As we consider the broad potential applications of our synthetic biology technologies, and consistent with the evolution of our business strategy, we have acquired a number of ventures that are already enabling products that benefit from the application of synthetic biology. Our strategy contemplates the continued acquisition of product-focused companies that we believe may leverage our technologies and expertise in order to expand their respective product applications. We believe that the acquisition of these types of companies allows us to develop and commercialize innovative products and create significant value.
Consistent with the ongoing evolution of our strategy, we routinely consider ways to organize our business and the grouping of our assets to facilitate strategic opportunities.
What is synthetic biology?
History
Synthetic biology entails the application of engineering principles to biological systems for the purpose of designing and constructing new biological systems or redesigning/modifying existing biological systems. Biological systems are governed by DNA, the building blocks of gene programs, which control cellular processes by coding for the production of proteins and other molecules that have a functional purpose and by regulating the activities of these molecules. This regulation occurs via complex biochemical and cellular reactions working through intricate cell signaling pathways, and control over these molecules modifies the output of biological systems.
In the early 1970s, scientists utilized basic tools and procedures for transferring DNA from one organism to another. Foundational tools included: gene programs contained in vectors; enzymes that could cut DNA at specific sites; and enzymes that could "glue" two complementary segments of DNA together. Developments between 1980 and the end of the 20th century advanced the field of genetic engineering, including automated DNA sequencing, DNA amplification via polymerase chain reaction and the creation of genetically modified organisms, or GMOs. However, the simplistic "cut-and-paste" nature of the available tools and the absence of genomic sequence information significantly restricted the scope of early synthetic biology efforts.
More recently, synthetic biology has been enabled by the application of information technology and advanced statistical analysis, also known as bioinformatics, to genetic engineering, as well as by improvements in DNA synthesis. Synthetic biology aims to engineer gene-based programs or codes to modify cellular function to achieve a desired biological outcome. For example, applications may include the replacement of a defective protein with a functional protein to treat a broad range of human and animal disease states or the production of multiple proteins through the regulation of several genes in a cell to produce petrochemicals.
Our approach
The essence of our approach is to apply synthetic biology by using an iterative process in which we:

• | Design genes of interest and gene programs utilizing knowledge of cellular pathways and protein function;


• | Build biological molecules, gene programs and their variants to optimize performance of the biological system;


• | Test gene programs by inserting them into cellular systems and comparing the result(s) to the intended effects; and


• | Learn by utilizing information gained in our iterative processes to create better gene programs and cellular systems using a more informed and efficient process to achieve improved outcomes.

As a result of our approach, we have developed extensive knowledge about many classes of DNA components and the rules governing their expression and activity. We have also assembled an inventory of these DNA components that we can use to 
7

rationally construct unique vectors with predictable outcomes. The knowledge embedded in our DNA database allows us to create single gene and highly complex multigenic gene programs (an individual gene program containing multiple genes).
To support our approach, we have developed, acquired, and integrated a unique suite of technologies, and we continue to expand upon their capabilities. These technologies are complementary in nature and share some or all of the following key characteristics:

• | Platform neutral — outcome oriented. We can work across different cell types with the objective of achieving the intended biological outcome allowing for product development across a broad spectrum of end markets.


• | Knowledge driven. We use statistical modeling tools and computational analysis to continually acquire more knowledge about biological systems and their design to continually improve our ability to develop new and improved products and processes.


• | Rationally designed. Our knowledge of biological systems and components allows us to design, build and select gene programs.


• | Capable of complexity. Our technologies enable the design and precise control of complex biological molecules and multigenic gene programs.


• | Industrial scale. We use engineering principles and automation to enable products based on synthetic biology that are commercially viable.

Our competitive strengths
We believe that our technologies, our ability to work across multiple host systems and our approach to synthetic biology — design-build-test-learn — give us a competitive advantage over traditional industrial processes as well as current approaches to synthetic biology.
We believe that we have the following competitive strengths:
We have a suite of proprietary and complementary technologies
We have built a suite of proprietary and complementary technologies that provides us with a comprehensive ability to design, create, modify and regulate gene programs and cellular systems across multiple host systems (human, animal, insect, plant, fungi, and bacteria). By virtue of the complementary nature of our technologies, we are able to provide our subsidiaries, JVs, and collaborators with a diverse array of capabilities to potentially develop and commercialize new and differentiated products enabled by synthetic biology.
Our design-build-test-learn continuum allows us to design and build improved and more complex gene programs
We have developed a core expertise and technologies to design, build and test complex gene programs, as well as technologies to isolate cells that best express the desired biological output. We have also developed an extensive bioinformatic software platform that combines information technology with advanced statistical analysis for DNA design and genetic engineering, enabling us to continually learn and create optimal conditions for our gene programs. Our approach allows us to build improved and more complex gene programs.
We believe we are a leader in synthetic biology
We believe we are the first company focused exclusively on applying synthetic biology across a broad spectrum of end markets and have been working in the field since 1998. Over the last 21 years, we have accumulated extensive knowledge and experience in the design, modification and regulation of gene programs. We believe all of these factors, coupled with our suite of proprietary and complementary technologies, provide us with advantages in synthetic biology.
We serve large and diverse end markets with high built-in demand
A vast number of products consumed globally are or can be produced using biologically-based processes. Natural resources are becoming more scarce as demand exceeds supply, creating unmet needs for improvements in development and manufacturing. As a result, the need for complex biologically engineered molecules such as those enabled by our synthetic biology 
8

technologies is large and spans multiple industries, including health, food, energy, and environment. Each of these markets faces unique challenges, however all have unmet needs for improvements in product development and manufacturing that can result in savings of both cost and time as compared to traditional means of industrial design and production. Because synthetic biology has the potential to deliver against these unmet needs, we believe that significant demand already exists for improved products enabled by synthetic biology. Additionally, there are markets utilizing traditional industrial processes that have failed to recognize the significant improvement in performance that could be achieved using synthetic biology.
Our evolving business strategy allows us to leverage the broad potential of synthetic biology
We believe our ECC business model was a capital efficient and rapid way for us to initiate our participation in a diversified range of product opportunities and industrial end markets, including health, food, energy, and environment. While our ongoing ECCs continue to allow us to participate in the potential upside from products that are enabled by our technologies across a range of industries, we believe that we are now capable of recognizing additional benefit from the product candidates enabled by our technologies through the formation of a variety of business structures, including operating subsidiaries and JVs. The flexibility of this approach, we believe, will enable us to maximize the value we receive for each particular opportunity within various industries in which we operate.
Our suite of proprietary and complementary technologies
We apply the potential of synthetic biology through our suite of proprietary and complementary technologies that combine the principles of precision engineering, statistical modeling, automation and production at an industrial scale. This enables us to engineer precise and complex gene programs across many cell types.
In order to create a highly functional biological system, we recognize the complexity of cellular processes and the necessity to construct an optimized gene program in conditions reflective of the natural environment to allow for the creation of the optimal biological product. This requires a rigorous understanding of cell signaling pathways as well as the interactions that influence the expression of protein. This knowledge is captured in our advanced Cell Systems Informatics, which uses statistical modeling and other analytic frameworks to determine the most efficient pathways for an intended biochemical result, and also plays a critical role in our research and development as this database of information allows us to explore new targets of potential interest to our current or future subsidiaries, JVs, and collaborators. Moreover, our bioinformatics and computational modeling platform is central to our Protein Engineering, which focuses on designing enhanced and/or novel protein functionalities, including stability, localization, and catalytic activity.
In addition to creating optimized gene programs via the most efficient cell signaling pathways and in the relevant cellular environments, we have a growing library of genetic components with our UltraVector platform that enable design and assembly of gene programs that facilitate control over the quality, function, and performance of living cells. Our RheoSwitch inducible gene switch provides quantitative dose-proportionate regulation of the amount and timing of target protein expression, thereby providing another mechanism to closely control activity of a newly constructed gene program. Further, our AttSite Recombinases allow for stable, targeted gene integration and expression. Once cells have been engineered for the desired biological output, the LEAP automated platform can be used to identify and purify cells of interest, such as antibody expressing cells and stem cells. Furthermore, our ActoBiotics platform allows for targeted in situ expression of proteins and peptides from engineered microbes. Finally, our AdenoVerse technology platform is comprised of engineered adenovector serotypes that alone and in conjunction with our ability to further manipulate and improve the platform permits greater tissue specificity and target selection. We believe this platform will deliver a gene capacity exceeding 30kb which is three to six times greater than current viral delivery methods.
Our markets
Synthetic biology has applicability across many diverse end markets. Our goal is to be a leader in the application of synthetic biology for products currently utilizing biologically-based processes, and a leader in the replacement of conventional processes and products with biologically-based substitutes. Through the application of our suite of proprietary and complementary technologies, we believe we can create optimized biological processes and create substitutes for traditional industrial techniques, leading to improved products that are developed and manufactured faster and more cost-effectively.
Human Health
It is estimated that in 2018 the global biopharmaceuticals market was over $237 billion and is projected to reach greater than $388 billion by 2024. We believe that the unreliable, costly discovery and development process for new medicines is being replaced by the engineering of biology at the genetic, molecular, and cellular level. Our ability to regulate complex gene 
9

programs and cellular systems by applying the principles of science, engineering, and computational bioinformatics with proprietary technologies is being utilized to design new therapies for humans and animals. We are applying our approach to develop targeted gene therapy applications and novel solutions within oncology, rare diseases, active pharmaceutical ingredients, ocular diseases, and infectious diseases, as well as autoimmune, metabolic, and gastrointestinal disorders. All of our human therapeutic product candidates are in the drug discovery, preclinical, or clinical stages of development.
Food and Agriculture
The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations predicts that by 2050 the world's population will grow to almost 10 billion, global demand for food and other agricultural products is expected to increase 50 percent, and global demand for livestock products will increase by 70 percent. We are focused on enabling efficient, high-quality food production that sustainably supports the necessities of our growing population. By applying our suite of technologies, we aim to facilitate development of agricultural, livestock and aquaculture resources that deliver innovative approaches and superior production yields in an environmentally responsible manner.
Energy and Chemicals
Biological production via precise enzymatic conversion represents a promising approach for the efficient production of important energy products. Despite this promise, current attempts to produce "clean" energy are expensive to implement and operate at near break-even yields despite government assistance. Additionally, many alternative energy initiatives start from food sources, such as corn and sugarcane. As a result, these low efficiency processes also compete for arable land and water with the agriculture industry. Using our cellular engineering experience and suite of technologies, we have developed microbial cell lines for bioconversion of methane to higher carbon content compounds. We believe this proprietary platform holds the potential to modernize the existing gas-to-liquids industry by generating important fuels and chemicals at a fraction of the cost of traditional conversion methods. Our bioconversion approach also is being designed to reach an overall balance between sustainable productive yields and attractive economic returns.
To date we have accomplished biological production on a non-commercial scale of six fuel and chemical products that have promise in valuable and relatively large markets. These product opportunities are isobutanol for gasoline blending, 2,3 Butanediol and isoprene for conversion to synthetic rubber, 1,4 Butanediol for polyester, farnesene for diesel fuel and lubricants and isobutyraldehyde for acrylics. In aggregate, the value of such fuel and chemical products are significant, representing the potential of billions of dollars in estimated market opportunity.
Environment
Increased globalization has facilitated the spread of pests that affect human and environmental health by carrying disease and damaging crops. In addition, increasing agriculture outputs and employing more industrialized processes to meet the demands of a rapidly growing global population can impact natural resources and affect the environment. We seek to engineer biological solutions that are designed to protect, preserve or restore the environment and promote sustainability of natural resources. These biological approaches may replace products and processes that present an environmental hazard. Examples of products under development include biologically-based approaches that displace petroleum-derived ingredients and polymers, reduce the wasteful practices associated with extracting compounds that occur in limiting amounts in plants and animals, enable toxin-free, species-specific insect control with methods that do not persist in the environment, and facilitate improved sustainability in food systems.
Our business strategy
We believe our technologies are broadly applicable across many diverse end markets, including some end markets that have failed to recognize the applicability of synthetic biology or failed to efficiently utilize biologically-based processes to produce products. To enable us to maximize the number of these markets we could address, we devised a strategy that allowed us to focus on our core expertise in synthetic biology while developing many different commercial product candidates via collaborations in a broad range of industries or end markets. We built our business primarily around the formation of ECCs, as well as certain research collaborations.
Over time, our strategy has evolved away from ECC-type collaborations to relationships and structures that provide us with more control and ownership over the development process and commercialization path. In these new relationships and structures, we bear more of the responsibility to fund the projects and execute on product candidate development.
10

For example, effective January 1, 2018, we transferred certain of our gene and cell therapy assets for human health to our wholly owned subsidiary, Precigen. As a further part of this strategic evolution, in October 2018, we entered into the ZIOPHARM License Agreement, which terminated and replaced the terms of an ECC with ZIOPHARM. The ZIOPHARM License Agreement gives us development and commercialization control over certain products previously licensed to ZIOPHARM. Finally, in December 2018, we reacquired the rights to use Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-cell (CAR-T) technologies that were previously licensed to Merck KGaA.
We have acquired a number of ventures that are already enabling products that benefit from the application of synthetic biology. Our strategy contemplates the continued acquisition of product-focused companies that we believe may leverage our technologies and expertise in order to expand their respective product applications. We believe that the acquisition of these types of companies allows us to develop and commercialize innovative products and create significant value.
In certain strategic circumstances, we may enter into a JV with a third party collaborator where we may contribute access to our technology, cash or both into the JV that we will jointly control with our collaborator. Pursuant to a JV agreement, we may be required to contribute additional capital to the JV, and we may be able to receive a higher financial return than we would normally receive from an ECC to the extent that we and our collaborator are successful in developing one or more products. Our gas-to-liquid platform for bioconversion of methane to higher carbon content compounds, which we refer to as our methane bioconversion platform, or MBP, is an example of our implementation of a JV approach. Based on our internally developed work on our MBP technology, we have executed two JV arrangements with related parties for specific end products.
Our operating subsidiaries
To derive value from the broad potential applications of our synthetic biology technologies, and consistent with the evolution of our business strategy, we routinely consider ways to organize our business to facilitate strategic opportunities. For example, we have acquired a number of ventures that are already enabling products that benefit from the application of synthetic biology and that we now operate as subsidiaries. Our strategy contemplates the continued formation and acquisition of such operating subsidiaries. As these enterprises develop, we will determine whether to maintain full ownership, introduce investors via either private or public financing, or seek strategic options to partner or divest the businesses.

In the future, our ownership stake in AquaBounty may drop below 50 percent, which may result in our deconsolidating AquaBounty.
Joint ventures
The following represent our significant JVs as of December 31, 2018:
Intrexon Energy Partners
In March 2014, we and certain investors, or the IEP Investors, including affiliates of Third Security, LLC, or Third Security, a related party, entered into a Limited Liability Company Agreement that governs the affairs and conduct of business of Intrexon Energy Partners, LLC, or Intrexon Energy Partners, a JV formed to optimize and scale-up our MBP technology for the production of certain fuels and lubricants. We also entered into an ECC with Intrexon Energy Partners providing exclusive rights to our technology for the use in bioconversion, as a result of which we received a technology access fee of $25 million while retaining a 50 percent membership interest in Intrexon Energy Partners. The IEP Investors made initial capital contributions, totaling $25 million in the aggregate, in exchange for pro rata membership interests in Intrexon Energy Partners totaling 50 percent. We committed to make additional capital contributions of up to $25 million, and the IEP Investors, as a group and pro rata in accordance with their respective membership interests in Intrexon Energy Partners, have committed to make additional capital contributions of up to $25 million, at the request of the Intrexon Energy Partners' board of managers, or the Intrexon Energy Partners Board, and subject to certain limitations. Intrexon Energy Partners is governed by the Intrexon Energy Partners Board, which has five members. Two members of the Intrexon Energy Partners Board are designated by us and three members are designated by a majority of the IEP Investors. We and the IEP Investors have the right, but not the obligation, to make additional capital contributions above the initial limits when and if solicited by the Intrexon Energy Partners Board.

In December 2015, we and certain investors, or the IEPII Investors, entered into a Limited Liability Company Agreement that governs the affairs and conduct of business of Intrexon Energy Partners II, LLC, or Intrexon Energy Partners II, a JV formed to utilize our MBP technology for the production of 1,4-butanediol, an industrial chemical intermediate used to manufacture spandex, polyurethane, plastics, and polyester. We also entered into an ECC with Intrexon Energy Partners II providing exclusive rights to our technology for use in the field, as a result of which we received a technology access fee of $18 million while retaining a 50 percent membership interest in Intrexon Energy Partners II. The IEPII Investors made initial capital 
12

contributions, totaling $18 million in the aggregate, in exchange for pro rata membership interests in Intrexon Energy Partners II totaling 50 percent. In December 2015, the owners of Intrexon Energy Partners II made a capital contribution of $4 million, half of which was paid by us. We committed to make additional capital contributions of up to $10 million, and the IEPII Investors, as a group and pro rata in accordance with their respective membership interests in Intrexon Energy Partners II, have committed to make additional capital contributions of up to $10 million, at the request of the Intrexon Energy Partners II's board of managers, or the Intrexon Energy Partners II Board, and subject to certain limitations. Intrexon Energy Partners II is governed by the Intrexon Energy Partners II Board, which has five members.

We and the IEPII Investors have the right, but not the obligation, to make additional capital contributions above the initial limits when and if solicited by the Intrexon Energy Partners II Board.
EnviroFlight
In February 2016, we entered into a series of transactions involving EnviroFlight, LLC, or Old EnviroFlight, Darling Ingredients Inc., or Darling, and a newly formed venture between us and Darling, or New EnviroFlight. This series of integrated transactions resulted in us acquiring substantially all of the assets of Old EnviroFlight and contemporaneously contributing all of these assets, with the exception of certain developed technology, and $3 million of cash to New EnviroFlight in exchange for a non-controlling, 50 percent membership interest in New EnviroFlight. Our contributions to New EnviroFlight included an exclusive license to the developed technology that was retained by us. Darling received the remaining 50 percent membership interest in New EnviroFlight as consideration for terminating rights previously held in the developed technology with Old EnviroFlight. New EnviroFlight was formed to generate high nutrition, low environmental impact animal and fish feed, as well as fertilizer products, from black soldier fly larvae.
See "Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 5" appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report for a discussion of significant collaborations between us and our JVs.
Our ECCs
Although our strategy has evolved away from a focus primarily on ECCs, we remain party to a number of such collaborations, and we may, in the future, elect to enter into additional ECCs or expand one or more of our existing ECCs. An ECC is an agreement with a collaborator to develop products based on our technologies in one or more specifically defined fields. These fields may be narrowly defined (representing, for example, a specific therapeutic approach for a single indication) or may be broad (representing, for example, an entire class of related products). In each case, we and the collaborator precisely define the field based on factors such as the expertise of the collaborator, the relative markets for the prospective products, the collaborator's resources available to commit to the ECC and our expectations as to other prospective ECCs in related areas. Regardless of the size of the field, under each ECC we grant the collaborator exclusive rights to our services and certain of our technologies to commercialize products within the field.
We may realize four general categories of revenue under our ECCs: (i) technology access fees upon signing; (ii) reimbursements of costs incurred by us for our research and development and/or manufacturing efforts related to specific applications provided for in the collaboration; (iii) milestone payments upon the achievement of specified development, regulatory and commercial activities; and (iv) royalties on sales of products arising from the collaboration. We may receive equity in lieu of cash for technology access fees and milestones and also may participate in capital raises to allow earlier-stage collaborators to focus their resources on product development.
Generally, each of our ECCs is designed to continue in perpetuity unless terminated. Each of our collaborators, however, retains the right to terminate the ECC for any reason by providing us written notice a certain period of time prior to such termination, generally ninety days. The ECC is also terminable by either party upon the other party's breach of material provisions of the ECC. The failure of our collaborator to exercise diligent efforts to develop products within the field of the ECC constitutes such a breach.
In the event one of our ECCs terminates, we are entitled to immediately pursue a collaboration with a different counterparty within the field of the terminated ECC. Moreover, technologies and product candidates in a relatively early stage of development revert to us, along with data, materials and the rights to applicable regulatory filings related to the reverted products, enabling us to develop those product candidates ourselves or incorporate them into a future collaboration. Product candidates that are at a more advanced stage of development, such as those already generating revenue or being considered for approval by an applicable regulatory body at the time of the ECC's termination are retained by the former collaborator. The collaborator has the right to commercialize such retained products although we are entitled to the royalties or other 
13

compensation to which we would be entitled as if the ECC were still in effect. Upon termination, we generally retain any technology access fees or other payments to which we are entitled through the date of termination.
In our ECCs, we retain rights to our existing intellectual property and generally any intellectual property developed using, or otherwise incorporating, our technologies. In addition, we are generally responsible for controlling the prosecution and enforcement of this intellectual property with the exception of the enforcement of patents directed solely and specifically to products developed within the field of each ECC.
Each of our ECCs requires the collaborator to indemnify us for all liability related to products produced pursuant to the ECC and to obtain insurance coverage related to product liability.
See "Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 5" appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report for a discussion of the key financial terms of our significant ECCs.
Mergers, acquisitions, and technology in-licensing
We may augment our suite of proprietary technologies through mergers or acquisitions of technologies, which would then become available to new or existing ventures, including operating subsidiaries, JVs, and collaborations. Among other things, we may pursue technologies that we believe will be generally complementary to our existing technologies and also meet our desired return on investment and other economic criteria. In certain cases, such technologies may already be applied in the production of products or services and in these cases we may seek to expand the breadth or efficacy of such products or services through the use of our technologies. See "Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 3" appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report for further discussion of mergers, acquisitions or significant technology in-licensing activities.
Competition
We believe that we are a leader in synthetic biology. We do not believe that we have any direct competitors who provide similar technologies that fully enable the commercialization of products developed using synthetic biology across a broad spectrum of biologically-based industries. As a result, we believe our competition is more indirect and general in nature and falls into three broad categories:

• | Synthetic biology service providers. There are companies that have competing technologies for individual pieces of our suite of complementary technologies. For example, there are companies that can synthesize DNA, and there are companies that can develop monoclonal antibodies. One portion of our proprietary technology related to DNA synthesis and assembly includes the ability to de novo synthesize DNA. We believe the following companies engage in the manufacture of DNA componentry: ATUM, Inc.; Blue Heron Biotech, LLC (a subsidiary of OriGene); Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. (IDT); GenScript USA, Inc.; Life Technologies Corporation, now part of Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.; and Twist Bioscience Corporation.


• | Industrial companies who may develop their own approach to synthetic biology. Rather than becoming a collaborator with us, potential collaborators may decide to invest time and capital to internally develop their own synthetic biology capabilities. For example, large biopharmaceutical companies, energy companies, and ag-bio companies may pursue a proprietary synthetic biology strategy.


• | Industrial companies who may develop competing products using other technologies. Products enabled by our synthetic biology will face competition in the market, including from products that have been developed using other industrial technologies. For example, large biopharmaceutical companies pursue other technologies for drug development, and large ag-bio companies pursue other technologies for the development of genetically modified crops. The rapidly evolving market for developing genetically engineered, or GE, T-cells in particular is characterized by intense competition and rapid innovation. Genetically engineering T-cells faces significant competition in the chimeric antigen receptor, or CAR, technology space from multiple companies and their collaborators, such as Novartis/University of Pennsylvania, Bluebird Bio/Celgene/Juno Therapeutics, Gilead/Kite Pharma, Cellectis, Allogene Therapeutics, Adaptimmune/GSK, Autolus Therapeutics, and Bellicum Pharmaceuticals. We face competition from non-cell based treatments offered by other companies such as Amgen, AstraZeneca, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Incyte, Merck, and Roche.

Intellectual property
As we advance technologies across multiple platforms and synthetic biology areas, correspondingly, we apply a multilayered approach for protecting intellectual property relating to the inventions we have developed internally as well as those we have acquired from third parties, such as by assignment or by in-license. We seek patent protection in the United States and in other countries for our inventions and discoveries, and we develop and protect our key know-how and trade secrets relating to our platform technologies as well as to the products we are developing with our subsidiaries, JVs, and collaborations.
We seek patent protection for our platform technologies, including but not limited to our (i) switch technology; (ii) activator ligands for our switch technology; (iii) portfolio around various genetic componentry such as vectors, cells and organisms containing these genetic componentry; and (iv) cell identification and selection platform. In addition, we seek patents covering specific collaborator's products.
Through the use of our various platform technologies we seek to design and build proprietary compounds, vectors, methods and processes across a variety of end markets. In particular, we focus our intellectual property on synthetic biology technologies that provide platforms for the design and creation of cells, vectors and components for our subsidiaries, JVs, and collaborations. In addition, we may pursue intermediate and product-specific patents associated with our subsidiaries', JVs', and collaborations' lead programs.
Our success depends, in part, upon our ability to obtain patents and maintain adequate protection for our intellectual property relating to our technologies and products and potential products. We have adopted a strategy of seeking patent protection in the United States and in other jurisdictions globally as we deem appropriate under the circumstances, with respect to certain of the technologies used in or relating to our products and processes. For instance, where we believe appropriate, we have also filed counterpart patents and patent applications in other jurisdictions, including Australia, Argentina, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Israel, Japan, Korea, Mexico, New Zealand, Philippines, Russia, Singapore, South Africa and Taiwan. In the future we may file in these or additional jurisdictions as deemed appropriate for the protection of our technologies.
As of December 31, 2018, we owned at least 55 issued United States patents and 55 pending United States patent applications relating to certain aspects of our technologies, and we have pursued counterpart patents and patent applications in other jurisdictions around the world, as we have deemed appropriate. We continue to actively develop our portfolio through the filing of new patent applications, provisional and continuations or divisionals relating to our technologies, methods and products as we and our collaborators deem appropriate.
We have strategic positioning with respect to our key technologies including our owned patent portfolios directed to: our switch technology covering aspects of our switches and gene modulation systems, with a last to expire patent currently in 2032; our portfolio around various genetic componentry, such as vectors, cells and organisms containing these genetic componentry, and their use, with a last to expire patent in 2034; our activator ligand technology covering aspects of our activator ligands and their use, with a last to expire patent in 2034; and our cell identification and selection technology covering aspects of our cell identification and selection platform, including our cell purification, isolation, characterization and manipulation technologies, with a last to expire patent in 2031. Although we cannot be assured that these patents may not be subject to challenge in the future, as of this filing, there are currently no material contested proceedings and/or third party claims with respect to any of these patent portfolios.
Additionally, we complement our intellectual property portfolio with exclusive and non-exclusive patent licenses and options for licenses to third-party technologies.
A principal component of our strategy is maximizing the value of our ECCs through our intellectual property that covers our technologies, which is accentuated by intermediate and program-specific intellectual property protections. In addition to owned and in-licensed patents, we solidify our intellectual property protection through a combination of trade secrets, know-how, confidentiality, nondisclosure and other contractual provisions, and security measures to protect our confidential and proprietary information related to each platform and collaborator program. We regularly assess and review the risks and benefits of protecting our developments through each aspect of intellectual property available to us.
Because we rely on trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological advances to protect various aspects of our core technology, we require our employees, consultants and scientific collaborators to execute confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with us to maintain the confidentiality of our trade secrets and proprietary information. Our confidentiality agreements generally provide that the employee, consultant or scientific collaborator will not disclose our confidential information to third parties. These agreements also provide that inventions conceived by the employee, consultant 
15

or scientific collaborator in the course of working for us will be our exclusive property. Additionally, our employees agree to take certain steps to facilitate our assertion of ownership over such intellectual property. These measures may not adequately protect our trade secrets or other proprietary information. If they do not adequately protect our rights, third parties could use our technologies, and we could lose any competitive advantage we may have. In addition, others may independently develop similar proprietary information or techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets, which could impair any competitive advantage we may have.
Regulatory environment
Regulations affecting Intrexon
With our diverse portfolio of proprietary and complementary technologies cutting across human health, animal health, public health and energy sectors, we are subject to significant and diverse regulations governing research, operations and product approval. Regulatory compliance is critical to our ability to operate, our management of potential liabilities and ultimately, our freedom to sell our products. Moreover, and as discussed below and in "Risk factors - Risks associated with our business strategy," the products produced by us and our collaborators enabled by our technology platforms are subject to extensive regulation. While we and our subsidiaries maintain regulatory compliance practices, we rely on our collaborators' compliance with laws and regulations applicable to the products they produce. We do not independently monitor whether our collaborators comply with applicable laws and regulations. Please see the risk factor entitled "Markets in which we, our JVs, and collaborators are developing products using our technologies are subject to extensive regulation, and we rely on our JVs and collaborators to comply with all applicable laws and regulations."
Environmental regulations affecting Intrexon, our JVs and our collaborators
We, as well as our JVs and collaborators, are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws, rules and regulations, including those relating to the discharge of materials into the air, water and ground, the generation, storage, handling, use, transportation and disposal of hazardous materials and the health and safety of employees with respect to laboratory activities required for the development of products and technologies. These laws and regulations require us and our JVs and collaborators to obtain environmental permits and comply with numerous environmental restrictions. These laws and regulations also may require expensive pollution control equipment or operational changes to limit actual or potential impacts to the environment.
Our laboratory activities and those of our JVs and collaborators inherently involve the use of potentially hazardous materials, which are subject to health, safety and environmental regulations. We design our infrastructure, procedures and equipment to meet our obligations under these regulations. We perform recurring internal and third-party audits and provide employees ongoing training and support, as required. All of our employees must comply with safety instructions and procedures, which are codified in our employment policies. Federal and state laws and regulations impose requirements on the production, importation, use and disposal of chemicals and genetically-modified microorganisms, or GMMs, which impact us and our JVs and collaborators. Our, our JVs' and our collaborators' processes may contain GE organisms which, when used in industrial processes, are considered new chemicals under the Toxic Substances Control Act, or TSCA, program of the United States Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA. These laws and regulations would require us, our JVs and collaborators to obtain and comply with the EPA's Microbial Commercial Activity Notice process to operate. In the European Union, we and our JVs and collaborators may be subject to a chemical regulatory program known as REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemical Substances). Under REACH, companies are required to register their products with the European Commission, and the registration process could result in significant costs or delay the manufacture or sale of products in the European Union.
Regulations affecting us and our collaborators
Human therapeutics regulation
Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, including any manufacturing changes, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, import and export of pharmaceutical products such as those being developed by our collaborators. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes, regulations, and requirements imposed by regulatory agencies, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
In the United States, pharmaceuticals must receive approval from the FDA before being marketed. The FDA approves drug products other than biological products through its authority under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and 
16

implementing regulations. The FDA licenses biological drug products, or biologics, through its authority under the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, and implementing regulations. The development processes for obtaining FDA approval for a non-biological drug product under the FDCA and for biologic licensure under the PHSA are generally similar, but have product-related differences reflected in regulations and in FDA guidance documents.
United States pharmaceutical development process
The process required by the FDA before a pharmaceutical product candidate may be marketed generally involves the following:

• | completion of preclinical laboratory tests and in vivo studies in accordance with the FDA's current Good Laboratory Practice regulations and standards, and other applicable requirements;


• | submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug application, or IND, for human clinical testing, which must become effective before human clinical trials commence;


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to the FDA's Good Clinical Practices, or GCP, regulations, and any additional requirements for the protection of human research subjects and their health information, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed product candidate for each intended use;


• | preparation and submission to the FDA of an application for marketing approval that includes substantial evidence of safety, purity and potency for a biologic, or of safety and efficacy for a non-biologic drug, including from results of nonclinical testing and clinical trials;


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the product candidate is produced to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the product candidate's identity, safety, strength, quality, potency and purity;


• | potential FDA inspection of the nonclinical and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the application; and


• | FDA review and approval of the application.

Human clinical trials under an IND
Clinical trials involve administering the product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators. Clinical trials must be conducted and monitored in accordance with the FDA's regulations. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an Institutional Review Board, or IRB, at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants and considers, among other things, whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. Clinical trials involving recombinant DNA at institutions that receive any funding from the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, also must be reviewed by an institutional biosafety committee, an institutional committee that reviews and oversees basic and clinical research that utilizes recombinant DNA at that institution.
Human clinical trials typically are conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:

• | Phase 1. The product candidate is introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain early understanding of its effectiveness. For some product candidates for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product candidate may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients with the targeted disease.


• | Phase 2. The product candidate is administered and evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to evaluate preliminary efficacy evidence for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule.


• | Phase 3. The product candidate is administered to an expanded patient population, often at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to generate sufficient data to evaluate the safety and

17

efficacy of the non-biologic drug, or the safety, purity, and potency of the biologic. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product candidate and provide an adequate basis for product labeling.
Post-approval clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted, or may be required to be conducted, after initial approval to further assess the risk/benefit profile of the product and to gain additional experience from treatment of patients in the intended indication, including for long-term safety follow-up.
Additional regulation for gene therapy clinical trials
Additional standards apply to clinical trials involving gene therapy. The FDA has issued guidance documents regarding gene therapies, which relate to, among other things: preclinical assessments; chemistry, manufacturing and controls, or CMC, information that should be included in an IND application; the proper design of tests to measure product potency in support of an application; and measures to observe delayed adverse effects in subjects exposed to investigational gene therapies when the risk of such effects is high.
Compliance with cGMP requirements
Drug and biologics manufacturers must comply with applicable cGMP regulations. Manufacturers and others involved in the manufacture and distribution of such products also must register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies. Both domestic and foreign manufacturing establishments must register and provide additional information to the FDA upon their initial participation in the manufacturing of drugs. Establishments may be subject to periodic, unannounced inspections by the FDA and other government authorities to ensure compliance with cGMP requirements and other laws. Discovery of problems may result in a government entity placing restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved product, and may extend to requiring withdrawal of the product from the market.
United States review and approval processes
The results of the preclinical tests and clinical trials, together with detailed information relating to the product's CMC and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an application requesting approval to market the product for one or more uses, or indications. For gene therapies, selecting patients with applicable genetic defects is often a necessary condition to effective treatment and may require diagnostic devices that the FDA has cleared or approved prior to or contemporaneously with approval of the gene therapy.
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, marketing applications generally must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the biologic product candidate for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product candidate is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any product candidate for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted.
On the basis of the marketing application and accompanying information, including the results of the inspection of the manufacturing facilities, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information for the FDA to reconsider the application. If those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA's satisfaction in a resubmission of the application, the FDA may issue an approval letter.
If a product candidate receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. The FDA may impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing or dispensing in the form of a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, or otherwise limit the scope of any approval. In addition, the FDA may require post-marketing clinical trials designed to further assess a non-biologic drug's safety and effectiveness, or a biologic's safety, purity, and potency, and testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized.
Orphan Drug Designation in the United States
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs and biological products intended to treat a "rare disease or condition," which generally is a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a marketing application or supplement seeking approval 
18

for the orphan indication. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the common identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are publicly disclosed by the FDA.
Orphan drug designation does not—by itself—convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. If a product that has an orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for that drug or biologic for the indication for which it has been designated, the product is entitled to an orphan exclusivity period in which the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug or biologic for the same indication for seven years.
Exceptions to the seven-year exclusivity period may apply in limited circumstances, such as where the sponsor of a different version of the product is able to demonstrate that its product is clinically superior to the approved orphan drug product. This exclusivity does not prevent a competitor from obtaining approval to market a different product that treats the same disease or condition, or the same product to treat a different disease or condition. The FDA can revoke a product's orphan drug exclusivity under certain circumstances, including when the holder of the approved orphan drug application is unable to assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the drug to meet patient needs. Orphan exclusivity operates independently from other regulatory exclusivities and other protections against generic or biosimilar competition.
A sponsor of a product application that has received an orphan drug designation is also granted tax incentives for clinical research undertaken to support the application. In addition, the FDA will typically coordinate with the sponsor on research study design for an orphan drug and may exercise its discretion to grant marketing approval on the basis of more limited product safety and efficacy data than would ordinarily be required, based on the limited size of the applicable patient population.
Fast Track Designation
The FDA has a number of expedited review programs for drugs that are intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening condition. As one example, under the agency's Fast Track program, the sponsor of a new drug candidate may request the FDA to designate the product for a specific indication as a Fast Track product concurrent with or after the filing of the IND for the product candidate. The FDA must determine if the product candidate qualifies for Fast Track designation within 60 days after receipt of the sponsor's request.
In addition to other benefits, such as the ability to have more frequent interactions with the FDA, the agency may initiate review of sections of a Fast Track product's marketing application before the application is complete. This rolling review is available if the applicant provides and the FDA approves a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the applicant pays applicable user fees. However, the FDA's review period for a Fast Track application does not begin until the last section of the marketing application is submitted. In addition, the Fast Track designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the agency believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process.
Post-approval requirements
Rigorous and extensive FDA regulation of drugs and biologics continues after approval, including requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, adverse experiences with the product, cGMP, and advertising and promotion. Changes to the manufacturing process or facility often require prior FDA approval before being implemented and other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval. Failure to comply with the applicable requirements may result in administrative, judicial, civil or criminal actions and adverse publicity. These include refusal to approve pending applications or supplemental applications, withdrawal of approval, clinical hold, suspension or termination of clinical trial, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines or other monetary penalties, refusals of government contracts, mandated corrective advertising or communications with healthcare providers, debarment, restitution, disgorgement of profits or other civil or criminal penalties.
Regulatory Exclusivity and Biosimilar Competition in the United States
In 2010, the federal Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act, or BPCIA, was enacted, creating a statutory pathway for licensure, or approval, of biological products that are biosimilar to, and possibly interchangeable with, reference biological products licensed under the Public Health Service Act.
Under the BPCIA, innovator manufacturers of original biological products are granted 12 years of exclusive use after first licensure before biosimilar versions of such products can be licensed for marketing in the United States. This means that the FDA may not approve an application for a biosimilar product that references data in an innovator's Biologics License 
19

Application, or BLA, until 12 years after the date of approval of the reference biological product, with a potential six-month extension of exclusivity if certain pediatric studies are conducted and the results are reported to the FDA. A biosimilar application may be submitted four years after the date of licensure of the reference biological product, but the FDA cannot approve the application until the full exclusivity period has expired. This 12-year exclusivity period operates independently from other protections that may apply to biosimilar competitors, including patents that are held for those products. Additionally, the BPCIA establishes procedures by which the biosimilar applicant must provide information about its application and product to the reference product sponsor, and by which information about potentially relevant patents is shared and litigation over patents may proceed in advance of approval. The BPCIA also provides a period of exclusivity for the first biosimilar to be determined by the FDA to be interchangeable with the reference product.
Under the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, which was subsequently made applicable to biological products by the BPCIA, the FDA may also issue a Written Request asking a sponsor to conduct pediatric studies related to a particular active moiety; if the sponsor agrees and meets certain requirements, the sponsor may be eligible to receive an additional six months of marketing exclusivity for its drug product containing such active moiety.
Other regulatory exclusivity may be granted to drugs, including, but not limited to, three-year and five-year exclusivity granted to non-biologic drugs under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, also referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments.
Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of product candidates, some of a sponsor's United States patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product's approval date. The United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. Only one patent applicable to an approved biologic product is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent.
Foreign regulation of human therapeutics
In addition to regulations in the United States, our subsidiaries, such as Precigen and ActoBio, and our collaborators that are focused on the development of human therapeutic products will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of the products enabled by our technologies. Whether or not the developer obtains FDA approval for a product, they must obtain approval by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries or economic areas, such as the European Union, before they may commence clinical trials or market products in those countries or areas. The approval process and requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from place to place, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval.
Regulation of animal based technologies
The development, movement and commercialization of animal based products (genetically modified animals) is governed globally by either technology- or product-based laws and regulations specific to each country. In the majority of our target markets, the relevant regulatory pathway for animal based products is distinct from those governing human pharmaceutical products although the risk assessment parameters and agencies with jurisdiction may be consistent. In each case, product evaluation and approval requires the development of data to demonstrate human/animal safety, environmental safety and effectiveness. In the United States, the FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine regulates certain GE animals as 'animal drugs' as well as animal feed products. The United States Department of Agriculture, or USDA, regulates veterinary vaccines and other biologics, and the EPA regulates certain animals, such as genetically modified insects with pesticidal properties, as biopesticides. Regulatory oversight and jurisdiction within the United States is based on either the nature of the product and/or product end use. For example, the FDA has historically regulated genetically modified animals as animal drugs on the basis that the rDNA construct in a GE animal is an article intended to affect the structure or function of the body of the animal and, in some cases, intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease in the animal. However, the FDA recently clarified that certain genetically modified animals will not be regulated as animal drugs based on their ultimate end use. Specifically, products intended to reduce the population of mosquitoes (for example, by killing them at some point in their life cycle, or by interfering with their reproduction or development) are regulated as pesticides by EPA.
Specific statutes and regulations also define standards and data requirements that we and our collaborators must satisfy. While regulatory oversight may vary globally, animal based products generally must undergo regulatory review and approval prior to their movement and commercial introduction internationally. These regulations also require the development and submission of 
20

data to demonstrate product efficacy as well as evaluate potential risk to human/animal health and the environment. For drugs administered to animals, extensive regulatory requirements exist often including evaluation by the same (or similar) authorities as human pharmaceuticals. For example, a new animal drug is deemed "unsafe" and, therefore, may not be introduced into commerce in the United States unless: the FDA has approved a new animal drug application, or NADA, for its intended use; the drug is only for investigational use and conforms to specified exemptions for such use under an Investigational New Animal Drug, or INAD, exemption; or the drug conforms to certain FDA regulations. The NADA approval process is in many ways similar to the approval process for human drugs and requires a demonstration of the drug's safety and efficacy for its proposed conditions of use. Actions on INADs may require preparation of an environmental assessment, or EA, and a finding of no significant impact, or FONSI. Through the preparation of an EA/FONSI or an Environmental Impact Statement, the FDA will examine the potential for environmental impacts, including the potential for inadvertent release or escape of the animal with an intentionally altered genome and/or its products into the environment, and whether certain measures may mitigate any potential significant impacts that would adversely affect the human environment.
The complex, multi-faceted regulation of genetically modified animals as "animal drugs" is exemplified by the regulatory approval of AquaBounty's AAS, the first genetically modified animal ever approved by the FDA. For such bioengineered animals, the United States and Canada have established regulatory processes led by the FDA and Health Canada/Canadian Food Inspection Agency, or CFIA, respectively, while other countries, such as Brazil and Argentina among others, are using existing authorities for the evaluation of genetically modified organisms for the advancement and regulation of novel genetically modified animal technologies. In December 2012, the FDA published an EA for AAS along with its FONSI in the Federal Register, confirming that an approval of the pending NADA would not have an adverse effect on the environment and opened up a 60 day period for public comment. In February 2013, the FDA extended the period for public comment by an additional 60 days, which expired in April 2013. Prior to the publication of the EA and FONSI, in September 2010, the FDA held a public meeting of its Veterinary Medicine Advisory Committee to review its findings regarding AAS. The conclusion of its panel of experts was that AAS is indistinguishable from other farmed Atlantic salmon, is safe to eat and does not pose a threat to the environment under its conditions of use. Subsequently, the FDA initiated an EA in compliance with its obligations under the National Environment Policy Act, or NEPA, which requires that all federal agencies consider the possible environmental impacts of any action that they authorize. Subsequently, in November 2015, the FDA approved the NADA for the production, sale and consumption of AAS. AquaBounty is subject to on-going post approval responsibilities as detailed in the FDA letter of approval and summarized in the EA dated in November 2015. In the event that AquaBounty seeks to modify or expand its production sites and methods, such would require further regulatory approvals.
In May 2016, Health Canada concluded its review of AAS and approved it for commercial sale in Canada, and the Animal Feed Division of the Animal Health Directorate of CFIA authorized AAS for use in livestock feeds.
In April 2016, the FDA issued Import Alert 99-40 in response to a law passed by Congress, which states that the FDA may not allow the introduction or delivery for introduction into interstate commerce any food that contains GE salmon, until final labeling guidelines for informing consumers of such content are published. In December 2017, the FDA approved a supplementary NADA for an additional grow out facility for AAS located in Albany, Indiana. However, the FDA considers salmon eggs to meet the definition of food and its import alert to mean that AquaBounty cannot import AAS, including its eggs or any food from the salmon, into the United States.
Global regulations continue to evolve for gene-edited animal technologies where precise genetic additions or deletions are introduced into an animal's genome. On January 10, 2017, the FDA released a draft Revised Guidance for Industry which, when finalized, will represent the FDA's current thinking on the regulation of intentionally altered genomic DNA in animals. Although the USDA recently issued a statement indicating that in large part it would not regulate gene-edited plants as GMO crops, the FDA's guidance reiterates the FDA's historic position that it maintains oversight of gene-edited animals as "animal drugs". However, there is a growing global trend to significantly reduce the regulatory burden for gene-edited animals in other countries, such as Argentina and Brazil. For example, Argentina's National Advisory Commission on Agricultural Biotechnology has implemented a regulatory process where technology providers are able to submit data to demonstrate that no new genetic material is introduced into the animal's genome. If the submission is successful, the product will not be subject to regulations governing genetically modified products in Argentina. Brazil has recently instituted a similar process. While such a process may significantly expedite time to market and may reduce developmental costs, we recognize the importance of also working with key stakeholders and the public to create product awareness and build public acceptance prior to commercialization.
Regulation of self-limiting insect technologies
Oxitec has developed a GE self-limiting line of the mosquito Aedes aegypti, OX513A, as well as a new second generation mosquito, OX5034. Moreover, Oxitec has developed other self-limiting insects to suppress crop pests. While the GE mosquito 
21

was historically subject to regulatory review by the FDA as a new animal drug, jurisdiction was shifted to the EPA in October 2017. Under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, or FIFRA, the EPA is charged with protecting human health and the environment by ensuring that registered pesticides do not cause unreasonable adverse effects to man or the environment. FIFRA's definition of "pesticide" includes "any substance or mixture of substances intended for preventing, destroying, repelling, or mitigating any pest". Prior to this shift, the FDA published in August 2016 a final EA and FONSI regarding impacts on human health, animal health and the environment of the OX513A GE mosquito based on review of information and evidence related to an investigational trial in Key Haven, Florida. Following the transfer of jurisdiction to the EPA, Oxitec submitted regulatory dossiers to the EPA for the release of the OX513A GE mosquito in Florida and other states. Oxitec is now seeking approval for trial releases of its OX5034 mosquito. Oxitec's OX513A and OX5034 GE mosquitos have also been approved by Brazil's National Biosafety Committee, or CTNBio, for community-wide releases. Additionally, open field trials of Oxitec's mosquitoes have been conducted in the Cayman Islands, Panama, and Malaysia under relevant permits or approvals. Further approvals will be required for commercial production and use.
Self-limiting GE insects used to control crop pests—instead of disease carrying vectors—are regulated by the USDA. Under the Plant Protection Act, the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, or APHIS, has broad authority to regulate plant pests to protect crops and other plants. Therefore, USDA regulates organisms and products that are known or suspected to be plant pests or that pose a plant pest risk, including those that have been genetically modified. While Oxitec's GE self-limiting insects are designed to suppress hard-to-control or resistant plant pests, they are still currently subject to the USDA's jurisdiction. When an applicant has developed sufficient data to demonstrate that the organism no longer poses a plant pest risk, the applicant can petition APHIS to "deregulate" the article, meaning the GE organism should no longer be considered a regulated article under APHIS regulations. In 2017, APHIS released a final EA and subsequent FONSI supporting a limited environmental release of Oxitec's GE diamondback moth. This conclusion was based on the finding that it would be unlikely for these insects to impact the physical, biological and human health environment. These self-limiting insects will also likely be subject to foreign agriculture GE regulations and authorizing bodies, such as CTNBio and the Ministry of Agriculture in Brazil as well as CONABIA in Argentina and the Office of the Gene Technology Regulator in Australia.
Regulation of agricultural technologies/plants and food products
The manufacturing, marketing and certain areas of research related to some of the potential food products developed by us and our subsidiaries and collaborators are subject to regulation by federal and state governmental authorities in the United States. As it relates to GE foods and/or plants, they are subject to regulation by the FDA, USDA, and EPA under the Coordinated Framework for the Regulation of Biotechnology. These technologies have been regulated under this framework for over two decades. Similar regulatory approval systems are in place globally as biotech crops have been planted in over 26 countries, including over 19 developing countries. Currently, our Arctic apple and Florian technologies are subject to these plant biotechnology regulations. As previously noted above for gene-edited animal technologies, global processes are evolving that we believe may streamline the review and assessment of these technologies. In a number of countries, including the United States, which has implemented an "Am I Regulated" process, specific gene-edited plant products will not be subject to GMO regulation if simple nucleotide changes were made and/or no new genetic material has been incorporated in the final product.
The Arctic apple, which is one of our commercial plant biotechnology products, has undergone significant regulatory review in recent years, and a few varieties have been successfully deregulated and authorized for sale in the United States. In February 2015, the USDA announced its decision to deregulate Okanagan's Golden Delicious apple variety and Granny Smith apple variety, or together the Arctic apples. In reaching its decision, the USDA conducted a final plant pest risk assessment concluding that Arctic apples are unlikely to pose a plant pest risk to agriculture and other plants in the United States. The USDA also completed an EA to comply with the NEPA and concluded that deregulation is not likely to have a significant impact on the human environment. Concurrent with the USDA, Okanagan also engaged in a voluntary food safety assessment consultation with the FDA regarding its Arctic apples. The FDA completed its assessment in March 2015. As part of bringing the assessment to closure, Okanagan was required to submit summaries of its safety and nutritional assessments for its Arctic apples. Based on the information provided by Okanagan and other information available to the agency, the FDA concluded the Arctic apple is not materially different in safety, nutrition, composition, or other relevant characteristics from food and feed from apples currently on the market, and the apples do not raise any issues that would require premarket review or approval by the FDA. In August 2016, the USDA announced its decision to extend a preliminary determination of nonregulated status to Okanagan's Arctic Fuji apple variety.
Comparable authorities to the federal and state governmental authorities in the United States are involved in the regulation of plant technology products in other countries, such as the European Food Safety Authority in Europe, CONABIA in Argentina, CNTBio in Brazil, and Health Canada in Canada. For example, in relation to Okanagan, Health Canada announced its decision in March 2015 that it has no objection to the food use of the Arctic apple in Canada. In reaching its decision, Health Canada conducted a comprehensive assessment of the Golden Delicious and Granny Smith varieties according to its Guidelines for the 
22

Safety Assessment of Novel Foods. These guidelines are consistent with internationally accepted principles for establishing the safety of foods with novel traits adopted by the Codex Alimentarius Commission. Following this assessment, it was determined that the changes made to the Arctic apple did not pose a greater risk to human health than apples currently available on the Canadian market. In addition, Health Canada also concluded that the Arctic apple would have no impact on allergies and that there are no differences in the nutritional value of the Arctic apple compared to other traditional apple varieties available for consumption.
Regulation of microbes and microbial products
The use of GMMs, such as our yeast and methanotroph strains, is subject to laws and regulations in many countries. In the United States, the EPA regulates the commercial use of many GMMs as well as potential products produced from GMMs. Various states within the United States could choose to regulate products made with GMMs as well. While the strain of genetically-modified yeast that we use, S. cerevisiae, is eligible for exemption from EPA review because it is generally recognized as safe, we must satisfy certain criteria to achieve this exemption, including, but not limited to, use of compliant containment structures and safety procedures. We expect to encounter GMM regulations in most if not all of the countries in that we may seek to make our products; however, the scope and nature of these regulations will likely vary from country to country. If we cannot meet the applicable requirements in countries in which we intend to produce our products using GMMs, then our business will be adversely affected. 
In addition to the use of the dried fermentation, biomass from the GMMs for animal feed is subject to approval as a new feed ingredient. In the United States, ingredients intended as components of animal feed must be either (i) described by an Association of American Feed Control Officials, or AAFCO, ingredient definition; (ii) generally recognized as safe, or GRAS, for the intended use; or (iii) approved food additives and listed in the Code of Federal Regulations, or CFR. The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act requires that any substance that is added to or is expected to become a component of animal food, either directly or indirectly, must be used in accordance with a food additive regulation unless it is GRAS for that intended use. The AAFCO Official Publication includes the list of approved food additives as well as the list of GRAS substances. In addition, many of the ingredients in the AAFCO Official Publication are not approved food additives and may not meet the criteria needed to be recognized as GRAS (21 CFR 570.30). Nevertheless, the FDA has accepted the listing of certain ingredients (e.g., those used as sources of nutrients, aroma, or taste) in the AAFCO Official Publication for their marketing in interstate commerce, provided there were no apparent safety concerns about the use or composition of the ingredient.
Regardless of the regulatory pathway, the following areas should be addressed: human food safety, target animal safety, environmental impact, utility (intended physical, nutritional or other technical effect), manufacturing chemistry, labeling, and proposed regulation. Based on preliminary evaluation, the feed derivative M. capsulatus biomass could potentially be commercialized following completion of the FDA's GRAS notification process. Under this process, the safety of M. capsulatus biomass is determined by a panel of experts, qualified by training and experience, to evaluate the feed ingredient, with a subsequent review and determination made by the FDA. If approved, the FDA then issues a "no objections" letter. However, if the 'killed' GM M. capsulatus is contained in the final feed product, additional data and information may be required to characterize the microbial ingredient, such as molecular characterization and potential pathogenicity. For use in Canada, the manufacture, sale and import of livestock feeds are regulated under the Feeds Act and Regulations administered by the CFIA. Under these regulations, all feeds must be safe to livestock, humans and the environment as determined by a premarket review.
Energy and chemical regulation
The environmental regulations discussed above also govern the development, manufacture and marketing of energy and chemical products. Chemical products produced by us and our collaborators may be subject to government regulations in our target markets. In the United States, the EPA administers the requirements of the TSCA, which regulates the commercial registration, distribution and use of many chemicals. Before an entity can manufacture or distribute significant volumes of a chemical, it needs to determine whether that chemical is listed in the TSCA inventory. If the substance is listed, then manufacture or distribution can commence immediately. If not, then in most cases a "Chemical Abstracts Service" number registration and pre-manufacture notice must be filed with the EPA, which has 90 days to review the filing. A similar requirement exists in Europe under the REACH regulation. Additional regulations may apply to specific subsets of chemicals such as, for example, fuel products that are subject to regulation by various government agencies including, in the United States, the EPA and the California Air Resources Board.
