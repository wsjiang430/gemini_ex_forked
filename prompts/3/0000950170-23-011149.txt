 Item 1. Business.
LM Funding America, Inc. (“we”, “our”, “LMFA”, or the “Company”) currently has two lines of business: our recently commenced cryptocurrency mining business and our historical specialty finance business.
 On September 15, 2021, we announced our plan to operate in the Bitcoin mining ecosystem, and we commenced Bitcoin mining operations in late September 2022. This business operation deploys our computing power to mine Bitcoin and validate transactions on the Bitcoin network. We believe that developments in Bitcoin mining have created an opportunity for us to deploy capital and conduct large-scale mining operations in the United States. We conduct this business through a wholly owned subsidiary, US Digital Mining and Hosting Co, LLC, a Florida limited liability company ("US Digital"), which we formed in 2021 to develop and operate our cryptocurrency mining business.
 With respect to our specialty finance business, the Company has historically engaged in the business of providing funding to nonprofit community associations primarily located in the state of Florida. We offer incorporated nonprofit community associations, which we refer to as “Associations,” a variety of financial products customized to each Association’s financial needs. Our original product offering consists of providing funding to Associations by purchasing their rights under delinquent accounts that are selected by the Associations arising from unpaid Association assessments. Historically, we provided funding against such delinquent accounts, which we refer to as “Accounts,” in exchange for a portion of the proceeds collected by the Associations from the account debtors on the Accounts. In addition to our original product offering, we also purchase Accounts on varying terms tailored to suit each Association’s financial needs, including under our New Neighbor Guaranty program.
Cryptocurrency Mining Business
Bitcoin was introduced in 2008 with the goal of serving as a digital means of exchanging and storing value. Bitcoin is a form of digital currency that depends upon a consensus-based network and a public ledger called a “blockchain”, which contains a record of every Bitcoin transaction ever processed. The Bitcoin network is the first decentralized peer-to-peer payment network, powered by users participating in the consensus protocol, with no central authority or middlemen, that has wide network participation. The authenticity of each Bitcoin transaction is protected through digital signatures that correspond with addresses of users that send and receive Bitcoin. Users have full control over remitting Bitcoin from their own sending addresses. All transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain are transparent, allowing those running the appropriate software to confirm the validity of each transaction. To be recorded on the blockchain, each Bitcoin transaction is validated through a proof-of-work consensus method, which entails solving complex mathematical problems to validate transactions and post them on the blockchain. This process is called mining. Miners are rewarded with Bitcoins, both in the form of newly-created Bitcoins and fees in Bitcoin, for successfully solving the mathematical problems and providing computing power to the network.
 Factors such as access to computer processing capacity, interconnectivity, electricity cost, environmental factors (such as cooling capacity) and location play important roles in mining. In Bitcoin mining, “hashrate” is a measure of the computing and processing power and speed by which a mining computer mines and processes transactions on the Bitcoin network. We expect to continue increasing our computing power through 2023 and beyond as we expand the number of active mining machines. A company’s computing power measured in Hashrate is generally considered to be one of the most important metrics for evaluating Bitcoin mining companies.
 We obtain Bitcoin as a result of our mining operations, and we sell Bitcoin from time to time, to support our operations and strategic growth. We plan to convert our Bitcoin to U.S. dollars. We may engage in regular trading of Bitcoin or engage in hedging activities related to our holding of Bitcoin. However, our decisions to hold or sell Bitcoin at any given time may be impacted by the Bitcoin market, which has been historically characterized by significant volatility. Currently, we do not use a formula or specific methodology to determine whether or when we will sell Bitcoin that we hold, or the number of Bitcoins we will sell. Rather, decisions to hold or sell Bitcoins are currently determined by management by monitoring the market in real time.
 Equipment Purchases
 During 2021, we committed to purchasing an aggregate of 5,046 Bitcoin S19J Pro Antminer cryptocurrency mining machines for an aggregate purchase price of $31.6 million (the “Mining Machines”) from Bitmain. This contract allowed for a reduction in purchase price if Bitcoin price declined prior to shipment. Due to the variable nature of the contract, we were credited an aggregate total of approximately $7.2 million toward the 40% purchase price that is normally paid upon the shipment of a batch. We received all of the Mining Machines purchased during 2021 from August 2022 through November 2022.
On August 31, 2022, the Company committed to purchasing an additional 400 Bitcoin Miner S19J Pro machines from Bitmain for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $1.3 million which were delivered in December 2022. The Company paid the full purchase price within 7 days of the date of the signing of the agreement.

Additionally, on September 20, 2022, the Company committed to purchasing 200 Bitcoin Miner S19 XP machines from Bitmain for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $1.3 million, which was fully paid in 2022. There were 204 S19 XP machines delivered in January 2023.
We purchased an additional 65 S19 XP machines on December 20, 2022 and another 125 S19 XP machines on January 15, 2023 from Bitmain for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $1.1 million. We used various Bitmain credits and coupons totaling approximately $0.6 million to pay for the 65 S19 XP machines that were ordered in December 2022, and in January 2023 we paid the remaining $0.5 million non-refundable payment relating to the 125 S19 XP machines in cash. All 190 XP machines are anticipated to be delivered in April 2023.
During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company paid approximately $12.7 million to Bitmain for deposits related to mining equipment and payments of $1.9 million were made to various shipping vendors for transportation and customs costs related to the equipment. Since the inception of our contracts with Bitmain, we have paid an aggregate of approximately $26.4 million to Bitmain and related vendors relating to the purchase of these machines through December 31, 2022, and paid an additional $0.5 million in January 2023 under the Bitmain contracts that was due as of December 31, 2022.
 As of March 27, 2023, we have approximately 3,700 machines with hashing capacity of approximately 0.37 EH/s. We have approximately 1,900 S19J Pro Antminer machines representing approximately 0.19 EH/s hashing power in storage awaiting placement at a hosting site.
 Hosting Contracts
 On September 5, 2022, the Company, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, US Digital, entered into a hosting agreement (the “Core Hosting Agreement”) with Core Scientific Inc. (“Core”) pursuant to which Core agreed to host the 1,200 of the Company's Bitcoin Miner S19J Pro machines at a secure location and provide power, maintenance and other services specified in the contract with a term of one year, with automatic renewals unless we or Core notifies the other in writing not less than ninety (90) calendar days before such renewal of its desire for the order not to renew unless terminated sooner pursuant to the terms of the Core Hosting Agreement. In October 2022, the Company entered into additional orders with Core under the Core Hosting Agreement to host an additional 1,778 machines. As required under the Core Hosting Agreement, the Company has paid approximately $2.2 million as of December 31, 2022 as a deposit. As of March 27, 2023, Core has energized 2,978 of our machines located at their sites with a hashing capacity of approximately 0.30 EH/s on a daily basis. In December 2022, Core filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas. Core's bankruptcy filing has not negatively impacted our mining ability at their sites as of March 27, 2023.
 On January 26, 2023, the Company entered into a hosting agreement (the “Phoenix Hosting Agreement”) with Phoenix Industries Inc. (“Phoenix”) pursuant to which Phoenix agreed to host 228 of the Company's Bitcoin Miner S19J Pro machines at a secure location and provide power, maintenance and other services specified in the contract with a term of two years. This Phoenix Hosting Agreement will renew automatically for an additional two years if we provide written notice to Phoenix of its desire of renewal at least sixty (60) days in advance of the conclusion of the initial term of two years, unless terminated sooner pursuant to the terms of the Phoenix Hosting Agreement. As required under the Phoenix Hosting Agreement, the Company paid approximately $36 thousand as a deposit in January 2023. These machines were energized in January 2023. As of March 27, 2023, Phoenix has energized 228 machines located at their sites with hashing capacity of approximately 0.02 EH/s on a daily basis.
 On March 9, 2023, the Company entered into a hosting agreement (the “Longbow Hosting Agreement”) with Longbow HostCo LLC. (“Longbow”) pursuant to which Longbow agreed to host 500 of the Company's Bitcoin Miner S19J Pro machines at a secure location and provide power, maintenance and other services specified in the contract with a term of two years. Upon written request from us at least ninety (90) days prior to the conclusion of the then current term and approval by Longbow, the term shall renew for successive one (1) year periods with a three percent (3%) increase as of the commencement of each renewal term  unless terminated sooner pursuant to the terms of the Longbow Hosting Agreement. As required under the Longbow Hosting Agreement, the Company paid approximately $157 thousand as a deposit in March 2023. These machines were energized in March 2023. As of March 27, 2023, Longbow has energized 500 of our machines located at their sites with hashing capacity of approximately 0.05 EH/s on a daily basis.
 On June 21, 2022, the Company entered into a Master Agreement, dated effective as of June 20, 2022, with Compute North LLC (“Compute North”) under which Compute North had agreed to host up to 4,200 of US Digital’s Bitcoin Miner S19J Pro machines and provide colocation, management and other services (the “Master Agreement”). The term of the Master Agreement was for 60 months, subject to earlier termination in specified circumstances. The Company paid a non-refundable co-location deposit of $1.3 million on June 21, 2022 under the Master Agreement. Compute North filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on September 22, 2022. We moved the 2,690 machines from Compute North into a storage facility during January and February 2023. Compute North had not energized any of our machines located at their site. We recorded an impairment charge of $1.0 million on our deposit in the fourth quarter of 2022 which is reported on our Consolidated Statements of Operations as Impairment loss on prepaid hosting deposits.
 In October 2021, we entered into a sale and purchase agreement (the “Uptime Purchase Agreement”) with Uptime Armory LLC (“Uptime”) pursuant to which US Digital agreed to purchase, and Uptime agreed to supply to US Digital, an aggregate of 18 modified

40-foot cargo containers (“POD5ive containers”) that would have been designed to hold and operate 280 S19 Pro Antminers manufactured by Bitmain. The purchase price of the POD5ive containers totaled $3.15 million, of which $2.4 million or 75% was paid in 2021 as a non-refundable down payment and the remaining 25% was paid after Uptime delivered a “notice of completion” of the equipment in 2022. However, no containers have been delivered as of December 31, 2022.
 On November 8, 2022, LMFA filed an action in Florida circuit court against Uptime Armory, LLC and Bit5ive, LLC in a case styled US Digital Mining and Hosting Co. LLC v. Uptime Amory, LLC and Bit5ive, LLC (Fla. 11thCir. Ct., November 8, 2022). In that action, we alleged breach of contract and violation of the Florida Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act and are seeking, among other things, damages of $3.15 million for non-delivery of the 18 POD5ive containers. The Defendants in this action filed a motion to compel confidential arbitration action. The court has now stayed the action in the Florida Circuit Court, and ordered the parties to confidential arbitration governed by the American Arbitration Association and the case is proceeding to arbitration. We recorded an impairment charge of $3.15 million on our mining machine deposit in the fourth quarter of 2022 and is reported on our Consolidated Statements of Operations as Impairment loss on prepaid mining machine deposits.
In October 2021, US Digital also entered into a hosting agreement with Uptime Hosting LLC (the “Hosting Agreement”) to host the Company’s 18 POD5ive containers at a secure location and provide power, maintenance and other services specified in the contract for 6 cents per kilowatt with a term of one year. Under the Hosting Agreement we paid a deposit of $0.8 million in 2021 and were required to pay an additional deposit for each container three months prior to delivery at the hosting site of $44 thousand and a final deposit for each container one month prior to arrival at the hosting site of $44 thousand. The deposits paid for hosting services under the Hosting Agreement are refundable. On June 29, 2022, the Company and Uptime Hosting LLC entered into a Release and Termination Agreement in which the Hosting Agreement was terminated and Uptime Hosting LLC agreed to pay the $0.8 million deposit. We recorded an impairment charge of $0.8 million on our prepaid hosting deposit in the fourth quarter of 2022.
 Specialty Finance Business
 In our specialty finance business, we purchase an Association’s right to receive a portion of the Association’s collected proceeds from owners that are not paying their assessments. After taking assignment of an Association’s right to receive a portion of the Association’s proceeds from the collection of delinquent assessments, we engage law firms to perform collection work on a deferred billing basis wherein the law firms receive payment upon collection from the account debtors or a predetermined contracted amount if payment from account debtors is less than legal fees and costs owed. Under this business model, we typically fund an amount equal to or less than the statutory minimum an Association could recover on a delinquent account for each Account, which we refer to as the “Super Lien Amount”. Upon collection of an Account, the law firm working on the Account, on behalf of the Association, generally distributes to us the funded amount, interest, and administrative late fees, with the law firm retaining legal fees and costs collected, and the Association retaining the balance of the collection. In connection with this line of business, we have developed proprietary software for servicing Accounts, which we believe enables law firms to service Accounts efficiently and profitably.
 Under our New Neighbor Guaranty program, an Association will generally assign substantially all of its outstanding indebtedness and accruals on its delinquent units to us in exchange for payment by us of monthly dues on each delinquent unit. This simultaneously eliminates a substantial portion of the Association’s balance sheet bad debts and assists the Association to meet its budget by receiving guaranteed monthly payments on its delinquent units and relieving the Association from paying legal fees and costs to collect its bad debts. We believe that the combined features of the program enhance the value of the underlying real estate in an Association and the value of an Association’s delinquent receivables.
Because we acquire and collect on the delinquent receivables of Associations, the Account debtors are third parties about whom we have little or no information. Therefore, we cannot predict when any given Account will be paid off or how much it will yield. In assessing the risk of purchasing Accounts, we review the property values of the underlying units, the governing documents of the relevant Association, and the total number of delinquent receivables held by the Association.
Markets, Geography and Major Customers
 Bitcoin is a global store and exchange of value used by people across the world as an asset and to conduct daily transactions. Mining Bitcoin supports the global Bitcoin blockchain and the millions of people that depend on it for economic security and other benefits. Strictly speaking, there is no customer market for mining Bitcoin but we consider our mining pool operators as customers because they compensate us for providing processing power to the mining pool (see Item 1A. Risk Factors- “Our reliance on a third-party mining pool service provider for our mining revenue payouts may adversely affect an investment in us.”). We lease hosting space for our mining equipment from other hosting and mining companies.
Our specialty finance business focused on Associations is focused entirely in the state of Florida.
 Working Capital Items
 The Bitcoin mining industry is highly competitive and dependent on specialized mining machines that have few manufacturers. Machine purchases require large down payments and miner deliveries often arrive many months after initial orders are placed. However, over the last 12 months, we have seen a significant improvement in the availability and pricing for Bitcoin mining

machines. The current market conditions have provided opportunities to purchase both new and used machines on the spot-market from other miners or retail-dealers of machines for better financial terms and delivery terms, but there can be no guarantee that such opportunities will continue on a long-term basis. Currently, we are purchasing mining machines direct from Bitmain.
In addition to the approximate 3,700 machines in operation as of March 27, 2023, the Company has approximately 1,900 S19J Pro Antminer machines in storage awaiting placement at a hosting site. We also expect to receive an additional 190 miners in the second quarter of 2023 which have been fully prepaid. The Company expects to enter into additional agreements to purchase more miners in the coming years. The majority of miners we operate and expect to operate once received are the latest generation of miners manufactured by Bitmain, including the S19J-Pro and S19 XP.
 Materials and Suppliers
 We engage in the operation of high efficiency Bitcoin mining machines. These specialized computers, often called mining rigs, have few manufacturers. All of the machines we purchased this year were manufactured by Bitmain, one of the preeminent manufacturers of Bitcoin mining rigs. It is headquartered in China and manufactures throughout Asia.
 Historically, we have been able to manage our supply chains effectively, but global supply chains continue to be constrained, and from time-to-time experience substantial increases in shipping costs and logistical delays as we make efforts to ensure timely delivery of equipment. There can be no certainty that we will not be affected in the future, and we believe that there is a significant risk that equipment supply chains will continue to be affected in 2023.
 While some macro-economic indicators available as of the date of this filing suggest that inflation may be slowing, inflationary pressures impact virtually all aspects of our materials and suppliers, including power prices, and are likely to impact our fiscal year 2023.
 As indicated above, bankruptcies of hosting companies may pose a risk to our ability to mine Bitcoin. We do not have any business relationships with some of the notable crypto companies that have declared bankruptcy such as Three Arrow Capital, FTX, Genesis Global Holdco, Genesis Asia Pacific, BlockFi, Voyager Digital and Celsius.
 Environmental Issues
 No significant pollution or other types of hazardous emission result from the Company’s direct operations and it is not anticipated that our operations will be materially affected by federal, state or local provisions concerning environmental controls. Our costs of complying with environmental, health and safety requirements have not been material.
There are increasing concerns over the large energy usage of Bitcoin mining and its effects on the environment. Many media reports focus exclusively on the energy requirements of Bitcoin mining and cite it as an environmental concern. However, we do not believe that existing or pending climate change legislation, regulation, or international treaties or accords are reasonably likely to have a material effect in the foreseeable future on our business or markets that we serve, nor on our results of operations, capital expenditures or financial position. We continue to monitor emerging developments in this area.
Competition
 Bitcoin mining is a global activity. During fiscal year 2021, a majority of Bitcoin mining occurred in China. After China banned Bitcoin mining in May 2021, the center of mining moved to North America. Although Bitcoin mining by its nature is not a directly competitive business, all miners compete for Bitcoin rewards; based on this, we define competitors as other Bitcoin miners. Our competitors include large, publicly-listed mining companies, large private mining companies, and, in some cases, independent, individual miners who pool resources. We believe our principal competitive advantages include our energy background, a combination of owned, operated, and co-located miners and facilities, our strategic use of the Bitcoin we mine to fund operations growth, and our commitment to sustainable business practices, including sourcing renewable energy. Within North America, our major competitors include:
•Marathon Digital Holdings
 •Riot Blockchain, Inc.
 •Core Scientific, Inc.
 •Bitfarms LTD.
 •Iris Energy Limited
 •Clean Spark
 In addition to the foregoing, we compete with other companies that focus all or a portion of their activities on mining activities at scale. We face significant competition in certain operational aspects of our business, including, but not limited to, the acquisition of new miners, obtaining low cost electricity, obtaining access to energy sites with reliable sources of power, and evaluating new technology developments in the industry.
Intellectual Property
 We do not currently own any patents in connection with our existing and planned Bitcoin mining related operations. We do rely, and expect to continue relying, upon trade secrets, trademarks, service marks, trade names, copyrights and other intellectual property rights.
Government Regulation
 Bitcoin Mining
 Cryptocurrency mining is largely an unregulated activity at both the state and federal level. We anticipate that cryptocurrency mining will be a focus for increased regulation in the near- and long-term, and we cannot predict how future regulations may affect our business or operations. State regulation of cryptocurrency mining is important with respect to where we conduct our mining operations. The majority of our mining facilities are located in Kentucky, which we believe currently has one of the most favorable regulatory environments for cryptocurrency miners.
In March 2022, the United States announced plans to establish a unified federal regulatory regime for cryptocurrency, and a group of United States Senators sent a letter to the United States Treasury Department asking Treasury Secretary Yellen to investigate Treasury’s ability to monitor and restrict the use of cryptocurrencies to evade sanctions imposed by the United States. We are unable to predict the impact that any new regulations may have on our business at the time of filing this Annual Report. We continue to monitor and proactively engage in dialogue on legislative matters related to our industry.
 In August 2021, the chair of the SEC stated that he believed investors using digital asset trading platforms are not adequately protected, and that activities on the platforms can implicate the securities laws, commodities laws and banking laws, raising a number of issues related to protecting investors and consumers, guarding against illicit activity, and ensuring financial stability. The chair expressed a need for the SEC to have additional authorities to prevent transactions, products, and platforms from “falling between regulatory cracks,” as well as for more resources to protect investors in “this growing and volatile sector.” The chair called for federal legislation centering on digital asset trading, lending, and decentralized finance platforms, seeking “additional plenary authority” to write rules for digital asset trading and lending. In addition, it is possible the failure of FTX Trading Ltd. (“FTX”) in November 2022 and the resulting market turmoil could lead to increased SEC, CFTC, or criminal investigations, enforcement, and/or other regulatory activity.
 While these statements are focused on digital asset exchanges (not Bitcoin miners), the failure of large exchanges, such as the recent failure of the exchange operated by FTX Trading Ltd. (“FTX”), who applied for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in November 2022, may impact the adoption and value of Bitcoin. Additionally, because we store and sell our Bitcoin on exchanges, we may also be potentially impacted by exchange failures in that respect. For those reasons, we carefully vet our custodians for adequate compliance with U.S. laws as well as liquidity, using the information available to us, but we cannot be certain that we will be able to avoid the negative effects of a large exchange failure. We have not been directly impacted by the FTX bankruptcy other than the impact it had on the price of Bitcoin.
 As the regulatory and legal environment evolves, we may become subject to new laws, such as further regulation by the SEC, CFTC, and other agencies, which may affect our mining and other activities. For additional discussion regarding our belief about the potential risks existing and future regulation pose to our business, see Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors” beginning on page 11 of this Annual Report.
 Cybersecurity
 Our share of Bitcoins mined from our pools are initially received by us in wallets we control. We currently sell the majority of the Bitcoin we mine and utilize hot wallets to hold this Bitcoin immediately prior to selling for working capital purposes. We hold any remainder of our Bitcoin in cold storage. Bitcoins we mine or hold for our own account may be subject to loss, theft or restriction on access. Hackers or malicious actors may launch attacks to steal, compromise or secure Bitcoins, such as by attacking the Bitcoin network source code, exchange miners, third-party platforms (including Coinbase), cold and hot storage locations or software, or by other means. We may be in control and possession of substantial holdings of Bitcoin, and as we increase in size, we may become a more appealing target of hackers, malware, cyber-attacks or other security threats.
To our knowledge there has been no security breach or incident, unauthorized access or disclosure, or other compromise of or relating to the Company or its subsidiaries hard wallets, cold wallets, information technology and computer systems, networks, hardware, software, data and databases, equipment or technology. We have not been notified of, and have no knowledge of any event or condition that could result in, any security breach or incident, unauthorized access or disclosure or other compromise to their IT systems and data, and we have implemented appropriate controls, policies, procedures, and technological safeguards to maintain and protect the integrity, continuous operation, redundancy and security of our IT systems and Data reasonably consistent with industry standards and practices, or as required by applicable regulatory standards. We are presently in material compliance with all applicable laws or statutes and all judgments, orders, rules and regulations of any court or arbitrator or governmental or regulatory authority,

internal policies and contractual obligations relating to the privacy and security of IT systems and data and to the protection of such IT systems and data from unauthorized use, access, misappropriation or modification.
 Human Capital
 We believe that our future success depends, in no small part, on our ability to continue to attract, hire, and retain qualified personnel. As of March 31, 2023, we had 8 employees, all of which were full time and all located in the United States. We believe that we have adequate personnel and resources with the specialized skills required to carry out our operations successfully. Employees participate in equity incentive plans and receive what we believe is generous compensation in the form of salary and benefits. We continually seek to hire and retain talented professionals, although the competition for such personnel in our segments is significant. None of our employees are represented by a labor union, and we have never experienced a work stoppage. We believe we have a strong and engaging relationship with our employees.
 We use outside consultants, attorneys, and accountants, as necessary. We endeavor to maintain a workplace that is free from discrimination or harassment on the basis of color, race, sex, national origin, ethnicity, religion, age, disability, sexual orientation, gender identification or expression or any other status protected by applicable law. The basis for recruitment, hiring, development, training, compensation and advancement is a person’s qualifications, performance, skills and experience. We believe that our employees are fairly compensated, without regard to gender, race and ethnicity, and routinely recognized for outstanding performance.
 Corporate Information
 The Company was originally organized in January 2008 as a Florida limited liability company under the name LM Funding, LLC. Prior to our initial public offering in 2015, all of our business was conducted through LM Funding, LLC and its subsidiaries. Immediately prior to our initial public offering in October 2015, the members of the LM Funding, LLC contributed all of their membership interests to LM Funding America, Inc., a Delaware corporation incorporated on April 20, 2015 (“LMFA”), in exchange for shares of the common stock of LMFA. Immediately after such contribution and exchange, the former members of LM Funding, LLC became the holders of 100% of the issued and outstanding common stock of LMFA, thereby making LM Funding, LLC a wholly-owned subsidiary of LMFA.
The Company organized two new subsidiaries in 2020: LMFA Financing LLC, a Florida limited liability company, on November 21, 2020, and LMFAO Sponsor LLC, a Florida limited liability company ("Sponsor"), on October 29, 2020. LMFAO Sponsor LLC organized a subsidiary, LMF Acquisition Opportunities Inc., on October 29, 2020. LM Funding America Inc. organized a subsidiary, US Digital Mining and Hosting Co., LLC. ("USDM"), on September 10, 2021. USDM has created various 100% owned subsidiaries to engage in business in various states. The Company also from time to time organizes other subsidiaries to serve a specific purpose or hold a specific asset.
