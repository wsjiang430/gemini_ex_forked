Cryptocurrency Mining Business
 
Industry Summary
 
Bitcoin is a world–recognized cryptocurrency, which can be traded and converted into major fiat currencies on cryptocurrency exchanges. Cryptocurrencies are a medium of exchange that are transacted through and recorded on a decentralized distributed ledger system, called the “Blockchain.” The Blockchain is built by a chronological addition of transactions, which are grouped into blocks. Each new block requires a mathematical problem to be solved before it can be confirmed and added to the Blockchain. The processing power used to solve these mathematical problems is measured by Hash Rate or Hashes per second (“H/s”). The complexity of these problems, also referred to as mining difficulty, increases with the network’s growing Hash Rate.
 
Bitcoin mining entails solving these complex mathematical problems using custom designed and programmed application-specific integrated circuit (“ASIC”) computers (also referred to as “miners”). Bitcoin miners perform a vital function on the Bitcoin Blockchain network, by performing these calculations and adding transaction blocks to the Blockchain ledger. When a miner is successful in adding a block to the Blockchain, it is rewarded with a fixed number of Bitcoin; a miner can also be compensated by network transaction fees.
 
Additional information about Bitcoin, Blockchain and cryptocurrencies can be found on publicly available educational sources such as www.Bitcoin.org.
 
Our Operations
 
Cryptocurrency mining
 
MGT conducts cryptocurrency activities at a company-owned and managed Bitcoin mining facility in LaFayette, Georgia. Located adjacent to a utility substation, the several-acre property has access to about 20 megawatts (MW) of electrical power, half of which is presently utilized by the Company. Business activities are comprised of self-mining operations and leasing space to third parties.
 
As of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2023, the Company owned 175 and 0 Antminer S17 Pro Bitcoin miners (“S17 miners”), respectively, plus 35 Antminer S19 Pro miners as of March 31, 2023. Due to unfavorable mining economics and various required repairs, no S17 miners were operating at December 31, 2022, and we exchanged all remaining S17 miners, as well as loose hash boards, power supplies, and controller boards for the more efficient S19 miners.
 
In addition to its self-mining operations, the Company leases its owned space to other Bitcoin miners and also provides hosting services for owners of mining equipment. These measures improve utilization of the electrical infrastructure and better insulate us against the volatility of Bitcoin mining.
 
MGT’s miners are housed in a modified shipping container on the Company’s owned property in Georgia. The entire facility, including the land and improvements, five 2500 KVA 3-phase transformers, three mining containers, and miners, are owned by MGT. We continue to explore ways to grow and maintain our current operations including but not limited to further potential equipment sales and raising capital to acquire the newest generation miners. The Company is also investigating other sites to develop into Bitcoin mining facilities in addition to expansion at its current property.
 
Bitcoin And Blockchain Overview
 
A Bitcoin is one type of a digital asset that is issued by, and transmitted through, an open source, math-based protocol platform using cryptographic security (the “Bitcoin Network”). The Bitcoin Network is an online, peer-to-peer user network that hosts the public Blockchain transaction ledger and the source code that comprises the basis for the cryptography and math-based protocols governing the Bitcoin Network. No single entity owns or operates the Bitcoin Network, the infrastructure of which is collectively maintained by a decentralized user base. Bitcoin can be used to pay for goods and services or can be converted to fiat currencies, such as the US Dollar, at rates determined on Bitcoin exchanges or in individual peer to peer end-user-to-end-user transactions.
 
Bitcoins are “stored” or reflected on the Blockchain in a decentralized manner on the computers of each Bitcoin Network user. The Blockchain records the transaction history of all Bitcoin in existence and, through the transparent reporting of transactions, allows the Bitcoin Network to verify the association of each Bitcoin with the digital wallet that owns it. The Bitcoin Network and Bitcoin software programs can interpret the Blockchain to determine the exact Bitcoin balance, if any, of any digital wallet listed in the Blockchain as having taken part in a transaction on the Bitcoin Network.

The Bitcoin Network, being decentralized, does not rely on either governmental authorities or financial institutions to create, transmit or determine the value of Bitcoin. Rather, Bitcoin are created and allocated by the Bitcoin Network protocol through a “mining” process subject to a strict, well-known issuance schedule. The value of Bitcoin is determined by the supply and demand of Bitcoin in the Bitcoin exchange market (and in private peer to peer transactions), as well as the number of merchants that accept it. As Bitcoin transactions can be broadcast to the Bitcoin Network by any user’s Bitcoin software and Bitcoin can be transferred without the involvement of intermediaries or third parties, there are only minor transaction costs in direct peer-to-peer transactions on the Bitcoin Network. Third party service providers such as Bitcoin exchanges and third-party payment processing services may charge significant fees for processing transactions and for converting, or facilitating the conversion of, Bitcoin to or from fiat currency.
 
Miners dedicate substantial resources to mining. Given the increasing difficulty of the target established by the Bitcoin Network, miners must continually invest in expensive mining hardware to achieve adequate processing power to hash at a competitive rate.
 
Bitcoin is an example of a digital asset that is not a fiat currency (i.e., a currency that is backed by a central bank or a national, supra-national or quasi-national organization) and are not backed by hard assets or other credit. As a result, the value of Bitcoin is determined by the value that various market participants place on Bitcoin through their transactions.
 
The supply of Bitcoin is finite. Once 21 million Bitcoin are generated, the network will stop producing more. Currently, there are approximately 19.3 million Bitcoin in circulation, or 92% of the total supply of Bitcoin. Within the Bitcoin protocol is an event referred to as Bitcoin halving (“Halving”) where the Bitcoin provided upon mining a block is reduced by 50%. Halvings are scheduled to occur once every 210,000 blocks, or roughly every four years, until the maximum supply of 21 million Bitcoin is reached. The most recent Halving occurred in May 2020, with a revised reward payout of 6.25 Bitcoin per block.
 
Given a stable hash rate, a Halving reduces the number of new Bitcoin being generated by the network. While the effect is to limit the supply of new coins, it has no impact on the quantity of total Bitcoin outstanding. As a result, the price of Bitcoin could rise or fall based on overall investor and consumer demand. Should the price of Bitcoin remain unchanged after the next Halving, the Company’s revenue from self-mining would be reduced by 50%, with a much larger negative impact to profit.
 
The cryptocurrency markets have grown rapidly in both popularity and market size. These markets are local, national and international and include an ever-broadening range of products and participants. There have been many documented instances of fraud involving companies engaged in the cryptocurrency industry and the use of cryptocurrencies. The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), and other governmental agencies around the world, are evaluating the cryptocurrency markets and are likely to institute new rules and regulations within this market to protect investors and such regulations could result in the restriction of the acquisition, ownership, holding, selling, use or trading of our common stock.
 
Strategy
 
MGT’s strategy is to oversee the operations in La Fayette, Georgia, which include self-mining, hosting others’ miners for a fee, and leasing its physical space and electrical infrastructure. The Company’s immediate focus is to grow free cash flow, with a longer-term objective to expand its mining operations.
Competition
 
Our industry is very new and subject to rapid change and constant innovation. We face significant competition, including from companies that have entered this space earlier than us and are better capitalized, with vertically integrated business models. Some of these companies are our suppliers. We compete to attract, engage, and retain personnel, educated and skilled in the Blockchain and cryptocurrency mining space.
 
We compete with vertically integrated companies such as Bitmain that engage in both the design and distribution of mining machines, as well as cryptocurrency mining. We also compete with many other companies that are engaged in cryptocurrency mining, some of which have better access to mining hardware, lower operating expenses and lower cost of capital than MGT. These companies include Riot Blockchain, Inc. and Marathon Digital Holdings, Inc.
 
Employees
 
Currently, the Company has 2 full–time employees. Neither employee is represented by a union, and we believe our relationships with our employees are good.

Government Regulation
 
Government regulation of cryptocurrency is being actively considered by the United States federal government via a number of agencies and regulatory bodies, as well as similar entities in other countries. State government regulations also may apply to our activities and other activities in which we participate or may participate in the future. Other regulatory bodies are governmental or semi-governmental and have shown an interest in regulating or investigating companies engaged in the cryptocurrency business.
 
Businesses that are engaged in the transmission and custody of Bitcoin and other digital assets, including brokers and custodians, can be subject to U.S. Treasury Department regulations as money services businesses as well as state money transmitter licensing requirements. Bitcoin and other digital assets are subject to anti-fraud regulations under federal and state commodity laws, and digital asset derivative instruments are substantively regulated by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Certain jurisdictions, including, among others, New York and a number of countries outside the United States, have developed regulatory requirements specifically for digital assets and companies that transact in them.
 
Regulations may substantially change in the future and it is presently not possible to know how regulations will apply to our businesses, or when they will be effective. As the regulatory and legal environment evolves, we may become subject to new laws, further regulation by the SEC and other agencies, which may affect our mining and other activities. For instance, various bills have also been proposed in Congress related to our business, which may be adopted and have an impact on us. For additional discussion regarding our belief about the potential risks existing and future regulation pose to our business, see the Section entitled “Risk Factors” herein.
 
In addition, since transactions in Bitcoin provide a reasonable degree of pseudo anonymity, they are susceptible to misuse for criminal activities, such as money laundering. This misuse, or the perception of such misuse (even if untrue), could lead to greater regulatory oversight of Bitcoin platforms, and there is the possibility that law enforcement agencies could close Bitcoin platforms or other Bitcoin-related infrastructure with little or no notice and prevent users from accessing or retrieving Bitcoin held via such platforms or infrastructure.
