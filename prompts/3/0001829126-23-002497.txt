ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

Overview
 
Rebus Holdings, Inc. (fka Inspyr Therapeutics, Inc.) is a pharmaceutical company focused on the research and development of novel targeted precision therapeutics for the treatment of cancer. Our approach utilizes our proprietary delivery technology to better enhance immuno-modulation for improved therapeutic outcomes. Our potential first-in-class immune-oncology lead asset, RT-AR001, an adenosine A2A receptor antagonist, is differentiated by its intratumoral delivery of nano- or microparticle formulations that allows for better tumor infiltration. The adenosine A2 Receptor is one of many T-cell surface immune checkpoint proteins. Our patented portfolio of adenosine receptor antagonists provides flexibility to optimize treatment based on the specific adenosine targets found in each type of cancer.
Adenosine Receptor Modulators
 
The adenosine receptor modulators include A2A, A2B and dual A2A/A2B antagonists, that have broad development applicability including indications within immuno-oncology. Very high concentrations of adenosine are produced in the tumor microenvironment which prevents the host’s own immune cells from attacking the tumor. Adenosine receptor antagonists as single-agents and in combination with other existing immuno-oncology agents may overcome this immunosuppression and boost the host immune response leading to enhanced anti-tumor activity as well as inhibition of metastasis. Preclinical data has shown the direct effects with our drug candidates on certain types of cancer cells.
 
We have completed the manufacture of our novel platform delivery system of nano- or microparticle formulations that will be used in toxicology studies anticipated to begin in the second half of 2023, that will support the submission of an IND in 2024.
 
While we believe that the data from our nonclinical studies appear encouraging, the outcome of our ongoing or future studies may ultimately be unsuccessful.
 
We have manufactured sufficient amounts of nano- or microparticle formulations, to take us through the IND and initial clinical studies.
 
Rebus Holdings/ Ridgeway Licensing Agreement
 
Pursuant to our recent termination of license with Ridgeway Therapeutics, Inc., we reacquired the rights to certain intellectual property, discussed above, and are currently focusing on a pipeline of small molecule adenosine receptor modulators. In October 2020, pursuant to the cancellation of a license agreement whereby we previously licensed US Patent 9,593,118, we reacquired the exclusive right to such patent that covers both A2B and dual A2A/A2B antagonists. Accordingly, going forward our major focus will be: (i) further characterization of the anti-cancer activity of our unique pipeline delivery platform containing A2A, A2B and dual A2A/A2B antagonists, leading to selection of a clinical candidate or candidates for an Investigative New Drug or IND enabling studies; and (ii) licensing and/or partnering our delivery platform and the A2B and dual A2A/A2B antagonists for further development.

Our ability to execute the business plan is contingent upon our ability to raise the necessary funds. During January 2021, we sold $500,000 of debt securities for cash, and in June 2021, we sold $600,000 of debt securities for $500,000 in cash and $100,000 in cancellation of outstanding obligations. We are currently using such funds to maintain our SEC reporting requirements, pay outstanding invoices to our independent registered accounting firm, legal fees, and to retain consultants and other personnel in preparation for an Investigational New Drug Application (“IND”) filing related to our unique delivery platform and portfolio of adenosine A2R antagonists for the treatment of certain solid tumors. Should we fail to further raise sufficient funds to execute our business plan, our priority would be to maintain our intellectual property portfolio and seek business development opportunities with potential development partners and/or acquirors.
 
Pre-Revenue
 
We are a pre-revenue, early-stage company that has not achieved profitability, and has no product revenues. Additionally, we have no approved products for sale.
 
Going Concern
 
Our auditors’ report on our December 31, 2022 consolidated financial statements expressed an opinion that our capital resources as of the date of their Audit Report were not sufficient to sustain operations or complete our planned activities for the upcoming year unless we raised additional funds. As of December 31, 2022 we had sufficient cash on hand to operate until March, 2023. If we do not obtain additional funds by such time, we may no longer be able to continue as a going concern and will cease operation which means that our shareholders will lose their entire investment.
Recent Developments
 

● | Effective October 12, 2021, we (i) completed a 1-for-75 Reverse Stock Split and (ii) a holding company reorganization whereby we changed our name to Rebus Holdings, Inc. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | On August 16, 2021, we appointed Raul Silvestre, Esq. as (i) our interim chief executive officer and principal accounting officer and (ii) a member of the Board of Directors. 
● | On June 18, 2021, we completed the private placement of $600,000 of non-interest bearing senior convertible debentures consisting of (i) $500,000 purchased in cash and (ii) $100,000 purchased pursuant to the cancellation of outstanding obligations.

Product Development of Adenosine Receptor Modulators
 
As a result of the License Termination, the Company has refocused its business plan on the research and development of its lead asset, RT-AR001, an adenosine A2 receptor antagonist, which is differentiated by its intratumoral delivery of nano- or microparticle formulations that allows for better tumor infiltration.
 
Adenosine is an extracellular signaling molecule that regulates multiple aspects of tissue function and specifically plays a role in immunity and inflammation. The adenosine A2 receptor is one of many T-cell surface immune checkpoint proteins. High levels of adenosine in the tumor microenvironment are produced and, therefore, adenosine signaling, mediated through the A2A and A2B receptors, suppresses the host immune response to the tumor cells.

As such, our portfolio of adenosine receptor antagonists has broad applicability as potential immuno-oncology (IO) therapeutic agents in multiple solid tumor types both as a potential single agent and in combination with other IO agents, in addition to traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy. We are actively seeking licensing opportunities and/or partners to further develop our unique platform delivery system of A2A, A2B and dual A2A/A2B receptor antagonists. Our current product development plan for adenosine receptor antagonists contemplates the following major initiatives, subject to the Company receiving sufficient funds:
 

● | Continue development of anti-cancer agents with partner company, Ridgeway Therapeutics, Inc.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Further characterization of our platform delivery system and existing agents in preclinical studies, and towards an investigational new drug (IND) application.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Support ongoing licensing / partnership activities.
--+----------------------------------------------------

 
Pre-IND and IND
 
The Company is currently pursuing an IND filing related to our unique delivery platform and portfolio of adenosine A2R antagonists for the treatment of certain solid tumors, and is preparing its pre-IND application, for its lead asset, RT-AR001, an adenosine A2A receptor antagonist.
 
Between September 2021 and February 2022, our CMO manufactured to GMP standards; both our adenosine A2A receptor antagonist as well as the nano- or microparticle formulation for intratumoral delivery known as RT-AR001. We have sufficient material to take us through the IND and initial clinical studies.
 
We have completed in-vitro testing of our adenosine A2A receptor antagonist and will begin toxicology testing with RT-AR001 in the second half of 2023. The Company plans to provide a further update on RT-AR001’s clinical development in the fourth quarter of 2023.
 
Our Technology
 
We have what we believe to be a robust intellectual property portfolio covering proprietary A2A agonists (LNC-001, see below), A2B antagonists (LNC-002, see below), and dual A2A/A2B antagonists (LNC-003, see below). We also have a substantial catalogue of synthesized compounds, specifically A2A agonists and A2B antagonists that require further characterization and testing for potential clinical candidates. We believe that our proprietary dual A2A/A2B antagonists have great potential and should be further explored.
Patents and Proprietary Rights
 
Our success will likely depend upon our ability to preserve our proprietary technologies and operate without infringing the proprietary rights of other parties. However, we may rely on certain proprietary technologies and know-how that are not patentable or that we determine to keep as trade secrets. We protect our proprietary information, in part, using confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, significant scientific collaborators, and sponsored researchers that generally provide that all inventions conceived by the individual in the course of rendering services to us shall be our exclusive property.
 
The intellectual property underlying our technology is covered by certain patents and patent applications previously owned by Lewis and Clark Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“LNC”) and now fully owned by the Company. All of the LNC intellectual property has been assigned to the Company. We solely own all of our patents and patent applications for adenosine receptor modulators, which include three patent estates, one for A2A agonists (LNC-001), the second for A2B antagonists (LNC-002), and the third for dual A2A/A2B antagonists (LNC-003). Ownership of these patent estates came from our purchase (in exchange for 7,122,172 shares of our common stock) of Lewis and Clark Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (LNC) on July 31, 2017. The purchase of LNC also included all know-how, pre-clinical data, and development data that relate to and form the basis of our technology. Under the purchase agreement, we are sole owners of the technology and patent estates and are not required to make any other future payments, including fees or other reimbursements, milestones, or royalties, to LNC.

When appropriate, we will continue to seek patent protection for inventions in our core technologies and in ancillary technologies that support our core technologies or which we otherwise believe will provide us with a competitive advantage. We will accomplish this by filing and maintaining patent applications for discoveries we make, either alone or in collaboration with scientific collaborators and strategic partners. Typically, we plan to file patent applications in the United States. In addition, we plan to obtain licenses or options to acquire licenses to patent filings from other individuals and organizations that we anticipate could be useful in advancing our research, development, and commercialization initiatives and our strategic business interest.

Development Strategy
 
We anticipate that under the planning and direction of key personnel, to outsource all our nonclinical development and manufacturing, and the majority of our clinical development activities to contract research organizations (CROs) and contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs). Our contract CROs and CMOs are required to comply with federal, state and United States Food and Drug Administration or FDA regulations including Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP), Good Clinical Practices (GCP), and Good Lab Practices (GLP).
 
We intend to conduct toxicology testing of our A2A antagonist RT-AR001 the select a candidate for clinical trials in an oncology indication. This oncology work is expected to be run in conjunction with and oversight from Ridgeway Therapeutics, Inc. for the selection of an anti-cancer agent.
 
Commercialization Strategy
 
We intend to (i) license or sell the underlying technology of our therapeutics to third parties during or after our clinical trials, (ii) seek a corporate partner for further development, or (iii) continue developing our drug candidates ourselves. It is expected that such third parties would then continue to develop, market, sell, and distribute any resulting products. As part of our overall strategic plan, we are exploring our options and actively seeking to engage in a collaborative, strategic and/or licensing arrangement with another pharmaceutical company. If we enter into any such transaction, we may be required to give up certain rights to our technology and control over its future development.
Intellectual Property
 
We regard the protection of patents and other intellectual property rights that we own or license as critical to our business and competitive position. To protect our intellectual property, we rely on patent, trade secret, and copyright law, as well as confidentiality, nondisclosure, assignment of invention and other contractual arrangements with our officers, directors, employees, consultants, investigators, clinical trial sites, contractors, collaborators and other third parties to whom we disclose confidential information. Our policy is to pursue patent applications on inventions and discoveries that we believe are commercially important to the development and growth of our business. We solely own or have exclusive licenses to our patents and patent applications.
 
Our pipeline currently includes a substantial catalogue of synthesized compounds, specifically A2A agonists and A2B antagonists that require further characterization and testing for potential clinical candidates. Our proprietary dual A2A/A2B antagonists have great potential and need to be further explored.
 
Our intellectual property estate, shown above, has twenty-eight (28) issued patents in twenty-five (25) different jurisdictions and five (5) currently pending applications.
 
When appropriate and funding permitting, we plan to continue to seek patent protection for inventions in our core technologies and in ancillary technologies that support our core technologies or which we otherwise believe would provide us with a competitive advantage. We expect to be able to accomplish this by filing and maintaining patent applications for discoveries we make, either alone or in collaboration with scientific collaborators and strategic partners. Typically, we plan to file patent applications in the United States as well as foreign countries, where applicable. In addition, we may obtain licenses or options to acquire licenses to patent filings from other individuals and organizations that we anticipate could be useful in advancing our research, development and commercialization initiatives and our strategic business interest.

Manufacturing and Supply
 
We do not plan to develop company-owned or company-operated manufacturing facilities. We historically have and we plan to in the future, outsource all drug manufacturing to contract manufacturers that are required to operate in compliance with cGMP. We may also seek to refine the current manufacturing process in order to achieve improvements in efficiency, costs, purity and the like as well as address different drug formulations to achieve improvements in stability and/or drug delivery.
 
Between September 2021 and February 2022, our CMO manufactured to GMP standards, both our adenosine A2A receptor antagonist as well as the nano- or microparticle formulation for intratumoral delivery known as RT-AR001. We have sufficient material to take us through the IND and initial clinical studies.
 
Governmental Regulations
 
FDA Approval Process
 
Prior to commencement of clinical studies involving humans, preclinical testing of new pharmaceutical products is generally conducted on animals in the laboratory to evaluate the potential efficacy and safety of the product candidate. The results of these studies are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND application, which must become effective before clinical testing in humans can begin. Typically, human clinical evaluation involves a time-consuming and costly three-phase process. In Phase I, clinical trials are conducted with a small number of people to assess safety, tolerability and to evaluate the pattern of drug distribution within the body. In Phase II, clinical trials are conducted with groups of patients afflicted with a specific disease in order to determine preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and expanded evidence of safety. (In some cases, an initial trial is conducted in diseased patients to assess both preliminary efficacy and preliminary safety, in which case it is referred to as a Phase I/II trial.) In Phase III, large-scale, multi-center, comparative trials are conducted with patients afflicted with a target disease in order to provide enough data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety required by the FDA. The FDA closely monitors the progress of each of the three phases of clinical testing and may, at its discretion, re-evaluate, alter, suspend, or terminate the testing based upon the data which have been accumulated to that point and its assessment of the risk/benefit ratio to the patient. All adverse events must be reported to the FDA. Monitoring of all aspects of the study to minimize risks is a continuing process.
 
The results of the preclinical and clinical testing on non-biologic drugs and certain diagnostic drugs are submitted to the FDA in the form of a New Drug Application (NDA) for approval prior to commencement of commercial sales. In responding to an NDA submission, the FDA may grant marketing approval, may request additional information, may deny the application if it determines that the application does not provide an adequate basis for approval, and may also refuse to review an application that has been submitted if it determines that the application does not provide an adequate basis for filing and review. There can be no assurance that approvals would be granted on a timely basis, if at all, for any of our proposed products.
 
Orphan Drugs
 
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally defined as a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the drug and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. The first NDA applicant to receive FDA approval for a particular active ingredient to treat a particular disease with FDA orphan drug designation is entitled to a seven-year exclusive marketing period in the United States for that product, for that indication. During the seven-year exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same orphan indication, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity in that it is shown to be safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug for the same disease or condition, or the same drug for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the NDA application user fee.

Asia, European and Other Regulatory Approval
 
Whether or not FDA approval has been obtained, approval of a product by comparable regulatory authorities in Europe and other countries is necessary prior to commencement of marketing the product in such countries. The regulatory authorities in each country may impose their own requirements and may refuse to grant an approval, or may require additional data before granting it, even though the relevant product has been approved by the FDA or another authority. As with the FDA, the regulatory authorities in the European Union (EU), countries located in Asia, and other developed regions have lengthy approval processes for pharmaceutical products. The process for gaining approval in particular countries and regions varies, but generally follows a similar sequence to that described for FDA approval. In Europe, the European Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products provides a mechanism for EU-member states to exchange information on all aspects of product licensing. The EU has established a European agency for the evaluation of medical products, with both a centralized community procedure and a decentralized procedure, the latter being based on the principle of licensing within one member country followed by mutual recognition by the other member countries. In China, the CFDA functions as the counterpart to the FDA in the United States and is responsible for overseeing drug approvals in China and its territories.
Reimbursement and Health Care Cost Control
 
Reimbursement for the costs of treatments and products such as ours from government health administration authorities, private health insurers and others, both in the United States and abroad, is a key element in the success of new health care products. Significant uncertainty often exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved health care products. The revenue and profitability of some health care-related companies have been affected by the continuing efforts of governmental and third-party payors to contain or reduce the cost of health care through various means. Payors are increasingly attempting to limit both coverage and the levels of reimbursement for new therapeutic products approved for marketing by the FDA, and are refusing, in some cases, to provide any coverage for uses of approved products for disease indications for which the FDA has not granted marketing approval. In certain foreign markets, pricing or profitability of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to government control.
 
In the United States, there have been a number of federal and state proposals to implement government control over health care costs. The U.S. Patient Protection and Affordance Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act were signed into law in March 2010. A number of provisions of those laws require further rulemaking action by governmental agencies to implement. The laws change access to health care products and services and create new fees for the pharmaceutical and medical device industries. Future rulemaking could increase rebates, reduce prices or the rate of price increases for health care products and services, or require additional reporting and disclosure. The laws also include new authorization to the FDA to approve companies to market biosimilar products within the United States, although to date FDA rulemaking under this legislation has been limited. We cannot predict the timing or impact of any such future rulemaking on our business.
 
Other Regulations
 
We are also subject to various U.S. federal, state, local and international laws, regulations and recommendations relating to safe working conditions, laboratory and manufacturing practices and the use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances, including radioactive compounds and infectious disease agents, used in connection with our business. Additionally, we are subject to regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and Securities and Exchange Commission regulations. We cannot accurately predict the extent of government regulation which might result from future legislation or administrative action.
Employees
 
As of March 15, 2023, we employed only Mr. Silvestre, on a part time basis, as our interim chief executive officer who is our only employee. In addition, we contract with a limited number of consultants to assist in activities related to our operations.

Corporate History
 
We were incorporated in the State of Delaware in November 2003. In August of 2016, we changed our name from GenSpera, Inc. to Inspyr Therapeutics, Inc. In October 2021, we completed a holding company reorganization structure, changing our name to Rebus Holdings, Inc. Our principal office is located in Westlake Village, California. Since our inception, we have invested a substantial portion of our efforts and financial resources in the development of mipsagargin (G-202). In July of 2017, we acquired Lewis and Clark Pharmaceuticals and licensed certain assets to Ridgeway Therapeutics for further development. Upon the termination of such license in October 2020, we resumed operations focusing our efforts on our Adenosine Receptor Modulators. On October 12, 2021, we completed a 1:75 reverse stock split of our common stock. We have generated no revenues from the sale of our product candidates and have experienced substantial net operating losses.
