Prior Operations
 
ORGANIZATIONAL HISTORY
 
We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on October 30, 2013, under the name “Bling Marketing, Inc.”. Until December 29, 2014, we were a wholesaler of jewelry, principally earrings, rings, and pendants (“BMI Business”). We recognized a minimal amount of sales from operations before the three months ending June 30, 2014, and were accordingly classified as a shell company. During the three-month ended June 30, 2014, we began working with several distributors to sell our jewelry products to retail outlets and, as a result, recognized sales revenue of $22,025 during the said period. On September 11, 2014, we filed a Current Report on Form 8-K indicating that we were no longer a shell company as defined by Rule12b-2 of the Exchange Act in light of our operations through the quarter that ended June 30, 2014.
 
On December 26, 2014, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (“Nugene Merger Agreement”) with NuGene Inc., a California corporation (“NuGene”). On December 29, 2014 (the “Closing Date”), we filed a certificate of merger in the State of California whereby our subsidiary, NG Acquisition Inc. (“Acquisition Sub”), merged with NuGene. As a result, NuGene, the surviving entity, became our wholly owned subsidiary. The transaction under the Nugene Merger Agreement was deemed to be a reverse merger, whereby the Company (the legal acquirer) is considered the accounting acquiree and NuGene is considered the accounting acquirer, and NuGene (the legal acquiree) is considered the accounting acquirer. The assets, liabilities, and operations of the acquired entity, NuGene, were brought forward at their book value, and no goodwill was recognized.
 
In connection with the NuGene Merger Agreement, we entered into a Business Transfer and Indemnity Agreement dated December 29, 2014 (the “Indemnity Agreement”) with our former Chief Executive Officer and Director, Dena Kurland providing for:
 

1. | The transfer of our jewelry business operations existing on the date of the Indemnity Agreement (the “BMI Business”); 
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | The assumption by Ms. Kurland of all liabilities of our Company and the indemnification by Ms. Kurland holding our Company harmless for any and all liabilities arising at or before the date of the Indemnity Agreement; 
3. | The payment by NuGene to Ms. Kurland of $350,000 in cash; and 
4. | The surrender by Ms. Kurland of 15,000,000 shares (before giving effect to the Stock Split discussed below) (the “Indemnity Shares”) of our Company’s common stock representing 95% of the then outstanding common stock (all of which shares have been deemed cancelled by the Company). 

 
Pursuant to the terms of the Nugene Merger Agreement, 26,052,760 shares of Company common stock and 1,917,720 Company a newly designated Series A Preferred Stock were issued to the former NuGene shareholders. The Series A Preferred Stock was: (i) initially convertible into common stock at a ratio of one to one, (ii) as long as there were a minimum of 900,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock outstanding, the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock had the right to elect a majority of the board of directors and (iii) the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock, generally voting as a class with the holders of common stock, had for each share of Series A Preferred Stock three times the number of votes permitted to each share of common stock.
 
On December 26, 2014, our board of directors approved a 15.04 to one stock split (“Stock Split”) in the form of a stock dividend to holders of our common stock as of that date. To affect that board action, each recipient of the stock dividend would receive 14.04 additional shares of common stock for every share of common stock held.

On December 29, 2014, we completed the sale of 2,000,000 shares of our common stock to 18 purchasers (“Stock Placement”) for proceeds totaling $2,000,000, including (a) $1,625,000 of cash and (b) automatic conversion of promissory notes in the principal amount of $375,000.
 
NuGene was incorporated in California in December 2006 and formed and funded by our founders, Ali Kharazmi and Mohammed Kharazmi, M.D. The initial focus of NuGene was to develop and market customized skin care products. As part of that focus, NuGene sought to leverage the working relationships developed by our founders with the plastic surgery community. NuGene directed significant time and resources on developing anti-aging and scar treatment/reduction products.
 
In 2007 Nugene continued to focus on “age-defying” products utilizing peptide complexes (see further description below) and nano-encapsulation for absorption into the skin (see additional description below). We introduced a limited product line under the NuGene name and co-branded the products with an affiliated entity, Genetic Institute of Anti-Aging, Inc. (“GIAA”), which the Kharazmi owned. We utilized the services of a Korean-based contract manufacturer to supply our products. This product line (the “GIAA Line”) was based on peptides and did not utilize stem cells. We had very modest sales in 2007, with our sole customer GIAA, a related party.
 
In 2008 we stopped production of the GIAA Line, and sales were limited to selling the remaining inventory through medical offices and GIAA. With the GIAA Line discontinued, we spent the remainder of 2008 considering different formulations and methodologies for improved anti-aging products.
 
In 2009 and 2010, we had limited activity and minimal sales. Our sales were mainly overseas and limited to the remaining inventory of the GIAA Line. We continued to explore how we might advance our formulations and methodologies. We expended funds on research and development, carried out mainly by scientists engaged by the Company.
 
In 2011 our founders decided to use adult adipose human stem cells (undifferentiated cells found throughout the body that multiply by cell division to replenish dying cells and regenerate tissues) as the foundation of the formulation for its products. In 2011 the Company developed a proprietary process to extract human adult stem cells from fat cells that the Company then used in its customized NuGene line explicitly made for those client(s). Throughout 2011 we continued to provide autologous, or mature, fat-derived stem cells for use in clinical procedures utilizing this technology. Through this process, the Company refined its ability to culture adult human stem cells to render human-conditioned stem cell media at a proprietary concentration, a primary ingredient in the NuGene line of cosmeceuticals. The Company believes that this proprietary concentration, combined with our unique formulations, will provide NuGene with a significant competitive advantage.
 
In 2012 we completed our initial line of cosmeceutical products based on these adipose-derived stem cells. We branded this advanced skincare line solely under the NuGene name (the “NuGene Line”). We eliminated the unpleasant odor associated with stem cells by adding a fragrance with a very low incidence of allergic reaction. The packaging of this new product line bears no resemblance to the prior GIAA Line. We also manufactured the NuGene Line ourselves at a small laboratory facility that we leased from an affiliated entity owned by one of our founders.
 
Throughout 2013 we continued to expand the product offerings of the NuGene Line. The Company focused its stem cell work on surgical and orthopedic regeneration. These services were delivered to one client, which was an affiliated entity. Sales of the NuGene Line were limited as we were in an initial rollout and branding phase.
 
During 2014, we focused our efforts on transitioning to a cosmeceutical skincare business for mass distribution. With this transition and expanded attention to our consumer products, we sought to develop our marketing plan and distribution channels. By the end of 2014, we had wholesalers distributing products from the NuGene Line to medical offices and medical spas throughout the United States. December 31, 2014, we had about 50 locations selling our products. In addition to the NuGene Line, we generated revenues from an affiliate, Advanced Surgical Partners (“ASP”), which is also owned by our CEO and Chairman of the Board, Messrs. Ali and Mohammed Kharazmi, respectively. Revenues generated from ASP resulted from NuGene providing Plasma Rich Platelet and Stem Cell injections for orthopedic and plastic surgery procedures to ASP. We provided these products and services to ASP as we transitioned into commercializing our cosmeceutical product lines. We expect further to minimize these product sales and services to ASP in early 2015.

Our target customers primarily consisted of middle-aged men and women concerned with their aging skin and hair loss. Although our distributors were primarily west of the Mississippi River, our products were sold throughout the United States.
 
By 2017, our cosmeceutical skincare business had been discontinued as we could not obtain financing for operations on reasonable terms and became inactive. Our corporate charter was revoked in Nevada.
 
On January 26, 2020, Emergent, LLC (“Emergent”), a Nevada LLC controlled by Milan I Hoffman, was appointed the custodian of the Company and proceeded to revive the Company’s existence and resolve its outstanding indebtedness. This was completed as to all indebtedness except for one convertible rate promissory note of $120,000. In March 14th, 2022, Ms. Hoffman sold her Series A Preferred stock in the Company and certain shares of Series C Preferred Stock to Livento Group, LLC. Also in March 2022, David Stybr, our CEO and the sole owner of Livento Group, LLC, agreed to contribute Livento Group, LLC to the Company in exchange for a transfer to him of the Series A Preferred Stock which gave Mr. Stybr voting control of the Company. The Series C Preferred Stock purchased by Livento Group, LLC was cancelled. As a result of these transactions our current operations are the operations of Livento Group, LLC.
 
David Stybr, CEO and Founder inserted the shares of Livento Group LLC into NuGene International, Inc. and received A class voting shares and 5 mil of C class shares.
 
Livento Group operations started in 2017 as the internal team spearheaded the development of financial management software based on artificial intelligence for investment entities. This software currently provides several clients with data processing and analytical services in the investment management sector. Management believes that this segment of our operations will provide meaningful revenue, but we can give no assurance that this will happen. The product is best described as an automated system that can analyze large quantities of data, focusing on selected parameters and predicting short-term future behavior within a specific portfolio of selected assets. The software chooses assets with the highest potential based on a set of specifications and properties, predicting short-term future behavior within a particular portfolio.
 
In 2020 the Company acquired land for a residential real estate development project, amounting to 4 million USD, with a completion target of late 2022. The property is being developed into 16 residential condominiums in a suburb of Prague in the Czech Republic, and all of the condominium units have signed purchase agreements totaling 12 million. The development cost was approximately 3 million USD. Accordingly, the gross profits from this project (not counting carrying costs) will be about 5 million USD. The Company had one more real estate project in the planning phase but planned to sell it and not develop the property further. The Company invested in a residential project total amount of around 825,000 USD and is currently looking for a buyer. We have had discussions with three potential buyers and expect to finalize a contract of sale by the end of 2022 but can give no assurances that this will occur or that any sale of this project will prove profitable. We do not have any further plans to engage in additional real estate development projects.
 
Present Operations
 
The Company formed BOXO Productions, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“BOXO”), on June 17, 2022 as a wholly owned subsidiary. BOXO previously operated as a division of Livento that operated since 2020, where we meet with top film and movie producers. BOXO’s business model is strongly oriented toward the growing demand for content to fill cinemas after COVID19 and the expansion of online content distributors. BOXO Productions will hold all assets related to Company’s business in movies in the future and currently doesn’t employ any personnel. In most of its projects, BOXO is not primarily dependent on the movie’s success, as a distributor pays it before the film is finalized and receives a share of the revenue from cinemas’ box office and home sales. BOXO plans to produce up to 6 movies and 12 television productions during 2022. BOXO also intends to participate in other films based on management’s assessment of their potential success in cinemas already in the post-production phase. BOXO will focus on negotiating distribution agreements that provide for its sharing in the box office sales of these movies. Scripts are chosen by BOXO’s production team, which regularly receives offers from authors commonly involved in the film industry. BOXO may acquire movie or television rights in various stages of development. Less frequently, BOXO receives offers for participating in a project’s post-production phase. BOXO finances movies via internal resources, loans, and investors depending on the project’s state of development and the Company’s cash position.

During 2022 BOXO started production of three movies, Carnival of Killers, Wash Me in the River and Running Wild. These projects received an initial investment from Livento of USD 400,000 each. Two of these projects, Carnival of Killers and Running Wild are expected to enter the development stage of production competed in the summer of 2023 and filming and postproduction should end during 4Q 2024. The movie Wash Me in the River was released in Q4 of 2022.
 
We are in early stages of producing other movies that will be announced during Q1 or Q2 of 2023 once all the relevant agreements are finalized.
 
The team has been involved either as producers, executive producers, or agents over the years on the following movies, which have been aired both in theaters and streaming services such as Netflix, Prime Video, Paramount, and Disney Plus:
 

● | The Misfits; a 2021 Action/Thriller featuring Pierce Brosnan 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Packaging of Ironman movie 
● | Black Swan; a 2010 Drama/Thriller featuring Natalie Portman, Mila Kunis, Winona Ryder, and Vincent Cassel 
● | Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile; a 2019 Crime/Drama featuring John Malkovich and Zac Efron 
● | Marley & Me; a 2008 Comedy/Drama featuring Jennifer Aniston and Owen Wilson 
● | The Last Full Measure; a 2019 War/Drama featuring Samuel L. Jackson and Ed Harris 
● | Worth; a 2020 Drama featuring Michael Keaton and Stanley Tucci Jr. 
● | American Traitor: The Trial of Axis Sally; a 2021 Drama that features Al Pacino 
● | Best Sellers; a 2021 Drama/Comedy featuring Michael Caine and Cary Elwes 

 
Currently, the Company’s primary focus is the activities of BOXO Productions. As previously mentioned, new movies and television productions are started monthly, with the target being six movies this year. The Company will use the proceeds of the condominium sales to fund the activity and operations of BOXO.
 
The BOXO team is comprised of three consultants that have been in the production business for last 20 – 30 years and has experience with large productions as the above-mentioned examples. They have together worked on approximately 300 movie projects over the years.
 
The Company does not plan to continue in its real estate activities, is finalizing its current projects, and will not pursue new opportunities in this segment. The last remaining project, Thunder, was a proposed 52-unit condominium apartment building in Prague. We had an option to purchase the parcel for the construction of the project but allowed the option to lapse. The parcel remains available and the project now which consists of budget, architectural drawings, and project plans. We will endeavor to sell the project hopefully during 2023 but can give no assurance that we will be successful in those efforts. Any buyer needs to secure the land and hire construction company to build the project. Any proceeds from the sale of this project will be added to our general working capital.
 
Trends in the Our Markets
 
Management believes that the entertainment industry is experiencing structural changes. COVID19 changed the movie distribution business and offered new business models and potential growth to participants who provide apps and streaming content directly to consumers through the Internet. Based on management’s analysis of recent market statistics and trends, we believe these models have become dominant trends in this market segment.
 
Management also believes that these trends will continue and that there is a large market for BOXO’s films and television productions. The movie production market has expanded significantly in the last two years and is likely to continue growing significantly in the coming years. Management has observed that online streaming platforms continually require new content, and an increased number of connected devices will likely result in more customers using these services. In the next few years, many developed and emerging nations will add new customers to the network.

The Company has internally developed software called “Elisee” that can capture large amounts of data and create predictive behavior based on client inputs that assist the client in establishing its investment portfolio. Successfully building an equity portfolio is not simple since one must consider the future of particular industries and the companies within them. Retail investors and Family Offices lack complex historical data, and this is where Elisee excels. This data has been acquired from Dow Jones and other public sources and dissected and analyzed. We believe in diversification but place more emphasis on those industries and companies with a more promising outlook based on guidance from Elisee. Management believes each potential customer’s financial situation and investment needs are unique. We see the constant shift of the world’s financial markets, real estate prices, CPI data, and effective portfolio management as the key to success.
 
Elisee, our software product, uses algorithms that read market data and neurological network abilities to determine the best path forward and make ongoing corrections over time. The main idea is based on reducing risk by investing in several assets. Investors should approach assets individually and carefully assemble them into their portfolios. When creating an optimal portfolio, Elisee constantly measures two factors. The first factor is a parameter expressing potential profitability, and the second parameter represents risk. It is necessary to consider the riskiness of the individual assets in the portfolio, their mutual covariance, or their mutual correlation to calculate the risk of the entire portfolio. Covariance expresses the extent to which two investment instruments move in the same direction at a specific time.
 
Our competitors are other A.I. database and algorithm programming companies delivering services to clients like banks and asset managers. Elisee is diversification tool.
 

The investor could create his portfolio from all the points in the picture. But only points E, N, and J form an admissible set suitable for the investor. This set is also bounded by the efficient frontier, characterized by the rational investor choosing only those portfolios that offer the maximum expected return for the specified amount of risk. And at the same time, he chooses a portfolio that provides him the minimum risk for the given amount of expected return. If the investor chooses point E, he can no longer create a better mix of stocks in his portfolio. If an investor establishes a portfolio from any combination lying on the efficient frontier, it will be the best possible portfolio combination in the given situation.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We identified this as a unique opportunity to support several companies with different needs and to aid them in their asset selection process. We developed our system that can read large amounts of data and run portfolio analyses on these assets, providing improved portfolio management and performance.
 
The system’s development commenced in early 2018, and the first version took one year of development and testing with various basic data sets. Currently, Livento has a team of three analysts who focus on the maintenance and further development of the system. We are continually developing and improving our software, making it more robust, stable, and capable of supporting an increased number of asset classes.
 
Key summary of points:
 

● | Elisee was developed and tested over four years. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Elisee has had a successful and profitable track record for three years. 
● | Elisee can process 1 TB of data in 1 hour. 
● | Elisee uses neurological network algorithms to determine and analyze large data portions.

Marketing Strategy
 
Our marketing strategy comprises the following components; social media (Twitter, LinkedIn, FB, etc.), PR and video communications, and a personal approach. The strategy differs based on the product offered. They may be described as follows:
 
Social media:
 
The BOXO brand is currently. We can rapidly, quickly, and reliantly inform all stakeholders about necessary and relevant news. We use promotional posts to gain company followers.
 
PR and video communications:
 
A professional IR agency was hired to write our PR communications, arrange interviews with Management, write articles, and introduce them via different channels to the media. Video interviews and conference attendance are also planned for more prominent investors’ involvement.
 
Personal approach:
 
Our software uses a direct and personal approach via different marketing channels, including social networks, industry liaisons, and articles in specialized magazines.
 
Employees
 
We currently have eleven employees and consultants. Three of our employees are specialized in Elisee development, three are engaged in Financial Management, and two are involved in administrative positions. The remaining employees are engaged in various management positions. We anticipate hiring additional employees or consultants over the next three months to support the growth of BOXO. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement.
Competition
 
BOXO competes with other production companies focused on movies and online streaming platforms. Our main market advantage is direct contact via the producer team to top Hollywood icons, including well-known producers, directors, actors, and distribution companies that pay BOXO before the film is finalized.
 
The competition to our software is other software products performing similar functions. We differentiate ourselves in specializing and providing a proven track record in several specific market segments, where we can offer predictive behavior of assets with and without our decision-making process.
 
In all aspects of our business, we face competition from companies with more significant resources than we have, but we have gradually and consistently grown despite this.
 
We currently occupy space within serviced office suites in New York City and Prague in the Czech Republic. Since our employees and consultants work virtually, we believe this arrangement is adequate for us and allows us to operate at a very low cost. In the future, if we require more office space, we will acquire appropriate quarters within which to operate.
