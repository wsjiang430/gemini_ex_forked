We believe integrating our patented and proprietary AI technology into its existing Supply Chain offerings will allow for automated logistics monitoring and optimization, creating operational efficiencies at higher margins for us, and our Fortune 1000 clients.
 
Our Sales Strategy
 
Our direct sales teams are supported by systems engineers averaging over twenty (20) years of experience in the mobile industry. The sales organization’s growth in-reach mirrors the addition of new products and services. Sales team members are organized by industry areas of opportunity, areas of expertise, and territory. Our sales teams are organized to address national accounts offering a broad array of unique solutions for key lines of business applications, which provides opportunities for upsell and cross sell to our clients. For the barcode label (media) business, we utilize a specialty sales force, resellers, and distributors of our manufactured private label products. For the Israeli market we have direct sales teams that are organized by industry and product line. In Israel we also offer comprehensive technical service and support which increases customer confidence and supports the sales process.
 
Salespeople are supported internally by sales support personnel, who coordinate quotes and logistics, and by members of the systems engineering group and software teams.
 
The normal sales cycle is one (1) to six (6) months, and typically involves the development of a scope of work and preparation of a ROI analysis. We use Company developed analysis templates in order to reduce the sales cycle. The analyses and proposals include information on leasing and other financing options, which helps differentiate us from our competitors. The label business sales cycles are shorter, with purchases made more frequently on a transactional basis.
 
Competition
 
The mobile system integration market is characterized by a limited number of large competitors and numerous smaller niche players. We typically pursue larger accounts and national customers, competing most often with larger channel partners. For specific solutions, we also compete with niche players who are often focused on a single industry. Hardware sales are competitive because of online retailers. We believe our consultative, integrated solutions approach is a clear differentiator for most prospective customers.
Human Capital
 
OMNIQ’s operating philosophy is our growth and continued success are the result of management and employees working together in a spirit of cooperation and teamwork. Our core values emphasize an environment where safety, diversity, inclusion, talent development, training, and retention are top priorities. This has enabled us to meet various challenges over the years. The progress that has been achieved by us reflects this strong mutual commitment between the Company and its employees. We believe our employees are our greatest asset. We remain focused on furnishing friendly and safe working conditions, providing competitive pay, offering quality benefits, and producing revenue for the continued growth of the Company and the communities in which we operate. All of this with an emphasis on the welfare of our employees and their families. We realize our success is a direct result of the hard work and dedication of our employees. Each employee at OMNIQ is a contributing partner in our future growth and we strive to maintain a mutually beneficial workplace culture that also fosters the professional development of each employee.
