(b) | Business of Issuer
----+-------------------

 
Reynaldos Mexican Food Company, Inc. is a developmental stage company, incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on October 24, 1984. Our plan of business has not been implemented but will involves
 
The Company’s operations consist of a search for a merger, acquisition, reverse merger or a business transaction opportunity with an operating business or other financial transaction; however, there can be no assurance that this plan will be successfully implemented. Until a transaction is effectuated, the Company does not expect to have significant operations. At this time, the Company has no arrangements or understandings with respect to any potential merger, acquisition, reverse merger or business combination candidate pursuant to which the Company may become an operating company.
 
Opportunities may come to the Company’s attention from various sources, including our management, our stockholders, professional advisors, securities broker dealers, venture capitalists and private equity funds, members of the financial community and others who may present unsolicited proposals. At this time, the Company has no plans, understandings, agreements, or commitments with any individual or entity to act as a finder in regard to any business opportunities. While it is not currently anticipated that the Company will engage unaffiliated professional firms specializing in business acquisitions, reorganizations or other such transactions, such firms may be retained if such arrangements are deemed to be in the best interest of the Company. Compensation to a finder or business acquisition firm may take various forms, including one-time cash payments, payments involving issuance of securities (including those of the Company), or any combination of these or other compensation arrangements. Consequently, the Company is currently unable to predict the cost of utilizing such services.

The Company has not restricted its search to any particular business, industry, or geographical location. In evaluating a potential transaction, the Company analyzes all available factors and make a determination based on a composite of available facts, without reliance on any single factor.
 
 It is not possible at this time to predict the nature of a transaction in which the Company may participate. Specific business opportunities would be reviewed as well as the respective needs and desires of the Company and the legal structure or method deemed by management to be suitable would be selected. In implementing a structure for a particular transaction, the Company may become a party to a merger, consolidation, reorganization, tender offer, joint venture, license, purchase and sale of assets, or purchase and sale of stock, or other arrangement the exact nature of which cannot now be predicted. Additionally, the Company may act directly or indirectly through an interest in a partnership, corporation or other form of organization. Implementing such structure may require the merger, consolidation, or reorganization of the Company with other business organizations and there is no assurance that the Company would be the surviving entity. In addition, our present management and stockholders may not have control of a majority of the voting shares of the Company following reorganization or other financial transaction. As part of such a transaction, some or all of the Company’s existing directors may resign and new directors may be appointed. The Company’s operations following the consummation of a transaction will be dependent on the nature of the transaction. There may also be various risks inherent in the transaction, the nature and magnitude of which cannot be predicted.
 
The Company may also be subject to increased governmental regulation following a transaction; however, it is not possible at this time to predict the nature or magnitude of such increased regulation, if any.
 
The Company expects to continue to incur moderate losses each quarter until a transaction considered appropriate by management is effectuate.
 
At present financial revenue has not yet been realized. The Company hopes to raise capital in order to fund the acquisitions.
 
All statements involving our business plan are forward looking statements and have not been implemented as of this filing.
 
The Company is moving in a new direction, statements made relating to our business plan are forward looking statements and we have no history of performance. Current management does not have any experience in acquisition of companies but is actively looking for a suitable person to incorporate into the management team.
 
The analysis will be undertaken by or under the supervision of our management. As of the date of this filing, we have not entered into definitive agreements. In our continued efforts to analyze potential business plan, we intend to consider the following factors:
 

· | Potential for growth, indicated by anticipated market expansion or new technology; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Competitive position as compared to other businesses of similar size and experience within our contemplated segment as well as within the industry as a whole; 
· | Strength and diversity of management, and the accessibility of required management expertise, personnel, services, professional assistance and other required items; 
· | Capital requirements and anticipated availability of required funds, to be provided by the Company or from operations, through the sale of additional securities or convertible debt, through joint ventures or similar arrangements or from other sources;
· | The extent to which the business opportunity can be advanced in our contemplated marketplace; and 
· | Other relevant factors

In applying the foregoing criteria, management will attempt to analyze all factors and circumstances and make a determination based upon reasonable investigative measures and available data. Due to our limited capital available for investigation, we may not discover or adequately evaluate adverse facts about the opportunity to be acquired. Additionally, we will be competing against other entities that may have greater financial, technical, and managerial capabilities for identifying and completing our business plan.
 
We are unable to predict when we will, if ever, identify and implement a business plan. We anticipate that proposed business plan would be made available to us through personal contacts of our directors, officers and principal stockholders, professional advisors, broker-dealers, venture capitalists, members of the financial community and others who may present unsolicited proposals. In certain cases, we may agree to pay a finder’s fee or to otherwise compensate the persons who introduce the Company to business opportunities in which we participate.
 
We expect that our due diligence will encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management of the target business and inspection of its facilities, as necessary, as well as a review of financial and other information, which is made available to the Company. This due diligence review will be conducted either by our management or by third parties we may engage. We anticipate that we may rely on the issuance of our common stock in lieu of cash payments for services or expenses related to any analysis.
 
We may incur time and costs required to select and evaluate our business structure and complete our business plan, which cannot presently be determined with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the indemnification and evaluation of a prospective business that is not ultimately completed may result in a loss to the Company. These fees may include legal costs, accounting costs, finder’s fees, consultant’s fees and other related expenses. We have no present arrangements for any of these types of fees.
 
We anticipate that the investigation of specific business opportunities and the negotiation, drafting and execution of relevant agreements, disclosure documents and other instruments will require substantial management time and attention and substantial cost for accountants, attorneys, consultants, and others. Costs may be incurred in the investigation process, which may not be recoverable. Furthermore, even if an agreement is reached for the participation in a specific business opportunity, the failure to consummate that transaction may result in a loss to the Company of the related costs incurred.
 
As of the time of this filing, the Company has not implemented a business combination. Our business plan is to merge with, or acquire, an operating entity that offers product or service growth potential. We are actively looking for a suitable merger candidate and evaluating potential target companies that align with our business plan. This will require review of financials, products and management of the merger candidate. We anticipate the review process could take up to 30 days after a viable candidate is located.
 
Competition
 
Reynaldos Mexican Food Company, Inc. is in direct competition with many other entities in its efforts to locate a suitable transaction. Included in the competition are business development companies, special purpose acquisition companies (“SPACs”), venture capital firms, small business investment companies, venture capital affiliates of industrial and financial companies, broker-dealers and investment bankers, management consultant firms and private individual investors. Many of these entities possess greater financial resources and are able to assume greater risks than those which Reynaldos Mexican Food Company, Inc. could consider. Many of these competing entities also possess significantly greater experience and contacts than Reynaldos Mexican Food Company, Inc.’s management. Moreover, the Company also competes with numerous other companies similar to it for such opportunities.

Preliminary copies of this information must be submitted to the SEC at least 10 days prior to the date that definitive copies of this information are provided to our stockholders.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2022, we had two officers, two directors and no employees. We anticipate that we will begin to fill out our management team as and when we raise capital to begin implementing our business plan. In the interim, we will utilize independent consultants to assist with accounting and administrative matters. We currently have no employment agreements and believe our consulting relationships are satisfactory. We plan to continue to hire independent consultants from time to time on an as-needed basis.
