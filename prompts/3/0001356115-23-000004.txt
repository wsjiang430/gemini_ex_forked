Primary Investment Objective
As a diversified REIT, the Company’s primary investment objective is to provide both current income and capital appreciation. The Company seeks to achieve this objective through its focus on investing across the capital structure in various commercial real estate property types. Target underlying property types primarily include, but are not limited to, SFR, multifamily, self-storage, life science, office, industrial, hospitality, net lease and retail. The Company may, to a limited extent, hold, acquire or transact in certain non-real estate securities.
The Company focuses on opportunistic investments in real estate properties with a value-add component and real estate credit with the objective to increase the cash flow and value of our properties, acquire properties with cash flow growth potential and achieve capital appreciation for shareholders through a value-add program. The Company pursues real estate credit investments based on where the Adviser believes the various real estate subsectors are performing within the broader real estate cycle and tactically allocates its investments among these opportunities.
The Company believes that a diversified investment approach is appropriate for the current market environment. However, to capitalize on investment opportunities at different times in the economic and real estate investment cycle, the Company may change its investment strategy from time to time. The Company believes that the flexibility of the Company's investment strategy and the experience and resources of the Adviser and its affiliates will allow the Company to take advantage of changing market conditions to provide both current income and generate capital appreciation. The Board is able to modify the Company's strategies to the extent it determines it is in Company's best interest.
Target Investments
We invest primarily in commercial real estate, including operating properties and common equity but also including, but not limited to, mortgage debt, mezzanine debt and preferred equity:
• Operating Properties: We make investments in operating properties with a value-add component, including but not limited to retail, hospitality, and office space rented from the Company and land for development. 
• Common Equity: We make investments in common equity in publicly traded companies and privately held entities focused on investment in real estate across a range of underlying property types.
• Mortgage Debt: We expect that we may make investments in mortgage debt on real estate properties. The loans may vary in duration, bear interest at a fixed or floating rate and amortize, typically with a balloon payment of principal at maturity. These investments may include whole loans or pari passu participations within such mortgage debt.
• Mezzanine Loans: We expect that we may originate or acquire mezzanine loans. These loans are generally subordinate to the other mortgage debt on a property, but senior to the equity of the borrower. These loans are not secured by the underlying real estate, but generally can be converted into preferred equity of the mortgage borrower or owner of a mortgage borrower, as applicable.
• Preferred Equity: We expect that we may make investments that are subordinate to any mortgage or mezzanine loan, but senior to the common equity of the borrower. Preferred equity investments typically receive a preferred return from the issuer’s cash flow rather than interest payments and often have the right for such preferred return to accrue if there is insufficient cash flow for current payment. These investments are not secured by the underlying real estate, but upon the occurrence of a default, the preferred equity provider typically has the right to effect a change of control with respect to the ownership of the property.
In addition to investments in real estate, the Company may, to a limited extent, hold, acquire or transact in certain non-real estate securities. The Company’s non-real estate investments include its ownership of common equity, preferred equity, loans, CLOs, rights and warrants, U.S. life settlement contracts, convertible notes and bonds from a number of diverse issuers and investment vehicles, including litigation claims and midband spectrum frequency licenses.
Our Financing Strategy
While we do not have any formal restrictions or policy with respect to our debt-to-equity leverage ratio, we currently expect that our leverage will not exceed a ratio of 3-to-l. We believe this leverage ratio is prudent given that leverage typically exists at the asset level. The amount of leverage we may employ for particular assets depends upon the availability of particular types of financing and our Adviser’s assessment of the credit, liquidity, price volatility and other risks of those assets and financing counterparties. Our decision to use leverage to finance our assets is at the discretion of our Adviser, subject to review by our Board, and is not subject to the approval of our shareholders. We generally intend to match leverage term and structure to that of the underlying investment financed. For additional information on sources of and trends regarding our liquidity, see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources.”
Our Structure
The following chart shows our ownership structure as of the date hereof:
(1) The Portfolio may be held directly or through one or more intermediate entities.
Our Adviser
The Company is externally managed by the Adviser, through an agreement dated July 1, 2022, amended on October 25, 2022 (the “Advisory Agreement”), by and among the Company and the Adviser for an initial three-year term that will expire on July 1, 2025 and successive one-year terms thereafter unless earlier terminated. The Adviser manages the day-to-day operations of the Company and provides investment management services. All of the Company’s investment decisions are made by the Adviser, subject to general oversight by the Adviser’s investment committee and the Company’s Board. The Adviser is wholly owned by our Sponsor. The members of our Adviser’s investment committee are James Dondero, Matt McGraner, Matthew Goetz, and Brian Mitts.
Our Advisory Agreement
We pay our Adviser annual fees. We do not pay any incentive fees to our Adviser. We also generally reimburse our Adviser for operating or offering expenses it incurs on our behalf or in connection with the services it performs for us. 
Direct payment of operating expenses by us together with reimbursement of operating expenses to the Adviser, plus compensation expenses relating to equity awards granted under a long-term incentive plan and all other corporate general and administrative expenses of the Company, including the Fees (defined below) payable under the Advisory Agreement, may not exceed 1.5% (the “Expense Cap”) of Managed Assets (defined below), calculated as of the end of each quarter, for the twelve-month period following the Company’s receipt of the Deregistration Order; provided, however, that this limitation will not apply to Offering Expenses (defined below), legal, accounting, financial, due diligence and other service fees incurred in connection with extraordinary litigation and mergers and acquisitions or other events outside the ordinary course of our business or any out-of-pocket acquisition or due diligence expenses incurred in connection with the acquisition or disposition of certain real estate-related investments; provided, further, in the event the Company consolidates another entity that it does not wholly own as a result of owning a controlling interest in such entity or otherwise, expenses will be calculated without giving effect to such consolidation and instead such entity’s expenses will, on a pro rata basis consistent with the Company’s percentage ownership, be considered those of the Company for purposes of calculation of expenses. The Adviser may, at its discretion and at any time, waive its right to reimbursement for eligible out-of-pocket expenses paid on the Company’s behalf. Once waived, these expenses are considered permanently waived and become non-recoupable in the future.
Under the terms of the Advisory Agreement, our Adviser will, among other things:
•identify, evaluate and negotiate the structure of our investments (including performing due diligence);
•find, present and recommend investment opportunities consistent with our investment policies and objectives;
•structure the terms and conditions of our investments;
•review and analyze financial information for each investment in our overall Portfolio;
•close, monitor and administer our investments; and
•identify debt and equity capital needs and procure the necessary capital.
As consideration for the Adviser’s services under the Advisory Agreement, we pay our Adviser an annual fee (the “Advisory Fee”) of 1.00% of Managed Assets and an annual fee (the “Administrative Fee” and, together with the Advisory Fee, the “Fees”) of 0.20% of the Company’s Managed Assets. The Advisory Agreement provides that the first portion of the monthly installment of the Advisory Fee shall be paid in cash up to $1.0 million and the remainder of the monthly installment of the Advisory Fee, if any, shall be paid in common shares of the Company, subject to certain restrictions related to maintaining the Company’s status as a REIT and compliance with federal securities laws and rules promulgated by the New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”). In addition, in no event will the common shares issued to the Adviser under the Advisory Agreement exceed five percent of the number of common shares or five percent of the voting power of the Company outstanding prior to the first such issuance. The number of common shares payable to the Adviser under the Advisory Agreement as a portion of the Advisory Fee shall equal (i) the total dollar amount of the monthly installment of the Advisory Fee payable minus the $1.0 million cash portion of the monthly installment of the Advisory Fee divided by (ii) the volume-weighted average price per share for the 10 trading days prior to the end of the month for which the Fees will be paid. The Fees shall be payable independent of the performance of the Company or its investments. The Advisory Agreement also provides that the Administrative Fee shall be paid in cash.
Under the Advisory Agreement, “Managed Assets” means an amount equal to the total assets of the Company, including any form of leverage, minus all accrued expenses incurred in the normal course of operations, but not excluding any liabilities or obligations attributable to leverage obtained through (i) indebtedness of any type (including, without limitation, borrowing to purchase or develop real estate or other investments, borrowing through a credit facility, or the issuance of debt securities), (ii) the issuance of preferred shares or other preference securities, (iii) the reinvestment of collateral received for securities loaned in accordance with the Company’s investment objectives and policies, and/or (iv) any other means. In the event the Company holds collateralized mortgage-backed securities (“CMBS”) where the Company holds the controlling tranche of the securitization and is required to consolidate under generally accepted accounting principles all assets and liabilities of a specific CMBS trust, the consolidated assets and liabilities of the consolidated trust will be netted to calculate the allowable amount to be included as Managed Assets. In addition, in the event the Company consolidates another person it does not wholly own as a result of owning a controlling interest in such person or otherwise, Managed Assets will be calculated without giving effect to such consolidation and instead such person’s assets, leverage, expenses, liabilities and obligations will, on a pro rata basis consistent with the Company’s percentage ownership, be considered those of the Company for purposes of calculation of Managed Assets. The Adviser computes Managed Assets as of the end of each fiscal quarter and then computes each installment of the Fees as promptly as possible after the end of the month with respect to which such installment is payable.
Incentive compensation may be payable to our executive officers and certain other employees of our Adviser or its affiliates pursuant to a long-term incentive plan adopted by us and approved by our shareholders. Compensation expense is generally not considered when calculating Managed Assets.
We are required to pay directly or reimburse the Adviser for all of the documented “operating expenses” (all out-of-pocket expenses of the Adviser in performing services for us, including but not limited to the expenses incurred by the Adviser in connection with any provision by the Adviser of legal, accounting, financial, due diligence, investor relations or other services performed by the Adviser that outside professionals or outside consultants would otherwise perform and our pro rata share of rent, telephone, utilities, office furniture, equipment, machinery or other office, internal and overhead expenses of the Adviser required for our operations) and any and all expenses (other than underwriters’ discounts) paid or to be paid by us in connection with an offering of our securities, including, without limitation, our legal, accounting, printing, mailing and filing fees and other documented offering expenses (collectively, “Offering Expenses”), paid or incurred by the Adviser or its affiliates in connection with the services it provides to us pursuant to the Advisory Agreement. Direct payment of operating expenses by us together with reimbursement of operating expenses to the Adviser, plus compensation expenses relating to equity awards granted under a long-term incentive plan and all other corporate general and administrative expenses of the Company, including the Fees payable under the Advisory Agreement, may not exceed the Expense Cap of 1.5% of Managed Assets, calculated as of the end of each quarter, for the twelve-month period following the Company’s receipt of the Deregistration Order; provided, however, that this limitation will not apply to Offering Expenses, legal, accounting, financial, due diligence and other service fees incurred in connection with extraordinary litigation and mergers and acquisitions or other events outside the ordinary course of our business or any out-of-pocket acquisition or due diligence expenses incurred in connection with the acquisition or disposition of certain real estate-related investments; provided, further, in the event the Company consolidates another entity that it does not wholly own as a result of owning a controlling interest in such entity or otherwise, expenses will be calculated without giving effect to such consolidation and instead such entity’s expenses will, on a pro rata basis consistent with the Company’s percentage ownership, be considered those of the Company for purposes of calculation of expenses. The Adviser may, at its discretion and at any time, waive its right to reimbursement for eligible out-of-pocket expenses paid on the Company’s behalf. Once waived, these expenses are considered permanently waived and become non-recoupable in the future.
The Advisory Agreement has an initial term of three years that will expire on July 1, 2025 and successive additional one-year terms thereafter unless earlier terminated. We have the right to terminate the Advisory Agreement on 30 days’ written notice upon the occurrence of a cause event (as defined in the Advisory Agreement). The Advisory Agreement can be terminated by us or the Adviser without cause upon the expiration of the then-current term with at least 180 days’ written notice to the other party prior to the expiration of such term. The Adviser may also terminate the agreement with 30 days’ written notice if we have materially breached the agreement and such breach has continued for 30 days before we are given such notice. In addition, the Advisory Agreement will automatically terminate in the event of Advisers Act Assignment (as defined in the Advisory Agreement) unless we provide written consent. A termination fee will be payable to the Adviser by us upon termination of the Advisory Agreement for any reason, including non-renewal, other than a termination by us upon the occurrence of a cause event or due to an Advisers Act Assignment. The termination fee will be equal to three times the Fees earned by the Adviser during the twelve-month period immediately preceding the most recently completed calendar quarter prior to the effective termination date; provided, however, if the Advisory Agreement is terminated prior to the one year anniversary of the date of the Advisory Agreement, the Fees earned during such period will be annualized for purposes of calculating the Fees.
Under the terms of the Advisory Agreement, the Adviser will indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its subsidiaries, including the OP, from all claims, liabilities, damages, losses, costs and expenses, including amounts paid in satisfaction of judgments, in compromises and settlements, as fines and penalties and legal or other costs and expenses of investigating or defending against any claim or alleged claim, of any nature whatsoever, known or unknown, liquidated or unliquidated, that are incurred by reason of the Adviser’s bad faith, fraud, willful misfeasance, intentional misconduct, gross negligence or reckless disregard of its duties; provided, however, that the Adviser will not be held responsible for any action of our Board in following or declining to follow any written advice or written recommendation given by the Adviser. However, the aggregate maximum amount that the Adviser may be liable to us pursuant to the Advisory Agreement will, to the extent not prohibited by law, never exceed the amount of the Advisory Fees received by the Adviser under the Advisory Agreement prior to the date that the acts or omissions giving rise to a claim for indemnification or liability have occurred. In addition, the Adviser will not be liable for special, exemplary, punitive, indirect, or consequential loss, or damage of any kind whatsoever, including without limitation lost profits. The limitations described in the preceding two sentences will not apply, however, to the extent such damages are determined in a final binding non-appealable court or arbitration proceeding to result from the bad faith, fraud, willful misfeasance, intentional misconduct, gross negligence or reckless disregard of the Adviser’s duties.
The Adviser and its affiliates expect to engage in other business ventures, and as a result, their resources will not be dedicated exclusively to our business. However, pursuant to the Advisory Agreement, the Adviser is required to devote sufficient resources to our administration to discharge its obligations under the Advisory Agreement.
Management of Operating Properties
The Company’s operating properties, other than undeveloped land, are managed by NexVest Realty Advisors, LLC (“NexVest”), an affiliate of the Adviser. The property management agreement with NexVest for the retail property in Lubbock, Texas is dated January 1, 2014 and has a fixed fee of $750 per month. The property management agreement with NexVest for Cityplace Tower is dated August 15, 2018, and the management fee is calculated on 3% of gross revenues, with a minimum fee of $20,000 per month. The property management agreement with NexVest for the White Rock Center is dated June 1, 2013, and the management fee is calculated on 4% of gross receipts, payable monthly.
Management of Life Settlement Contracts
The Company’s investments in U.S. life settlement contracts through SFP, a wholly owned Irish Designated Activity Company, are managed by NexAnnuity Asset Management, L.P. (“NexAnnuity”), an affiliate of the Adviser. SFP acquires life settlement contracts funded by the issuance of debt securities (the “Structured Note”) purchased by the Company and utilizes proceeds from maturing life settlement contracts to repay the Structured Note and to further invest in life settlement contracts. The management agreement (the “SFP IMA”) with NexAnnuity provides that NexAnnuity will receive a management fee (the “SFP Management Fee”) paid monthly in an amount equal to 1.0% of the average weekly value of an amount equal to the total assets of SFP, including any form of leverage, minus all accrued expenses incurred in the normal course of operations, but not excluding any liabilities or obligations attributable to investment leverage obtained through (i) indebtedness of any type (including, without limitation, borrowing through a credit facility or the issuance of debt securities), (ii) the issuance of preferred stock or other preference securities, (iii) the reinvestment of collateral received for securities loaned in accordance with the investment objective, investment guidelines and policies under the SFP IMA, and/or (iv) any other means, plus any value added tax or any other applicable tax, if any, thereon. NexAnnuity may waive all or a portion of the SFP Management Fee. For the year ended December 31, 2022, NexAnnuity did not waive any portion of the SFP Management Fee.
Competition
Our profitability depends, in large part, on our ability to acquire investments in commercial real estate at attractive prices. We are subject to significant competition in acquiring these investments. In particular, we will compete with a variety of institutional investors, including other REITs, specialty finance companies, public and private funds, commercial and investment banks, hedge funds, mortgage bankers, commercial finance and insurance companies, governmental bodies and other financial institutions, as well as developers, owners, and operators of real estate. We may also compete with our Sponsor and its affiliates for investment opportunities. There are significant potential conflicts of interest that could affect our investment returns. In addition, there are several REITs with similar investment objectives and others may be organized in the future. These other REITs will increase competition for the available supply of commercial real estate investments, including operating properties, common equity mortgage debt, mezzanine debt, preferred equity and other real estate related assets suitable for investment. Some of our anticipated competitors have greater financial resources, different cost structures, access to lower costs of capital and access to funding sources that may not be available to us, such as funding from the U.S. government, if we are not eligible to participate in programs established by the U.S. government. In addition, some of our competitors are not subject to the operating constraints associated with REIT tax compliance or maintenance of an exclusion or exemption from the Investment Company Act. Furthermore, some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments, or pay higher prices, than we can. Current market conditions may attract more competitors, which may increase the competition for our investments. An increase in the competition for such assets may decrease the availability or increase the price of such assets, which may limit our ability to generate attractive risk-adjusted current income and capital appreciation for our shareholders, thereby adversely affecting the market price of our common shares.
In addition, with respect to our operating properties, we compete for tenants based on a number of factors, including location, rental rates, security, flexibility, and expertise to design space to meet prospective tenants’ needs and the manner in which the property is operated, maintained, and marketed. As leases at our properties expire, we may encounter significant competition to renew or re-lease space in light of the large number of competing properties within the markets in which we operate. As a result, we may be required to provide rent concessions or abatements, incur charges for tenant improvements and other inducements, including early termination rights or below-market renewal options, or we may not be able to timely lease vacant space.
In the face of this competition, we expect to have access to our Sponsor’s professionals and their industry experience, which we believe will provide us with a competitive advantage and help us assess investment risks and determine appropriate pricing for potential investments. We expect that these relationships will enable us to compete more efficiently and effectively for attractive investment opportunities. Although we believe we are well positioned to compete effectively, there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve our business goals or expectations due to the extensive 
competition in our market sector. We operate in a competitive market for investment opportunities and future competition may limit our ability to acquire desirable investments in commercial real estate and could also affect the pricing of our securities.
Operating and Regulatory Structure
General
Our operating properties are subject to various laws, ordinances and regulations, including those relating to fire and safety requirements, and affirmative and negative covenants and, in some instances, common area obligations. We believe that each of the operating properties in our Portfolio has the necessary permits and approvals.
Americans with Disabilities Act
Our operating properties must comply with Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (the “ADA”), to the extent that such properties are “public accommodations” as defined by the ADA. The ADA may require removal of structural barriers to access by persons with disabilities in certain public areas of our operating properties where such removal is readily achievable. In addition, under the ADA, alterations to a place of public accommodation or a commercial facility are to be made so that, to the maximum extent feasible, such altered portions are readily accessible to and usable by disabled individuals. The readily achievable standard considers, among other factors, the financial resources of the affected site and the owner, lessor or other applicable person. 
Compliance with the ADA, as well as other federal, state and local laws, may require modifications to operating properties we currently own or may purchase or may restrict renovations of those properties. Failure to comply with these laws or regulations could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants, as well as the incurrence of the costs of making modifications to attain compliance, and future legislation could impose additional obligations or restrictions on our operating properties. We could be held liable as the owner of the property for a failure of one of our tenants to comply with these laws or regulations.
We believe that our operating properties are in substantial compliance with the ADA and that substantial capital expenditures to address the requirements of the ADA will not be required. However, noncompliance with the ADA could result in imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants. The obligation to make readily accessible accommodations is an ongoing one, and we will continue to assess our operating properties and make alterations as appropriate in this respect.
Environmental Matters
Under various federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the environment, as a current or former owner or operator of real property, we may be liable for costs and damages resulting from the presence or discharge of hazardous or toxic substances, waste or petroleum products at, on, in, under, or migrating from such property, including costs to investigate and clean up such contamination and liability for harm to natural resources. Such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of such contamination, and the liability may be joint and several. These liabilities could be substantial and the cost of any required remediation, removal, fines, or other costs could exceed the value of the property and/or our aggregate assets. In addition, the presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination at our operating properties may expose us to third-party liability for costs of remediation and/or personal or property damage or materially adversely affect our ability to sell, lease or develop our operating properties or to borrow using the properties as collateral. In addition, environmental laws may create liens on contaminated sites in favor of the government for damages and costs it incurs to address such contamination. Moreover, if contamination is discovered on our operating properties, environmental laws may impose restrictions on the manner in which property may be used or businesses may be operated, and these restrictions may require substantial expenditures.
Independent environmental consultants have conducted Phase I environmental site assessments at all of our operating properties, including undeveloped land, in our Portfolio. A Phase I environmental site assessment is a report that identifies potential or existing environmental contamination liabilities. Site assessments are intended to discover and evaluate information regarding the environmental condition of the assessed property and surrounding properties. These assessments do not generally include soil samplings, subsurface investigations or an asbestos survey. None of the site assessments identified any known past or present contamination that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business, assets or operations. However, the assessments are limited in scope and may have failed to identify all environmental conditions or concerns. A prior owner or operator of a property or historic operations at our operating properties, or operations and conditions at nearby properties, may have created a material environmental condition that is not known to us or the independent consultants preparing the site assessments. Material environmental conditions may have arisen after 
the review was completed or may arise in the future, and future laws, ordinances or regulations may impose material additional environmental liability. Moreover, conditions identified in environmental assessments that did not appear material at that time, may in the future result in material liability.
Environmental laws also govern the presence, maintenance and removal of hazardous materials in building materials (e.g., asbestos and lead), and may impose fines and penalties for failure to comply with these requirements or expose us to third-party liability (e.g., liability for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos). Such laws require that owners or operators of buildings containing hazardous materials properly manage and maintain certain hazardous materials, adequately notify or train those who may come into contact with certain hazardous materials, and undertake special precautions, including removal or other abatement, if certain hazardous materials would be disturbed during renovation or demolition of a building. In addition, the operating properties in our Portfolio are subject to various federal, state, and local environmental and health and safety requirements, such as state and local fire requirements.
When excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials, mold growth may occur, particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time. Some molds may produce airborne toxins or irritants. Indoor air quality issues can also stem from inadequate ventilation, chemical contamination from indoor or outdoor sources, and other biological contaminants such as pollen, viruses and bacteria. Indoor exposure to airborne toxins or irritants above certain levels can be alleged to cause a variety of adverse health effects and symptoms, including allergic or other reactions. As a result, the presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants at any of our operating properties could require us to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold or other airborne contaminants from the affected property or increase indoor ventilation. In addition, the presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants could expose us to liability from our tenants, employees of our tenants or others if property damage or personal injury occurs. We are not presently aware of any material adverse indoor air quality issues at our operating properties.
Generally, the leases with respect to our office and retail operating properties require the lessee to comply with environmental law and provide that the lessee will indemnify us for any loss or expense we incur as a result of the lessee’s violation of environmental law or the presence, use or release of hazardous materials on our operating property attributable to the lessee. If our lessees do not comply with environmental law, or we are unable to enforce the indemnification obligations of our lessees, our results of operations would be adversely affected.
We believe that there are no compliance issues with laws and regulations that have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, that have adversely affected, or are reasonably expected to adversely affect, our business, financial condition and results of operations, and we do not currently anticipate material capital expenditures arising from environmental regulation. We believe that climate change could present risks to our business. Some of the potential impacts of climate change to our business include increased operating costs due to additional regulatory requirements and the risk of disruptions to our business. We do not believe these risks are material to our business at this time. Our currently anticipated capital expenditures for environmental control facility matters are not material.
The cost of future environmental compliance may materially and adversely affect us. We cannot predict what other environmental legislation or regulations will be enacted in the future, how existing or future laws or regulations will be administered or interpreted or what environmental conditions may be found to exist on our properties in the future. Compliance with existing and new laws and regulations may require us or our tenants to spend funds to remedy environmental problems. If we or our tenants were to become subject to significant environmental liabilities, we could be materially and adversely affected. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors— We are subject to certain risks associated with investing in real estate, including potential liabilities under environmental laws and risks of loss from weather conditions, man-made or natural disasters, climate change and terrorism.”
Insurance
We carry comprehensive general liability coverage on the operating properties in our Portfolio, with limits of liability customary within the industry to insure against liability claims and related defense costs. Similarly, we are insured against the risk of direct physical damage in amounts necessary to reimburse us on a replacement-cost basis for costs incurred to repair or rebuild each property, including loss of rental income during the reconstruction period. Our property policies include coverage for the perils of flood, tornado and earthquake shock with limits and deductibles customary in the industry and specific to the project. We will also obtain title insurance policies when acquiring new properties, which insure fee title to the properties in our Portfolio. We have obtained coverage for losses incurred in connection with both domestic and foreign terrorist-related activities. These policies include limits and terms we consider commercially reasonable. There are certain losses (including, but not limited to, losses arising from environmental conditions, acts of war or certain kinds of terrorist attacks) that are not insured, in full or in part, because they are either uninsurable or the cost of insurance makes it, in our belief, economically impractical to maintain such coverage. Should an uninsured loss arise 
against us, we would be required to use our own funds to resolve the issue, including litigation costs. In addition, for the operating properties in our Portfolio, we could self-insure certain portions of our insurance program and therefore, use our own funds to satisfy those limits. We believe the policy specifications and insured limits are adequate given the relative risk of loss, the cost of the coverage and industry practice. In the opinion of our management team, the operating properties in our Portfolio are adequately insured.
REIT Qualification
We have to be treated as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, beginning with our taxable year ended December 31, 2021. We believe that we have been organized in conformity with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), and that our intended manner of operation will enable us to meet the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT. However, we cannot assure you that we will qualify and remain qualified as a REIT. To qualify as a REIT, we must meet on a continuing basis, through our organization and actual investment and operating results, various requirements under the Code relating to, among other things, the sources of our gross income, the composition and values of our assets, our distribution levels and the diversity of ownership of our shares. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year and do not qualify for certain statutory relief provisions, we will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at corporate rates and may be precluded from qualifying as a REIT for the subsequent four taxable years following the year during which we failed to qualify as a REIT. Even if we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we may be subject to some U.S. federal, state and local taxes on our income or property or REIT “prohibited transactions” taxes with respect to certain of our activities. Any distributions paid by us generally will not be eligible for taxation at the preferred U.S. federal income tax rates that apply to certain distributions received by individuals from taxable corporations.
Investment Company Act Exclusion
We, as well as our subsidiaries, intend to conduct our operations so that we are not required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the Investment Company Act defines an investment company as any issuer that is or holds itself out as being engaged primarily, or proposes to engage primarily, in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities. Section 3(a)(1)(C) of the Investment Company Act defines an investment company as any issuer that is engaged or proposes to engage in the business of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding or trading in securities and owns or proposes to acquire investment securities having a value exceeding 40% of the value of the issuer’s total assets (exclusive of U.S. Government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis, which we refer to as the 40% test. Excluded from the term “investment securities,” among other things, are U.S. Government securities and securities issued by majority-owned subsidiaries that are not themselves investment companies and are not relying on the exclusion from the definition of investment company set forth in Section 3(c)(1) or Section 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act.
We are organized as a holding company and conduct our business primarily through our OP and through subsidiaries of our OP. We anticipate that our OP will always be at least a majority-owned subsidiary. We intend to conduct our operations so that neither we nor our OP will hold investment securities in excess of the limit imposed by the 40% test. The securities issued by any wholly owned or majority-owned subsidiaries that we may form in the future that are excluded from the definition of “investment company” based on Section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act, together with any other investment securities we may own, may not have a value in excess of 40% of the value of our total assets (exclusive of U.S. government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis. We will monitor our holdings to ensure continuing and ongoing compliance with this test. In addition, we believe that neither we nor our OP are considered an investment company under Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the Investment Company Act because neither of us engage primarily, propose to engage primarily, or hold ourselves out as being engaged primarily in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities. Rather, we and our OP are primarily engaged in the non-investment company businesses of our subsidiaries.
We anticipate that certain of our subsidiaries will meet the requirements of the exclusion set forth in Section 3(c)(5)(C) of the Investment Company Act, which excludes entities primarily engaged in the business of “purchasing or otherwise acquiring mortgages and other liens on and interests in real estate.” To meet this exclusion, the SEC staff has taken the position that at least 55% of a subsidiary’s assets must constitute qualifying assets (as interpreted by the SEC staff under the Investment Company Act) and at least another 25% of assets (subject to reduction to the extent the subsidiary invested more than 55% of its total assets in qualifying assets) must constitute real estate-related assets under the Investment Company Act (and no more than 20% comprised of miscellaneous assets). In general, we also expect, with regard to our subsidiaries relying on Section 3(c)(5)(C), to rely on other guidance published by the SEC staff and on our analyses of guidance published with respect to other types of assets to determine which assets are qualifying assets and real estate-related assets. Maintaining the Section 3(c)(5)(C) exclusion, however, will limit our ability to make certain investments.
Smaller Reporting Company Status
We are a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Regulation S-K under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and may elect to take advantage of certain of the scaled disclosures available to smaller reporting companies. 
Human Capital Disclosure
We are externally managed by our Adviser pursuant to the Advisory Agreement between us and our Adviser. All of our executive officers are employees of our Adviser or its affiliates. As of December 31, 2022, we had no employees.
COVID-19 Pandemic Updates
For information on the effects that the COVID-19 pandemic has had on our business, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors— The current COVID-19 pandemic or the future outbreak of other highly infectious or contagious diseases could materially and adversely impact or disrupt our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and performance.”
