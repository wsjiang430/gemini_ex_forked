Item 1. Business.
General
 
Power REIT (the “Registrant” or the “Trust”, and together with its consolidated subsidiaries, “we”, “us”, or “Power REIT”, unless the context requires otherwise) is a Maryland-domiciled, internally-managed real estate investment trust (a “REIT”) that owns a portfolio of real estate assets related to transportation, energy infrastructure and Controlled Environment Agriculture (“CEA”) in the United States.
 
The Trust is structured as a holding company and owns its assets through twenty-five direct and indirect wholly-owned, special purpose subsidiaries that have been formed in order to hold real estate assets, obtain financing and generate lease revenue. As of December 31, 2022, the Trust’s assets consisted of approximately 112 miles of railroad infrastructure and related real estate which is owned by its subsidiary Pittsburgh & West Virginia Railroad (“P&WV”), approximately 601 acres of fee simple land leased to a number of utility scale solar power generating projects with an aggregate generating capacity of approximately 108 Megawatts (“MW”) and approximately 263 acres of land with approximately 2,211,000 square feet of existing or under construction CEA properties in the form of greenhouses.
 
In 2019, we expanded the focus of our real estate activities to include CEA properties in the form of greenhouses in the United States. CEA is an innovative method of growing plants that involves creating optimized growing environments for a given crop indoors. Power REIT is focused on CEA in the form of greenhouses which use approximately 70% less energy than indoor growing, 95% less water usage than outdoor growing, and does not have any agricultural runoff of fertilizers or pesticides. We believe greenhouse cultivation represents a sustainable solution from both a business and environmental perspective. Certain of our greenhouse properties are operated for the cultivation of cannabis by state-licensed operators. During 2022 we acquired a greenhouse focused on the cultivation of tomatoes. Unfortunately, the market for tomatoes compressed and the tenant was unable to meet its financial obligations and has vacated the property. We typically enter into long-term “triple net” leases where our tenants are responsible for all costs related to the property, including insurance, taxes and maintenance.
 
Corporate Structure
 
Power REIT was formed as part of a reorganization and reverse triangular merger of P&WV that closed on December 2, 2011. P&WV survived the reorganization as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Registrant. Currently, the Trust is structured as a holding company and owns its assets through twenty-five wholly-owned, special purpose subsidiaries that have been formed in order to hold real estate assets, obtain financing and generate lease revenue.
 
The chart below shows the organizational structure of the Trust as of December 31, 2022.

Power REIT’s Business
 
We are primarily engaged in the ownership, leasing, acquisition, development, and disposition of special purpose real estate assets. Our typical approach is to lease the properties on a long-term “triple net” basis whereby the tenant pays all property related costs including real estate taxes, insurance, and other operating costs including the maintenance of the property.
 
2022 and 2023 Acquisitions and Transactions
 
On March 31, 2022, we completed our first acquisition with the focus on the cultivation of food crops, through a newly formed wholly owned subsidiary, PW MillPro NE LLC, (“PW MillPro”), and acquired a 1,121,513 square foot greenhouse cultivation facility (the “MillPro Facility”) on an approximately 86-acre property and a separate approximately 4.88-acre property with a 21-room employee housing building (the “Housing Facility”) for $9,350,000 and closing costs of approximately $91,000 located in O’Neill, Nebraska (collectively the “Property”). On April 1, 2022, we announced that we entered into a 10-year triple-net lease with a wholly owned subsidiary of Millennium Sustainable Ventures Corp. (ticker: MILC) related to the Property. The MillPro property is configured for the cultivation of tomatoes and during 2022 grew a preliminary crop. Unfortunately, the market for tomatoes compressed and the tenant was unable to meet its financial obligations and has vacated the property. We remain optimistic that we acquired this property at an attractive basis and that a new tenant can be secured to put the facility back into operation in the future.
 
On January 6, 2023, one of our wholly owned subsidiaries sold its interest in five ground leases related to utility scale solar farms located in Tulare County, California for gross proceeds of $2.5 million. The properties were acquired by our subsidiary in 2013 for $1,550,000.
 
The sale of the Tulare solar ground leases is part of a strategic review as we continue to evaluate alternatives to enhance liquidity and improve our opportunities. We have shifted our focus to Controlled Environment Agriculture in the form of greenhouses as a technology based real estate opportunity.
 
Business Strategy
 
Our primary objective is to maximize the long-term value of the Trust for our shareholders. To that end, our business goals are to obtain the best possible rental income at our properties in order to maximize our cash flows, net operating income, funds from operations, funds available for distribution to shareholders and other operating measures and results, and ultimately to maximize the values of our properties.
 
To achieve this primary goal, we have developed a business strategy focused on increasing the values of our properties, and ultimately of the Trust, which includes:
 
● Raising capital by monetizing the embedded value in our portfolio to enhance our liquidity position and, as appropriate reducing debt levels to strengthen our balance sheet; 
 ● Selling off non-core properties and underperforming assets;
 ● Seeking to re-lease properties that are vacant or have non-performing tenants
 ● Raising the overall level of quality of our portfolio and of individual properties in our portfolio;
 ● Improving the operating results of our properties; and ● Taking steps to position the Company for future growth opportunities.

Improving Our Balance Sheet by Reducing Debt and Leverage; Maintaining Liquidity
 
Leverage
 
We continue to seek ways to reduce our leverage by improving our operating performance and through a variety of other means available to us. These means might include selling properties, raising capital or through other actions.
Liquidity
 
As of December 31, 2022, our consolidated balance sheet reflected $2.85 million in cash and cash equivalents and $1 million restricted cash. We believe that this amount and future net cash provided by operations, property sales, and other sources of capital, should provide sufficient liquidity to meet our liquidity requirements in the short term, including for one year from the filing of this Annual Report.
Capital Recycling
 
In the later part of 2022, we commenced property reviews to establish a plan for the portfolio and, if appropriate, will seek to dispose of properties that we do not believe meet financial and strategic criteria given economic, market and other circumstances. Disposing of these properties can enable us to redeploy or recycle our capital to other uses, such as to repay debt, to reinvest in other real estate assets and development and redevelopment projects, and for other corporate purposes. Along these lines, in early 2023 we completed sales of assets for total gross proceeds of $2.5 million (See Subsequent Events). We also have several properties that we are marketing for sale and/or lease which have been classified as “Assets Held for Sale.”
Improving Our Portfolio
 
We are currently seeking to refine our property holdings by selling properties and/or re-leasing them in an effort to improve the overall performance going forward.
 
Taking Steps to Position the Company for Future Growth Opportunities
 
We are taking steps designed to position the Trust to create shareholder value. In connection therewith, we have implemented processes designed to ensure strong internal discipline in the use, harvesting and recycling of our capital, and these processes will be applied in connection with seeking to reposition properties.
 
We may continue to seek to acquire, in an opportunistic, selective and disciplined manner, properties that have operating metrics that are better than or equal to our existing portfolio averages, and that we believe have strong potential for increased cash flows and appreciation in value. Taking advantage of any acquisition opportunities would likely involve some use of debt or equity capital. We will pursue transactions that we expect can meet the financial and strategic criteria we apply, given economic, market and other circumstances. In addition, we are exploring the potential to use our existing corporate structure for strategic transactions including potentially merging assets or companies with the Trust.

Growth and Investment Strategies - CEA
 
In 2019, we expanded the focus of our real estate acquisitions to include CEA properties in the United States. CEA is an innovative method of growing plants that involves creating optimized growing environments for a given crop indoors. Power REIT is focused on CEA in the form of a greenhouse which uses dramatically less energy than indoor growing, 95% less water usage than outdoor growing, and does not have any agricultural runoff of fertilizers or pesticides. We believe greenhouse cultivation represents a sustainable solution from both a business and environmental perspective. Certain of our greenhouse properties are operated for the cultivation of cannabis by state-licensed operators. During 2022 we acquired a greenhouse focused on the cultivation of tomatoes. Unfortunately, the market for tomatoes compressed and the tenant was unable to meet its financial obligations and has vacated the property. We continue to explore greenhouse transactions for the cultivation of other plants and food crops. We typically enter into long-term triple net leases where our tenants are responsible for all costs related to the property, including insurance, taxes and maintenance.
 
Regulated Cannabis Industry - Market Opportunity
 
Cannabis Overview
 
We believe that a convergence of changing public attitudes and increased legalization momentum in various states toward regulated cannabis, and medical-use cannabis in particular, is generating interest investment in regulated cannabis related opportunities. The cannabis industry is still emerging but increasingly, state-licensed cannabis cultivation, processing and dispensing facilities are becoming sophisticated business enterprises that use state-of-the-art technologies, well-honed business, operational processes to produce and dispense at scale high-quality, high-consistency cannabis products that should drive improved financial performance.
 
In the United States, the development and growth of the regulated cannabis industry has generally been driven by state law and regulation. Accordingly, market conditions vary on a state-by-state basis. State laws that legalize and regulate medical-use cannabis allow patients to consume cannabis for medicinal reasons with a designated healthcare provider’s recommendation, subject to various requirements and limitations. States have authorized numerous medical conditions as qualifying conditions for treatment with medical-use cannabis, which vary significantly from state to state and may include, among others, treatment for cancer, glaucoma, HIV/AIDs, wasting syndrome, pain, nausea, seizures, muscle spasms, multiple sclerosis, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), migraines, arthritis, Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s, lupus, residual limb pain, spinal cord injuries, inflammatory bowel disease and terminal illness. As of December 31, 2022, 37 states, the District of Columbia, and four of five U.S. territories have passed laws allowing their citizens to use medical cannabis.

Cannabis Industry Growth and Trends
 
The cannabis industry over the past several years has experienced dramatic growth. As the cannabis industry continues to evolve and mature, innovative products are being developed for consumers. In addition to smoking and vaporizing of dried leaves, cannabis can be incorporated into a variety of edibles, vaporizers, spray products, transdermal patches and topicals. These additional form factors are driving a significant portion of the growth.
Shifting Public Attitudes and State Law
 
The changing public attitudes surrounding cannabis has been a catalyst for the growth of the United State regulated cannabis industry. According to a 2021 poll conducted by Pew Research Center, 91% of U.S. adults say that marijuana should be legal, while only 9% say that it should not. Additionally, regardless of political affiliation, the majority of participants indicate they are in favor of legalization.
 
As legalization is currently on a state-by-state basis, expansion of the cannabis industry is impacted by the regulatory processes of each state. States may restrict the number of cannabis licenses (cultivation, distribution, rental processing) permitted; impose significant taxes on cannabis products; and even limit the medical conditions that are eligible for cannabis treatment. As such, it is difficult to predict economic potential and trajectory of new markets. Accordingly, it is important to evaluate each State regulatory structure as part of evaluating investment opportunities.
 
Cannabis Industry Access to Capital
 
Currently, the illegal status of cannabis under federal law limits the ability of industry participants to fully access the U.S. banking system, public capital markets and other traditional sources of financing. The banking industry’s reluctance to finance cannabis operations may provide opportunities for us continue to grow our portfolio on attractive risk adjusted terms. Power REIT can deploy a form of non-dilutive capital to companies seeking to finance licensed cannabis cultivation facilities through the ownership of the real estate.
Investment Opportunity
 
Within the broader cannabis related investment opportunity, we believe the ownership of real estate has the potential to provide an attractive risk adjusted investment area of focus. Given the regulatory hurdles including the impact on access to traditional forms of capital, a potential opportunity exists to generate higher investment yields than traditional real estate asset classes.
 
We have focused on CEA cultivation assets in the form of greenhouses. We believe that acquiring CEA greenhouse cultivation properties, where we construct or rehabilitate existing structures, should provide a competitive advantage that will become increasingly apparent as the cannabis industry expands and matures. Currently, most of the cannabis cultivation, nationally, occurs in industrial, warehouse-style facilities. This cultivation method is resource and energy intensive compared to greenhouse cultivation which should use dramatically less energy when compared to industrial facilities. As the cannabis industry continues to expand and prices compress, we believe that industrial, warehouse-style cultivation of cannabis may not be economically competitive. Under our sustainable business model, our tenants should have the potential to become high-quality, low-cost producers of medical cannabis in their respective states.
 
During 2022, the cannabis industry faced significant headwinds that had a dramatic impact on cultivation focused companies such as our tenants. The wholesale prices in most markets compressed dramatically and in many cases were below the cost of cultivation and many cultivation companies have shut down. Due to the significant price compression in the wholesale cannabis market, many of our cannabis related tenants are experiencing significant financial challenges which has impacted their ability to pay rent. The Trust has offered certain of its cannabis tenants’ relief by amending leases to several of its tenants whereby monthly cash payments are restructured over the course of the lease to lower rent payments during 2022 and increase rent payments in the future. Unfortunately, in many cases this has not been enough to solve the issues and many of the cannabis tenants have shut down or continue to try to operate but have limited ability to pay rent at this time.

Food Cultivation Market Opportunity
 
There is a growing trend towards cultivation of certain crops in CEA greenhouse cultivation facilities. Climate change is accelerating the depletion of water and traditional agricultural land resources and adapting to these intensifying trends is critical to achieve food security. Simultaneously, demand for locally grown, fresh produce is increasing. Many traditional agricultural areas of the U.S. are experiencing drought and CEA’s lower water demand combined with increased potential yields represent an important part of the solution. Greenhouse technology is an economically and environmentally sustainable solution for these secular issues.
 
Relative to outdoor (field) production, greenhouse production is more predictable and consistent and produces a crop that is more uniform in appearance and quality. CEA allows for an average of 20x higher yield compared to outdoor cultivation, using 90% less water with no fertilizer runoff. Additionally, the specialized improvements needed for food crop production create higher asset value than farmland.
 
Management and Trustees - Human Capital
 
Mr. David H. Lesser serves as a member and Chairman of our Board of Trustees. He also serves as our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Secretary and Treasurer. Mr. Lesser has over 35 years of experience in real estate investment and finance. His expertise informs our process in all aspects of our business including acquisitions, project management, development, and finance. Mr. Lesser’s significant ownership stake in Power REIT provides strong alignment and incentives to focus on creation of shareholder value. Susan Hollander serves our Chief Accounting Officer with responsibility for all strategic accounting, compliance and financial reporting functions. Accordingly, Power REIT currently has two full-time employees and several consultants but does not have any other employees or officers. As Power REIT’s business grows, we will continue to evaluate our staffing and third-party service needs and adjust as necessary. Employee levels are managed to align with the pace of business and management believes it has sufficient human capital to operate its business successfully.
 
We believe that our success depends on our ability to retain our key personnel, primarily David Lesser, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Secretary and Treasurer.
 
The Trust has a Board of Trustees that has four Independent Trustees in addition to Mr. Lesser. Power REIT does not have a staggered board; accordingly, the current policy is that each Trustee serves for one-year terms.
 
Employee health and safety in the workplace is one of our core values. The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored for us the importance of keeping our employees safe and healthy. In response to the pandemic, we have taken actions aligned with the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in an effort to protect our workforce so they can more safely and effectively perform their work.
 
ESG the “Triple Bottom Line”
 
With a focus on the “Triple Bottom Line” and a commitment to Profit, Planet and People, Power REIT is committed to best-in-class focus on Environment, Social and Governance (“ESG”) factors.
 
Environmental
 
Our asset base is environmentally friendly. We currently own a railroad ground lease which is an environmentally friendly form of transportation. We also own a portfolio of ground leases for utility scale solar farms. Our recent focus on CEA greenhouse properties consumes dramatically less energy than indoor growing, 95% less water, and do not generate the agricultural runoff associated with traditional fertilizers or pesticides.
Social
 
Our CEA tenant/operator roster is diverse and engaged with their local communities. A number of our CEA facilities will produce cannabis which is considered an alternative medical solution for a variety of ailments including, but not limited to, multiple sclerosis, PTSD, arthritis, and seizures. To date, the FDA has not approved a marketing application for cannabis for the treatment of any disease or condition.

13
--

Governance
 
We are an internally managed REIT with a Board comprised of four independent Trustees and one insider Trustee. Each Trustee serves a one-year term and as such, we do not have a staggered board. In addition, we do not have any other management protection structures such as “poison pills” or “golden parachutes.” Power REIT management has strong alignment with shareholders through significant insider ownership and both the Board and CEO receive compensation entirely in the form of equity. We believe that our corporate governance is a strong component of our ESG profile.
 
As our ESG story and portfolio expand, our investor engagement efforts will continue to build alongside, driving our commitment to the planet, its people, and generating returns for our shareholders.
 
Revenue Concentration
 
Historically, the Trust’s revenue has been concentrated to a relatively limited number of investments, industries and lessees. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, Power REIT collected approximately 57% of its consolidated revenue from four properties. The tenants are NorthEast Kind Assets, LLC (“Sweet Dirt”), Fiore Management LLC (“Canndescent”), Norfolk Southern Railway and JAB Industries, Ltd (“JAB”) which represent 22%, 10%, 11% and 14% of consolidated revenue respectively.
Dividends
 
During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Trust paid quarterly cash dividends during the first three quarters of 2022 of approximately $490,000 ($0.484375 per share per quarter) to holders of Power REIT’s 7.75% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Stock and accrued the fourth quarter dividend amount.
 
Distributions declared by us will be authorized by our Board of Trustees in its sole discretion out of funds legally available therefor and will be dependent upon a number of factors, including the capital requirements for our business plans and meeting the distribution requirements necessary to maintain our qualification as a REIT. We cannot assure that our intended distributions will be made or sustained or that our Board of Trustees will not change our distribution policy in the future. Under some circumstances, we may be required to fund distributions from working capital, liquidate assets at prices or times that we regard as unfavorable or borrow to provide funds for distributions, or we may make distributions in the form of a taxable stock dividend.
 
Tax Status as a REIT
 
We have elected to be treated for tax purposes as a REIT, which means that we are exempt from U.S. federal income tax if a sufficient portion of our annual income is distributed to our shareholders, and if certain other requirements are met. In order for us to maintain our REIT qualification, at least 90% of our ordinary taxable annual income must be distributed to shareholders. As of December 31, 2021, our last tax return completed to date, we currently have a net operating loss of $24.8 million, which may reduce or eliminate this requirement.
 
Certain Restrictions on Size of Holdings and Transferability
 
In order to assist us in complying with the limitations on the concentration of ownership of REIT stock imposed by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), among other purposes, our Declaration of Trust provides that no person or entity may own, directly or indirectly, more than 9.9% in economic value of the aggregate of the outstanding common shares of Power REIT. However, our charter authorizes our Board of Trustees to exempt from time to time the ownership limits applicable to certain named individuals or entities. This provision or other provisions in our Declaration of Trust or By-laws, or provisions that we may adopt in the future, may limit the ability of our shareholders to sell their shares at a premium over then-current market prices by discouraging a third party from seeking to obtain control of us. On April 28, 2014, our Board of Trustees granted an exemption to Hudson Bay Partners, LP, on behalf of itself, and its affiliates, including David H. Lesser from the 9.9% ownership limit.
 
Our charter also prohibits any person from (1) beneficially or constructively owning shares of our capital stock that would result in our being “closely held” under Section 856(h) of the Code at any time during the taxable year, (2) transferring shares of our capital stock if such transfer would result in our stock being beneficially or constructively owned by fewer than 100 persons and (3) beneficially or constructively owning shares of our capital stock if such ownership would cause us otherwise to fail to qualify as a REIT.
