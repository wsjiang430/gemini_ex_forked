ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

 Overview

Founded in October 2018 and headquartered in Florida with remote employees and specialty contractors in London, New York and Latin America, MGO Global Inc. (“MGO,”, “MGO Global”, the “Company,” “we,” “our,” and “us”) is a performance-driven lifestyle brand portfolio company focused on direct-to-consumer (“DTC”) digital commerce.

Not new to building successful global lifestyle brands, MGO’s accomplished leadership team encompasses decades of experience in fashion design, marketing, technology, corporate finance and branding. Our design team continues to push innovation and evolution of the product cycle without compromising quality and design integrity. We believe that our management’s executive-level expertise in marketing technology will empower MGO to play an important role in defining the next generation of DTC digital commerce. Our finance and accounting team is tasked with ensuring that responsible decision making is informed by our commitment to maintaining economic stability and focus on strategic growth.

With a deep understanding of analytics, personality-driven trust and algorithm-driven distribution, our marketing team is uniquely equipped to leverage emerging technologies, such as machine learning and Artificial Intelligence (“AI”), to build brands efficiently and cost-effectively with a small core team of specialists. Through our end-to-end, scalable brand-building platform, backed by robust consumer behavioral data, we are intent on building digitally native brands that thrive in the modern DTC economy.

In 2018, MGO signed a global licensing agreement with soccer player Lionel Messi and created "The Messi Brand" - a line of casual wear and accessories inspired by his trend-setting style. The brand's designs focus is on accessibility and ease, much like Messi's personal style. While this has been the only asset in our portfolio through 2022, our business model is centered on strategic expansion through collaborations, licensing, acquisitions, and organic development. We intend to drive the commercial value of each brand within our portfolio through our own DTC platform methodologies, ensuring that each brand maintains its own unique identity while remaining thoughtfully aligned with the values of its customers.

Guided by the Company’s expertise and fueled by our team’s passion to ultimately grow MGO into a major lifestyle brand portfolio company and its brands into universally recognized symbols of excellence, MGO is committed to exceeding its partners’ and customers’ expectations by creating and delivering innovative, premium lifestyle clothing and consumer products and earning lifetime fidelity to our DTC brands through high-touch customer engagement, service and attention.

Our Mission

MGO is intent on inspiring people worldwide to express their best, most authentic selves through our distinctive lifestyle and consumer product brands; and delivering superior financial performance and value creation through optimization of our shared services across our scalable brand-building platform.
Our Core Values

Since our inception, we have consciously fostered a corporate culture in which our core values are deeply ingrained in our identity and serve as a compass to guide our decision-making and business-building processes. Our core values are the source of our Company’s drive and distinctiveness, thoughtfully woven into our organizational fabric to influence how we think, work and act. These core values are:

The Messi Brand

Born in Argentina, Leo Messi (“Messi”) discovered his love and great aptitude for soccer as a young boy. At age eight, he was recruited to the youth soccer system of Newell’s Old Boys, a local sports club affiliated with the Argentine Football Association. Considerably smaller than most kids his age, Messi was eventually diagnosed with a hormone deficiency that compromised his growth, resulting in his suffering through a costly regimen of nightly growth hormone injections. When he was offered the opportunity to train at soccer powerhouse FC Barcelona’s youth academy and have his medical bills covered by the team, he did not hesitate to migrate to Spain to pursue his passion. Today, Messi is widely regarded as one of the sport’s greatest players of all time.

Messi currently plays as a forward for France’s Paris Saint Germain team and captains the Argentina national team. Until joining the Paris Saint Germain club in 2021, he had spent his entire professional career with FC Barcelona, where he won a club-record 35 trophies, including 10 La Liga titles, seven Copa del Rey titles and four Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) Champions Leagues. His renowned skill on the pitch has led him to be universally recognized as one of the best soccer players in the world, earning him a record seven Ballon d’Or, an annual soccer award presented by French news magazine France Football; as well as six European Golden Shoes, an award that is presented each season to the leading goal scorer in the top division of a European national soccer league. Among many other records, awards and acclaim, Messi also won a gold medal at the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games when the Argentina National Team beat Nigeria. At the FIFA World Cup 2022, held in Qatar on November 20 – December 18, 2022, Messi led Argentina as its team captain to glory, winning the championship title against France, which marked Argentina’s third World Cup win and its first since 1986. In February 2023, on the heels of winning the 2022 World Cup, he was crowned The Best FIFA Men’s Player for the third time – the first was in 2009 and the second was in 2019. In addition, Messi became the first man in history to win the adidas Golden Ball twice at the FIFA World Cup in 2022, with the first awarded at the Brazil 2014 World Cup. (Source: https://fbref.com/en/players/d70ce98e/Lionel-Messi#all_leaders)

In 2022, Messi claimed the top spot in Forbes’ 2022 annual ranking of the world’s highest-paid athletes (for the second time – the other was in 2019), surpassing $1 billion in career earnings. Earlier in his career, Messi was recognized as one of Time’s 100 most influential people in the world in 2011 and 2012. Commenting on the impact of Messi’s career impact on the sport of soccer, The New York Times reported in March 2022, “It is likely the last 15 years will come to be seen almost exclusively through the lens of Messi and Ronaldo (Cristiano Ronaldo). They have, after all, dominated this era of soccer, and so it is fitting, in many ways, that they should come to define it.”

Having overcome his childhood health and physical challenges, Messi is more than just a great soccer player to many people – he is an idol, a leader, even a hero. Beloved by millions of fans worldwide, Messi boasts a massive, passionate social media following (as of March 24, 2023) comprised of 445 million on Instagram (ranked #3 overall for most followers); 114 million on Facebook (ranked #5 overall for most followers); 1.42 million subscribers on YouTube; and over 8.04 million more on Weibo, China’s largest social media platform.

MGO Global’s chief goal for The Messi Brand is to extend and amplify Leo Messi’s values, vision and uncompromising sportsmanship that have distinguished him on the soccer field and seamlessly translate them to high quality apparel and products created or curated for discerning customers who love and respect the celebrated athlete.

Brand Design and Aesthetic

The Messi Brand design team is led by MGO co-founder and Chief Design Officer Virginia “Ginny” Hilfiger, who works in close collaboration with Leo Messi to craft the fundamental design aesthetic that has continued to inform and inspire the development of each year’s casual, but elegant spring and fall collections. Two of the brand’s signature design elements, the color palette and the incorporation of “10” and “30,” are nods to Messi’s soccer teams – the color palette is largely composed of his teams’ colors, light blue, navy blue, white and red; the “10” is his jersey number worn for both Barcelona and the Argentina national team; and the “30” is his jersey number for Paris Saint Germain.

Each item released is carefully constructed with high-quality fabrics, and quality stitching and design techniques to create clothing that is as technically advanced as Messi’s style of play on the field.

Our embroidered polos are produced using light weight 95% piqué cotton and 5% spandex. Piqué fabric is a double weave knit – it is this twin layer that gives pique its signature waffle or quilt texture on one side, and a smooth finish on the other side. The space between those layers allows for air flow, making the fabric breathable, more durable, more absorbent of dye and better at concealing sweat. Designed with a 100% cotton waistband for great comfort, our pants are constructed using light weight knit fabric comprised of 62% nylon, 32% cotton and 5% spandex. Our zip-front jackets are made using double-faced 75% long staple cotton, 18% polyester and 7% spandex. Long staple cotton is derived from the Gossypium barbadense species of cotton, which yields cotton with unusually long, silky fibers. This high quality cotton gives our jackets a smooth feel, while the double-faced fabric gives the jacket more body, providing a premium look. Similarly, our long sleeve knit tops are constructed using 100% long staple cotton, which makes it feel like silk to the touch and on the body.

A key design directive by Messi is to ensure quality, comfort and versatility always remain priorities for the brand.

More than ever, sustainability is dominating consumer priorities and the fashion agenda. We believe that one of the most important ways to reduce our environmental impact is to limit the extractive production of virgin raw materials and decrease textile waste. By offering our customers a conscious shopping choice with sustainable, affordable pieces that are designed to be aligned with our brand values while being on trend, The Messi Brand is committed to proactively supporting and promoting a much more circular, responsible economy. Moreover, we are thoughtfully choosing our supply chain partners to ensure that our core values are in sync with one another, and our combined sustainability initiatives serve as a force multiplier in aiding our industry to reduce textile waste worldwide.

The Messi Brand Collections

Current collections available in MGO’s operated ecommerce store, The Messi Store (www.themessistore.com), provide a range of sporty menswear pieces from edgy graphic t-shirts and sweatshirts to well-cut quilted jackets and high-performance polos and pants. In addition, graphic t-shirts for women and kids are offered, along with plush bathrobes, graphic beach towels, rugs, posters, keychains and a men’s wallet.

All products in the Messi Green collection are marked with the stamp of eco-approval or feature a print of Vila Franca do Campo, one of the most iconic landscapes on the Azorean Island of Sao Miguel – home to thousands of endangered species and a symbolic reminder that few things on Earth are in infinite quantities.

The Messi Wallet can also be found marketed under the Winning Streak Premium Collection. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Messi Wallet: in late 2022, MGO introduced a limited drop of the Messi Wallet as part of its Winning Streak Premium Collection. The official smart wallet of Messi holds 1-12 credit cards and bills, provides quick card access at the click of a button, and blocks RFID to prevent wireless theft of personal financial information. In addition, the wallet has been produced using space-grade 6061-T6 aluminum and an expandable aluminum backplate to ensure structural strength that is tough, yet lightweight, and promises long durability and corrosion resistance.
· | Messi Swim: in early 2023, The Messi Store released its new limited Messi Swim line for men, featuring swim trucks available in four signature colors: red, blue, ocean blue and black. The comfortable swimwear is made using a high quality, lightweight, two-way stretch, water-repellent fabric and features a draw string at the waist, two pockets and the Messi brand predominantly reflected on a white strip around the left leg.

Expansion of The Messi Brand 

The Messi Brand development roadmap provides for the classic core of the collection to remain intact, supplemented with a line of cool, fun streetwear. Expansion of our childrenswear, accessories and homeware collections are also being considered. Further, given our core value of corporate social responsibility, we are committed to gradually expanding our eco-friendly Messi Green line, which currently represents approximately 10% of the overall collection.

In addition, we will look to forge trusted brand collaborations to expand The Messi Brand into new consumer product categories – a strategy that has contributed to increasing brand awareness and market penetration for The Messi Brand since it was first launched.

For example, in tandem with the debut of The Messi Store in 2019, we partnered with Richard James Savile Row to design a one-time promotional limited edition/capsule collection titled Tailored by Richard James, which was exclusively featured on The Messi Store and in Santa Eulalia in Barcelona, which according to Pitti Uomo and The Business of Fashion is among the top 30 luxury menswear stores in the world. Santa Eulalia served as the venue for the official Messi Brand launch party, playing host to Messi, the MGO team, numerous reporters and photographers, and hundreds of fans who attended the event. Consisting of an unstructured, precision cut blazer, complimentary slim-fit chinos, shirts, polos and the finishing touches of socks, pocket squares and scarves, the Tailored by Richard James limited editions encapsulated Richard James’ contemporary, fashion-led Savile Row style and Messi’s distinctive fashion sense and commitment to excellence. The Messi Store currently has no other collaboration with Richard James Savile Row.

In 2021, The Messi Store formed a strategic collaboration with world-renowned floral display artist Mr. Flower Fantastic for a one-time drop (“drops” are special release products that are either scarce in quantity, due to intentional limited production, or scarce in availability, due to a limited-time purchase window, and in this case will not be restocked) of the collectible Handle with Care Messi 10 – a custom designed soccer ball-shaped planter handcrafted from solid marble and released exclusively on the NTWRK app and in The Messi Store. Aimed at Gen Z and Millennial consumers and boasting a monthly audience exceeding ten million viewers, NTWRK is a video shopping app that offers tools that allow creators to interact with viewers and sell curated products in real-time in what has been called a mix of QVC, Twitter and Twitch. The Messi Store currently has no other collaboration with Mr. Flower Fantastic.

 Marketing Strategy for The Messi Brand

 We are actively engaged in implementing a purpose-driven brand marketing strategy that is founded on three primary pillars: business and financial discipline, consumer-centricity and amplified brand communication which leads with a digital-first mindset. By leveraging the influence and social following of Leo Messi, we are endeavoring to scale our sales and customer base through defined content and media strategies that will grow our customers from knowing our brand, liking our brand, loving our brand and to living our brand.

We believe that never before has the power to build a global consumer brand in a matter of a few years been more readily possible, due in large measure to the prominence, reach and influence of ecommerce, social media and digital marketing. This cultural phenomenon is expected to fuel and accelerate The Messi Brand’s growth, because we understand the mission critical significance of engaging and inspiring our target audiences through ‘shareworthy’ messaging and meaningful online interaction with and storytelling through our brand and brand identity. Moreover, we strive to attain enduring customer trust and loyalty by delivering on our brand promise of “Precision. Excellence. Humility” – all with an uncompromising commitment to excellence in all that we do.

Our ecommerce store is found at www.TheMessiStore.com, and The Messi Store mobile app is available for download through both the App Store and Google Play app marketplaces. Created using the scalable, secure and proven ecommerce platform Shopify, The Messi Store is accessible to consumers worldwide in a multi-currency environment with built-in customer engagement tools that drive highly personalized shopping experiences for our store visitors. According to information supplied on Shopify.com, Shopify is one of the most scalable, feature-rich and fastest growing ecommerce platforms, powering over one million ecommerce stores in 175 countries.

Social Media Marketing

We rely heavily on social media and AI-powered digital marketing tools and content to reach and access prospective customers where they are online, with particular emphasis on Instagram, Facebook, YouTube and Weibo (in China). As of March 24, 2023, The Messi Store has 1.7 million followers on Instagram and 291,339 followers on Facebook. When combined with Leo Messi’s personal social media following, we currently reach over 446 million on Instagram and 114+ million on Facebook, alone, representing a massive, passionate audience of prospective buyers of The Messi Brand apparel, accessories and home wares. Monthly marketing initiatives include Leo Messi posting selfies and other images wearing The Messi Brand wear.

Distribution Channels for Messi Brand Products

Direct to Consumer (DTC) Channels

Ecommerce: The Messi Brand is a digitally native brand aimed at using proven technology to deliver a unique customer experience. Our first collection of Messi Brand apparel debuted in ecommerce store, The Messi Store (www.themessistore.com), operated by MGO, in September 2019. On launch day, fan traffic was so voluminous it caused the site to crash. Based on the Company’s site’s data analytics, since inception in September 2019, The Messi Store has had over 6.9 million unique online visitors – 75% of whom have accessed our ecommerce platform through mobile devices – and has shipped orders to customers in 110 countries, with more than half of all sales stemming from the United States.

Shopify, the platform on which TheMessiStore.com is built and operates, utilizes sophisticated algorithms to track unique visitors’ IP addresses and site visit sessions. Unique visitors are defined as the number of unduplicated visits (counted only once) to a website over the course of a specific time period, while a session is the number of times people have collectively visited the site in a designated timeframe. For example, if three separate people visited TheMessiStore.com one time, two times and three times, respectively, the number of unique visitors is three, and the number sessions is six.

Mobile Commerce: In November 2020, MGO launched The Messi Store mobile app, which is available for download from the App Store and Google Play. The app provides us with the ability to provide users with exclusive and/or early access to newly released Messi Brand collections, collaborations and giveaways. Since its launch, the app has been downloaded by more than 120,000 users worldwide.
Wholesale Channels

We believe that by first creating a strong, direct and intimate connection with consumers through our proprietary DTC channels, we will gain critical market insight and the perspective necessary to guide traditional retailers and other wholesale channels on how best to showcase and merchandize our products, by arming us with smart demographic and psychographic intelligence and refining The Messi Brand voice and attitude.

Ultimately, we envision offering Messi Brand apparel and products through a robust bricks-and-mortar strategy, targeting high-end specialty clothing and home goods stores worldwide. However, we are currently pursuing this strategy slowly, responsibly and cautiously, particularly given the prevailing economic challenges confronting a retail environment still recovering from the COVID pandemic.

In partnership with travel retail specialist Duty Free Americas, MGO now offers The Messi Brand products in two duty-free stores at the Uruguay-Brazil border, with a third location set to open soon. 

Moving forward, we are also considering the merits of building a global network of distribution partners and sub-licensees which have established relationships with leading premium apparel retailers in key geographic regions around the world that present compelling new market penetration opportunities for The Messi Brand.

Sub-Licensing Channels

Products made under sub-licensing arrangements with The Messi Brand will, in most cases, be sold through ecommerce, retailer and other wholesale channels. We expect that, with our approval, the licensees with which we may elect to partner, will have the right to distribute products selectively through other venues, which provide additional, yet controlled, exposure of our brand. In addition, this strategy provides for a cost-effective means to produce Messi-branded apparel, accessories and home goods that may be more suitable for local niche markets and cultural-specific consumer trends.

We have recently negotiated a licensing and distribution agreement with a large Brazilian specialty apparel company to collaborate on the design and production of a collection of loungewear, underwear, socks and swimwear for The Messi Brand. This new partner will be responsible for marketing these product lines through its own established wholesale channel and retail stores throughout Latin America and will also supply products for The Messi Store ecommerce platform, thereby expanding the scope of our collections and consumer offerings and fueling greater revenue growth opportunities for our Company.

Our Supply Chain Strategy

Based on our leadership’s experience in building global lifestyle brands for many of the world’s leading apparel companies, we have established, long-standing relationships and key industry knowledge that empowers us to best identify and leverage qualified third-party suppliers and manufacturers to produce our raw materials and finished products.

We directly and actively manage every aspect of our product design, development and production process. Our in-house innovation and design team works closely with our suppliers to source or develop the materials for our products that meet our exact specifications for comfort, stretch, durability, functionality, sustainability and performance. Our in-house production team, comprised of contracted industry professionals with longstanding experience working with our Chief Design Officer, selects our fabric and trim suppliers, directly manages the relationships between these suppliers and our finished product manufacturers and drives our production allocation strategy and production schedules. We believe we have built a supply chain that is optimized for our business and through which we can control the design, development and fulfillment of our products.

We do not own any manufacturing facilities and do not manufacture any of our products. We purchase our finished products from third-party manufacturers on a purchase-order basis and do not have any agreements requiring us to use any specific supplier or manufacturer. We have long-standing relationships with our vendors, built over decades by key members of our team. Chosen based on desired design and production specifications of a particular product or collection, our global network of valued manufacturers are based in Brazil, China, India, Latvia, Mexico, Peru, Portugal, Sri Lanka and the United States. We regularly source new suppliers and manufacturers across the world to support our ongoing innovation and growth, and we carefully evaluate all new suppliers and manufacturers to ensure they share our high standards for quality and precision in manufacturing, ethical working conditions and social and environmental sustainability practices.

Warehousing and Logistics

MGO Global has partnered with an international logistics company, Bleckmann Logistics, serving many renowned brands across global consumer goods industries. With distribution centers spanning the Netherlands, Belgium, the United Kingdom and the United States, this bonded third-party logistics, or 3PL, the Company has the capacity to process more than 300 million pieces of merchandise annually and distribute over 20 million packages through retail, wholesale and ecommerce sales channels. In addition, this trusted partner shares our commitment to sustainability with specific initiatives focused on carbon footprint reduction, social involvement and becoming the employer of choice in its industry and ethical business practices and sustainable growth. More specifically, 85% of their operations run on renewable energy and they have committed to achieving a 90% recycling rate for 2023.

We regularly evaluate our distribution infrastructure and capacity to ensure that we remain positioned to timely and efficiently meet our anticipated needs and support our continued growth of The Messi Brand — and other brands that we may organically grow or acquire in the realization of our expanded portfolio of global lifestyle brands.

Use of Artificial Intelligence-Assisted Digital Marketing

Under the leadership and guidance of MGO’s Chief Marketing Officer, an expert in the fields of software engineering, marketing automation and algorithm-oriented marketing, MGO has developed and continues to invest in the development of proprietary methodologies and systems that leverage the power of machine learning and leading AI tools and technologies to effectively mine vast amounts of data to identify new customers and new markets; and to take advantage of deep learning to identify the best possible go-to-market and customer acquisition and conversion strategies – all at a fraction of the time and at significantly lower cost than it would require for humans to execute without AI assistance. As a result, we believe we can accelerate the process of efficiently reaching, educating, inspiring and converting better-targeted consumers into customers through an array of smarter digital multimedia initiatives.

Market Opportunities

Total Addressable Market

In its 28 Dazzling Fashion Industry Statistics 2023 online article dated March 6, 2023, Zippia states that the global fashion industry was valued at $1.7 trillion as of 2022 and accounts for two percent of the world’s GDP. The Coresight Research US Apparel and Beauty Spending Tracker provides a monthly update on the trajectory of consumer spending on beauty, clothing and footwear. Its latest report covers spending from January 2023, showing that clothing and footwear spending increased by 6.3% year over year.

From a demand perspective, Gen-Z and wealthier consumers from middle-income groups and upwards are predicted by McKinsey to demonstrate the strongest appetite for leisure spend in the United States with fashion being one of the top three categories on which they will seek to splurge or treat themselves. In China, there are strong prospects for growth in consumer spending power, where rising incomes will contribute to an anticipated increase of $10 trillion in consumption growth between 2021 and 2030. (Source: McKinsey & Company, Meet Your Future Asian Consumer, July 28, 2021)

E-Commerce

Lower digital barriers to entry for all clothing brands offer the opportunity to market, sell and fulfill orders globally and automatically. As a result, worldwide revenue and revenue per user are projected to grow. In the U.S. alone, the apparel and accessory industries accounted for 29.5% of all ecommerce sales in 2021. (Source: Statista, Online Share of Total U.S. Retail Sales in 2021, by Product Category, March 8, 2022). In Europe, it is expected that by 2025, each consumer will spend nearly $1000 on fashion-related items over the course of the year. (Source: Statista, Retail E-Commerce ARPU in Europe, 2017-2025, May 20, 2021)

Sustainability

Consumers are increasingly aware of the impact their choices are making on the environment and seeking more sustainable and ethical alternatives. The debate over whether sustainable and ethical clothing is a passing fad or a crucial segment for fashion brands is pretty much over. According to a February 2023 report from The Business Research Company, the global ethical fashion market will grow from $7.57 billion in 2022 to $8.17 billion in 2023 at a compound annual growth rate of 8.0%. By 2027, researchers at the firm are forecasting that the market will rise to $11.12 billion. 
Retail Landscape Realities

Lifestyle brands, whether accessible or prestige, have faced structural shifts in the retail landscape that have made it more challenging for them to succeed. Those challenges include: 

• | Decline of Traditional Wholesale Channels: It is estimated by analysts at UBS that between 40,000 to 50,000 retail stores in the Unites States will close down over the next five years. UBS sees the most closures shaking out among clothing and accessories retailers, consumer electronics businesses and home furnishing chains, or about 23,500 stores cumulatively within these categories by 2026. (Source: CNBC, UBS Expects 50,000 Store Closures in the U.S. Over the Next 5 Years After Pandemic Pause, April 13, 2022)
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Heightened Competition from Fast Fashion: The desire for newness has led to enormous competition in the apparel industry from fast fashion brands which can quickly manufacture and copy styles at lower prices than designer brands. The global fast fashion market is expected to grow from $106.42 billion in 2022 to $122.98 billion in 2023. (Source: The Business Research Company, Fast Fashion Global Market Report 2023 – By Gender (Women's Wear, Men's Wear), By Age (Adults Wear, Teens Wear, Kids Wear, Other Ages), By Type (Pants, Coat, Skirt, Other Types) – Market Size, Trends, And Global Forecast 2023-2032)
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Direct-to-Consumer, or DTC, as an Essential Channel for Every Brand: Given the growth in online and the challenges associated with traditional wholesale channels, brands are increasingly seeking DTC channels but often lack the financial or human capital to build them.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Larger, More Fractured Discovery Landscape: According to Publicis Sapient, 87% of shoppers today begin product searches online, meaning that younger customers are focused on direct search for brands they already know (Source: Publicis Sapient, “Shopper-First Retailing – The New Rules of Retail from the Actions, Voices and Eyes of Today’s Consumers”, 2018).
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Growing Importance of Data: We believe that data and data analytics is critical to helping brands assess their product and efficiently acquire customers and improve customer experience. Through traditional wholesale channels, brands receive very minimal data, and the data they do receive is often a season old.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Social Media

On February 24, 2023, Statista Research reported that as of January 2023, there were 5.16 billion Internet users worldwide, or 64.4% of the global population. Of this total, 4.76 billion, or 59.4% were social media users. The use of the Internet and social media have changed consumer shopping behavior and the ways in which companies grow their apparel brands, presenting significant opportunities for organizations to directly connect with customers, lower costs, improve brand awareness, influence consumers’ attitudes, receive real-time feedback and increase sales. Drilling deeper, mobile channels have become the norm and are now embedded within consumers’ daily lives via the use of mobile tools, shopping apps, location-based services and mobile wallets - all impacting the consumer online shopping experience.

Competitive Landscape

Competition in the global lifestyle apparel industry is principally based on product quality, innovation, style, price, brand image, distribution model and definitive standards for customer experience and service. Generally speaking, our industry is intensely competitive, and many companies who may be perceived as our competitors have substantially greater financial, distribution and marketing resources, as well as greater brand awareness.

There are several sports celebrity-inspired lifestyle brands and brand collaborations with which we may directly compete for market share in the specific segments we serve, including several involving global soccer superstars, such as the likes of Christiano Ronaldo’s CR7, Memphis Depay’s MDC and Tiémoué Bakayoko’s Ètudes, among others.

Our Competitive Strengths

We believe that MGO Global stands to benefit from a number of competitive differentiators that serve to set our Company apart from other lifestyle brand portfolio companies. Chief among them are:

· | Proven, Premium Lifestyle Brand Builders Lead MGO. Our Company’s design and production team is led by 30-year industry veteran Ginny Hilfiger, younger sibling of Tommy Hilfiger, a globally renowned pioneer of classic American cool style. During her 15-year tenure as EVP of Design at Tommy Hilfiger’s namesake apparel brand, Ginny was the visionary behind Tommy Jeans, the women’s sportswear and junior lines, the H Hilfiger collection for Federated Department Stores and the successful brand collaboration between Tommy and supermodel Gigi Hadid – just to name a few key achievements. Following her run of successes at Tommy, she launched her own signature brand “Ginny H” before being recruited as Creative Director for FILA Global, charged with revamping FILA’s brand DNA globally. MGO’s C-suite also include Julian Groves, Chief Operating Officer, who brings our Company over 25 years of experience in global brand strategy and expansion for lifestyle brands that have included J. Brand, True Religion, Guess and Burberry; and Chief Executive Officer Maximiliano Ojeda, an international business executive and entrepreneur who, along with Ginny Hilfiger, co-founded MGO and today guides and directs our global business operations and brand-building architecture.

Our Growth Strategies

The key elements of our growth strategy are centered on:


· | Growing The Messi Brand’s global customer base. With our differentiated brand and organic virality, strong funnel of new customers and our continued focus on collaborative partnerships and marketing efficiencies, we remain intent on growing the number of customers passionate about and loyal to The Messi Brand through our dynamic direct to consumer business model. Our broad digital ecosystem – from our engaging ecommerce website and mobile app to social media channels, allows us to better connect, engage, track and service our customers. This ecosystem also provides us with robust quantitative and qualitative customer data that we use to inform all aspects of our business operations – from product development to merchandising to marketing.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Launching New Categories and Offerings under The Messi Brand. Through in-house development by our talented design team or collaborations with other leading brands and notable designers, we intend to continue to expand The Messi Brand line of products to broaden and deepen our categories to potentially include capsule collections featuring men’s business wear, special occasion wear, designer denim wear, non-athletic footwear, more diversified home décor offerings and expanded clothing collections designed specifically for women and children, among others.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Driving Leverage in Operational Efficiency. We are focused on using our customer and market data to drive actionable insights and improve key aspects of our brand management platform’s operations. Moreover, we plan to further deepen customer relationships with personalization and customization through the development and launch of a Messi Store loyalty program. Through this program, we expect to tailor our marketing messages, promotions and product recommendations to each unique customer’s preferences with a goal of enhancing customer engagement and capturing greater spend.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Implement New Technologies. We will continue to enhance our ecommerce functionality with tools for product recommendations, enhanced payment options (e.g., buy now pay later), and improved returns processes to drive conversions and increase order value. We also believe there is an opportunity to further leverage our proprietary artificial intelligence-powered and algorithm-driven DTC marketing system to drive more efficient customer acquisition, conversion and retention marketing strategies.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Growing through Strategic Acquisitions and Brand Partnerships and Collaborations. Capitalizing on the platform infrastructure we have created to support the development, launch and success of The Messi Brand, we will actively look to identify and pursue new opportunities to vertically integrate other prolific brand partnerships into our brand portfolio, replicating and scaling our licensing model. In addition, we aim to explore incremental growth opportunities to acquire existing lifestyle brands, products or intellectual property that will complement our brand mix and appeal to our customers. Finally, it is common practice in the fashion industry to establish brand collaborations with other leading lifestyle brands to penetrate new product categories, enter new markets and expand into new geographic regions. In this regard, we expect to seek out opportunities to identify and pursue brand collaborations with premium lifestyle brands with the goal of leveraging and cross-marketing new co-branded products to existing and prospective customer bases of both brands to fuel our respective revenue growth.

Design, Research and Development

We believe our design, research and development efforts are key factors in our success. Our ability to react to changing customer needs and industry trends is a key to our success. Our design, research and brand development teams, in partnership with our marketing teams, drive our efforts to bring new products to market.

We may also apply that same insight to organically developed brands or other brands that we may elect to license or acquire in the future.
Intellectual Property

The Messi License

On October 29, 2018, we originally entered into a Trademark License Agreement with Leo Messi Management SL, a company incorporated under the laws of Spain with VAT number B65073694 registered in the Commercial Registry of Barcelona (“LMM”). Pursuant to that agreement, LLM granted MGOTEAM 1 LLC the worldwide rights to the “Messi” brand of apparel for a period of nine years.

Governmental Regulation and Environmental Matters

Our business is subject to a number of laws and regulations that affect companies conducting business on the Internet, many of which are still evolving and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business. These laws and regulations include federal and state consumer protection laws protecting the privacy of consumer information and regulations prohibiting unfair and deceptive trade practices. In particular, under federal and state privacy laws and regulations, we must provide notice to consumers of our policies on sharing sensitive information with third parties, advance notice of any changes to our policies and, in some instances, we may be obligated to give customers the right to prevent sharing of their sensitive information with unaffiliated third parties. The growth and demand for e-commerce could result in more stringent consumer protection laws that impose additional compliance burdens on online companies. These consumer protection laws could result in substantial compliance costs.

In many jurisdictions, there is currently great uncertainty whether or how existing laws governing issues such as property ownership, sales and other taxes, libel and personal privacy apply to the Internet and e-commerce. In addition, new tax regulations in jurisdictions where we do not now collect state and local taxes may subject us to the obligation to collect and remit state and local taxes or subject us to additional state and local sales and income taxes, or to requirements intended to assist states with their tax collection efforts. New legislation or regulation, the application of laws and regulations from jurisdictions whose laws do not currently apply to our business or the application of existing laws and regulations to the Internet and e-commerce could result in significant additional taxes on our business. These taxes or tax collection obligations could have an adverse effect on our cash flows and results of operations. Further, there is a possibility that we may be subject to significant fines or other payments for any past failures to comply with these requirements.

We are subject to U.S. federal, state and local laws and regulations that could affect our business, including those promulgated under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Consumer Product Safety Act, the Flammable Fabrics Act, the Textile Fiber Product Identification Act, the rules and regulations of the Consumer Products Safety Commission and various environmental laws and regulations. Our operations also are subject to various international trade agreements and regulations. While we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with all applicable governmental regulations, current governmental regulations may change or become more stringent or unforeseen events may occur, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.

Organizational History

On October 11, 2018, MGOTEAM 1 LLC (“MGO LLC”) was formed in Delaware by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Maximiliano Ojeda. On November 20, 2021, MGO LLC entered into a Trademark License Agreement (the “Messi License”) with Leo Messi Management SL, a company incorporated under the laws of Spain (“LMM”). Pursuant to the Messi License, LLM granted MGO LLC the worldwide rights to the “Messi” brand of apparel as further described in “Business—Messi License.” On November 30, 2021, MGO Global Inc. was incorporated in Delaware, and on December 6, 2021 entered into a Rollover Agreement (the “Rollover Agreement”) with MGO LLC and members of MGO LLC holding 88% of its the membership interests (the “Rollover Members”). Under the Rollover Agreement, the Rollover Members of MGO LLC rolled over all of their membership interests in exchange for 8,818,000 shares of the Company’s common stock. On the execution date of December 6, 2021, the stockholder’s equity was retroactively restated to reflect the Rollover Agreement. As a result, MGO LLC became an 88% owned subsidiary of the Company and the Company succeeded to the business of MGO Global Inc. as its sole line of business.
