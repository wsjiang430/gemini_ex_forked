Available Information

The Company is a public company and files interim, quarterly and annual reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These reports are on file and a matter of public record with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Securities and Exchange Commission maintains an Internet site that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC (http://www.sec.gov). The Company’s reports can also be obtained for free on our website, www.bankprov.com. 

Market Area

Our primary lending area encompasses a broad market that includes Northeastern Massachusetts and Southern New Hampshire, with a focus on Essex County, Massachusetts, and Hillsborough and Rockingham Counties, New Hampshire, which are part of, and bedroom communities to, the technology corridor between Boston, Massachusetts and Concord, New Hampshire.  The Bank also offers select products on a national basis, which includes the enterprise value loan product and mortgage warehouse product. Our primary deposit-gathering area is currently concentrated in Essex County, Massachusetts, and Rockingham County and Hillsborough County, New Hampshire, although we also receive deposits from our business customers who are located nationwide.

According to data from the FDIC as of June 30, 2022 (the latest date for which information is available), Essex County represents 5.8% of total deposits in the state of Massachusetts or approximately $33.51 billion. The Bank holds a 2.11% market share of Essex County. Rockingham and Hillsborough Country represent 23.0% and 34.3% of total deposits in the state of New Hampshire or approximately $11.72 billion and $17.51 billion, respectively. The Bank holds market share of 1.99% and 2.29% of Rockingham and Hillsborough Counties, respectively. Our deposit mix consists of traditional retail deposits, which account for 80.9% of total deposits, enterprise value deposits which account for 8.5% of total deposits, deposits from digital asset customers which account for 6.1% of total deposits, mortgage warehouse deposits which are 2.3% of total deposits, deposits related to banking as a service customers which are 2.0% of total deposits and deposits from renewable energy customers which total 0.3% of total deposits. 

Competition

We face significant competition for deposits and loans. Our most direct competition for deposits has historically come from the many financial institutions operating in our market area where several large holding companies operate banks. Many of these institutions, such as TD Bank, Bank of America and Citizens Bank, are significantly larger than us and, therefore, have greater resources. Additionally, some of our competitors offer products and services that we do not offer, such as insurance services, trust services, and wealth management. We also face competition for investors’ funds from other financial service companies such as brokerage firms, fintech companies, money market funds, mutual funds and other corporate and government securities. Based on data from the FDIC as of June 30, 2022, BankProv had 2.11% of the deposit market share within Essex County, Massachusetts, giving us the 12th largest market share out of 34 financial institutions with offices in that county as of that date and had 1.99% of the deposit market share within Rockingham County, New Hampshire, giving us the 9th largest market share out of 25 financial institutions with offices in that county as of that date. This data excludes deposits held by credit unions.

Our competition for loans comes primarily from financial institutions in our market area. Our experience in recent years is that many financial institutions in our market area, especially community banks that are seeking to significantly expand their commercial loan portfolios and banks located in lower growth regions in New Hampshire and Maine, have been willing to price commercial loans aggressively in order to gain market share.

Lending Activities 

Commercial Business Loans. We make commercial business loans primarily in our market area to a variety of small- and medium- sized businesses, including professional and nonprofit organizations, and, to a lesser extent, sole proprietorships. We also originate our enterprise value loans nationwide, and we originate our renewable energy loans primarily in New England and New Hampshire. At December 31, 2022, commercial business loans were $701.4 million, or 48.4% of our total loan portfolio, and we intend to moderate the amount of commercial business loans that we originate in 2023. As part of our relationship driven focus, we encourage our commercial business borrowers to maintain their primary deposit accounts with us, which enhances our interest rate spread and overall profitability.

Commercial lending products include term loans and revolving lines of credit. Commercial term loans and lines of credit are made with either variable or fixed rates of interest. Variable rates and rates on Small Business Administration (“SBA”) loans (with the exception of SBA Payment Protection Program (“PPP”) loans) are generally based on the prime rate as published in The Wall Street Journal, plus a margin. Initial rates on non-SBA fixed-rate business loans are generally based on a corresponding Federal Home Loan Bank rate, plus a margin. Commercial business loans typically have shorter maturity terms and higher interest rates than commercial real estate loans, but may involve more credit risk because of the type and nature of the collateral. We are focusing our efforts on originating such loans to experienced, growing small- to medium-sized, privately-held companies with local or regional businesses and non-profit entities that operate in our market area.

When making commercial loans, we consider the financial statements of the borrower, our lending history with the borrower, the debt service capabilities and global cash flows of the borrower and other guarantors, the projected cash flows of the business and the value of the collateral, accounts receivable, inventory and equipment. All of these loans are secured by assets of the respective borrowers.




As of December 31, 2022, enterprise value loans, which we also refer to as search fund lending, merger and acquisition, re-capitalization, and shareholder/partner buyout loans, totaled $452.3 million, with relationships spanning 27 states. We originate these loans to small- and medium-size businesses in a senior secured position; relying largely on the enterprise value of the business and ongoing cash flow to support operational and debt service requirements. These are fully amortizing term loans (up to seven years) with material levels of equity and/or combination of seller financing behind our senior secured lending. At December 31, 2022, the largest loan was $25.6 million and is secured by all business assets. At December 31, 2022, the loan was performing in accordance with its original repayment terms.

The following table provides information with respect to our enterprise value loans by type at December 31, 2022.

In 2020, the Bank began offering lines of credit to enterprise businesses in the digital asset space. These lines of credit are utilized by digital asset businesses to further their offerings in crypto-backed lending, margin trading, crypto mining operations, or other growth initiatives. These lines of credit are collateralized by the United States dollar (“USD”) value of the digital currency. The Bank uses a custodian to hold the digital currency and monitors the collateral coverage ratio on an ongoing basis. If warranted, the Bank will instruct the custodian to liquidate the collateral and provide us with the USD proceeds of the liquidation. In 2021 the Bank expanded its loan offerings in the digital asset space by offering term loans to purchase cryptocurrency mining equipment. These loans were based on the loan to value of the equipment with a term generally ranging from 24 to 30 months. In the fourth quarter of 2022, the Bank made the strategic decision to cease originating loans secured by cryptocurrency mining equipment. Furthermore, in December 2022, the Bank began to divest its outstanding loan exposure secured by cryptocurrency mining equipment and as a result ended the fiscal year with three loans, spanning two relationships, totaling $26.7 million. At December 31, 2022 the largest loan relationship secured by cryptocurrency mining equipment totaled $21.8 million and was impaired and on non-accrual status with specific reserves. At December 31, 2022, there were two remaining lines of credit totaling $14.5 million, which were backed by the USD value of the digital currency or cash. The largest outstanding balance on a credit line to a digital asset company was $10.0 million at December 31, 2022 and was performing in accordance with its original repayment terms. 

We also originate loans to developers of commercial-scale renewable energy facilities, primarily in New England and New York, and at December 31, 2022, we had a total of $53.9 million in renewable energy loans. Our renewable energy loans primarily include loans secured by solar arrays and battery storage operations which work in conjunction with the solar arrays. The average term and amortization for these loans can extend to 15 years or more, given the asset life, and are generally underwritten to lesser term than the associated power purchase agreement (“PPA”) supporting the repayment of each loan. The term of the loan is also shorter than the life expectancy of the related equipment. Generally, the underwriting criteria includes: a report supporting the power generation capacity and ultimately the ability to generate sufficient cash flows, assignment of the associated PPA, analysis on the quality of the power off-taker, an overall business valuation, and appropriate loan covenants, which may include maximum loan-to-value and minimum debt service coverage requirements. At December 31, 2022, $37.3 million, or 69.2%, of our renewable energy loans was secured by solar 

 

arrays. The largest loan was $11.3 million and is secured by all business assets of the company, including the solar array and an assignment of the PPA. At December 31, 2022, the loan was performing in accordance with its original repayment terms.

A portion of our commercial business loans are guaranteed by the SBA through the SBA 7(a) loan program. The SBA 7(a) loan program supports, through a U.S. Government guarantee, some portion of the traditional commercial loan underwriting that might not be fully covered absent the guarantee. A typical example would be a business acquiring another business, where the value purchased is an enterprise value (as opposed to tangible assets), which results in a collateral shortfall under traditional loan underwriting requirements. In addition, SBA 7(a) loans, through term loans, can provide a good source of permanent working capital for growing companies. BankProv is a Preferred Lender under the SBA’s PLP Program, which allows expedited underwriting and approval of SBA 7(a) loans.

Our largest commercial business loan at December 31, 2022 totaled $25.6 million, was originated in 2021 and is an enterprise value loan that as of December 31, 2022 was performing in accordance with its original repayment terms. Our second largest commercial business loan totaled $20.0 million, was originated in 2022 and is a term loan secured by cryptocurrency mining equipment. The loan is part of a larger impaired relationship which totaled $21.8 million as of December 31, 2022 and carried specific reserves. The third largest commercial loan totaled $15.3 million, was originated in 2020 and is an enterprise value loan that as of December 31, 2022 was performing in accordance with its original repayment terms. 

Commercial Real Estate Loans. At December 31, 2022, commercial real estate loans were $456.7 million, or 31.5% of our total loan portfolio. This amount includes $35.2 million of multi-family residential real estate loans, which we consider a subset of commercial real estate loans, and which are described below. Our commercial real estate loans are generally secured by properties used for business purposes such as office buildings, industrial facilities and retail facilities; however, we also originate loans secured by investment real estate in the form of residential rental units. At December 31, 2022, $181.0 million of our commercial real estate portfolio was secured by owner occupied commercial real estate, and $275.8 million was secured by income producing, or non-owner occupied commercial real estate. We currently target new commercial real estate loan originations to experienced, growing small- and mid-size owners and investors in our market area. The average outstanding loan in our commercial real estate portfolio was $710,000 as of December 31, 2022, although we originate commercial real estate loans with balances significantly larger than this average. At December 31, 2022, our ten largest commercial real estate loans had an average balance of $9.8 million.

We focus our commercial real estate lending on properties within our primary market areas, but we will originate commercial real estate loans on properties located outside the area based on an established relationship with a strong borrower. We intend to continue to grow our commercial real estate loan portfolio while maintaining prudent underwriting standards. In addition to originating these loans, we occasionally will participate in commercial real estate loans with other financial institutions. Such participations are underwritten in accordance with our policies before we will participate in such loans. 

We originate a variety of fixed- and adjustable-rate commercial real estate loans with terms and amortization periods generally up to 20 years, although our Loan Policy permits longer terms and amortization periods depending on the risk profile, which may include balloon loans. Interest rates and payments on our adjustable-rate loans adjust every three, five or seven years and generally are indexed to the corresponding Federal Home Loan Bank borrowing rate plus a margin. Most of our adjustable-rate commercial real estate loans adjust every five years and amortize over terms of 20 years. We generally include pre-payment penalties on commercial real estate loans we originate. 

The following table provides information with respect to our commercial real estate loans by type at December 31, 2022. The table excludes multi-family residential real estate loans, discussed below.

If we foreclose on a commercial real estate loan, the marketing and liquidation period to convert the real estate asset to cash can be lengthy with substantial holding costs. In addition, vacancies, deferred maintenance, repairs and market stigma can result in prospective buyers expecting sale price concessions to offset their real or perceived economic losses for the time it takes them to return the property to profitability. Depending on the individual circumstances, initial charge-offs and subsequent losses on commercial real estate loans can be unpredictable and substantial.

Our largest single commercial real estate loan at December 31, 2022 totaled $15.8 million, was originated in 2013 and is a commercial line of credit secured by non-owner occupied commercial use property. Our next largest commercial real estate loan at December 31, 2022 was totaled $15.6 million, was originated in 2019 and is secured by non-owner occupied commercial use property. The third largest commercial real estate loan was for $12.9 million, was originated in 2019 and is secured by non-owner occupied commercial use property. All of the collateral securing these loans is located in our primary lending area. At December 31, 2022, all of these loans were performing in accordance with their original repayment terms.

Multi-Family Residential Real Estate Loans. At December 31, 2022, multi-family real estate loans were $35.2 million, or 2.4% of our total loan portfolio. We do not focus on the origination of multi-family real estate lending, but we will originate these loans to well-qualified borrowers when opportunities exist that meet our underwriting standards. We currently originate new individual multi-family real estate loans to experienced, growing small- and mid-size owners and investors in our market area. Our multi-family real estate loans are generally secured by properties consisting of five to 15 rental units. The average outstanding loan size in our multi-family real estate portfolio was $559,000 as of December 31, 2022. We generally do not make multi-family real estate loans outside our primary market areas. In addition to originating these loans, we also participate in multi-family residential real estate loans with other financial institutions. Such participations are underwritten in accordance with our policies before we will participate in such loans.

We originate a variety of fixed- and adjustable-rate multi-family real estate loans for terms up to 30 years. Interest rates and payments on our adjustable-rate loans adjust every three, five or seven years and generally are indexed to the corresponding Federal Home Loan Bank borrowing rate plus a margin. Most of our adjustable-rate multi-family real estate loans adjust every five years and amortize over terms of 20 to 25 years. We also include pre-payment penalties on loans we originate. 

If we foreclose on a multi-family real estate loan, the marketing and liquidation period to convert the real estate asset to cash can be lengthy with substantial holding costs. In addition, vacancies, deferred maintenance, repairs and market stigma can result in prospective buyers expecting sale price concessions to offset their real or perceived economic losses for the time it takes them to return the property to profitability. Depending on the individual circumstances, initial charge-offs and subsequent losses on commercial real estate loans can be unpredictable and substantial.

Our largest multi-family real estate loan at December 31, 2022 totaled $4.8 million, was initially originated in 2020 as a construction and land development loan and is secured by a multi-family property. At December 31, 2022, this loan was performing in accordance with its original repayment terms.

Construction and Land Development Loans. At December 31, 2022, construction and land development loans were $69.7 million, or 4.8% of our total loan portfolio, consisting of $2.5 million of one- to four-family residential and condominium construction loans and $67.2 million of commercial and multi-family real estate construction loans. At December 31, 2022, $63.4 million of our commercial and multi-family real estate construction loans are expected to convert to permanent loans upon completion of the construction phase. The majority of the balance of these loans is secured by properties located in our primary lending area.

We primarily make construction loans for commercial development projects, including hotels, condominiums and single-family residences, small industrial buildings, retail and office buildings and apartment buildings. Most of our construction loans are interest-only loans that provide for the payment of interest during the construction phase, which is usually up to 12 to 24 months, although some construction loans are renewed, generally for one or two additional years. At the end of the construction phase, the loan may convert to a permanent mortgage loan or the loan may be paid in full. 

We also originate construction and site development loans to contractors and builders to finance the construction of single-family homes and subdivisions. While we may originate these loans whether or not the collateral property underlying the loan is under contract for sale, we consider each project carefully in light of current residential real estate market conditions. We actively monitor the number of unsold homes in our construction loan portfolio and local housing markets to attempt to maintain an appropriate balance between home sales and new loan originations. We generally will limit the maximum number of speculative units (units that are not pre-sold) approved for each project to two units. We have attempted to diversify the risk associated with speculative construction lending by doing business with experienced small and mid-sized builders within our market area

Residential real estate construction loans include single-family tract construction loans for the construction of entry level residential homes. While maturity dates for residential construction loans are largely a function of the estimated construction period of the project, and generally do not exceed one year, land development loans generally are for 18 to 24 months. Substantially all of our residential 

 

construction loans have adjustable rates of interest based on The Wall Street Journal prime rate plus a margin. Construction loan proceeds are disbursed periodically in increments as construction progresses and as inspection by our approved inspectors warrant.

Our largest construction and land development loan at December 31, 2022 totaled $11.9 million, was originated in 2021 and is secured by commercial use property. At December 31, 2022, this loan was performing in accordance with its original repayment terms.

Mortgage Warehouse Loans. Our mortgage warehouse lending business has a national platform with relationship managers across the United States that offers Master Repurchase Agreement facilities (“facilities”) to independent non-bank mortgage origination companies, which allow them to fund the closing of residential mortgage loans. Each facility advance is fully collateralized by a security interest in one- to four-family residential mortgage loans and are further enhanced by deposit balances. The primary source of repayment of the facilities is the sale of the underlying mortgage loans to outside investors, which typically occurs within 15 days, with the exception of construction loans which generally take longer to pay off due to the nature of the loan.. These investors can include Federal National Mortgage Association/Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation and Government National Mortgage Association, as well as other large financial institutions who aggregate pools of loans.  

To approve facilities to non-bank mortgage origination borrowers we conduct a thorough due diligence of the company and its ownership to assess the financial performance including assets and liquidity and regulatory profile. To underwrite the companies we use a proprietary risk based scoring model that correlates to our internal regulatory loan risk grading system. We continually monitor companies’ performance through both internal and external financial management and quality reviews. At December 31, 2022, mortgage warehouse loans were $213.4 million, or 14.7% of total loans.

Loan Underwriting Risks

Commercial Business Loans. Unlike residential mortgage loans, which generally are made on the basis of the borrower’s ability to make repayment from his or her employment or other income, and which are secured by real property whose value tends to be more easily ascertainable, commercial business loans are of higher risk and typically are made on the basis of the borrower’s ability to make repayment from the cash flow of the borrower’s business and the collateral securing these loans may fluctuate in value. Our commercial business loans are originated primarily based on the identified cash flow of the borrower and secondarily on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower. Most often, this collateral consists of accounts receivable, inventory or equipment, the value of which may depreciate over time, may be more difficult to appraise and may be more susceptible to fluctuation in value. Credit support provided by the borrower for most of these loans and the probability of repayment is based on the liquidation of the pledged collateral and enforcement of a personal guarantee, if any. As a result, the availability of funds for the repayment of commercial business loans may depend substantially on the success of the business itself. These types of loans are generally more sensitive to regional and local economic conditions, making loss levels more difficult to predict.

Enterprise value loans may expose us to a greater risk of non-payment and loss than our other business loans because: (1) repayment of such loans may be dependent upon the successful execution of the borrower’s business plan, which may include new management and be based on projected cash flows that may include business synergies, cost savings, and revenue growth that have yet to be realized; (2) they may require additional financing from their private equity sponsors or others, a successful sale to a third party, a public offering, or some other form of liquidity event; or (3) in the event of default and liquidation, there may be reliance on the sale of intangible assets that may have insufficient value to repay the debt in full.

See “Risk Factors – Risks Related to Our Cryptocurrency Activities” for a discussion of risks related to our digital asset lending. 

Commercial and Multi-Family Real Estate Loans. Loans secured by commercial and multi-family real estate generally have larger balances and involve a greater degree of risk than one- to four-family residential mortgage loans. In addition, many of our commercial borrowers have more than one loan outstanding with us. Consequently, an adverse development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship can expose us to a significantly greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development with respect to a one- to four-family residential mortgage loan. Of primary concern in commercial and multi-family real estate lending is the borrower’s creditworthiness and the feasibility and cash flow potential of the project. Payments on loans secured by income producing properties often depend on successful operation and management of the properties. As a result, repayment of such loans may be impacted, to a greater extent than residential real estate loans, by adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy. To monitor cash flows on income producing properties, we require borrowers and loan guarantors, if any, to provide annual financial statements on commercial and multi-family real estate loans. In reaching a decision on whether to make a commercial or multi-family real estate loan, we consider and review a global cash flow analysis of the borrower and consider the net operating income of the property, the borrower’s expertise, credit history and profitability and the value of the underlying property. We have generally required that the properties securing these real estate loans have debt service coverage ratios (the ratio of earnings before debt service to debt service) of at least 1.20x. In accordance with our loan policy, an environmental phase one report may be obtained when the possibility exists that hazardous materials may have existed on the site, or the site may have been impacted by adjoining properties that handled hazardous materials. These types of loans are generally more sensitive to regional and local economic conditions, making loss levels more difficult to predict. In addition, some of our commercial real estate loans are not fully amortizing and contain large balloon payments upon maturity. These balloon 

 

payments may require the borrower to either sell or refinance the underlying property in order to make the balloon payment, which may increase the risk of default or non-payment. 

Further, if we foreclose on a commercial real estate or multi-family real estate loan, our holding period for the collateral may be longer than for one- to four-family residential mortgage loans because there are fewer potential purchasers of the collateral, which can result in substantial holding costs. In addition, vacancies, deferred maintenance, repairs and market stigma can result in prospective buyers expecting sale price concessions to offset their real or perceived economic losses for the time it takes them to return the property to profitability.

Construction and Land Development Loans. Our construction loans are based upon estimates of costs and values associated with the completed project. Underwriting is focused on the borrowers’ financial strength, credit history and demonstrated ability to produce a quality product and effectively market and manage their operations. All construction loans for which the builder does not have a binding purchase agreement must be approved by senior loan officers.

Construction lending involves additional risks when compared with permanent residential lending because funds are advanced upon the security of the project, which is of uncertain value prior to its completion. Because of the uncertainties inherent in estimating construction costs, as well as the market value of the completed project and the effects of governmental regulation of real property, it is relatively difficult to evaluate accurately the total funds required to complete a project and the related loan-to-value ratio. This type of lending also typically involves higher loan principal amounts and is often concentrated with a small number of builders. In addition, generally during the term of a construction loan, interest may be funded by the borrower or disbursed from an interest reserve set aside from the construction loan budget. These loans often involve the disbursement of substantial funds with repayment substantially dependent on the success of the ultimate project and the ability of the borrower to sell or lease the property or obtain permanent take-out financing, rather than the ability of the borrower or guarantor to repay principal and interest. If the appraised value of a completed project proves to be overstated, we may have inadequate security for the repayment of the loan upon completion of construction of the project and may incur a loss. A discounted cash flow analysis is utilized for determining the value of any construction project of five or more units. Our ability to continue to originate a significant amount of construction loans is dependent on the strength of the housing market in our market areas. 

Land loans secured by improved lots generally involve greater risks than residential mortgage lending because land loans are more difficult to evaluate. If the estimate of value proves to be inaccurate, in the event of default and foreclosure, we may be confronted with a property the value of which is insufficient to assure full payment. These types of loans are generally more sensitive to regional and local economic conditions, making loss levels more difficult to predict.

Mortgage Warehouse Loans. Mortgage warehouse loans are primarily facilities to non-bank mortgage origination companies. The risk of fraud associated with this type of lending includes, but is not limited to, settlement process risks, the risk of financing nonexistent loans or fictitious mortgage loan transactions, or the risk that collateral delivered is fraudulent or non-existent, creating a risk of loss of the full amount financed on the underlying residential mortgage loan, or in the settlement processes. In addition to fraud risk, there is also the risk of the mortgage companies being unable to sell the loans. 

Adjustable-Rate Loans. While we anticipate that adjustable-rate loans will better offset the adverse effects of an increase in interest rates as compared to fixed-rate loans, an increased monthly mortgage payment required of adjustable-rate loan borrowers in a rising interest rate environment could cause an increase in delinquencies and defaults. The marketability of the underlying property also may be adversely affected in a high interest rate environment. In addition, although adjustable-rate mortgage loans make our asset base more responsive to changes in interest rates, the extent of this interest sensitivity is limited by the annual and lifetime interest rate adjustment limits on residential loans.

Loan Originations, Purchases and Sales 

We have grown our loan portfolio by developing expertise for customers who typically have not been supported by larger financial institutions but whose business needs are usually too complex for smaller institutions. Loan originations come from a variety of sources. The primary sources of loan originations are current customers, business development by our relationship managers, walk-in traffic, our website, networking events and referrals from customers as well as our directors, business owners, investors, entrepreneurs, builders, realtors, and other professional third parties, including brokers. Loan originations are further supported by lending services offered through cross-selling and employees’ community service. 

Historically, we generally originated loans for our portfolio. We occasionally sell participation interests in commercial real estate loans and commercial business loans to local financial institutions, primarily on the portion of loans exceeding our borrowing limits. At December 31, 2022, we were servicing $20.6 million of commercial real estate and commercial business loans where we had sold an interest to local financial institutions. We sold loan participations of $6.2 million and $12.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 




While we generally do not purchase whole loans, we will occasionally purchase loan participations from other financial institutions and have in previous years purchased through a shared national credit program. As of December 31, 2022, we had $9.7 million of outstanding purchased loans. We do not expect to make any purchases through a shared national credit program going forward. We did not have any loan participation purchases for the year ended December 31, 2022. We purchased loans totaling $6.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021.

Loan Approval Procedures and Authority 

Our lending activities follow written, non-discriminatory, underwriting standards and loan origination procedures established by BankProv’s Board of Directors and management. BankProv’s Board of Directors has granted loan approval authority to certain officers up to prescribed limits, depending on the officer’s experience, the type of loan and whether the loan is secured or unsecured. All loans require the approval of a minimum of two lending officers, one of which must be a Senior Vice President or above (the exception is borrowing relationships of $25,000 and below, which can be approved by one officer with sufficient authority for that loan type. For loan relationships below $2.0 million, approval is required by designated individuals with delegated loan authority as identified within our loan policy. Our loan policy dictates that for loan relationships of between $2.0 million and $3.0 million approval is required by one of the following members of Credit Committee: Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Lending Officer and/or Senior Credit Officer. Loan relationships exceeding $3.0 million in exposure that do not involve exceptions to policy must be authorized by BankProv’s Credit Committee. Loan relationships exceeding $3.0 million in exposure that involve exceptions to policy, including loans in excess of our internal loans-to-one borrower limitation, must be authorized by BankProv’s Risk Committee of the Board of Directors. Exceptions are fully disclosed to the approving authority, either an individual officer or the appropriate management or board committee prior to commitment. Exceptions are reported to the Board of Directors quarterly.
Loans-to-One Borrower Limit and Loan Category Concentration 

The maximum amount that we may lend to one borrower and the borrower’s related entities is generally limited, by statute, to 20% of our capital, which is defined under Massachusetts law as the sum of our capital stock, surplus account and undivided profits. Our regulatory limit on loans-to-one borrower, is assessed quarterly, and was $38.4 million at December 31, 2022. In addition, we generally establish our internal loans-to-one borrower limit as 90% of our regulatory limit. This amount was $34.5 million as of December 31, 2022, with loans greater than this amount requiring approval by BankProv’s Risk Committee of the Board of Directors.

At December 31, 2022, our largest lending relationship consisted of five commercial business loans with an exposure of $40.7 million, secured by all business assets except for one unsecured ACH line of credit with an exposure of $50,000.  All loans in this relationship were performing in accordance with their original repayment terms at December 31, 2022.  Our second largest lending relationship consisted of six commercial business loans with a total exposure of $40.5 million, secured by all business assets. This relationship was performing in accordance with its original repayment terms at December 31, 2022. Although the December 31, 2022 exposures on our two largest relationships exceeded the regulatory limit in effect at December 31, 2022, the total exposures were in compliance with the regulatory limit in effect at the time the last extensions of credit were made. Our third largest lending relationship with a total exposure of $38.0 million consisted of 13 construction and land development loans with a total exposure of $28.0 million and secured by commercial use property, nine commercial real estate loans with a total exposure of $9.7 million and also secured by commercial use property, and one commercial business loan with a total exposure of $385,000 secured by all business assets. This relationship was performing in accordance with its original repayment terms at December 31, 2022. Our fourth largest lending relationship consisted of one commercial business line, with a total exposure of $36.0 million, secured by the USD value of the business’ digital currency. At December 31, 2022 there was no outstanding balance on this relationship. Our fifth largest lending relationship consisted of one commercial business line with a total exposure of $35.0 million, secured by the USD value of the business’ digital currency. At December 31, 2022 there was $10.0 million outstanding on this relationship and it was performing in accordance with its original repayment terms.

Investment Activities 

We have legal authority to invest in various types of investment securities and liquid assets, including U.S. Treasury obligations, securities of various government-sponsored enterprises, residential mortgage-backed securities and municipal government bonds, deposits at the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston, certificates of deposit of federally insured institutions, investment grade corporate bonds and investment grade marketable equity securities, including common stock and money market mutual funds. We also are required to maintain an investment in Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston stock, which investment is based on the level of our Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings. While we have the authority under applicable law to invest in derivative securities, we had no investments in derivative securities at December 31, 2022. 

At December 31, 2022, our investment portfolio had a fair value of $28.6 million, and consisted of U.S. Government Agency asset- and mortgage-backed securities, and state and municipal bonds. 




Our investment objectives are to provide and maintain liquidity, to establish an acceptable level of interest rate and credit risk, to provide a use of funds when demand for loans is weak and to generate a favorable return. Our Board of Directors has the overall responsibility for the investment portfolio, including approval of our investment policy. The Risk Committee of the Board of Directors and management are responsible for implementation of the investment policy and monitoring our investment performance. Our Risk Committee reviews the status of our investment portfolio quarterly.

Each reporting period, we evaluate all debt securities with a decline in fair value below the amortized cost of the investment to determine whether or not the impairment is deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired (“OTTI”). OTTI is required to be recognized if (1) we intend to sell the security; (2) it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis; or (3) for debt securities, the present value of expected cash flows is not sufficient to recover the entire amortized cost basis. For all impaired debt securities that we intend to sell, or more likely than not will be required to sell, the full amount of the depreciation is recognized as OTTI resulting in a realized loss that is a charged to earnings through a reduction in our noninterest income. For all other impaired debt securities, credit-related OTTI is recognized through earnings and non-credit related OTTI is recognized in other comprehensive income/loss, net of applicable taxes. We did not recognize any OTTI during the years ended December 31, 2022 or 2021.

Sources of Funds 

General. Deposits have traditionally been our primary source of funds for use in lending and investment activities. We also use borrowings, primarily Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston advances, Federal Reserve Bank of Boston (“FRB”) brokered deposits and certificates of deposit obtained from a national exchange, to supplement cash flow needs, lengthen the maturities of liabilities for interest rate risk purposes and to manage the cost of funds. In addition, funds are derived from scheduled loan payments, investment securities maturities and sales, loan prepayments, retained earnings and income on earning assets. While scheduled loan payments and income on earning assets are relatively stable sources of funds, deposit inflows and outflows can vary widely and are influenced by prevailing interest rates, market conditions and levels of competition. 

Deposit Accounts. The majority of our deposits (other than certificates of deposit) are from depositors who reside in our primary market areas. However, a significant portion of our brokered certificates of deposits and QwickRate deposits, described below, are from depositors located outside our primary market areas. We also receive deposits from our nationwide business customers. Deposits are attracted through the offering of a broad selection of deposit instruments, including noninterest-bearing demand deposits (such as checking accounts), interest-bearing demand accounts (such as NOW and money market accounts), savings accounts and certificates of deposit. In addition to accounts for individuals, we also offer several commercial checking accounts designed for the businesses operating in our market area, and we encourage our commercial borrowing customers to maintain their deposit relationships with us. 

We have grown our core deposits (which we define as all deposits except for certificates of deposit) through a variety of strategies, including investing in technology and hiring additional employees, as well as proactive interaction with our customers. Our investment in technology has enabled us to better serve commercial customers who demand faster processing times and simplified online interaction. For example, we provide deposit and cash management services for 1031 qualified intermediaries, banking as a service (“BaaS”) customers, digital currency customers, payroll providers and community association management companies. Funds we receive from digital currency customers are denominated in U.S. dollars; we do not have any digital assets or liabilities on our balance sheet and we do not take any digital currency exchange rate risk. In addition, we believe that our specialized commercial activities have provided opportunities to generate business deposits from those customers, including from customers outside of our branch network, that may not be available to traditional community banks.

At December 31, 2022, our deposits totaled $1.28 billion. As of that date, our certificates of deposit included $120.1 million of brokered certificates of deposit and $7.0 million of QwickRate certificates of deposit, where we gather certificates of deposit nationwide by posting rates we will pay on these deposits. At December 31, 2022, all QwickRate certificates of deposit were in amounts of $100,000 or greater.

Deposit account terms vary according to the minimum balance required, the time period that funds must remain on deposit, and the interest rate, among other factors. In determining the terms of our deposit accounts, we consider the rates offered by our competition, our liquidity needs, profitability, and customer preferences and concerns. We generally review our deposit mix and pricing on a weekly basis. Our deposit pricing strategy has generally been to offer competitive rates and services and to periodically offer special rates in order to attract deposits of a specific type or term. We do not price our deposit products to be among the highest rate paying institution in our market area, but instead focus on services to gather deposits. 

Borrowings. We primarily utilize advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston to supplement our supply of investable funds. The Federal Home Loan Bank functions as a central reserve bank providing credit for its member financial institutions. As a member, we are required to own capital stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank and are authorized to apply for advances on the security of such stock and certain of our whole first mortgage loans and other assets (principally securities which are obligations of, or guaranteed by, the United States), provided certain standards related to creditworthiness have been met. Advances are made under several different 

 

programs, each having its own interest rate and range of maturities. Depending on the program, limitations on the amount of advances are based either on a fixed percentage of an institution’s net worth or on the Federal Home Loan Bank’s assessment of the institution’s creditworthiness. As of December 31, 2022, we had a borrowing capacity of $118.2 million with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston, including an available line of credit of $2.0 million at an interest rate that adjusts daily. On that date, we had $107.3 million in advances outstanding from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston. All of our borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank are secured by investment securities and qualified collateral, including one- to four-family loans and multi-family and commercial real estate loans held in our portfolio. 

From time to time and dependent on rates, we may utilize the FRB Borrower In Custody (“BIC”) program as a source of overnight borrowings. Borrowings from the FRB BIC program are secured by a Uniform Commercial Code (“UCC”) financing statement on qualified collateral, consisting of certain commercial loans. As of December 31, 2022, we had a borrowing capacity of $153.3 million with the FRB. On that date, we had $19.5 million in advances outstanding from the FRB.

Personnel 

As of December 31, 2022, we had 198 full-time and six part-time employees, none of whom is represented by a collective bargaining unit. We believe we have a good working relationship with our employees. 
Subsidiaries 

BankProv’s subsidiaries include Provident Security Corporation, 5 Market Street Security Corporation and Prov 1, LLC. Provident Security Corporation and 5 Market Street Security Corporation were established to buy, sell, and hold investments for their own account. Prov 1, LLC was established to engage in any lawful act or activity for which limited liability companies may be organized.
SUPERVISION AND REGULATION

General

BankProv is a Massachusetts-chartered stock savings bank. The Bank’s deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and by the Depositors Insurance Fund for amounts in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance limits. BankProv is subject to extensive regulation by the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks, as its chartering agency, and by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, as its primary federal regulatory and primary deposit insurer. BankProv is required to file reports with, and is periodically examined by, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks concerning its activities and financial condition and must obtain regulatory approvals prior to entering into certain transactions, including, but not limited to, mergers with or acquisitions of other financial institutions. BankProv is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston. 

The regulation and supervision of BankProv establish a comprehensive framework of activities in which an institution can engage and is intended primarily for the protection of depositors and borrowers and, for purposes of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the protection of the insurance fund. The regulatory structure also gives the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies, including policies with respect to the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes. 

As a bank holding company, Provident Bancorp, Inc. is required to comply with the rules and regulations of the Federal Reserve Board. It is required to file certain reports with the Federal Reserve Board and is subject to examination by and the enforcement authority of the Federal Reserve Board. Provident Bancorp, Inc. is also subject to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission under the federal securities laws.

Any change in applicable laws or regulations, whether by the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Federal Reserve Board, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts or Congress, could have a material adverse impact on the operations and financial performance of Provident Bancorp, Inc. and BankProv. In addition, Provident Bancorp, Inc. and BankProv are affected by the monetary and fiscal policies of various agencies of the United States Government, including the Federal Reserve Board. In view of changing conditions in the national economy and in the money markets, it is impossible for management to accurately predict future changes in monetary policy or the effect of such changes on the business or financial condition of Provident Bancorp, Inc. and BankProv. 

Set forth below is a brief description of material regulatory requirements that are or will be applicable to BankProv and Provident Bancorp, Inc. The description is limited to certain material aspects of the statutes and regulations addressed, and is not intended to be a complete description of such statutes and regulations and their effects on BankProv and Provident Bancorp, Inc.




Massachusetts Banking Laws and Supervision

BankProv, as a Massachusetts-chartered stock savings bank, is regulated and supervised by the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks. The Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks is required to regularly examine each state-chartered bank. The approval of the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks is required to establish or close branches, to merge with another bank, to issue stock and to undertake many other activities. Any Massachusetts savings bank that does not operate in accordance with the regulations, policies and directives of the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks may be sanctioned. The Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks may suspend or remove directors or officers of a savings bank who have violated the law, conducted a bank’s business in a manner that is unsafe, unsound or contrary to the depositors’ interests, or been negligent in the performance of their duties. In addition, the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks has the authority to appoint a receiver or conservator if it is determined that the bank is conducting its business in an unsafe or unauthorized manner, and under certain other circumstances. 

The powers that Massachusetts-chartered savings banks can exercise under these laws include, but are not limited to, the following.

Lending Activities. A Massachusetts-chartered savings bank may make a wide variety of mortgage loans including fixed-rate loans, adjustable-rate loans, variable-rate loans, participation loans, graduated payment loans, construction and development loans, condominium and co-operative loans, second mortgage loans and other types of loans that may be made in accordance with applicable regulations. Commercial loans may be made to corporations and other commercial enterprises with or without security. Consumer and personal loans may also be made with or without security. 

Insurance Sales. Massachusetts savings banks may engage in insurance sales activities if the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks has approved a plan of operation for insurance activities and the bank obtains a license from the Massachusetts Division of Insurance. A savings bank may be licensed directly or indirectly through an affiliate or a subsidiary corporation established for this purpose. Although BankProv has received approval for insurance sales activities, it does not offer insurance products. 

Investment Activities. In general, Massachusetts-chartered savings banks may invest in preferred and common stock of any corporation organized under the laws of the United States or any state provided such investments do not involve control of any corporation and do not, in the aggregate, exceed 4.0% of the bank’s deposits. Massachusetts-chartered savings banks may in addition invest an amount equal to 1.0% of their deposits in stocks of Massachusetts corporations or companies with substantial employment in the Commonwealth which have pledged to the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks that such monies will be used for further development within the Commonwealth. At the present time, BankProv has the authority to invest in equity securities. However, such investment authority is constrained by federal law. See “—Federal Bank Regulation—Investment Activities” for such federal restrictions. 

Dividends. A Massachusetts stock bank may declare from net profits cash dividends not more frequently than quarterly and non-cash dividends at any time. No dividends may be declared, credited or paid if the bank’s capital stock is impaired. A Massachusetts savings bank with outstanding preferred stock may not, without the prior approval of the Commissioner of Banks, declare dividends to the common stock without also declaring dividends to the preferred stock. The approval of the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks is required if the total of all dividends declared in any calendar year exceeds the total of its net profits for that year combined with its retained net profits of the preceding two years, less any required transfer to surplus or to a fund for the retirement of any preferred stock. For this purpose, net profits mean the remainder of all earnings from current operations plus actual recoveries on loans and investments and other assets after deducting current operating expenses, actual losses, accrued dividends on preferred stock, if any, and all federal and state taxes. 

Protection of Personal Information. Massachusetts has adopted regulatory requirements intended to protect personal information. The requirements are similar to existing federal laws such as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, discussed below under “—Federal Bank Regulation—Privacy Regulations.” They require organizations to establish written information security programs to prevent identity theft. The Massachusetts regulation also contains technology system requirements, especially for the encryption of personal information sent over wireless or public networks or stored on portable devices. 

Parity Approval. A Massachusetts bank may, in accordance with Massachusetts law, exercise any power and engage in any activity that has been authorized for national banks, federal thrifts or state banks in a state other than Massachusetts, provided that the activity is permissible under applicable federal law and not specifically prohibited by Massachusetts law. Such powers and activities must be subject to the same limitations and restrictions imposed on the national bank, federal thrift or out-of-state bank that exercised the power or activity. A Massachusetts bank may exercise such power and engage in such activities by providing 30 days’ advanced written notice to the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks.

Loans-to-One Borrower Limitations. Massachusetts banking law grants broad lending authority. However, with certain limited exceptions, total obligations of one borrower to a bank may not exceed 20.0% of the total of the bank’s capital, which is defined under Massachusetts law as the sum of the bank’s capital stock, surplus account and undivided profits. 




Loans to a Bank’s Insiders. Massachusetts law provides that a Massachusetts financial institution shall comply with Regulation O of the Federal Reserve Board, which generally requires that extensions of credit to insiders:

be made on terms that are substantially the same as, and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than, those prevailing for comparable transactions with unaffiliated persons and that do not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features; and
not exceed certain limitations on the amount of credit extended to such persons, individually and in the aggregate, which limits are based, in part, on the amount of the Massachusetts financial institution’s capital.

Regulatory Enforcement Authority. Any Massachusetts bank that does not operate in accordance with the regulations, policies and directives of the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks may be subject to sanctions for non-compliance, including seizure of the property and business of the bank and suspension or revocation of its charter. The Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks may, under certain circumstances, suspend or remove officers or directors who have violated the law, conducted the bank’s business in a manner which is unsafe, unsound or contrary to the depositors’ interests or been negligent in the performance of their duties. In addition, upon finding that a bank has engaged in an unfair or deceptive act or practice, the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks may issue an order to cease and desist and impose a fine on the bank concerned. Massachusetts consumer protection and civil rights statutes applicable to BankProv permit private individual and class action lawsuits and provide for the rescission of consumer transactions, including loans, and the recovery of statutory and punitive damage and attorney’s fees in the case of certain violations of those statutes. 

Depositors Insurance Fund. BankProv is a member of the Depositors Insurance Fund, a corporation that insures savings bank deposits in excess of federal deposit insurance coverage. The Depositors Insurance Fund is authorized to charge savings banks a risk-based assessment on deposit balances in excess of the amounts insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.

Massachusetts has other statutes and regulations that are similar to the federal provisions discussed below.

Federal Bank Regulation 

Capital Requirements. Federal regulations require Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation-insured depository institutions to meet several minimum capital standards: a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 6.0%, a total capital to risk-based assets ratio of 8.0%, and a Tier 1 capital to average assets leverage ratio of 4.0%. 

For purposes of the regulatory capital requirements, common equity Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common stockholders’ equity and retained earnings. Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common equity Tier 1 and additional Tier 1 capital. Additional Tier 1 capital includes certain noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries. Total capital includes Tier 1 capital (common equity Tier 1 capital plus additional Tier 1 capital) and Tier 2 capital. Tier 2 capital is comprised of capital instruments and related surplus, meeting specified requirements, and may include cumulative preferred stock and long-term perpetual preferred stock, mandatory convertible securities, intermediate preferred stock and subordinated debt. Also included in Tier 2 capital is the allowance for loan and lease losses limited to a maximum of 1.25% of risk-weighted assets and, for institutions that made such an election regarding the treatment of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (“AOCI”), up to 45% of net unrealized gains on available-for-sale equity securities with readily determinable fair market values. Institutions that have not exercised the AOCI opt-out have AOCI incorporated into common equity Tier 1 capital (including unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale-securities). BankProv has exercised the opt-out and therefore does not include AOCI in its regulatory capital determinations. Calculation of all types of regulatory capital is subject to deductions and adjustments specified in the regulations.

In determining the amount of risk-weighted assets for purposes of calculating risk-based capital ratios, all assets, including certain off-balance sheet assets (e.g., recourse obligations, direct credit substitutes, residual interests) are multiplied by a risk weight factor assigned by the regulations based on the risks believed inherent in the type of asset. Higher levels of capital are required for asset categories believed to present greater risk. For example, a risk weight of 0% is assigned to cash and U.S. government securities, a risk weight of 50% is generally assigned to prudently underwritten first lien one to four- family residential mortgages, a risk weight of 100% is assigned to commercial and consumer loans, a risk weight of 150% is assigned to certain past due loans and a risk weight of between 0% to 600% is assigned to permissible equity interests, depending on certain specified factors.

In addition to establishing the minimum regulatory capital requirements, the regulations limit capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments to management if the institution does not hold a “capital conservation buffer” consisting of 2.5% of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted asset above the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements. At December 31, 2022, BankProv exceeded the fully phased in regulatory requirement for the capital conservation buffer.

The federal banking agencies, including the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, have established a “community bank leverage ratio” of between 8 to 10% of average total consolidated assets for qualifying institutions with assets of less than $10 billion. Institutions with capital meeting the specified requirements and electing to follow the alternative framework are deemed to comply with the applicable 

 

regulatory capital requirements, including the risk-based requirements. A qualifying institution may opt in and out of the community bank leverage ratio on its quarterly call report.

The optional community bank leverage ratio has currently been established at 9%. 

As of December 31, 2022, the Bank has not opted into the CBLR framework.

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act required each federal banking agency to revise its risk-based capital standards for insured institutions to ensure that those standards take adequate account of interest-rate risk, concentration of credit risk, and the risk of nontraditional activities, as well as to reflect the actual performance and expected risk of loss on multi-family residential loans. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, along with the other federal banking agencies, adopted a regulation providing that the agencies will take into account the exposure of a bank’s capital and economic value to changes in interest rate risk in assessing a bank’s capital adequacy. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation also has authority to establish individual minimum capital requirements in appropriate cases upon determination that an institution’s capital level is, or is likely to become, inadequate in light of the particular circumstances. 

Standards for Safety and Soundness. As required by statute, the federal banking agencies have adopted final regulations and Interagency Guidelines Establishing Standards for Safety and Soundness to implement safety and soundness standards. The guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards that the federal banking agencies use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired. The guidelines address internal controls and information systems, internal audit system, credit underwriting, loan documentation, interest rate exposure, asset growth, asset quality, earnings and compensation, fees and benefits. The agencies have also established standards for safeguarding customer information. If the appropriate federal banking agency determines that an institution fails to meet any standard prescribed by the guidelines, the agency may require the institution to submit to the agency an acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the standard.

Investment Activities. All state-chartered Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insured banks, including savings banks, are generally limited in their activities as principal and equity investments to activities and equity investments of the type and in the amount authorized for national banks, notwithstanding state law, subject to certain exceptions. For example, state-chartered banks may, with Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation approval, continue to exercise state authority to invest in common or preferred stocks listed on a national securities exchange and in the shares of an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. The maximum permissible investment is 100% of Tier 1 Capital, as specified by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s regulations, or the maximum amount permitted by Massachusetts law, whichever is less.

In addition, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation is authorized to permit such a state bank to engage in state-authorized activities or investments not permissible for national banks (other than non-subsidiary equity investments) if it meets all applicable capital requirements and it is determined that such activities or investments do not pose a significant risk to the Deposit Insurance Fund. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has adopted procedures for institutions seeking approval to engage in such activities or investments. In addition, a nonmember bank may control a subsidiary that engages in activities as principal that would only be permitted for a national bank to conduct in a “financial subsidiary” if a bank meets specified conditions and deducts its investment in the subsidiary for regulatory capital purposes. 

Interstate Banking and Branching. Federal law permits well capitalized and well managed bank holding companies to acquire banks in any state, subject to Federal Reserve Board approval, certain concentration limits and other specified conditions. Interstate mergers of banks are also authorized, subject to regulatory approval and other specified conditions. In addition, amendments made by the Dodd-Frank Act permit banks to establish de novo branches on an interstate basis to the extent that branching is authorized by the law of the host state for the banks chartered by that state. 

Prompt Corrective Regulatory Action. Federal law requires, among other things, that federal bank regulatory authorities take “prompt corrective action” with respect to banks that do not meet minimum capital requirements. For these purposes, the law establishes five capital categories: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized. 

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has adopted regulations to implement the prompt corrective action legislation. An institution is deemed to be “well capitalized” if it has a CBLR leverage ratio of 9.0% or greater, or a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, a leverage ratio of 5.0% or greater and a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 6.5% or greater. An institution is “adequately capitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0% or greater, a leverage ratio of 4.0% or greater and a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 4.5% or greater. An institution is “undercapitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 8.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a leverage ratio of less than 4.0% or a common equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 4.5%. An institution is deemed to be “significantly undercapitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.0%, a leverage ratio of less than 3.0% or a common equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 3.0%. An institution is considered to be “critically undercapitalized” if it has a ratio 

 

of tangible equity (as defined in the regulations) to total assets that is equal to or less than 2.0%. As of December 31, 2022, BankProv was a “well capitalized” institution under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation regulations. 

At each successive lower capital category, an insured depository institution is subject to more restrictions and prohibitions, including restrictions on growth, restrictions on interest rates paid on deposits, restrictions or prohibitions on payment of dividends, and restrictions on the acceptance of brokered deposits. Furthermore, if an insured depository institution is classified in one of the undercapitalized categories, it is required to submit a capital restoration plan to the appropriate federal banking agency, and the holding company must guarantee the performance of that plan in an amount equal to the lesser of 5.0% of the institution’s total assets when deemed undercapitalized or the amount necessary to achieve the status of adequately capitalized. Based upon its capital levels, a bank that is classified as well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, or undercapitalized may be treated as though it were in the next lower capital category if the appropriate federal banking agency, after notice and opportunity for hearing, determines that an unsafe or unsound condition, or an unsafe or unsound practice, warrants such treatment. If an “undercapitalized” bank fails to submit an acceptable plan, it is treated as if it is “significantly undercapitalized.” “Significantly undercapitalized” banks must comply with one or more of a number of additional restrictions, including but not limited to an order by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized, requirements to reduce total assets, cease receipt of deposits from correspondent banks or dismiss directors or officers, and restrictions on interest rates paid on deposits, compensation of executive officers and capital distributions by the parent holding company. “Critically undercapitalized” institutions are subject to additional measures including, subject to a narrow exception, the appointment of a receiver or conservator within 270 days after it obtains such status.

The previously referenced rulemaking to establish a “community bank leverage ratio” adjusted the referenced categories for qualifying institutions that opt into the alternative framework for regulatory capital requirements. Institutions that exceed the community bank leverage ratio would be considered to have met the capital ratio requirements to be “well capitalized” for the agencies’ prompt corrective rules.

Transaction with Affiliates and Regulation W of the Federal Reserve Regulations. Transactions between banks and their affiliates are governed by federal law. An affiliate of a bank is any company or entity that controls, is controlled by or is under common control with the bank. In a holding company context, the parent bank holding company and any companies which are controlled by such parent holding company are affiliates of the bank (although subsidiaries of the bank itself, except financial subsidiaries, are generally not considered affiliates). Generally, Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act and the Federal Reserve Board’s Regulation W limit the extent to which the bank or its subsidiaries may engage in “covered transactions” with any one affiliate to an amount equal to 10.0% of such institution’s capital stock and surplus, and with all such transactions with all affiliates to an amount equal to 20.0% of such institution’s capital stock and surplus. Section 23B applies to “covered transactions” as well as to certain other transactions and requires that all such transactions be on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable, to the institution or subsidiary as those provided to a non-affiliate. The term “covered transaction” includes the making of loans to, purchase of assets from, and issuance of a guarantee to an affiliate, and other similar transactions. Section 23B transactions also include the provision of services and the sale of assets by a bank to an affiliate. In addition, loans or other extensions of credit by the financial institution to the affiliate are required to be collateralized in accordance with the requirements set forth in Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act.

Sections 22(h) and (g) of the Federal Reserve Act place restrictions on loans to a bank’s insiders, i.e., executive officers, directors and principal shareholders. Under Section 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act, loans to a director, an executive officer and to a greater than 10.0% shareholder of a financial institution, and certain affiliated interests of these, together with all other outstanding loans to such person and affiliated interests, may not exceed specified limits. Section 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act also requires that loans to directors, executive officers and principal shareholders be made on terms and conditions substantially the same as offered in comparable transactions to persons who are not insiders and also requires prior board approval for certain loans. In addition, the aggregate amount of extensions of credit by a financial institution to insiders cannot exceed the institution’s unimpaired capital and surplus. Section 22(g) of the Federal Reserve Act places additional restrictions on loans to executive officers.

Enforcement. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has extensive enforcement authority over insured state savings banks, including BankProv. The enforcement authority includes, among other things, the ability to assess civil money penalties, issue cease and desist orders and remove directors and officers. In general, these enforcement actions may be initiated in response to violations of laws and regulations, breaches of fiduciary duty and unsafe or unsound practices. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation is required, with certain exceptions, to appoint a receiver or conservator for an insured state non-member bank if that bank was “critically undercapitalized” on average during the calendar quarter beginning 270 days after the date on which the institution became “critically undercapitalized.” The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation may also appoint itself as conservator or receiver for an insured state non-member bank under specified circumstances, including: (1) insolvency; (2) substantial dissipation of assets or earnings through violations of law or unsafe or unsound practices; (3) existence of an unsafe or unsound condition to transact business; (4) insufficient capital; or (5) the incurrence of losses that will deplete substantially all of the institution’s capital with no reasonable prospect of replenishment without federal assistance.




Federal Insurance of Deposit Accounts. BankProv is a member of the Deposit Insurance Fund, which is administered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Deposit accounts in BankProv are insured up to a maximum of $250,000 for each separately insured depositor.

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation imposes an assessment for deposit insurance on all depository institutions. Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation’s risk-based assessment system, insured institutions deemed less risky of failure pay lower assessments. Assessment rates (inclusive of possible adjustments) for most banks with less than $10 billion of assets are based on a formula using financial data and supervisory ratings, and currently range from 2.5 to 32 basis points of each institution’s total assets less tangible capital. 

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has authority to increase insurance assessments. A significant increase in insurance premiums would likely have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and results of operations of BankProv. Future insurance assessment rates cannot be predicted. 

Insurance of deposits may be terminated by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or regulatory condition imposed in writing. We do not know of any practice, condition or violation that might lead to termination of deposit insurance. 

Privacy Regulations. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation regulations generally require that BankProv disclose its privacy policy, including identifying with whom it shares a customer’s “non-public personal information,” to customers at the time of establishing the customer relationship and annually thereafter. In addition, BankProv is required to provide its customers with the ability to “opt-out” of having their personal information shared with unaffiliated third parties and not to disclose account numbers or access codes to non-affiliated third parties for marketing purposes. BankProv currently has a privacy protection policy in place and believes that such policy is in compliance with the regulations.

Community Reinvestment Act. Under the Community Reinvestment Act, or CRA, as implemented by Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation regulations, a non-member bank has a continuing and affirmative obligation, consistent with its safe and sound operation, to help meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. The CRA does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions nor does it limit an institution’s discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community, consistent with the CRA. The CRA does require the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, in connection with its examination of a non-member bank, to assess the institution’s record of meeting the credit needs of its community and to take such record into account in its evaluation of certain applications by such institution, including applications to acquire branches and other financial institutions. The CRA requires the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to provide a written evaluation of an institution’s CRA performance utilizing a four-tiered descriptive rating system. BankProv’s latest Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation CRA rating was “Satisfactory.”

In May 2022, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and other bank regulatory agencies released a notice of proposed rulemaking to strengthen and modernize the Community Reinvestment Act regulations and framework.

Massachusetts has its own statutory counterpart to the CRA which is also applicable to BankProv. The Massachusetts version is generally similar to the CRA but utilizes a five-tiered descriptive rating system. Massachusetts law requires the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks to consider, but not be limited to, a bank’s record of performance under Massachusetts law in considering any application by the bank to establish a branch or other deposit-taking facility, to relocate an office or to merge or consolidate with or acquire the assets and assume the liabilities of any other banking institution. BankProv’s most recent rating under Massachusetts law was “Satisfactory.” 

Consumer Protection and Fair Lending Regulations. Massachusetts savings banks are subject to a variety of federal and Massachusetts statutes and regulations that are intended to protect consumers and prohibit discrimination in the granting of credit. These statutes and regulations provide for a range of sanctions for non-compliance with their terms, including imposition of administrative fines and remedial orders, and referral to the Attorney General for prosecution of a civil action for actual and punitive damages and injunctive relief. Certain of these statutes authorize private individual and class action lawsuits and the award of actual, statutory and punitive damages and attorneys’ fees for certain types of violations. 

USA PATRIOT Act. BankProv is subject to the USA PATRIOT Act, which gave federal agencies additional powers to address terrorist threats through enhanced domestic security measures, expanded surveillance powers, increased information sharing, and broadened anti-money laundering requirements. By way of amendments to the Bank Secrecy Act, Title III of the USA PATRIOT Act provided measures intended to encourage information sharing among bank regulatory agencies and law enforcement bodies. Further, certain provisions of Title III impose affirmative obligations on a broad range of financial institutions, including banks, thrifts, brokers, dealers, credit unions, money transfer agents, and parties registered under the Commodity Exchange Act. 




Other Regulations 

Interest and other charges collected or contracted for by BankProv are subject to state usury laws and federal laws concerning interest rates. Loan operations are also subject to state and federal laws applicable to credit transactions, such as the:
Home Mortgage Disclosure Act of 1975, requiring financial institutions to provide information to enable the public and public officials to determine whether a financial institution is fulfilling its obligation to help meet the housing needs of the community it serves; 
Equal Credit Opportunity Act, prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, creed or other prohibited factors in extending credit; 
Fair Credit Reporting Act of 1978, governing the use and provision of information to credit reporting agencies; 
Massachusetts Debt Collection Regulations, establishing standards, by defining unfair or deceptive acts or practices, for the collection of debts from persons within the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and the General Laws of Massachusetts, Chapter 167E, which governs BankProv’s lending powers; and 
Rules and regulations of the various federal and state agencies charged with the responsibility of implementing such federal and state laws. 

The deposit operations of BankProv also are subject to, among others, the: 
Right to Financial Privacy Act, which imposes a duty to maintain confidentiality of consumer financial records and prescribes procedures for complying with administrative subpoenas of financial records; 
Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act (also known as “Check 21”), which gives “substitute checks,” such as digital check images and copies made from that image, the same legal standing as the original paper check; 
Electronic Funds Transfer Act and Regulation E promulgated thereunder, which govern automatic deposits to and withdrawals from deposit accounts and customers’ rights and liabilities arising from the use of automated teller machines and other electronic banking services; and 
General Laws of Massachusetts, Chapter 167D, which governs deposit powers. 

Federal Home Loan Bank System 

BankProv is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank System, which consists of 11 regional Federal Home Loan Banks. The Federal Home Loan Bank provides a central credit facility primarily for member institutions. Members of the Federal Home Loan Bank are required to acquire and hold shares of capital stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank. BankProv was in compliance with this requirement at December 31, 2022. Based on redemption provisions of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston, the stock has no quoted market value and is carried at cost. BankProv reviews for impairment based on the ultimate recoverability of the cost basis of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston stock. As of December 31, 2022, no impairment has been recognized. 

At its discretion, the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston may declare dividends on their stock. The Federal Home Loan Banks are required to provide funds for certain purposes including, for example, contributing funds for affordable housing programs. These requirements could reduce the amount of dividends that the Federal Home Loan Banks pay to their members and result in the Federal Home Loan Banks imposing a higher rate of interest on advances to their members. In 2022, the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston paid dividends equal to an annual yield of 3.53%. There can be no assurance that such dividends will continue in the future.

Holding Company Regulation 

Provident Bancorp, Inc. is subject to examination, regulation, and periodic reporting under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, as administered by the Federal Reserve Board. Provident Bancorp, Inc. is required to obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board to acquire all, or substantially all, of the assets of any bank or bank holding company. Prior Federal Reserve Board approval would be required for Provident Bancorp, Inc. to acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting securities of any bank or bank holding company if, after such acquisition, it would, directly or indirectly, own or control more than 5% of any class of voting shares of the bank or bank holding company. In addition to the approval of the Federal Reserve Board, prior approval may also be necessary from other agencies having supervisory jurisdiction over the bank to be acquired before any bank acquisition can be completed. 

A bank holding company is generally prohibited from engaging in non-banking activities, or acquiring direct or indirect control of more than 5% of the voting securities of any company engaged in non-banking activities. One of the principal exceptions to this prohibition is for activities found by the Federal Reserve Board to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. Some of the principal activities that the Federal Reserve Board has determined by regulation to be so closely related to banking are: (i) making or servicing loans; (ii) performing certain data processing services; (iii) providing discount brokerage services; (iv) acting as a fiduciary, investment or financial advisor; (v) leasing personal or real property; (vi) making investments in corporations or projects designed primarily to promote community welfare; and (vii) acquiring a savings and loan association whose direct and indirect activities are limited to those permitted for bank holding companies. 

 



The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 authorized a bank holding company that meets specified conditions, including being “well capitalized” and “well managed,” to opt to become a “financial holding company” and thereby engage in a broader array of financial activities than previously permitted. Such activities can include insurance underwriting and investment banking. We have not opted into financial holding company status.

A bank holding company is generally required to give the Federal Reserve Board prior written notice of any purchase or redemption of then outstanding equity securities if the gross consideration for the purchase or redemption, when combined with the net consideration paid for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding 12 months, is equal to 10% or more of the company’s consolidated net worth. The Federal Reserve Board may disapprove such a purchase or redemption if it determines that the proposal would constitute an unsafe and unsound practice, or would violate any law, regulation, Federal Reserve Board order or directive, or any condition imposed by, or written agreement with, the Federal Reserve Board. There is an exception to this approval requirement for well-capitalized bank holding companies that meet certain other conditions. 

The Federal Reserve Board has issued a policy statement regarding capital distributions, including dividends, by bank holding companies. In general, the Federal Reserve Board’s policies provide that dividends should be paid only out of current earnings and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention by the bank holding company appears consistent with the organization’s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. The Federal Reserve Board’s policies also require that a bank holding company serve as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary banks by standing ready to use available resources to provide adequate capital funds to those banks during periods of financial stress or adversity and by maintaining the financial flexibility and capital-raising capacity to obtain additional resources for assisting its subsidiary banks where necessary. The Dodd-Frank Act codified the source of strength doctrine. Under the prompt corrective action laws, the ability of a bank holding company to pay dividends may be restricted if a subsidiary bank becomes undercapitalized. In addition, the Federal Reserve Board has issued guidance that requires consultation with the agency prior to a bank holding company’s payment of dividends or repurchase of stock under certain circumstances. These regulatory policies could affect the ability of Provident Bancorp, Inc. to pay dividends, repurchase its stock or otherwise engage in capital distributions. 

Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, depository institutions are liable to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation for losses suffered or anticipated by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in connection with the default of a commonly controlled depository institution or any assistance provided by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to such an institution in danger of default. 

The status of Provident Bancorp, Inc. as a registered bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act will not exempt it from certain federal and state laws and regulations applicable to corporations generally, including, without limitation, certain provisions of the federal securities laws. 

Massachusetts Holding Company Regulation.  Under the Massachusetts banking laws, a company owning or controlling two or more banking institutions, including a savings bank, is regulated as a bank holding company. The term “company” is defined by the Massachusetts banking laws similarly to the definition of “company” under the Bank Holding Company Act. Each Massachusetts bank holding company: (i) must obtain the approval of the Massachusetts Board of Bank Incorporation before engaging in certain transactions, such as the acquisition of more than 5% of the voting stock of another banking institution; (ii) must register, and file reports, with the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks; and (iii) is subject to examination by the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks. Provident Bancorp, Inc. is not a “bank holding company” under the Massachusetts banking laws.

Federal Securities Laws

Provident Bancorp, Inc.’s common stock is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Provident Bancorp, Inc. is subject to the information, proxy solicitation, insider trading restrictions and other requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

Acquisition of the Company

Under the Change in Bank Control Act, no person, or group of persons acting in concert, may acquire control of a bank holding company such as Provident Bancorp, Inc. unless the Federal Reserve Board has been given 60 days’ prior written notice and not disapproved the proposed acquisition. The Federal Reserve Board considers several factors in evaluating a notice, including the financial and managerial resources of the acquirer and competitive effects. Control, as defined under the Change in Bank Control Act and applicable regulations, means the power, directly or indirectly, to direct the management or policies of the company or to vote 25% or more of any class of voting securities of the company. Acquisition of more than 10% of any class of a bank holding company’s voting securities constitutes a rebuttable presumption of control under certain circumstances, including where, as is the case with Provident Bancorp, Inc., the issuer has registered securities under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

In addition, federal regulations provide that no company may acquire control of a bank holding company without the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board. Control, as defined under the Bank Holding Company Act and Federal Reserve Board regulations, means ownership, control or power to vote 25% or more of any class of voting stock, control in any manner over the election of a majority of 

 

the company’s directors, or a determination by the regulator that the acquiror has the power to exercise, directly or indirectly, a controlling influence over the management or policies of the company. Any company that acquires such control becomes a “bank holding company” subject to registration, examination and regulation by the Federal Reserve Board. In 2020 the Federal Reserve Board amended its regulations concerning when a company exercises a controlling influence over a bank or bank holding company for purposes of the Bank Holding Company Act. Relevant factors include the company’s voting and nonvoting equity investment in the bank or bank holding company, director, officer and employee overlap and the scope of business relationships between the company and bank or bank holding company.
