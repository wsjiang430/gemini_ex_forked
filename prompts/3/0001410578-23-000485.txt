Item 1. Business
OVERVIEW
We are a commercial-stage pharmaceutical company founded in October 2014 that focuses on the development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products for the treatment of dermatological conditions. Our current portfolio includes eight branded and three authorized generic prescription drugs for dermatological conditions that are marketed in the U.S. We are managed by experienced life science executives with a track record of creating value for their stakeholders and bringing novel medicines to the market, enabling patients to experience increased quality of life, and enabling physicians and other licensed medical professionals to provide better care for their patients. We aim to acquire rights to future products by licensing or otherwise acquiring an ownership interest in, funding the research and development of, and eventually commercializing, these products through our field sales organization. Since inception, we have made significant investments to build out our commercial product portfolios, which we believe, coupled with our experienced dermatology sales leadership team and our recently expanded field sales force, will position our business for growth. We are a majority-owned subsidiary of Fortress.
2022 Highlights and Events 
On December 30, 2022, we filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (File No. 333-269079), which was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on January 26, 2023. This shelf registration statement covers the offering, issuance and sale by us of up to an aggregate of $150.0 million of our common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants, and units (the “2022 Shelf”). At December 31, 2022, $150.0 million remains available under the 2022 Shelf. In connection with the 2022 shelf, we have entered into an At Market Issuance Sales Agreement (the “Sales Agreement”) with B. Riley Securities, Inc. (“B. Riley”), relating to shares of our common stock. In accordance with the terms of the Sales Agreement, we may offer and sell up to 4,900,000 shares of our common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, from time to time through or to B. Riley acting as our agent or principal.
On March 14, 2022, we dosed the first patient in our Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating DFD-29 (Minocycline Modified Release Capsules 40 mg) for the Treatment of Rosacea. In January 2023 we achieved 100% enrollment in the trial, with a top-line data readout expected in the second quarter of 2023. We plan to submit the NDA for DFD-29 in the second half of 2023 and FDA approval is anticipated in the second half of 2024. In the Phase 2 clinical trials, DFD-29 (40mg) demonstrated nearly double the efficacy when compared against Oraycea® (European equivalent of Oracea®) on both co-primary endpoints. For the first co-primary endpoint, Investigator’s Global Assessment (“IGA”) treatment success, Oraycea only had a 33.33% IGA treatment success rate, while DFD-29 achieved a 66.04% IGA treatment success rate. For the second co-primary endpoint, the change in total inflammatory lesion count, Oraycea only had a 10.5 reduction in inflammatory lesions, while DFD-29 achieved a 19.2 reduction in inflammatory lesions.
On February 11, 2022, we announced that our exclusive licensing partner in Japan, Maruho Co., Ltd. (“Maruho”), received marketing and manufacturing approval for Rapifort® Wipes 2.5% (Qbrexza®), for the treatment of primary axillary hyperhidrosis, triggering a net $2.5 million milestone payment to us. The net payment reflects a milestone payment of $10 million to us from our exclusive licensing partner Maruho, offset by a $7.5 million payment to Dermira, Inc. (“Dermira”), the company from which we acquired global rights to Qbrexza® in May 2021, pursuant to the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement between us and Dermira. Under the terms of the licensing agreement with Maruho, the milestone payment was due from Maruho within 30 days of the approval. The period ended December 31, 2022 also reflects total year-to-date royalties of $0.2 million from Maruho on sales of Rapifort® Wipes 2.5% in Japan.
On January 12, 2022, we acquired Amzeeq® (minocycline) topical foam, 4%, and Zilxi® (minocycline) topical foam, 1.5%, two FDA-Approved Topical Minocycline Products and Molecule Stabilizing Technology (MST)™ from VYNE Therapeutics Inc., which expanded our product portfolio to eight actively marketed branded dermatology products.
These proprietary foam-based products optimize the topical delivery of minocycline, an active pharmaceutical ingredient that was previously available only in oral form. Approved by the FDA nearly 50 years ago, minocycline is a well-established molecule that has been prescribed, in oral formulation, over 30 million times in the past decade.

AMZEEQ (minocycline) topical foam, 4%, is the first and only topical formulation of minocycline to be approved by the FDA for the treatment of inflammatory lesions of non-nodular moderate to severe acne vulgaris in adults and children 9 years and older. According to the American Academy of Dermatology (“AAD”), acne is the most common skin condition in the United States, affecting up to 50 million Americans annually. 
Approved by the FDA in May 2020, ZILXI (minocycline) topical foam, 1.5%, is the first and only topical minocycline treatment for inflammatory lesions due to rosacea in adults. Rosacea is a common skin disease that affects 16 million Americans, according to AAD. Market research shows that over 70% of patients with rosacea are seeking better alternatives to current treatments.
On January 12, 2022, we entered into a third amendment of the loan and security agreement with East West Bank (“EWB”) (the “Amendment”), which increased the borrowing capacity of our revolving line of credit to $10.0 million, $2.9 million of which was outstanding at December 31, 2022, and added a term loan not to exceed $20.0 million. Both the revolving line of credit and the term loan mature on January 12, 2026. In January 2022 and August 2022, the Company borrowed $15.0 million and $5.0 million, respectively, against the term loan. The term loans bear interest at a floating rate equal to 1.73% above the prime rate and are payable monthly. The term loans contain an interest-only payment period through January 12, 2024, with an extension through July 12, 2024 if certain covenants are met, after which the outstanding balance of each term loan is payable in equal monthly installments of principal, plus all accrued interest, through the term loan maturity date. We may elect to prepay all or any part of the term loan without penalty or premium, but we may not re-borrow any amount, once repaid. Any outstanding borrowing against the revolving line of credit bears interest at a floating rate equal to 0.70% above the prime rate. The Amendment includes customary financial covenants such as collateral ratios and minimum liquidity provisions. We are in compliance with all applicable financial covenants under the Amendment as of December 31, 2022. The $10.0 million revolving line of credit is fully available to us without any restrictions, other than certain customary and ordinary closing conditions.
In September 2021, we were the victim of a cybersecurity incident that affected our accounts payable function and led to approximately $9.5 million in wire transfers being misdirected to fraudulent accounts. The matter was reported to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (“FBI”) and remains under their investigation. The cybersecurity incident does not appear to have compromised any personally identifiable information or protected health information. Fortress, as our controlling stockholder and supporting partner in our back-office functions, provided us with $9.5 million to ensure our accounts payable operations continued to function smoothly. The $9.5 million of support was in the form of a related party note, which was approved by the board of directors of both companies, and the balance of which was fully converted into 1,476,044 shares of our common stock upon the consummation of our IPO in November 2021 at the IPO price. The federal government has been able to trace and seize the fraudulently transferred cryptocurrency assets associated with the breach. The seized cryptocurrency has been transferred into U.S. government-controlled custodial wallets. Subsequently, the forfeiture process will be initiated by the U.S. Attorney’s Office. The process includes mandatory waiting periods for filing of claims. Once the cryptocurrency has been converted back into U.S. dollars, we expect to receive a notification letter to initiate the return of the cash to the Company. This process could take several months to a year or possibly longer to complete before funds can be returned. Given the recent market declines, volatility, and liquidity issues with cryptocurrency, there is no certainty as to the amount we will ultimately recover.

Our Products and Relevant Disease States
Excessive Underarm Sweating and the Current Standard of Care
Excessive underarm sweating, commonly referred to as primary axillary hyperhidrosis (“PAH”), is a rare disorder characterized by excessive sweating in the armpits. The exact cause of PAH is not known, and the disorder affects males and females equally. When excessive sweating occurs as part of some other disorder, it is said to be secondary hyperhidrosis, which is a more commonly encountered condition than is primary hyperhidrosis. According to a 2016 article published in the Archives of Dermatological Research, there are approximately 10 million people who suffer from PAH in the United States. The symptoms of PAH typically begin during childhood or puberty and may often, although not always, persist throughout a person’s life. Affected individuals may experience a heightened reaction to certain stimuli that can cause sweating such as anxiety, pain, exercise, tension, caffeine, and/or nicotine. The symptoms of this disorder develop due to overactivity of certain sweat glands, and incidences may be precipitated by social and/or physical stress. Some people with PAH experience relief from the symptoms during adulthood without treatment or obvious reason for the remission.
Pharmacological treatment options for PAH include topical, oral and iontophoretic treatments.
Qbrexza® (glycopyrronium 2.4% cloth) for the Treatment of Primary Axillary Hyperhidrosis
Our Qbrexza® (glycopyrronium 2.4%) product is a topical, once-daily anticholinergic cloth that was approved by the FDA in June 2018 for the treatment of PAH in adult and pediatric patients nine years of age and older. Anticholinergics are a class of pharmaceutical products that exert their effect by blocking the action of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter that transmits signals within the nervous 

8



system that are responsible for the activation of sweat glands. Qbrexza is applied directly to the skin and is designed to block underarm sweat production by inhibiting sweat gland activation. Qbrexza has Orange Book-listed patents that extend through February of 2033.
The PAH market had approximately 450,000 prescriptions in 2022 according to Symphony Health, excluding over-the-counter (“OTC”) clinical strength anti-perspirants.
Acne and the Current Standard of Care
Acne, also known as acne vulgaris, is a common skin disorder characterized by a blockage of hair follicles, which are clogged with oil and dead skin cells. According to the AAD, acne is the most common skin condition in the US, affecting up to 50 million individuals annually.
Approximately 85% of people between the ages of 12 and 24 experience at least a minor form of acne. The disease is classified as mild, moderate or severe based on the severity of the disease progression, which is useful in identifying an appropriate treatment regimen. Mild acne is characterized by clogged hair follicles (known as comedones) that are either exposed to air (blackheads) or closed (whiteheads), with occasional inflammatory lesions which occur primarily on the face. Moderate acne is characterized by a higher presence of inflammatory lesions known as papules and pustules across the face and extending to the trunk. Severe acne is characterized by painful, deep lesions called nodules across the face, with extensive involvement of the trunk frequently.
Treatment options are based on the severity of disease, with certain drugs being reserved for more severe forms of the disease. Mild acne is addressed with dietary and lifestyle changes, along with OTC and prescription topical agents. Other therapies with varying degrees of success include dermabrasion and chemical peels, light therapy and hormonal therapy such as birth control pills or spironolactone. Moderate acne is treated with more aggressive therapy including topical and oral antibiotics such as tetracyclines, which are particularly effective due to their antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties, and other topical agents including benzoyl peroxide and retinoids. Severe acne is treated with combination therapies, often including oral antibiotics. For resistant cases, physicians may use a potent drug known as isotretinoin (a vitamin A analog), which requires Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (“REMS”) (safety) monitoring with regard to pregnancy. The current U.S. market size for treatment of acne is considerable and estimated at approximately $3 billion annually, according to the American Medical Association.
Accutane® for the Treatment of Severe Recalitrant Nodular Acne
Accutane® (isotretinoin 10mg, 20mg, 30mg, and 40mg capsules USP) is indicated for the treatment of severe recalcitrant nodular acne. Accutane is used to treat a type of severe recalcitrant nodular acne that has not been helped by other treatments, including antibiotics. Severe recalcitrant nodular acne occurs when many red, swollen, tender lumps form in the skin. Patients with severe nodular acne are at higher risk of scarring. Accutane belongs to a class of drugs that affects all four major pathogenic processes in acne: increased sebum production, irregular follicular desquamation, propionibacterium acnes proliferation and inflammation. Accutane has achieved a strong market position and is well known in the dermatology community.
The oral isotretinoin market had over 2 million prescriptions in 2022 according to Symphony Health.
Targadox® for the Treatment of Severe Acne
Targadox® (doxycycline hyclate immediate release 50mg tablets) is indicated as adjunctive therapy for severe acne, which is part of a class of oral antibiotics known as tetracyclines. The tetracycline class, which includes minocycline, doxycycline, sarecycline and tetracycline, is particularly effective in treatment for more severe forms of acne due to its antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties. Targadox is gluten-free, lactose-free, animal byproduct-free, and GMO-free.
The oral doxycycline market had more than 25 million prescriptions in 2022 according to Symphony Health.
Amzeeq® for the Treatment of Moderate-to-Severe Acne
Amzeeq® (4% minocycline foam), formerly known as FMX101, was approved by the FDA in October 2019 and became available in pharmacies nationwide in January 2020. Amzeeq is a once-daily novel topical antibiotic foam formulation of minocycline for the treatment of inflammatory lesions of non-nodular moderate-to-severe acne vulgaris in patients nine years of age and older. Amzeeq utilizes proprietary MST™ technology and is the first topical minocycline to be approved by the FDA for any condition. We believe 

9



that the combination of a well-established antibiotic in a well-tolerated, easy to use foam makes Amzeeq a very attractive treatment option for patients. 
The topical acne market had almost 20 million prescriptions in 2022 according to Symphony Health, presenting significant unmet needs of patients and healthcare providers to be addressed. As the first topical minocycline to be approved by the FDA for any condition, we believe that Amzeeq may provide a new treatment alternative for patients and healthcare providers who are unsatisfied with their current therapies. Amzeeq has Orange Book-listed patents that extend through September of 2037. 
Ximino® for the Treatment of Inflammatory Lesions of Non-Nodular Moderate to Severe Acne
Ximino® (minocycline hydrochloride extended-release 45mg, 90mg, and 135mg capsules) is indicated for the treatment of inflammatory non-nodular lesions (pimples and red bumps) associated with moderate to severe acne. Minocycline is part of a class of oral antibiotics known as tetracyclines. Ximino encloses a small, uniform amount of the active pharmaceutical ingredient in a patented polymer wrapper through a controlled dosing capsular technology, known as Capsular Minotab Technology®, and provides a steady, controlled release of minocycline. The polymer technology in Ximino capsules is partially resistant to dissolution, so the minocycline is released over time, in a controlled manner. Ximino has Orange Book-listed patents that extend through April of 2027.
The oral minocycline market had just under 3 million prescriptions in 2022 according to Symphony Health.
Fungal Infections of the Skin and the Current Standard of Care
Fungal skin infections, collectively referred to as dermatomycoses, are common infections caused by ringworms (tinea) and include such conditions as athlete’s foot, jock itch and ringworm of the body. Tinea pedis, commonly known as athlete’s foot, is a form of ringworm that usually develops between the toes. Symptoms include peeling, cracking and scaly feet, blisters, and skin that is red, softened, itching, or burning. Tinea cruris, commonly known as jock itch, is a form of ringworm that affects the groin. Tinea corporis, commonly known as ringworm of the body, is a fungal infection that appears on the body in which the outer part of the sore might be raised while the skin in the middle appears normal. Fungal infections caused by ringworm cause skin rashes that present as itchy, red, raised and scaly rings. These infections are easily transmissible between people, pets or contaminated objects or surfaces but are usually not serious in nature.
Treatment options typically involve topical OTC and prescription antifungal medications. Where difficult to administer topically, oral options (such as for toenail fungus or oral thrush) or suppositories (such as for vaginal yeast infections) have proven to be more effective. OTC products typically include known antifungal ingredients such as clotrimazole, miconazole, terbinafine or ketoconazole. Prescription treatments are often reserved for more serious infection or for those in hard-to-treat areas. In conjunction with OTC or prescription medications, lifestyle adjustments, including daily washing of bedding and clothing during an infection, drying thoroughly after bathing, wearing loose clothing in affected areas and actively treating infected areas, can all contribute to disinfecting your surroundings and preventing a prolongation or recurrence of infection.
Exelderm® for the Treatment of Fungal Skin Infections
Exelderm® (sulconazole nitrate 1%, cream and solution) is a broad-spectrum antifungal agent indicated for the treatment of ringworm-caused fungal infections including tinea pedis, tinea cruris, tinea corporis and tinea versicolor. The active pharmaceutical ingredient (sulconazole) acts by inhibiting fungal cell division and growth and has been shown to have broad activity against candida species, aspergillus species and dermatophytes. Exelderm cream or solution is administered externally only, whereby a small amount of cream or solution is gently massaged into the affected and surrounding areas and only requires a convenient once or twice daily application. However, when used to treat tinea pedis, for which Exelderm cream is also indicated, twice daily application is required.
The topical antifungal market had more than 11 million prescriptions in 2022 according to Symphony Health.
Pruritus (Itch) and the Current Standard of Care
Pruritus or itch is defined as an unpleasant sensation of the skin that provokes the urge to scratch. It is a characteristic feature of many skin diseases and an unusual sign of some systemic diseases. Pruritus may be localized or generalized and can occur as an acute or chronic condition. Itch can be caused by a number of conditions, including skin conditions such as dry skin, eczema, psoriasis, scabies, 

10



parasites, burns, scars, insect bites and hives. Depending on the cause of itchiness, skin may appear normal, red, rough or bumpy. Repeated scratching can cause raised thick areas of skin that might bleed or become infected.
Treatment for itch may include moisturizing daily, using gentle cleansers, and bathing with lukewarm water. Long-term relief requires identifying and treating the underlying cause of itchy skin. Common treatments are prescription medicated creams and lotions, moist dressings, and oral anti-itch medicines.
Anti-Itch Product for the Treatment of Pruritus
Our acquired anti-itch product is indicated to treat pruritis, scabies, and other skin itch conditions (“Anti-itch Product”). Our Anti-itch Product delivers prescription relief and is non-steroidal and antihistamine free. Topical steroids are effective against itch because they reduce inflammation that can cause itch. However, they are not recommended for long-term use. Antihistamines are also effective in treating some types of itch, but they too have drawbacks with continued use. We plan on launching our Anti-itch Product through our field sales force during the second half of 2023.
Rosacea and the Current Standard of Care
Rosacea is a chronic, relapsing, inflammatory skin condition that most commonly presents with symptoms such as deep facial redness, acne-like inflammatory lesions (papules and pustules) and spider veins (telangiectasia). According to The National Rosacea Society, it is estimated that rosacea affects well over 16 million Americans and as many as 415 million people worldwide. Rosacea is most frequently seen in adults between 30 and 50 years of age. Surveys conducted by The National Rosacea Society report more than 90% of rosacea patients said their condition had lowered their self-confidence and self-esteem, and 41% reported that it had caused them to avoid public contact or cancel social engagements. Among rosacea patients with severe symptoms, 88% said the disorder had adversely affected their professional interactions, and 51% said they had missed work because of their condition. The rosacea market had 3.6 million prescriptions in 2022 and 3.4 million prescriptions in 2021 according to Symphony Health.
The tetracycline class of antibiotics (minocycline and doxycycline) are considered to be effective options for treatment of papulopustular rosacea, likely due to anti-inflammatory activities that are usually manifested at doses much lower than those prescribed for treatment of bacterial infections. A sub-antimicrobial dose of doxycycline (i.e., 40 mg taken once daily) as oral formulation has been approved for the treatment of only inflammatory lesions (papules and pustules) of rosacea and is available under the proprietary name Oracea® in the US. Oracea is generally considered to be the current standard of care. Minocycline, first introduced in 1971, is widely believed to be the most effective tetracycline agent due to its high lipophilicity, which is anticipated to permit greater permeation into, and accumulation in, the sebaceous follicles and layers of the epidermis. We offer two products, Zilxi and, if approved, DFD-29, that we believe provide a new treatment alternative for patients and healthcare providers who are unsatisfied with their current rosacea therapies.
Zilxi® for the Treatment of Papulopustular Rosacea
Zilxi® (1.5% minocycline foam), was approved by the FDA in May 2020 and became available in pharmacies nationwide in October 2020. Zilxi is a once-daily novel antibiotic foam formulation of minocycline for the treatment of inflammatory lesions of rosacea in adults. Similar to Amzeeq, Zilxi leverages MST™ technology and is the first minocycline product of any form to be approved by the FDA for use in rosacea. We believe the anti-inflammatory properties of minocycline delivered in our innovative foam technology make Zilxi a highly appealing treatment option for rosacea patients. Zilxi has Orange Book-listed patents that extend through October of 2030.
DFD-29 for the Treatment of Rosacea
DFD-29, is a low-dose minocycline (40 mg) extended release capsule formulation for oral use, for the treatment of papulopustular rosacea. The rationale of selecting DFD-29 doses lower than the approved minocycline dose, is based on the lower protein binding and higher lipophilicity of minocycline. A Phase 1 PK study (DFD-29-CD-001) in 24 healthy subjects demonstrated the systemic exposure of minocycline from DFD-29 (minocycline HCl) ER capsules 40 mg was much lower than that seen with the approved antibiotic dose of minocycline (not a head-to-head study). A Phase 2 study (DFD-29-CD-002) in 205 subjects with papulopustular rosacea, demonstrated that DFD-29 (40 mg) was significantly superior to placebo and Oracea®, on the co-primary endpoints of IGA treatment success and absolute inflammatory lesion count reduction. The study also showed DFD-29 was well-tolerated and safe. DFD-29 is currently in advanced stages of Phase 3 clinical studies for papulopustular rosacea.

Our Strategy
We are a highly focused, pharmaceutical company dedicated to developing and commercializing therapies for the treatment of dermatologic conditions that seeks to deliver value to patients, physicians and the healthcare system, as well as to our stakeholders. Our strategic priorities include continuing to augment and grow our product portfolio and organization in order to maximize the probabilities of sustainable long-term value creation. This will consist of both commercial execution on our existing product portfolio, including lifecycle management, as well as investing in additional growth strategies through product and company acquisitions, licensing, or developing new products.
An important part of our growth strategy is to identify new business development opportunities, including development stage and commercial drugs that we may acquire from other pharmaceutical companies. We are in various stages of discussion for other opportunities, both commercial and development stage, that could drive additional growth in the business. Successful development and commercialization of any future in-licensed development stage or commercial drugs will require us to navigate the many laws and regulations of governmental authorities and regulatory agencies around the world, including the FDA, relating to the manufacture, development, approval and commercialization of investigational drugs. For development stage drugs, we may require financial resources significantly in excess of those received by us upon completion of our IPO in November 2021 and our current cash on hand, and it may take many years for us to receive marketing approval, if ever, for any in-licensed or acquired product candidate.
Competitive Strengths
To successfully execute our strategy, we must continue to capitalize on our following core strengths:

● | Commercial leadership of our management team with a track record of commercial execution. We have a highly skilled and customer-focused management team in critical leadership positions across our Company. Our senior management team has over 135 years of collective sales and marketing experience in the pharmaceutical industry and a proven track record of developing businesses and creating value. Members of our management team have developed, launched, commercialized, and managed brands, generating over $3 billion in peak sales, collectively, at leading dermatology organizations. This experience includes improving business performance through organic revenue growth, maximizing operational efficiencies and through the identification, consummation and integration of licensing and acquisition opportunities. Our senior management team has extensive roots in the dermatology industry, with many of them having worked at and held senior positions with Medicis Pharmaceutical, Inc. leading up to the company’s acquisition by Valeant Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (now Bausch Health Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) for $2.6 billion in 2012. Our strategic approach leverages our management team’s experience with the capabilities of our field sales force to drive performance based on prescribing habits, brand preferences, promotional strategies and profit optimization while focusing on customer service excellence for our providers and their patients. Our execution to date has led to market-leading positions for three of our established brands, Targadox, Ximino, and Exelderm, in each of their respective markets.

● | Performance and experience of our accomplished field sales force. Our current seasoned field sales force includes approximately 65 professionals with an average tenure of over 11 years of experience in dermatology sales. Each of these individuals have deep-rooted and longstanding customer relationships in their respective territories. We have strategically optimized our sales outreach to cover over 80% of dermatologists in the top 50 U.S. metropolitan statistical areas and over 70% of the overall dermatology prescribing market. We are able to leverage the experience of our field sales force to create a tailored and entrepreneurial compensation plan that incentivizes our field sales force and aligns their activities with our corporate performance and growth objectives. We intend to continue to build a team of committed, experienced employees and to engage with patients and members of the dermatology community. Additionally, we believe that consolidation in the medical dermatology industry has resulted in an enhanced opportunity for a medical dermatology-focused company to build relationships with these stakeholders and has made available a large and growing talent pool of experienced individuals who can make significant contributions to our Company.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Specialized and differentiated access and distribution model. We have a specialized and differentiated access and distribution network of over 600 specialty pharmacies and wholesalers, where we directly sell our products, with limited distribution through traditional national wholesalers. This decentralized approach allows us to maximize our brand equity across our product portfolio through strategic relationships directly with pharmacies and allows us to provide exceptional customer service and access to patients and physicians.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | Active business development initiative. Business development plays a vital role in our growth strategy as we look to build scale. We consistently evaluate both strategic add-on deals that leverage our existing infrastructure, as well as more transformative assets that would require building out or restructuring our field sales force. We have extensive relationships in the industry that help us stay abreast of developments in our space and continually monitor new opportunities. We believe that we are an ideal partner for development stage companies with limited or no commercial capabilities, as well as established pharmaceutical companies looking to deprioritize their dermatology portfolio. We have ongoing discussions with an array of companies, including traditional large pharma, mid-size specialty pharma companies and smaller companies that focus on research and development, although we have not entered into any definitive agreements or arrangements.

● | Focus on cost management and efficient capital allocation. We have operated in a cost-conscious and capital efficient manner since inception. In addition to our internal leadership and management team, we have access to over 30 Fortress employees who possess significant expertise in one or more of the following areas: business development, legal, accounting, regulatory affairs, clinical operations and manufacturing. In November 2021, we entered into a shared services agreement with Fortress whereby Fortress would continue to provide consulting services and for the continued use of its personnel. As part of our emphasis on cost effectiveness with our resources, we endeavor to structure licenses and product acquisitions for future product opportunities in a capital efficient manner that allows us to minimize indebtedness and compensate partner companies through future profits and commercial benchmarks.

Major Customers
We primarily sell our prescription products to specialty pharmacies, independent wholesalers, and distributors with limited sales through the traditional national wholesaler channels. Our wholesalers and distributors purchase products from us and, in turn, supply products to retail drug store chains, independent pharmacies and managed care organizations. Customers in the managed care market include health maintenance organizations, group purchasing organizations, nursing homes, clinics, pharmacy benefit management companies and mail order customers. 
License & Collaboration Agreements and Acquisitions
We continue to seek to enhance our product line and develop a balanced portfolio of differentiated products through product acquisitions and in-licensing or acquiring rights to products and technologies from third parties. We intend to enter into strategic alliances and collaborative arrangements with third parties, which will give us rights to develop, manufacture, market and/or commercialize pharmaceutical products, the rights to which are primarily owned by these third parties. These alliances and arrangements can take many forms, including licensing arrangements, co-development and co-marketing agreements, co-promotion arrangements, research collaborations and joint ventures. Such alliances and arrangements will potentially enable us to share the risk of incurring all research and development expenses that do not lead to revenue-generating products. However, because profits from alliance products are shared with the counterparties to the collaborative arrangement, the gross margins on alliance products are generally lower, sometimes substantially so, than the gross margins that could be achieved had we not opted for a development partner.
Environmental Matters
Our operations are subject to substantial federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other matters, the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of, and exposure to, hazardous substances. Violation of these laws and regulations, which may change, can lead to substantial fines and penalties. Many of our third-party operations require environmental permits and controls to prevent and limit pollution of the environment. We believe that the facilities of our third-party service providers are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and we do not believe that future compliance will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
Employees and Human Capital Management
Our current headcount is 80 employees and contractors. Of these, we employee a total of 20 employees, of which 20 are full-time employees. These employees and contractors include 65 in sales as well as 13 in marketing, general and administrative positions, and 2 in research and development positions. We currently rely, and may continue to rely, on professional employer organizations and staffing organizations for the employment of our field sales force. Additionally, we have retained a number of expert advisors and consultants that help navigate us through different aspects of our business. We consider our relations with our employees to be good and have not experienced any work stoppages, slowdowns or other serious labor problems that have materially impeded our business operations.

13



Our human capital management objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing, and integrating our new and existing employees. The principal purpose of our equity incentive plan is to attract, retain, and motivate selected employees, consultants, and directors through the granting of share-based compensation awards and cash-based bonus awards.
Additionally, we have access to Fortress employees and consultants, who possess significant expertise in one or more of the following areas: business development, legal, accounting, regulatory affairs, clinical operations and manufacturing.
Geographic Areas
All of our product revenues are generated from operations or otherwise earned within the U.S. We receive royalties for Rapifort® Wipes 2.5% (Qbrexza®), for the treatment of primary axillary hyperhidrosis, from our exclusive licensing partner in Japan, Maruho Co., Ltd. We do not consider royalty revenue to be a material source of our consolidated revenue.
Seasonality of Business
Our business is affected by the standard annual insurance deductible resets, as well as the purchasing patterns and concentration of our customers; however, our business is not materially impacted by seasonality. There are no assurances that these historical trends will continue in the future.
Relationship with Fortress
General
We have an eight-year operating history. We are a majority owned subsidiary of Fortress. Fortress is a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to acquiring, developing and commercializing pharmaceutical and biotechnology products and product candidates at its majority-owned and majority-controlled subsidiaries and joint ventures, and at entities founded by Fortress and in which it maintains significant minority ownership positions. Fortress has a talented and experienced business development team, comprised of scientists, doctors, and finance professionals, who identify, evaluate, and propose for our consideration promising products and product candidates.
Fortress Note
From the Company’s inception in October 2014 until its initial public offering (“IPO”), Fortress funded the Company’s operations through a working capital loan future advance promissory note (the “Fortress Note”). In connection with the closing of our IPO on November 16, 2021, the balance of the Fortress Note reflecting $14.8 million converted into 1,476,044 shares of Journey common stock. The Fortress Note is no longer outstanding.
Product Licensing Agreements and Asset Acquisitions
Rapifort® Wipes 2.5% (Qbrexza)
On February 11, 2022, we announced that our exclusive licensing partner in Japan, Maruho Co., Ltd. (“Maruho”), received marketing and manufacturing approval for Rapifort® Wipes 2.5% (Qbrexza®), for the treatment of primary axillary hyperhidrosis, triggering a net $2.5 million milestone payment to us. The net payment reflects a milestone payment of $10 million to us from our exclusive licensing partner in Maruho, offset by a $7.5 million payment to Dermira, pursuant to the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement between us and Dermira. In conjunction with the terms of the licensing agreement with Maruho, the milestone payment was due from Maruho within 30 days of the approval. We acquired global rights to Qbrexza® from Dermira in 2021.
Amzeeq, Zilxi, FCD105 and the Molecule Stabilizing Technology Platform
On January 12, 2022, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “APA”) with VYNE Therapeutics Inc. (“VYNE”) to acquire VYNE’s Molecule Stabilizing Technology™ franchise (the “Acquisition”) for an upfront payment of $20.0 million, with an additional $5.0 million payment due on the one-year anniversary of the closing of the Acquisition. The APA also provides for contingent net sales milestone payments: in the first calendar year in which annual sales reach each of $100 million, $200 million, $300 million, $400 million and $500 million, we will be required to make a one-time payment of $10 million, $20 million, $30 million, $40 million and $50 million, respectively, in that year only, per product, totaling up to $450.0 million. In addition, Journey will pay VYNE 10% of any upfront 

14



payment received by Journey from a licensee or sublicensee of the products in any territory outside of the United States, subject to exceptions for certain jurisdictions as detailed in the APA. There are no subsequent milestone payments or royalties beyond the aforementioned payments. The Acquisition included two FDA-approved products (Amzeeq and Zilxi), and a development-stage dermatology program (FCD105), along with the Molecule Stabilizing Technology proprietary platform.
DFD-29 Agreement
On June 29, 2021, we entered into a license, collaboration, and assignment agreement with Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories, Ltd. (“DRL”) to obtain the global rights for the development and commercialization of DFD-29, a late-stage development modified release oral minocycline that is being evaluated for the treatment of inflammatory lesions of rosacea (the “DFD-29 Agreement”). We acquired global rights to DFD-29, including in the U.S. and Europe, except that DRL has retained certain rights to the program in select markets including Brazil, Russia, India and China. Pursuant to the DFD-29 Agreement, we agreed to make an upfront payment of $10.0 million, comprised of a $2 million payment upon execution and $8 million which was paid on September 29, 2021, 90 days following execution, with additional contingent regulatory, commercial, and corporate-based milestone payments, totaling up to $158.0 million. Royalties ranging from ten percent to twenty percent are payable on net sales of the product. Royalties are payable in each country until the last-to-expire patent in such country expires. Royalties are subject to a 50% reduction in the event that a generic competitor launches in an applicable country where we market and sell the product. We are responsible for the prosecution and enforcement of patents licensed under the DFD-29 Agreement. The DFD-29 Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, and indemnities, and title transfers to us on the date of achievement of certain regulatory milestones set forth in the agreement, after which our licenses become our acquired assets. Each party may also terminate the DFD-29 Agreement for material breach by the other party or for certain bankruptcy or insolvency related events. Additionally, we agreed to fund and oversee the Phase III clinical trials, approximating $24.0 million, based upon the most recent development plan and budget, which is subject to change.
The DFD-29 Agreement will remain in effect on a country-by-county basis until the expiration of the revenue percentage term in the relevant country, which period begins on the first commercial sale of a product in that country and ends upon the expiration or invalidation date of the last revenue generating patent in such country. The DFD-29 Agreement terminates in its entirety upon the expiry of the revenue percentage term in the last country covered under the DFD-29 Agreement.
Qbrexza Agreement
On March 31, 2021, we executed an asset purchase agreement for Qbrexza® (the “Qbrexza APA”) with Dermira, pursuant to which we acquired global ownership to Qbrexza® (glycopyrronium), a prescription cloth towelette approved to treat primary axillary hyperhidrosis in people nine years of age and older. The transaction closed on May 14, 2021, and pursuant to the Qbrexza APA, we made an upfront $12.5 million cash payment to Dermira. We are obligated to make payments to Dermira of up to $144 million in the aggregate upon the achievement of certain milestones. For the first two years, we are required to pay royalties on sales ranging from the mid-thirty to the mid-twenty percent and, thereafter royalties ranging from the lower teen digits to the upper teen digits are payable on net sales of Qbrexza products. Subject to certain reductions, royalties are payable for a period of eight years. The agreement contains customary representations, warranties, and indemnities. Each party may also terminate the Qbrexza APA for material breach by the other party or for certain bankruptcy or insolvency related events.
As part of the Qbrexza APA, we were assigned an exclusive license agreement with Rose University (“Rose U”) pursuant to which we obtained a worldwide exclusive license within a field of use including hyperhidrosis to practice, enforce and otherwise exploit certain patent rights, know-how and data related to Qbrexza. The license agreement with Rose U included a sublicense of certain data and an assignment of certain regulatory filings which Rose U had obtained from Stiefel Laboratories (“Stiefel”). In connection with the license agreement, we assumed Rose U’s obligations to Stiefel to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize products using the licensed patent rights, know-how and data.
Pursuant to these agreements with Rose U and the related agreement with Stiefel with respect to Qbrexza, we are obligated to pay Rose U low-to-mid single-digit royalties on net product sales and low double-digit royalties on sublicense fees and certain milestone, royalty and other contingent payments received from sublicensees, to the extent such amounts are in excess of the milestone and royalty payments we are obligated to pay Rose U directly upon the events or sales triggering such payments.
We are permitted to grant sublicenses to the licensed rights and may assign the agreements upon our acquisition or that of our assets that relate to the license agreement. We may terminate the license agreement if Rose U experiences certain insolvency events or if Rose U commits a material breach of the license agreement, subject to applicable cure provisions. Rose U may terminate the license in certain 

15



circumstances if we experience certain insolvency events or if we commit a material breach of the license agreement or if we cause Rose U to be in material breach of its license agreement with Stiefel, subject in each case to applicable cure provisions. Subject to earlier termination, the license agreement remains in effect until 15 years following the first commercial sale of a licensed product have elapsed or, if later, the date that the last patent or patent application in the licensed patent rights has expired or been revoked, invalidated or abandoned. As of December 31, 2022, the last-to-expire issued patent relating to Qbrexza that we license under the license agreement with Rose U expires in 2029.
Accutane Agreement
On July 29, 2020, we entered into a license and supply agreement for Accutane® (“Accutane Agreement”) with DRL. Pursuant to the Accutane Agreement, we agreed to pay $5.0 million, comprised of an upfront payment of $1.0 million paid upon execution, with additional milestone payments totaling $4.0 million. To date, we have paid $3.0 million of the additional milestone payments. Three additional milestone payments totaling $17.0 million are contingent upon the achievement of certain net sales milestones. Royalties in the low-double digits based on net sales, subject to specified reductions are also due. 
The term of the Accutane Agreement is ten years and renewable upon mutual agreement. We are required to pay royalties during the term of the Accutane Agreement. The agreement contains customary representations, warranties, and indemnities. Each party may also terminate the Accutane Agreement for material breach by the other party or for certain bankruptcy or insolvency related events and we may terminate for upon 180 days written notice to the other party. We commenced sales of this product in April 2021.
Anti-Itch Product Agreement
On December 18, 2020, we entered an asset purchase agreement for our Anti-itch Product (the “Anti-itch APA”) with Sun Pharmaceutical Industries, Inc. (“Sun”). Pursuant to the Anti-itch APA, total consideration is $4.0 million, comprised of an upfront payment of $2.0 million, payable upon execution. Through December 31, 2022, we have paid $4.0 million and have no additional payments. The Anti-itch APA contains customary representations, warranties, and indemnities. There are no subsequent milestone payments or royalties beyond the aforementioned payments. We intend to launch this product during the second half of 2023.
Ximino Agreement
On July 22, 2019, we entered into an asset purchase agreement for Ximino® (the “Ximino APA”) with Sun. Pursuant to the Ximino APA, total consideration is $9.4 million, with an upfront payment of $2.4 million, which was payable within 60 days after execution on September 22, 2019.
The remaining $7.0 million will be made starting on the second anniversary and for the next four anniversaries of the Ximino APA thereafter. In addition, we are obligated to pay royalties in the mid-single digits based on net sales of Ximino, subject to specified reductions until the end of 2022. The Ximino APA contains customary representations, warranties, and indemnities. Each party may also terminate the Ximino APA for material breach by the other party or for certain bankruptcy or insolvency related events. No additional licensing or milestone payments are required. We commenced sales of this product in August 2019.
Exelderm Agreement
On August 31, 2018, we entered into an asset purchase agreement for Exelderm® (the “Exelderm APA”) with Sun. Pursuant to the Exelderm APA, total consideration is $1.6 million, comprised of an upfront payment of $1.2 million, which was payable within 60 days after execution on October 31, 2018. The remaining milestone payment was contingent upon net sales reaching a certain threshold, at which point a $0.4 million payment became due. This threshold was achieved in 2020 and paid in early 2021. We are obligated to pay royalties in the low-double digits based on net sales of Exelderm until the end of 2023, and no additional licensing or milestone payments are required. We commenced sales of this product in August 2018.
Targadox Agreement
On March 10, 2015, we entered into a license and supply agreement (as amended) for Targadox® (the “Targadox Agreement”) with PuraCap International LLC n/k/a Caribe Holdings, Inc. (“Caribe”). We made an upfront payment of $1.3 million. Further payments will be made based on a revenue sharing arrangement and no additional licensing or milestone payments are required. The term of the Targadox Agreement is ten years and automatically renews for three-year periods unless either party provides notice of its intent not to 

16



renew at least 180 days prior to the expiration of the applicable term. Under our revenue sharing arrangement, we are entitled to retain a majority of the net profits and pay Caribe a portion of the net profits after deducting certain commercial, marketing and sales expenses during the term of the Targadox Agreement. The Targadox Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, and indemnities. Each party may also terminate the Targadox Agreement for material breach by the other party or for certain bankruptcy or insolvency related events. We commenced sales of this product in October 2016.
Research and Development
As discussed above, on June 29, 2021, we obtained the global rights for the development and commercialization of DFD-29, a late-stage development modified release oral minocycline that is being evaluated for the treatment of inflammatory lesions of rosacea. Through this collaboration, the parties will work together to complete the development of DFD-29, which includes conducting two Phase III studies to assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability of oral DFD-29 for the treatment of rosacea and the regulatory submission of a new drug application (“NDA”) under Section 505(b)(2) of the United States Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”). DRL will provide development support, including the monitoring of two Phase III clinical trials. 
On March 17, 2022, we dosed the first patient in our Phase 3 clinical trials evaluating DFD-29 (Minocycline Modified Release Capsules 40 mg) for the Treatment of Rosacea. As of January 10, 2023, we achieved 100 % enrollment in the trials, with a top-line data readout expected in the second quarter of 2023. We plan to submit the NDA for DFD-29 in the second half of 2023 and FDA approval is anticipated in the second half of 2024. In the Phase 2 clinical trials, DFD-29 (40mg) demonstrated nearly double the efficacy when compared against Oraycea® (European equivalent of Oracea®) on both co-primary endpoints. For the first co-primary endpoint, IGA treatment success, Oraycea only had a 33.33% IGA treatment success rate, while DFD-29 achieved a 66.04% IGA treatment success rate. For the second co-primary endpoint, the change in total inflammatory lesion count, Oraycea only had a 10.5 reduction in inflammatory lesions, while DFD-29 achieved a 19.2 reduction in inflammatory lesions.
The Phase II study, conducted in Germany, was a multi-center, randomized, double-blinded, parallel group, controlled study that assessed the efficacy, safety and tolerability of oral DFD-29 (20mg and 40mg) extended release minocycline hydrochloride capsules for the treatment of inflammatory lesions of rosacea over 16 weeks. Initial patient enrollment in the Phase II study included 205 male and female subjects with papulopustular rosacea. 160 subjects completed the study. Each subject was allocated to one of the following treatment groups, and received one capsule once daily, in the morning, for 16 weeks: i) DFD-29 40 mg extended release capsules (with 47 subjects at completion); ii) DFD-29 20mg extended release capsules (with 38 subjects at completion); iii) Oraycea® (doxycycline) capsules (with 40 subjects at completion); and iv) placebo capsules (with 35 subjects at completion). The study showed that DFD-29 40mg had statistical significance to both placebo and the active control, Oraycea® (German equivalent of U.S. marketed Oracea®), on both co-primary endpoints - proportion of subjects with IGA treatment success (grade 0 or 1 with at least a two grade reduction from baseline at week 16 and total inflammatory lesion count reduction from baseline to week 16. More information on the DFD-29 Phase II study can be found at clinicaltrials.gov. Highly statistically significant difference in IGA success could be shown for DFD-29 40mg compared to placebo (p < 0.0001) as well as compared to Oraycea (p= 0.0010). Highly statistically significant treatment difference was also observed in the co-primary endpoint mean change in total inflammatory lesion count as well in both DFD-29 40mg compared to placebo (p < 0.0001) and DFD-29 40mg compared to Oraycea (p = 0.0004). All statistical tests used were two-sided, with α=0.05 as level of significance. There were no related serious adverse events reported during the study for those subjects who were studied with DFD-29 40mg.
Intellectual Property
General
We rely on a combination of contractual provisions, confidentiality policies and procedures and patent, trademark, copyright and trade secrecy laws to protect the proprietary aspects of our technology and business. Three of our marketed products, Accutane, Targadox, and Exelderm, do not have patent protection and/or otherwise not eligible for patent protection. As part of our development and acquisition strategy, we place a strong emphasis on the patent protection for potential products.
Four of our marketed products, Qbrexza, Amzeeq, Zilxi, and Ximino, as well as DFD-29, currently have patent protection.

The two issued U.S. patents will expire in 2039.

18



Ximino Patents
We have an exclusive license to patents related to Ximino, including 6 issued U.S. patents. These patents cover the Ximino, methods of treatment, and related dosage forms and strengths, and will expire between 2025 and 2027.
Additional Intellectual Property and Proprietary Right Protection
We also use other forms of protection, such as trademark, copyright, and trade secret protection, to protect our intellectual property, particularly where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable. We aim to take advantage of all of the intellectual property rights that are available to us and believe that this comprehensive approach will provide us with proprietary positions for our product candidates, where available. Patents extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in various countries where patent protection is obtained. The actual protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from country to country, depends on the type of patent, the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in the country.
Our goal is to obtain, maintain and enforce patent protection for our products, formulations, processes, methods and other proprietary technologies, to preserve our trade secrets, and to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of other parties, both in the United States and in other countries. Our policy is to actively seek to obtain, where appropriate, the broadest intellectual property protection possible for any product candidates, proprietary information and proprietary technology through a combination of contractual arrangements and patents, both in the U.S. and elsewhere in the world.
Patents and other proprietary rights are crucial to the development of our business. We will be able to protect our proprietary technologies from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that our proprietary rights are covered by valid and enforceable patents, supported by regulatory exclusivity, or are effectively maintained as trade secrets.
Generally, patent applications in the U.S. are maintained in secrecy for a period of 18 months or more. The patent positions of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies are highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. Therefore, we cannot predict the breadth of claims allowed in biotechnology and pharmaceutical patents, or their enforceability. To date, there has been no consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims allowed in biotechnology patents. Third parties or competitors may challenge or circumvent our patents or patent applications, if issued. If our competitors prepare and file patent applications in the U.S. that claim technology also claimed by us, we may have to participate in derivation proceedings declared by the USPTO to determine proper inventorship of a claimed of invention, which could result in substantial cost, even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us. Because of the extensive time required for development, testing and regulatory review of a potential product, it is possible that before we commercialize any of our products, any related patent may expire or remain in existence for only a short period following commercialization, thus reducing any advantage of the patent. However, the life of a patent covering a product that has been subject to regulatory approval may be extended through the patent term restoration program, although any such extension could still be minimal.
If a patent is issued to a third party containing one or more preclusive or conflicting claims, and those claims are ultimately determined to be valid and enforceable, we may be required to obtain a license under such patent or to develop or obtain alternative technology, neither of which may be possible. In the event of litigation involving a third-party claim, an adverse outcome in the litigation could subject us to significant liabilities to such third party, require us to seek a license under the disputed rights of such third party, and/or require us to cease use of the technology. Moreover, our breach of an existing license or failure to obtain a license to technology required to commercialize our products may seriously harm our business. We also may need to commence litigation to enforce any patents issued to us or to determine the scope and validity of third-party proprietary rights. Litigation would involve substantial costs.
Other Intellectual Property Rights
We depend upon trademarks, trade secrets, and continuing technological advances to develop and maintain our competitive position. We also depend upon the skills, knowledge and experience of our scientific and technical personnel, as well as that of our advisors, consultants and other contractors. This knowledge and experience we call “know-how.” To help protect our proprietary know-how that is not patentable, and for inventions for which patents may be difficult to enforce, we rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect our interests. To this end, we require all employees, scientific advisors, consultants, collaborators and other contractors, upon commencement of a relationship with us, to enter into confidentiality agreements, which prohibit the disclosure of confidential information and, in the case of parties other than our research and development collaborators, require disclosure and assignment to us of the ideas, developments, discoveries and inventions important to our business. These agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed in connection with their relationship 

19



with us. These agreements may not, however, provide protection for our trade secrets in the event of unauthorized disclosure of such information.
There can be no assurance that any of our patents, licenses or other intellectual property rights will afford us any protection from competition or that our confidentiality agreements will not be breached, that we will have adequate remedies for any breach, that others will not independently develop equivalent proprietary information or that other third parties will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets and other intellectual property.
We may find it necessary to initiate litigation to enforce our patent rights, to protect our intellectual property or trade secrets or to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others. Litigation is costly and time-consuming and there can be no assurance that our litigation expenses will not be significant in the future or that we will prevail in any such litigation.
Competition
Pharmaceutical Industry
Our competitors include pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies, as well as universities and public and private research institutions. In addition, companies that are active in different but related fields represent substantial competition for us. Many of our competitors have significantly greater capital resources, larger research and development staffs and facilities and greater experience in drug development, regulation, manufacturing and marketing than we do. These organizations also compete with us to recruit qualified personnel, attract partners for joint ventures or other collaborations, and license technologies that are competitive with ours. To compete successfully in this industry, we must identify novel and unique drugs or methods of treatment and then complete the development of those drugs as treatments in advance of our competitors.
Dermatology Sector
The dermatology competitive landscape is highly fragmented, with a large number of midsize and smaller companies competing in both the prescription sector and the OTC sector. Our competitors are pursuing the development and/or acquisition of pharmaceuticals, medical devices and OTC products that target the same diseases and conditions that we are targeting in dermatology. Competitive factors vary by product line and geographic area in which our products are sold. The principal methods of competition for our products include quality, efficacy, market acceptance, price, and marketing and promotional efforts.
Branded products often must compete with therapeutically similar branded or generic products or with generic equivalents. Such competition frequently increases over time. For example, if competitors introduce new products, delivery systems or processes with therapeutic or cost advantages, our products could be subject to progressive price reductions and/or decreased volume of sales. To successfully compete for business, we must often demonstrate that our products offer not only medical benefits, but also cost advantages as compared with other forms of care. Accordingly, we face pressure to continually seek out technological innovations and to market our products effectively.
Our major competitors, including Galderma Laboratories, Almirall, Verrica Pharmaceuticals, MC2 Therapeutics, Novan Therapeutics, Sun Pharma, Leo Pharma, Arcutis Biotherapeutics, Mayne Pharma, Dermavant Sciences, Botanix Pharmaceuticals, and Ortho Dermatologics, among others, vary depending on therapeutic and product category, dosage strength and drug-delivery systems, among other factors.
Generic Competition
We face increased competition from manufacturers of generic pharmaceutical products, who may submit applications to the FDA seeking to market generic versions of our products. In connection with these applications, the generic drug companies may seek to challenge the validity and enforceability of our patents through litigation. When patents covering certain of our products (if applicable) expire or are successfully challenged through litigation or in USPTO proceedings, if a generic company launches a competing product “at risk,” or when the regulatory or licensed exclusivity for our products (if applicable) expires or is otherwise lost, we may face generic competition as a result. Generic versions are generally significantly less expensive than branded versions, and, where available, may be required to be utilized before or in preference to the branded version under third-party reimbursement programs, or substituted by pharmacies. Accordingly, when a branded product loses its market exclusivity, it normally faces intense price competition from generic forms of the product. To successfully compete for business with managed care and pharmacy benefits management organizations, we 

20



must often demonstrate that our products offer not only medical benefits, but also cost advantages as compared with other forms of care. Generic products generally face intense competition from other generic equivalents (including authorized generics) and therapeutically similar branded or generic products.
Supply and Manufacturing
We have limited experience in manufacturing products for clinical or commercial purposes, and we currently do not have any internal manufacturing capabilities. We currently rely upon multiple contract manufacturers to produce our products and clinical supply of product candidates and will continue to rely upon contract manufacturers for any current or future product candidates under current Good Manufacturing Practice (“cGMP”) regulations for use in pre-clinical and clinical activities. Due to the risks associated with reliance on third-party manufacturing risk, as part of our current and future strategy of licensing, acquiring, or the future development of assets, we currently, and will continue to, secure manufacturing agreements with either a counterparty to a transaction, with one or more of our contract manufacturers or additional contract manufacturers. As with any supply program, obtaining raw materials of the correct quality cannot be guaranteed, and we cannot ensure that we will be successful. Our third-party manufacturers have a limited number of facilities in which our product candidates can be produced and may have limited experience in manufacturing our product candidates in quantities sufficient for commercialization. Our third-party manufacturers will have other clients and may have other priorities that could affect their ability to perform the work satisfactorily and/or on a timely basis. Both of these occurrences would be beyond our control. We expect to similarly rely on contract manufacturing relationships for any products that we may in-license or acquire in the future. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully contract with such manufacturers on terms acceptable to us, or at all.
Contract manufacturers are subject to ongoing periodic and unannounced inspections by the FDA, the Drug Enforcement Administration and corresponding state and European agencies to ensure strict compliance with cGMPs and other state and federal regulations. We do not have control over third-party manufacturers’ compliance with these regulations and standards, other than through contractual obligations. If they are deemed out of compliance with cGMPs, product recalls could result, inventory could be destroyed, production could be stopped, and supplies could be delayed or otherwise disrupted.
If we need to change manufacturers during the clinical or development stage for product candidates or after commercialization for our approved products, the FDA and corresponding foreign regulatory agencies must approve these new manufacturers in advance, which will involve testing and additional inspections to ensure compliance with FDA regulations and standards and may require significant lead times and delay. Furthermore, switching manufacturers may be difficult because the number of potential manufacturers is limited. It may be difficult or impossible for us to find a replacement manufacturer quickly or on terms acceptable to us, or at all.
Government and Industry Regulations - Overview 
FDA Regulations
Numerous governmental authorities, principally the FDA and corresponding state and foreign regulatory agencies, impose substantial regulations upon any potential clinical development and the manufacture and marketing of our products. Before marketing in the U.S., any drug that we may develop must undergo rigorous pre-clinical testing and clinical trials and an extensive regulatory approval process implemented by the FDA under the FDCA. The FDA regulates, among other things, the pre-clinical and clinical testing, safety, efficacy, approval, manufacturing, record keeping, lot traceability, individual serialization, adverse event reporting, packaging, labeling, storage, advertising, promotion, export, sale and distribution of biopharmaceutical products.
The regulatory review and approval process is lengthy, expensive and uncertain. In the event that we acquire or develop a clinical stage asset, we will be required to submit extensive pre-clinical and clinical data and supporting information to the FDA for each indication or use to establish a product candidate’s safety and efficacy before we can secure FDA approval to market or sell a product in the U.S. The approval process may take many years, depending on the stage of development of a target asset, and requires the expenditure of substantial resources and may involve ongoing requirements for post-marketing studies or surveillance.
Clinical testing must meet requirements for institutional review board oversight, informed consent and good clinical practices, and must be conducted pursuant to an Investigational New Drug (“IND”) Application unless exempted.

21



For purposes of NDA approval, clinical trials are typically conducted in the following sequential phases:
Phase 1:
➢The drug is administered to a small group of humans, either healthy volunteers or patients, to test for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, excretion and clinical pharmacology.
Phase 2:
➢Studies are conducted on a larger number of patients to assess the efficacy of the product, to ascertain dose tolerance and the optimal dose range, and to gather additional data relating to safety and potential adverse events.
Phase 3:
➢Studies establish safety and efficacy in an expanded patient population.
Phase 4:
➢The FDA may require Phase 4 post-marketing studies to find out more about the drug’s long-term risks, benefits, and optimal use, or to test the drug in different populations.
The length of time necessary to complete clinical trials varies significantly and may be difficult to predict. Clinical results are frequently susceptible to varying interpretations that may delay, limit or prevent regulatory approvals. Additional factors that can cause delay or termination in future clinical trials, or that may increase the costs of these trials, include:

● | slow patient enrollment due to the nature of the clinical trial plan, the proximity of patients to clinical sites, the eligibility criteria for participation in the study or other factors;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | inadequately trained or insufficient personnel at the study site to assist in overseeing and monitoring clinical trials or delays in approvals from a study site’s review board;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | longer treatment time required to demonstrate efficacy or determine the appropriate product dose;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | insufficient supply of the drug candidates;
--+--------------------------------------------


● | adverse medical events or side effects in treated patients; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


● | ineffectiveness of the drug candidates.
--+----------------------------------------

In addition, the FDA, equivalent foreign regulatory authority, or a data safety monitoring committee for a trial may place a clinical trial on hold or terminate it if it concludes that subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk, or for futility. Any drug is likely to produce some toxicity or undesirable side effects in animals and in humans when administered at sufficiently high doses and/or for a sufficiently long period of time. Unacceptable toxicity or side effects may occur at any dose level at any time in the course of studies in animals designed to identify unacceptable effects of a drug candidate, known as toxicological studies, or clinical trials of drug candidates. The appearance of any unacceptable toxicity or side effect could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt, limit, delay or abort the development of any of our drug candidates and could ultimately prevent approval by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities for any or all targeted indications.
Sponsors of drugs may apply for a special protocol assessment (“SPA”) from the FDA. The SPA process is a procedure by which the FDA provides official evaluation and written guidance on the design and size of proposed protocols that are intended to form the basis for an NDA. However, final marketing approval depends on the results of efficacy, the adverse event profile and an evaluation of the benefit/risk of treatment demonstrated in the Phase 3 trial. The SPA agreement may only be changed through a written agreement between the sponsor and the FDA, or if the FDA becomes aware of a substantial scientific issue essential to product safety or efficacy. 

22



Before receiving FDA approval to market a product, we must demonstrate that the product is safe and effective for its intended use by submitting to the FDA an NDA, Abbreviated NDA (“ANDA”), 510(K) or Biologics License Application (“BLA”) containing the pre-clinical and clinical data that have been accumulated, together with chemistry and manufacturing and controls specifications and information, and proposed labeling, among other things. The FDA may refuse to accept an NDA, ANDA, 510(K) or BLA for filing if certain content criteria are not met and, even after accepting an NDA, ANDA, 510(K) or BLA, the FDA may often require additional information, including clinical data, before approval of marketing a product.
It is also becoming more common for the FDA to request a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (“REMS”), as part of an NDA, ANDA, 510(K) or BLA. The REMS plan contains post-market obligations of the sponsor to train prescribing physicians, monitor off-label drug use, and conduct sufficient Phase 4 follow-up studies and registries to ensure the continued safe use of the drug.
As part of the approval process, the FDA must inspect and approve each manufacturing facility. Among the conditions of approval is the requirement that a manufacturer’s quality control and manufacturing procedures conform to cGMP. Manufacturers must expend significant time, money and effort to ensure continued compliance, and the FDA conducts periodic inspections to certify compliance. It may be difficult for our manufacturers or us to comply with the applicable cGMPs, as interpreted by the FDA, and other FDA regulatory requirements. If we, or our contract manufacturers, fail to comply, then the FDA may not allow us to market products that have been affected by the failure.
If the FDA grants approval, the approval will be limited to those conditions and patient populations for which the product is safe and effective, as demonstrated through clinical studies. Further, a product may be marketed only in those dosage forms and for those indications approved in the NDA, ANDA, 510(K), or BLA. Certain changes to an approved BLA, including, with certain exceptions, any significant changes to labeling, require approval of a supplemental application before the drug may be marketed as changed. Any products that we manufacture or distribute pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuing monitoring and regulation by the FDA, including compliance with cGMP and the reporting of adverse experiences with the drugs. The nature of marketing claims that the FDA will permit us to make in the labeling and advertising of our products will generally be limited to those specified in FDA approved labeling, and the advertising of our products will be subject to comprehensive monitoring and regulation by the FDA. Drugs whose review was accelerated may carry additional restrictions on marketing activities, including the requirement that all promotional materials are pre-submitted to the FDA. Claims exceeding those contained in approved labeling will constitute a violation of the FDCA. Violations of the FDCA or regulatory requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process, or marketing and sale following approval may result in agency enforcement actions, including withdrawal of approval, recall, seizure of products, warning letters, injunctions, fines and/or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on our business.
Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
Sales of any pharmaceutical product depend, in part, on the extent to which such product will be covered by third-party payors, such as federal, state, and foreign government healthcare programs, commercial insurance, and managed healthcare organizations, and the level of reimbursement for such product by third-party payors. Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any newly approved product. Decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided are made on a plan-by-plan basis. One third-party payor’s decision to cover a particular product does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the product. As a result, the coverage determination process can require manufacturers to provide scientific details, information on cost-effectiveness, and clinical support for the use of a product to each payor separately. This can be a time-consuming process, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be applied consistently or obtained in the first instance.
In addition, third-party payors are increasingly reducing reimbursements for pharmaceutical products and related services. The U.S. government and state legislatures have continued implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on coverage and reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost effectiveness of pharmaceutical products, in addition to questioning their safety and efficacy. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit sales of any product. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for any product or a decision by a third-party payor not to cover a product could reduce physician usage and patient demand for the product.
At the state level, there are also new laws and ongoing ballot initiatives that create additional pressure on drug pricing and may affect how pharmaceutical products are covered and reimbursed. A number of states have adopted or are considering various pricing actions, 

23



such as those requiring pharmaceutical manufacturers to publicly report proprietary pricing information, limit price increases or to place a maximum price ceiling or cap on certain products. Existing and proposed state pricing laws have added complexity to the pricing of pharmaceutical drug products.
In international markets, reimbursement and healthcare payment systems vary significantly by country, and many countries have instituted price ceilings on specific products and therapies. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. Pharmaceutical products may face competition from lower-priced products in foreign countries that have placed price controls on pharmaceutical products and may also compete with imported foreign products. Furthermore, there is no assurance that a product will be considered medically reasonable and necessary for a specific indication, that it will be considered cost-effective by third-party payors, that an adequate level of reimbursement will be established even if coverage is available, or that the third-party payors’ reimbursement policies will not adversely affect the ability for manufacturers to sell products profitably.
International Regulations
In addition to regulations in the United States, there are a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of any product candidates. The approval process varies from country to country, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval.
Failure to comply with applicable federal, state and foreign laws and regulations would likely have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, federal, state and foreign laws and regulations regarding the manufacture and sale of new drugs are subject to future changes.
PHRMA Code and April 3, 2003 Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General, OIG Compliance Program for Pharmaceutical Manufacturers
We have established and implemented a corporate compliance program designed to prevent, detect and correct violations of state and federal healthcare laws, including laws related to advertising and promotion of our products that are in compliance with the PHRMA Code and the Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General (“OIG”) Compliance Program requirements for Pharmaceutical Manufacturers.
Healthcare Fraud, Waste and Abuse
We are subject to various federal, state and local laws targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry, violations of which can lead to civil and criminal penalties, including fines, imprisonment and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs.
These laws are potentially applicable to us as both a manufacturer and a supplier of products reimbursed by federal healthcare programs, and they also apply to physicians and other potential purchasers of our products.
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute (42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7b) prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, recommending or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Remuneration is not defined in the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including for example, gifts, discounts, coupons, the furnishing of supplies or equipment, credit arrangements, payments of cash, waivers of payments, ownership interests and providing anything at less than its fair market value. Under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the applicable criminal healthcare fraud statutes contained within 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7b, a person or entity need not have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the government may assert that a claim, including items or services resulting from a violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7b, constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act (discussed below) or the civil monetary penalties statute, which imposes fines against any person who is determined to have presented or caused to be presented claims to a federal healthcare program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute and implementing regulations provide for certain exceptions for “safe harbors” for certain discounting, rebating or personal services arrangements, among other things. However, the lack of uniform court interpretation of the Anti-Kickback Statute, coupled with novel 

24



enforcement theories by government authorities, make compliance with the law difficult. Violations of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute can result in significant criminal fines, exclusion from participation in Medicare and Medicaid and follow-on civil litigation, among other things, for both entities and individuals.
In October 2019, the OIG issued a proposed rule to, among other things, add new safe harbors for certain value-based arrangements. Although the value-based proposals would not include pharmaceutical manufacturers among the entities that could permissibly enter into such contracting arrangements, the general trend toward outcomes and value-based contracts in the healthcare industry may continue. It is possible that payors, among other customers, could push manufacturers for novel contracting approaches, including those that would incorporate value-based principles, and these efforts could affect our business.
The civil False Claims Act and similar state laws impose liability on any person or entity who, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment by a federal healthcare program. The qui tam provisions of the False Claims Act and similar state laws allow a private individual to bring civil actions on behalf of the federal or state government and to share in any monetary recovery. The Federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act and similar state laws impose reporting requirements for various types of payments to physicians and teaching hospitals. Failure to comply with reporting requirements under these laws could subject manufacturers and others to substantial civil money penalties.
Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
In the United States, our activities are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (formerly the Health Care Financing Administration), other divisions of the United States Department of Health and Human Services, the United States Department of Justice and individual United States Attorney offices within the Department of Justice, and state and local governments.
Drug Quality and Security Act (“DQSA”)
DQSA was enacted by Congress on November 27, 2013. Title II of DQSA, the Drug Supply Chain Security Act (“DSCSA”), outlines steps to build an electronic, interoperable system to identify and trace certain prescription drugs as they are distributed in the United States. This is intended to enhance the FDA’s ability to help protect consumers from exposure to drugs that may be counterfeit, stolen, contaminated, or otherwise harmful. The system is also intended to improve detection and removal of potentially dangerous drugs from the drug supply chain to protect U.S. consumers.
Additionally, the DSCSA directs FDA to establish national licensure standards for wholesale distributors and third-party logistics providers, and requires these entities report licensure and other information to FDA annually. The implementation and enforcement of complete unit level traceability of verifiable return serialization, including aggregation throughout the whole supply chain, is not required until November 27, 2023.
We are subject to, and required to be in compliance with, the DQSA. Our Company remains in compliance with the requirements promogulated by the DSCSA and intends on remaining vigilant with regards to any potential modifications to the act. For purposes of our business, we are considered both manufacturers and re-packagers under the act. Currently, we are in compliance with the DSCSA as it relates to our business and operations.
DSCSA: Recent FDA Announcement Regarding Certain Wholesale Distributor and Dispenser Verification Requirements Under DSCSA.
On October 22, 2020, the FDA announced a final guidance regarding enforcement of the DSCSA requirements for wholesale distributor verification of saleable returned products and dispenser verification of the product identifier for suspect and illegitimate product.

● | FDA does not intend to take action against wholesale distributors who do not, prior to November 27, 2023, verify a product identifier prior to further distributing returned product as required under the DSCSA. This provides wholesale distributors three additional years to comply with this requirement.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | FDA also does not intend to take action against dispensers who do not, prior to November 27, 2023, verify the product identifier for suspect or illegitimate product in the dispenser’s possession or control. This provides dispensers three additional years to comply with this requirement.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

25



Although the rule regarding wholesale distributor verification of saleable returned products does not directly apply to our Company, we will be required to assist our wholesale distributor customers by setting in place mechanics that would allow for traceability of returns in the supply chain. If we are not able to come into compliance of this rule, our wholesale distributor customers may not accept our returns on our behalf.
