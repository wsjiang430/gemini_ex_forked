ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

Overview
 
We utilize an asset light business model to lease entire hotels on a long-term basis and rent out hotel rooms in the properties we lease. We currently manage a portfolio of hotel rooms in New York, Washington D.C., Miami Beach, New Orleans and Los Angeles. With recent hotel rooms becoming available, as of the date of this filing, we have approximately 1,200 hotel rooms available for rent. We believe the pandemic created, and current economic conditions present, a historic opportunity for us to lease dislocated and underutilized hotels at favorable economics for our company.
 
In late 2021, we commenced the process of winding down our legacy business of leasing and re-leasing multifamily residential units, as we pivoted toward our new strategy of leasing hotels. Our transition has been substantially completed, although we continue to lease a total of approximately 9 multifamily residential units in Denver that we are in the process of exiting.
 
We have plans to expand both domestically and internationally. At this time London is the next city targeted for expansion.
 
We strive to improve operational efficiencies by leveraging proprietary technology to identify, lease, manage, and market globally the hotel space we lease to business and vacation travelers through our online portal and third-party sales and distribution channels. Our top ten sales channels represented over 90% of revenue during the year ended December 31, 2022.
 
General
 
We are building a portfolio of hotels that provide short-term accommodations for guests at average nightly and occupancy rates that exceed our total cost and expenses. We are growing this portfolio by capitalizing on the dislocation in the hotel industry created by the pandemic and subsequent rising interest rate environment. We target business and vacation travelers under our consumer brand LuxUrban and we market our hotel properties through our proprietary sales portal as well as several worldwide online travel agency (“OTA”) channels.
 
We believe that as a result of pandemic-induced hotel closures, changing financial requirements for hotel owners, as well as a significantly higher interest rate and refinancing environment, LuxUrban has a multi-year pipeline of potential properties to lease at favorable economics to our Company.
 
Many of the hotels that we lease have been hotels that were shuttered or underutilized as a result of the global pandemic. Other properties that we lease were either poorly managed properties where the landlord was looking for a more stable tenant, or a refinancing opportunity where LuxUrban provided a landlord a more desirable lender-friendly, long-term lease agreement.
 
Based on the market dislocation mentioned above, we believe our pipeline of high-quality opportunities will provide multiple leasing opportunities in upcoming years. Currently, we are focused on turnkey properties that require limited amounts of incremental capital to make the property guest-ready. We expect over time that we may need to invest additional capital as the best opportunities in our pipeline become leased. Even if we need to increase the capital we invest to make ready a property, we believe there are many attractive opportunities for properties where the economics will still be favorable based on the above mentioned market dislocation. In addition, we may be able to obtain greater concessions from landlords as a result of the capital required.
 
Property Summary
 
We enter into triple net leases in which we are responsible for all of the costs on the property outside of exterior structural maintenance. As of December 31, 2022, we leased 10 properties with 839 units available for rent. Our portfolio of properties as of December 31, 2022, was as follows:

Due to the triple net structure of our leases, we are typically responsible for the interior maintenance of our properties, and the landlord is responsible for the exterior maintenance and roof. When we enter into new property leases, we target leases of 10 to 15 years with 5-to-10-year extension options. We try to keep annual escalations of between 2 to 3% fixed and none of our leases at December 31, 2022 are tied to inflation or CPI.

Our Business Strategy
 
When we lease properties, we typically do so with either a refundable security deposit, refundable letter of credit or both. In most cases we get a period of “free rent” in which we make ready the property. Make ready could include but is not limited to: minor repairs or property updates, hiring appropriate property level staff, getting utilities / Wi-Fi / cable installed, or listing the property on the OTA channels we utilize.
 
We lease entire properties, which could include food service, gyms, or store fronts. We do and plan to in most cases, sublease the food service or store fronts to generate additional income. We believe these items are non-core to our operations.
 
Our average deposits / letter of credit by city as of December 31, 2022, were as follows:
 

Location | Miami Beach | | New York | | | NOLA | | DC | Total | 
-------------+-------------+-----------+----------+---+-----------+------+---+---------+-------+--------
Units | | 182 | | | 502 | | | 60 | | 95 | | 839 
Deposit / LC | $ | 1,635,000 | | $ | 8,000,000 | | $ | 300,000 | $ | 850,000 | $ | 10,785,000
Per Unit | $ | 8,984 | | $ | 15,936 | | $ | 5,000 | $ | 8,947 | $ | 12,855 

Revenue Management
 
We use our proprietary data science and algorithms to manage revenue and create dynamic pricing for our accommodation units. Pricing changes can occur multiple times a day based on revenue momentum or lack thereof. We utilize our technology to both maximize occupancy rates through attractive pricing and increase cash flow in advance of potential guest stays. We initially developed and further improved our revenue management algorithms in our legacy apartment rental business and have now applied it to our hotel operations.
Property Operations
 
When we lease a new property, we typically streamline operations versus how its operations were managed by the prior operator that includes, but is not limited to:

● | Reduction of staffing. Over time and as a result of technology changes, legacy properties we lease typically have staffing at levels higher than we typically operate our properties. In addition, we eliminate staffing for areas we do not plan to operate or operate initially, including restaurants, bars, and workout facilities.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Hiring quality general manager (or GM). We believe that our operational success is partially related to empowered on the ground employees to make decisions and solve guest concerns. This begins with a quality and experienced GM with a background in hospitality.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Continual cost benefit analysis. Our lead operational staff have been trained to continuously calculate cost benefit in our operations. Specifically, we are constantly reviewing the return on requested investment capital and the related payback. We do this both at the corporate level as well as the operational level. For example, during lower periods of occupancy we may delay certain maintenance items as during these periods we can remove these units from inventory for a more prolonged period without experiencing any impact to revenues.

Unit Economics
 
We believe we have one of the lowest per night property-level break-even costs in our markets as a result of leasing our properties at a generational low point. We estimate that the property-level break-even rate for revenue per available room (or RevPAR) for our portfolio as of December 31, 2022, was between $135 to $145 a night. We believe RevPAR provides an informative reflection of our business as it combines ADRs (average daily rates) along with occupancy rates. RevPAR for the full year 2022 was $247, well above the property-level break-even level.
 
The following table shows historical occupancy and RevPAR at our leased properties:
 

Year | Occupancy | | | RevPAR | 
-----+-----------+----+---+--------+--
2018 | | 86 | % | | $ | 160
2019 | | 84 | % | | $ | 157
2020 | | 61 | % | | $ | 103
2021 | | 72 | % | | $ | 122
2022 | | 77 | % | | $ | 247

 
As discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, prior to beginning our business transition, historically our business involved the leasing of units of multifamily properties. In late 2021, we began to transition our business to focus on leasing hotel properties in commercially-zoned areas, and we have substantially completed this transition as of the date of the this Annual Report. As a result, we believe that our historical financial and operating results, including operating metrics such as occupancy and RevPAR, are not indicative of our future operations and are not comparable to our current strategy. However, we believe that the above table is useful in illustrating the higher RevPAR and improved results that we believe that we will achieve as a result of our transition in business strategy.
 
Overall Hospitality Market
 
Since early 2022, we along with the broader lodging industry have experienced a steady recovery of demand for our properties in all of our markets. As a result, we have been able to increase our average daily rates during this period. Outside of post year-end seasonality, we continue to experience this recovery into 2023. We believe this trend will continue despite recessionary fears due to rising inbound international travel including the anticipated opening of Chinese travel which should have a significant impact in 2023.
Seasonality
 
Operations at hotel properties historically have been seasonal in nature, reflecting lower revenues and occupancy rates during the first quarter of each year when compared to the remaining three quarters. While we have only recently transitioned our business strategy to focus on the leasing of hotel units and therefore have limited historical data with respect to the seasonality of our business, we expect that this seasonality may cause fluctuations in our quarterly operating revenues, profitability, and cash flow.
Competition
 
The U.S. hotel industry is highly competitive. Our hotels compete with other hotels for guests in each of their markets on the basis of several factors, including, among others, location, quality of accommodations, convenience, brand affiliation, room rates, service levels and amenities, and level of customer service. In addition to traditional hotels, our properties also compete with non-traditional accommodations for travelers such as online room sharing services. Competition is often specific to the individual markets in which our hotels are located and includes competition from existing and new hotels.

Our competition also includes online and offline travel companies that target leisure and corporate travelers, including travel agencies, tour operators, travel supplier direct websites and their call centers, consolidators and wholesalers of travel products and services, large online portals and search websites, certain travel metasearch websites, mobile travel applications, social media websites, as well as traditional consumer ecommerce and group buying websites. We face these competitors in local, regional, national and/or international markets. We also face competition for customer traffic on internet search engines and metasearch websites, which impacts our customer acquisition and marketing costs.
 
However, while we expect new competitors may arise, we expect that we will continue to enjoy a competitive advantage over new competitors. We believe this to be the case because of:
 

● | the speed at which we can close,
--+---------------------------------


● | our experience and track record of opening, listing, and marketing properties very quickly,
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | our operational skillset and efficiency, and
--+---------------------------------------------


● | our reputation within the industry.
--+------------------------------------

Human Capital
 
As of December 31, 2022, we had a total of 213 full-time employees. Of these employees 135 are currently unionized. We believe that our corporate culture and employee relationships are healthy and productive.
 
Our operations are overseen directly by a management team that encourages our employees to take a long-term approach to our business. We may expand our current management to retain other skilled employees with experience relevant to our business. Our management’s relationships will provide the foundation through which we expect to grow our business in the future.
 
Our future success is dependent in part on our continued ability to attract, hire and retain qualified personnel. Therefore, investing, developing and maintaining human capital is critical to our success. The Company strives to provide its employees with a safe and healthy workplace.
 
We are an equal opportunity employer and it is our company’s policy to recruit, hire, train and promote personnel in all job classifications, without regard to race, religion, color, national origin, sex or age. We are committed to inclusivity and diversity across our entire operation and to fostering a culture where everyone feels empowered to do their best work. Cultivating a diverse and inclusive workplace helps us embrace different perspectives, talents and experiences. We believe achieving a culture of integrity and transparency starts with leadership and encourages every employee to work in support of our company’s goals. Continuous employee engagement helps us understand our employees’ perspectives and identify areas for additional focus.
 
As a result of our lease for the former Blakely NY Hotel, the majority of our employees are currently represented by labor unions and/or covered by collective bargaining agreements. We may in the future acquire additional portfolios of units in other hotels or other building serviced by organized or unionized labor. In addition, union, worker council or other organized labor activity may occur at other locations we already lease. Under the applicable agreements with labor unions or collective bargaining agreements, we are obligated to provide enhanced severance benefits that, in certain circumstances, may have to be paid upon termination of employment of hotel employees who are members of a union. We cannot predict the outcome of any labor-related proposal or other organized labor activity. Increased unionization of our workforce or other collective labor action, new labor legislation or changes in regulations could be costly, reduce our staffing flexibility or otherwise disrupt our operations, and reduce our profitability. While we have not experienced any labor disputes or work stoppages to date, from time to time, hospitality operations may be disrupted because of strikes, lockouts, public demonstrations or other negative actions and publicity involving employees and third-party contractors. We may also incur increased legal costs and indirect labor costs because of disputes involving our workforce.

Intellectual Property (Trademarks and Patents)
 
We have filed for eight trademarks, including with respect to the “LuxUrban” brand. We intend to use these and other trademarks in building our brand, proprietary corporate philosophies in creating our operations and guests experiences, and certain proprietary technology, applications and data bases and know how in our operations. As a result, our success depends in part on our ability to operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others, and to prevent others from infringing upon our proprietary rights. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing U.S. trademark and copyright applications, nondisclosure and assignment of invention agreements with employees, and enforcing our rights as applicable. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, and continuing technological innovation and may rely on licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position.
Regulation
 
We must ensure regulatory compliance in our operations across numerous jurisdictions.
 
Property and Accommodations Regulation
 
Our business is subject to U.S. federal, state and local and foreign laws and regulations that vary widely by city, country and property type. In many cities, local regulations affect our company’s ability to offer accommodations for specified durations or in residential neighborhoods. Hospitality and transient accommodations operations are also subject to compliance with the U.S. Americans with Disabilities Act and other laws and regulations relating to accessibility, and to laws, regulations and standards in other areas such as zoning and land use, licensing, permitting and registrations, fire and life safety, environmental and other property condition matters, staffing and employee training, cleaning protocols and other COVID-19 requirements, and property “star” ratings where required. Additionally, our real estate owners are also responsible for their own compliance with laws, including with respect to their employees, property maintenance and operations, environmental laws and other matters.
 
When signing leases in a new market, we engage local legal counsel to help identify relevant regulatory requirements. This research includes analysis on licensing and zoning, building code, accessibility and operations requirements, fire and life safety regulations, tax compliance, and local employment laws. Every leased property has unique characteristics, requiring further due diligence and regulatory analysis before each new lease signing.
 
We monitor regulatory changes in each existing market on an ongoing basis. To facilitate our growth and compliance work in each city, we attempt to establish relationships with local regulatory agencies, elected officials, business and community groups to build trust and improve understanding of our business model.
 
Our growing portfolio of accommodation units are comprised of units in entire hotels we lease on a long-term basis. Our hotel units are located in commercially zoned areas. Hotel units enjoy the benefits of commercial zoning, allowing for short-stay rentals of any length, even as a short as one day. An integral part of our growth strategy is to increase the number of hotel units comprising our total accommodation unit portfolio. As commercially zoned buildings are not typically subject to local short-stay length regulation, as we increase our hotel-based units, we will be able to offer a larger portion of our accommodation portfolio with maximum flexibility in terms of stay length and more readily ensure compliance with any regulations applicable to residential area accommodations. We also continuously refine our booking platforms and related software and data to properly identity each type of unit being marketed on our platforms and to systematically prohibit rental lengths that do not comply with existing regulations in the municipalities in which such units are located.

Privacy and Data Protection Regulation
 
In processing travel transactions and information about guests and their stays, we receive and store a large volume of personally identifiable data. The collection, storage, processing, transfer, use, disclosure and protection of this information are increasingly subject to legislation and regulations in numerous jurisdictions around the world, such as the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) and variations and implementations of that regulation in the member states of the European Union, as well as privacy and data protection laws and regulations in various U.S. States and other jurisdictions, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act), the Canadian Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (“PIPEDA”), and the UK General Data Protection Regulation and UK Data Protection Act. We have implemented a variety of technical and organizational security measures and other procedures and protocols to protect data, including data pertaining to guests and employees, and we are engaged in an ongoing process of evaluating and considering additional steps to comply with the California Consumer Privacy Act, GDPR, PIPEDA, the UK General Data Protection Regulation, and UK Data Protection Act.
Employment
 
We are also subject to laws governing our relationship with employees, including laws governing wages and hours, benefits, immigration, workplace safety and health, and hotel-specific ordinances.
Other Regulation
 
Our business is subject to various other laws and regulations, involving matters such as income tax and other taxes, consumer protection, online messaging, advertising and marketing, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other laws governing bribery and other corrupt business activities, and regulations aimed at preventing money laundering or prohibiting business activities with specified countries or persons. As we expand into additional markets, we will be subject to additional laws and regulations.
 
The regulatory environment in each market is often complex and evolving, and can be subject to significant change. Some relevant laws and regulations are inconsistent and ambiguous, and could be interpreted by regulators and courts in ways that could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Moreover, certain laws and regulations have not historically been applied to businesses such as ours, which often makes their application to our business uncertain.
 
Uncertainty
 
As a result of our transition from leasing multifamily residential units to leasing hotels, the need to comply with local or contractual short-stay length regulations or requirements, and the costs related thereto, have become increasingly less important to our operations.
 
However, as long as we lease multifamily residential units, we remain subject to short-term rental regulations, which can be difficult to ascertain, accurately interpret and apply. There is no one-size fits all approach in the United States. Additionally, the rules and regulations are in a constants state of change due to the massive and on-going shift in how governments, at all levels, assess and address short-term rental platforms. Presently, the wide variety of complex, evolving, and sometimes inconsistent and ambiguous federal, state, and local laws, regulations, and/or rules that affect the short-term rental business may adversely impact our operations and our ability, or willingness, to lease units from property owners in certain jurisdictions. Violation of the various laws, regulations, and rules that apply to us or may, in time, evolve to apply to us, could result in significant liability to us, including fines and other penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.

Corporate Information
 
Corphousing LLC (“Corphousing LLC”) was formed on October 24, 2017, as a Delaware limited liability company. In January 2022, Corphousing LLC converted into a C corporation, with the members of Corphousing LLC becoming the stockholders of CorpHousing.
 
The conversion had no effect on our business or operations and was undertaken to convert the form of the legal entity into a corporation for purposes of operating as a public company. All properties, rights, businesses, operations, duties, obligations, and liabilities of the predecessor limited liability company remained those of CorpHousing Group Inc.
 
On November 1, 2022, we filed an amendment to our certificate of incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, changing the name of our Company from “CorpHousing Group Inc.” to “LuxUrban Hotels Inc.” On December 30, 2022, we dissolved SoBeNY, which was the entity that covered our legacy apartment rental business. We substantially exited the business prior to year end 2022.
 
Facilities
 
We maintain nominal corporate headquarters at 2125 Biscayne Blvd, Suite 253 Miami, Florida 33137 Miami, Florida, where we lease office space. We believe that our corporate space is adequate for our immediate needs and that we will be able to obtain additional or substitute space, as needed, on commercially reasonable terms.
Emerging Growth Company Status
 
We are an “emerging growth company” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act, and we are eligible to receive certain specified reduced disclosure and other requirements that are otherwise generally applicable to public companies that are not “emerging growth companies,” including, but not limited to, exclusion from the requirement to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We have irrevocably opted-out of the extended transition period afforded to emerging growth companies in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised financial accounting standards. As a result, we will comply with new or revised accounting standards on the same time frames as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.
 
We will remain an “emerging growth company” until the earliest to occur of (i) the last day of the fiscal year during which our total annual gross revenue equals or exceeds $1.235 billion (subject to adjustment for inflation), (ii) December 31, 2027 (the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of our initial public offering (“IPO”), (iii) the date on which we have, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities, and (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a “large accelerated filer” under the Exchange Act.
 
We are also a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Regulation S-K under the Securities Act and may take advantage of certain of the scaled disclosures available to smaller reporting companies. We may be a smaller reporting company even after we are no longer an “emerging growth company.”
