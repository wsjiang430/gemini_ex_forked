Item 1.  Business.
Overview



We are a Delaware corporation incorporated in 1997. Through our emergence from bankruptcy on September 30, 2021, and new investors and management, we became a holding company located in Palo Alto, California, with the following subsidiaries: Mega Metaverse Corp., a California corporation, JetFleet Management Corp, a California corporation and formerly known as JetFleet Holding Corporation, Saving Digital Pte. Ltd., a Singapore corporation, and Marsprotocol, Inc., a Cayman Islands exempted company.



Previously, we have historically provided leasing and financing services to regional airlines worldwide and have been principally engaged in leasing mid-life regional aircraft to customers worldwide under operating leases and finance leases. In addition to leasing activities, we have also sold aircraft from our operating lease portfolio to third parties, including other leasing companies, financial services companies, and airlines. Our operating performance was driven by the composition of its aircraft portfolio, the terms of its leases, and the interest rate of its debt, as well as asset sales. 



Through Saving Digital Pte. Ltd, our wholly-owned subsidiary, we are currently engaged in solo-staking and provide proof-of-stake technology tools in Singapore for the Ethereum network. To a lesser extent, we are engaged in the provision of aircraft advisory and management services since September 30, 2021. We are currently exploring other crypto-related business models outside of the United States.



Recent Developments



On October 20, 2021, we set up Mega Metaverse Corp. (“Mega”), a wholly owned subsidiary incorporated in California. In December 2021, we launched our NFT business in the metaverse ecosystem through Mega, and released our first NFT game “Mano” on March 25, 2022. Due to regulatory challenges, the Company decided to suspend the Mano game and the alSpace platform, and on November 4, 2022, we discontinued the Mano game and the alSpace platform. 



On January 1, 2022, JetFleet Management Corp. (“JMC”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of JetfFleet Holding Corporation (“JHC”), was merged with and into JHC, with JHC being the surviving entity. As part of the merger, JHC changed its name to JetFleet Management Corp (“Jetfleet”).



Effective March 25, 2022, we changed our name from Aerocentury Corp. to Mega Matrix Corp. (the “Name Change”) to better reflect our expansion into Metaverse and the NFT gaming business. In connection with the Name Change, we changed our ticker symbol from “ACY” to “MTMT” on the NYSE American Exchange, which became effective on March 28, 2022.



On August 31, 2022, we acquired all of the equity interest in Saving Digital Pte, Ltd., a Singapore corporation (“SDP”) with no operations and approximately $3,800 in cash, from our chairman Yucheng Hu for a nominal consideration of $10,000.



On December 7, 2022, we entered into a definitive agreement and plan of merger (the “Merger Agreement”) related to a proposed merger transaction with MarsProtocol Inc., an exempted company incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands and our wholly-owned subsidiary (“MTMT Cayman”) for the purpose of redomiciling the corporation from Delaware to the Cayman Islands. The Merger Agreement provides that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, we will merge with and into MTMT Cayman (the “Redomicile Merger”), with MTMT Cayman being the surviving company in the Redomicile Merger. Following the Redomicile Merger, MTMT Cayman, together with its subsidiaries, will own and continue to conduct our business in substantially the same manner as is currently being conducted by us and our subsidiaries. The Merger Agreement contains customary closing conditions, including, among others, approval of the Redomicile Merger by our stockholders, the effectiveness of the registration statement on Form F-4 filed by MTMT Cayman related to the Redomicile Merger and receipt of required regulatory approvals. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, our Board of Directors (the “Board”) may exercise its discretion to terminate the Merger Agreement, and therefore abandon the Redomicile Merger, at any time prior to the effective time, including after the adoption of the Merger Agreement by the Company’s stockholders. As of the date of this report, the Merger Agreement has not been adopted by our stockholders and we have not yet set a date for a special meeting of stockholders seeking such approval.



Effective February 6, 2023, we changed our ticker symbol from “MTMT” to “MPU” on the NYSE American Exchange to more closely align with our MarsProtocol brand for our digital assets staking business.



On March 1, 2023, in connection with a newly formed joint venture, SDP and Bit Digital Singapore Pte. Ltd. (“Bit Digital”) entered into a shareholders’ agreement (the “Shareholders Agreement”) with Marsprotocol Technologies Pte. Ltd. (the “JV Company”), to provide staking technology tools in digital assets through the staking platform “MarsProtocol,” an individual and institutional grade designed staking platform (the “Joint Venture”). Pursuant to the Shareholders Agreement, SDP will own 60% and Bit Digital will own 40% of the JV Company.



Business of the Company



Through SDP, we are engaged in solo-staking and as a provider proof-of-stake technology tools in Singapore for the Ethereum network, and we plan to continue exploring other crypto-related business models outside of the United States. In addition, to a lesser extent, we are engaged in the provision of aircraft advisory and management services since September 30, 2021 through JetFleet.

On September 19, 2022, SDP purchased 37 Ether (ETH) for the purpose of exploring Ethereum staking opportunities following the transition by Ethereum on September 15, 2022 from proof-of-work (PoW) to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism referred to as the “Merge.” Prior to the Merge, Ethereum utilized a PoW validation method for digital asset transactions. Following the Merge, Ethereum shifted to a PoS validation system where validators stake their ETH into a smart contract on Ethereum to serve as collateral that can be destroyed if the validator behaves dishonestly or lazily. The validator (selected randomly) is then responsible for processing the blockchain transactions, storing data and adding new blocks to the blockchain. Validators receives a transaction fee on their staked coins in ETH as a reward for their active participation in the network. To become a validator on Ethereum, a participant must stake 32 ETH. Till quarter ending December 31, 2022, SDP explored Solo-Staking by staking 160 ETH to become five (5) validators to Ethereum to earn ETH rewards and yield. Solo-Staking enables SDP to utilize its ETH treasury to stake on the Ethereum beacon chain and to earn ETH-denominated rewards directly from the Ethereum protocol.



Through MarsProtocol, the Joint Venture will seek to provide non-custodial staking tools whereby users’ private keys are not stored in its database to ensure the safety of its users’ digital assets. As of the date of this report, such services will not be available to U.S. residents.



The following diagram summarizes our MarsProtocol StaaS Platform: 







The Joint Venture will provide our customers with a right-of-way to access our MarsProtocol platform after they have completed the registration process and the know-your-customer (KYC) verification process. Once registered, the customer can connect their third-party trusted wallet with the nodes to stake their ETH on the Ethereum beacon chain to earn ETH-denominated rewards directly from the Ethereum protocol. Customers can review their transactions and rewards each node produces through the asset dashboard. The Joint Venture or the Marsprotocol platform will not have any access to the Customer’s digital wallet. All decisions to stake will be made by the customer.



Our belief that the ETH and other digital assets that we hold are not securities based on a risk assessment and not a legal standard nor binding on the SEC or any other regulators. If USDC, USDT, or ETH are deemed to be securities under the laws of any U.S. federal, state, or foreign jurisdiction, or in a proceeding in a court of law or otherwise, it may have adverse consequences for such digital asset. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors – Risks Related to our Business – A particular digital asset’s status, such as an ETH, as a “security” in any relevant jurisdiction is subject to a high degree of uncertainty and if a regulator disagrees with our characterization of the ETH and other stable cryptocurrencies, we may be subject to regulatory scrutiny, investigation, fines and penalties, which may adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. A determination that an ETH or stable cryptocurrencies is a “security” may adversely affect the value of those ETH, stable cryptocurrencies and our business.”



Competition 



Staking as a Services (StaaS) providers offer a convenient and accessible way for users to stake their ETH without having to go through the technical process of running their own staking nodes. These providers typically charge a fee for their services, which can vary depending on the provider and the level of service offered.



The market for Ethereum StaaS is relatively new, but it is already competitive, with several providers vying for market share. Some of the larger competitors in this space include Coinbase, Binance, Kraken, and Bitfinex, which may have better established names, have a broader range of crypto related services, and have larger capital resources.



Competition in the StaaS market is primarily driven by factors such as the fee structure, reliability and uptime of the staking nodes, the user interface and user experience of the platform, and the level of customer support provided. Providers may also differentiate themselves by offering additional features such as staking pools, which allow users to pool their Ethereum with other stakers to increase their chances of earning rewards.



As the Ethereum network continues to evolve and attract more users, it is likely that the StaaS market will become even more competitive, with new providers entering the market and existing providers expanding their offerings to stay ahead of the competition.

Ethereum Rewards



From the inception of our solo-staking business in October 2022 through December 31, 2022, we earned an aggregate of 1.5 ETH as rewards.



The following table presents our ETH activities for the year ended December 31, 2022.




 | Number of ETH | | | Amount (1) | 
-------------------------------------------+---------------+-------+---+------------+--
Balance at December 31, 2021 | | - | | | $ | - | 
Receipt of ETH as staking reward | | 1.5 | | | | 1,800 | 
Exchange of cash and stable coins into ETH | | 300.7 | | | | 396,500 | 
Borrowings of ETH from a third party | | 32.0 | | | | 41,600 | 
Payment of charges | | (0.0 | ) | | | (100 | )
Impairment of ETH | | - | | | | (70,600 | )
Balance at December 31, 2022 | | 334.2 | | | $ | 369,200 | 


(1) | Receipt of digital assets from staking reward are the product of the number of ETH received multiplied by the ETH price obtained from Coinmarketcap, calculated on a daily basis. Sales of digital assets are the actual amount received from sales.

In addition, through our 51.0% ownership in JetFleet as of December 31, 2022, we will continue to focus on third-party management service contracts for aircraft operations. We believe that as passive investor interest in aircraft assets has increased, there has been increasing demand from aircraft investors for professional third-party aircraft leasing and portfolio management. We intend to take advantage of our reputation, experience and expertise in this aircraft management area. JetFleet conducts all of its operations from its office located at 1818 Gilbreth Rd., Suite 243, Burlingame, California, United States.



Bankruptcy



The Company and its then subsidiaries, JHC and JMC (collectively, the “Debtors”), filed on March 29, 2021, a voluntary petition for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. The filing was made in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware (the “Bankruptcy Court”) Case No. 21-10636 (the “Chapter 11 Case”). The Company also filed motions with the Bankruptcy Court seeking authorization to continue to operate our business as “debtor-in-possession” under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and orders of the Bankruptcy Court.



On August 16, 2021, in the Bankruptcy Court, the Debtors filed unexecuted drafts of its Plan Sponsor Agreement to be entered into between us, Yucheng Hu, TongTong Ma, Qiang Zhang, Yanhua Li, Yiyi Huang, Hao Yang, Jing Li, Yeh Cheng and Yu Wang, and identifying such individuals, collectively, as “Plan Sponsors” (the “Plan Sponsor Agreement”), and related agreements and documents required thereunder (collectively, with the Plan Sponsor Agreement, the “Plan Sponsor Documents”). The Plan Sponsor Documents were intended to cover the transactions contemplated by an investment term sheet entered into with Yucheng Hu and are part of the Debtors’ plan of reorganization as reflected in the Combined Disclosure Statement and Plan filed with the Bankruptcy Court as amended and supplemented from time to time (the “Plan”). On August 31, 2021, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order, Docket No. 0296 (the “Confirmation Order”), confirming the Plan as set forth in the Combined Plan Statement and Plan Supplement.



On September 30, 2021 and pursuant to the Plan Sponsor Agreement, the Company entered into and consummated the transactions contemplated by a Securities Purchase Agreement with the Plan Sponsor, and Yucheng Hu, in the capacity as the representative for the Plan Sponsor thereunder, pursuant to which the Company issued and sold, and the Plan Sponsor purchased, 14,354,635 (adjusted for the Forward Stock Split) shares of our common stock at $0.77 (adjusted for the Forward Stock Split) for each share of common stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $11,053,069.



Also on September 30, 2021, and pursuant to the Plan Sponsor Agreement, the Company entered into and consummated the transactions contemplated by a Series A Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement (the “JHC Series A Agreement”) with JHC, pursuant to which JHC issued and sold, and the Company purchased, 104,082 shares of Series A Preferred Stock, no par value, at $19.2156 per share of JHC Series A Preferred Stock, for an aggregate purchase price of $2 million.



Each share of JHC Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to one (1) vote on any matter that is submitted to a vote or for the consent of the shareholders of JHC. The JHC Series A Preferred Stock provides the Company with 74.83% voting control over JHC immediately following its issuance.



On January 1, 2022, JMC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of JHC, was merged with and into JHC, with JHC being the surviving entity. As part of the merger, JHC changed its name to JetFleet Management Corp.



Change In Control



As a condition to the closing of the Securities Purchase Agreement, Michael G. Magnusson resigned as President and Chief Executive Officer; Harold M. Lyons resigned as Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer, Senior Vice President, Finance and Secretary; and Michael G. Magnusson, Toni M. Perazzo, Roy E. Hahn, Evan M. Wallach and David P.

Government Regulation



Related to our StaaS Business



U.S Government Regulations



Government regulation of blockchain and digital assets is being actively considered by the United States federal government via a number of agencies and regulatory bodies, as well as similar entities in other countries. State government regulations also may apply to our activities and other activities in which we participate or may participate in the future. Other regulatory bodies are governmental or semi-governmental and have shown an interest in regulating or investigating companies engaged in the blockchain or cryptocurrency business.



Digital assets are assets issued and transferred using distributed ledger or blockchain technology. They are often referred to as crypto assets, cryptocurrency, or digital tokens, among other terminology. Digital assets can be securities, currencies, properties, or commodities, and depending on their characteristics, participants of digital assets must adhere to applicable laws and regulations. For example, the SEC treats some digital assets as “securities,” the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) treats some digital assets as “commodities,” and the Internal Revenue Service treats some digital assets as “property.” State regulators oversee digital assets through state money transfer laws, and the Department of the Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) monitors digital assets for anti-money laundering purposes.



Businesses that are engaged in the transmission and custody of digital assets that is not a security (“non-security digital assets”) such as Bitcoin and ETH, including brokers and custodians, can be subject to U.S. Treasury Department regulations as money services businesses as well as state money transmitter licensing requirements. Non-security digital assets are subject to anti-fraud regulations under federal and state commodity laws, and digital asset derivative instruments are substantively regulated by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Certain jurisdictions, including, among others, New York and a number of countries outside the United States, have developed regulatory requirements specifically for digital assets and companies that transact in them.



In addition, since transactions in non-security digital assets such as Bitcoin and ETH provide a reasonable degree of pseudo anonymity, they are susceptible to misuse for criminal activities, such as money laundering. This misuse, or the perception of such misuse (even if untrue), could lead to greater regulatory oversight of non-security digital asset platforms, and there is the possibility that law enforcement agencies could close such platforms or other related infrastructure with little or no notice and prevent users from accessing or retrieving non-security digital assets via such platforms or infrastructure. For example, in her January 2021 nomination hearing before the Senate Finance Committee, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen noted that cryptocurrencies have the potential to improve the efficiency of the financial system but that they can be used to finance terrorism, facilitate money laundering, and support malign activities that threaten U.S. national security interests and the integrity of the U.S. and international financial systems. Accordingly, Secretary Yellen expressed her view that federal regulators needed to look closely at how to encourage the use of cryptocurrencies for legitimate activities while curtailing their use for malign and illegal activities. Furthermore, in December 2020, FinCEN proposed a new set of rules for cryptocurrency-based exchanges aimed at reducing the use of cryptocurrencies for money laundering. These proposed rules would require filing reports with FinCEN regarding cryptocurrency transactions in excess of $10,000 and also impose record-keeping requirements for cryptocurrency transactions in excess of $3,000 involving users who manage their own private keys. In January 2021, the Biden Administration issued a memorandum freezing federal rulemaking, including these proposed FinCEN rules, to provide additional time for the Biden Administration to review the rulemaking that had been proposed by the Trump Administration. As a result, it remains unclear whether these proposed rules will take effect.



Digital assets that meet the definition of a “security” under the federal securities laws (“digital assets security”) are regulated by federal securities regulations such as the Securities Act of 1933, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Investment Company Act of 1940, and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.



In addition, businesses that provides a trading platform or exchanges for digital assets that are deemed securities may be required to register with the SEC as a national securities exchange unless an exemption is available. However, if such platform offers trading in digital assets that are not securities, it may have to register as a money-transmission service (MTS) instead of a SEC-regulated national securities exchange. MTSs are money transfer or payment operations that are mainly subject to state regulations, rather than federal regulations but may have to register with FinCEN and face certain reporting requirements.



All of the Company solo-staking and StaaS activities are conducted in Singapore, and the Company does not currently intend to make StaaS available to U.S. residents. In addition, the Company does not consider its holdings of ETH and other digital assets as securities based on a risk assessment, but this is not a legally binding standard recognized by the SEC or other regulators. If USDC, USDT, or ETH are deemed to be securities under the laws of any U.S. federal, state, or foreign jurisdiction, or in a proceeding in a court of law or otherwise, it may have adverse consequences for such digital asset. For additional discussion regarding our belief about the potential risks existing and future regulation pose to our business, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors” in this report.

Singapore Government Regulations



Singapore has a robust regulatory framework for financial services, which is overseen by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (“MAS”). The MAS is responsible for ensuring that the financial services industry operates in a safe and sound manner and maintains the stability of the financial system.



In Singapore, based on legal advice received from local counsel, ETH is considered a digital payment token (“DPT”) and regulated under the Payment Services Act 2019 (“PSA”). Currently, the PSA regulates services dealing in DPTs or facilitating the exchange of DPTs. The StaaS business is not considered a regulated activity under the PSA, as it does not involve buying or selling of DPTs or facilitating the exchange of DPTs.



However, the Payment Services (Amendment) Act 2021 (PSAA21) has been passed by Singapore’s parliament and may expand the scope of regulation for DPT services in the future, although it has not yet come into effect.



In terms of Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements, financial institutions in Singapore are required to implement robust measures to prevent money laundering and financing of terrorism. This includes conducting customer due diligence, ongoing monitoring of transactions, and reporting of suspicious transactions to the relevant authorities. The MAS works closely with financial institutions to ensure compliance with AML and KYC requirements, and has the power to impose penalties for non-compliance. As the StaaS business is currently not considered a regulated activity under the PSA, these specific requirements for licensed institutions do not apply to SDP apart from the general duty to report suspicious transactions. However, the regulatory landscape may change with the introduction of the PSAA21 and future amendments.



Related to our Aircraft Management Service



JHC is subject to compliance with federal, state and local government regulations. As a company engaged in international trade, these regulations include the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and various export control, money laundering, and anti-terrorism laws and regulations promulgated by the U.S. Department of Commerce and the Department of Treasury.
Intellectual Property



The protection of our technology and intellectual property is an important aspect of our business. We currently rely upon a combination of trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights, nondisclosure contractual commitments, and other legal rights to establish and protect our intellectual property.
