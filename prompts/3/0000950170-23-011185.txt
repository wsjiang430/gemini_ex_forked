 Pathfinder Bank
 The Bank is a New York-chartered commercial bank and its deposit accounts are insured up to applicable limits by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) through the Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”). The Bank is subject to extensive regulation by the NYSDFS, as its chartering agency, and by the FDIC, as its deposit insurer and primary federal regulator. The Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York (“FHLBNY”) and is also subject to certain regulations by the Federal Home Loan Bank System.
The Bank is primarily engaged in the business of attracting deposits from the general public in the Bank's market area, and investing such deposits, together with other sources of funds, in loans secured by commercial and residential real estate, and commercial business and consumer assets other than real estate. In addition, the Bank originates unsecured small business and consumer loans. The Bank also invests a portion of its assets in a broad range of debt securities issued by the United States Government and its agencies and sponsored enterprises, state and municipal governments and agencies, and corporations. The Company also invests in mortgage‑backed securities issued or guaranteed by United States Government sponsored enterprises, collateralized mortgage obligations and similar debt
-  -


securities issued by both government sponsored entities and private (non-governmental) issuers, and asset-backed securities that are generally issued by private entities. The Company invests primarily in debt securities but will, within certain regulatory limits, invest from time to time in mutual funds and equity securities. The Bank's principal sources of funds are deposits, principal and interest payments on loans and investments, as well as borrowings from correspondent financial institutions. The principal source of the Company’s income is interest on loans and investment securities. The Bank's principal expenses are interest paid on deposits and borrowed funds, employee compensation and benefits, data processing and facilities.
 The Bank also owns 100% of Whispering Oaks Development Corp. (“Whispering Oaks”), a New York corporation that is retained to operate or develop real estate-related projects. Whispering Oaks, through a wholly-owned second-tier subsidiary, is the sole limited partner in an unconsolidated special-purpose real estate management partnership. The partnership currently operates a low-income residential housing facility. The activities of Whispering Oaks, which included the sale of real property, resulted in a pre-tax gain of $111,000 in 2022.
Additionally, the Bank owns 100% of Pathfinder Risk Management Company, Inc., ("PRMC") which was established to record the 51% controlling interest upon the December 2013 purchase of the FitzGibbons Agency, an Oswego County property, casualty and life insurance brokerage business with approximately $1.1 million in annual revenues. The activities of PRMC resulted in pre-tax income of $207,000 in 2022. The Company’s 51% controlling interest in this entity resulted in income of $106,000 for the Company on a consolidated basis in 2022.
 MARKET AREA AND COMPETITION
Market Area
 We provide financial services to individuals, families, small to mid-size businesses and municipalities through our seven branch offices located in Oswego County, NY, four branch offices located in Onondaga County, NY and one limited purpose office located in Oneida County, NY. Our primary lending market area includes both Oswego and Onondaga Counties. However, our primary deposit generating area is concentrated in Oswego County and in the areas surrounding our Onondaga County branches.
 The economies of Oswego County and Onondaga County are based primarily on manufacturing, energy production, heath care, education, and government. In addition to financial services, the broader Central New York market has a more diverse array of economic sectors, including food processing production and transportation. The region has more recently also developed particular strength in the commercialization of certain emerging technologies such as bio-processing, medical devices, aircraft systems and renewable energy.
Based on recent independent market survey reports, median home values were $204,700 in Onondaga County and $132,400 in Oswego County at the end of 2022. Home values have shown only modest increases in recent years within the Syracuse, NY metro area, including Onondaga and Oswego Counties. This modest increase in home values within the area followed a period in which home values within the area exhibited relative stability compared to many other areas of the country during the most recent economic recession that began in 2008.
Competition
 Pathfinder Bank encounters strong competition both in attracting deposits and in originating real estate and other loans. Our most direct competition for deposits and loans comes from commercial banks, savings institutions and credit unions in our market area, including money-center banks such as JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Bank of America, regional banks such as M&T Bank and Key Bank N. A., and community banks such as NBT Bank and Community Bank N.A., all of which have substantially greater total assets than we do. Local credit unions, some of which also have more assets than the Company, are particularly strong competitors for consumer deposits and consumer loans. In addition, potential new competitors may be emerging that are generically defined as financial technology (also referred to as “FinTech” or “fintech”) companies. These entities seek to employ new technology and various forms of innovation in order to compete with traditional methods of delivering financial services. The advanced use of smartphones for mobile banking, automated investing services and cryptocurrency are examples of such technologies. Financial technology companies consist of both well-capitalized startup entities, divisions of established financial institutions and/or established technology companies. These entities seek to replace or supplement the financial services provided by established financial service entities, such as the Company. Many established financial institutions are now implementing, or planning to implement, various forms of fintech solutions and technologies in order to broaden their product and service offerings and/or to gain improved competitive positions in this emerging marketplace. Some of these technologies either have been implemented to varying degrees by the Bank, or will be available to the Bank for future implementation through its network of service providers and computer system vendors. It cannot be predicted with certainty at this time how effective these new competitors will be in our marketplace or what costs the Company will incur in the future to implement and maintain competitive technologies.
Our primary focus is to build and develop profitable consumer and commercial customer relationships while maintaining our role as a community bank. We compete for deposits by offering depositors a high level of personal service, a wide range of competitively-priced
-  -


financial services, and a well distributed network of branches, ATMs, and electronic banking. We compete for loans through our competitive pricing, our experienced and active loan officers, local knowledge of our market and local decision making, strong community support and involvement, and a highly reputable brand. Notwithstanding the significant but temporary economic dislocations associated with the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021, overall economic activity in the local marketplace and, more specifically, demand for commercial and residential loans grew significantly over the past decade. This growth in overall loan demand in our market area also attracted increased competition from financial institutions for those loans. Additionally, from a competitive perspective, some of our competitors offer products and services that we do not offer, such as trust services and private banking.
As of June 30, 2022, based on the most recently-available FDIC data, we had the largest market share in Oswego County, representing 48.7% of all deposits, and we additionally held 2.0% of all deposits in Onondaga County. In addition, when combining both Oswego and Onondaga Counties, we have the fifth largest market share of fifteen institutions, representing 7.7% of the total market. 
LENDING ACTIVITIES
 General
Our primary lending activities are originating commercial real estate and commercial loans, the vast majority of which have periodically adjustable rates of interest, and one-to-four family residential real estate loans, the majority of which have fixed rates of interest. Our loan portfolio also includes municipal loans, home equity loans and lines and consumer loans. In order to diversify our loan portfolio, increase our revenues, and make our loan portfolio less interest rate sensitive, the Company has actively sought to increase its commercial real estate and commercial business lending activities, consistent with safe and sound underwriting practices. Accordingly, we offer adjustable-rate commercial mortgage loans and floating rate commercial loans and lines of credit.
Commercial Real Estate Loans
 Over the past several years, we have focused on originating commercial real estate loans, and we believe that commercial real estate loans will continue to provide growth opportunities for us. We expect to increase, subject to our underwriting standards and market conditions, this business line in the future with a target loan size of $500,000 to $2.0 million to small businesses and real estate projects in our market area. Commercial real estate loans are secured by properties such as multi-family residential, office, retail, warehouse and owner-occupied commercial properties.
Our commercial real estate underwriting policies provide that such real estate loans are typically made in amounts up to 80% of the appraised value of the property. Commercial real estate loans are offered with interest rates that are generally fixed for up to three or five years then are adjustable based on the FHLBNY advance rate. Contractual maturities generally do not exceed 20 years. In reaching a decision whether to make a commercial real estate loan, we consider market conditions, operating trends, net cash flows of the property, the borrower’s expertise and credit history, and the appraised value of the underlying property. We will also consider the terms and conditions of the leases and the stability of the tenant base. We generally require that the properties securing these real estate loans have debt service coverage ratios (the ratio of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization divided by interest expense and current maturities of long term debt) of at least 120%. Environmental due diligence is generally conducted for commercial real estate loans. Typically, commercial real estate loans made to corporations, partnerships and other business entities require personal guarantees by the owners of 20% or more of the borrowing entity.
A commercial real estate borrower’s financial condition is monitored on an ongoing basis by requiring current financial statements, rent rolls, payment history reviews, property inspections and periodic face-to-face meetings with the borrower. We generally require borrowers with aggregate outstanding balances exceeding $100,000 to provide annual updated financial statements and/or federal tax returns. These requirements also apply to all guarantors on these loans.
 Loans secured by commercial real estate generally have greater credit risk than one-to-four family residential real estate loans. The increased credit risk associated with commercial real estate loans is a result of several factors, including larger loan balances concentrated with a limited number of borrowers, the impact of local and general economic conditions on the borrower’s ability to repay the loan. Furthermore, the repayment of loans secured by commercial real estate properties typically depends upon the successful operation of the real property securing the loan. If the cash flows from the property are reduced, the borrower’s ability to repay the loan may be impaired. However, commercial real estate loans generally have higher interest rates than loans secured by one-to-four family residential real estate.
 Commercial Loans
We typically originate commercial loans, including commercial term loans and commercial lines of credit, on the basis of a borrower’s ability to make repayment from the cash flows of the borrower’s business, conversion of current assets in the normal course of business
-  -


(for seasonal working capital lines), the industry and market in which they operate, experience and stability of the borrower’s management team, earnings projections and the underlying assumptions, and the value and marketability of any collateral securing the loan. As a result, the availability of funds for the repayment of commercial loans and commercial lines of credit is substantially dependent on the success of the business itself and the general economic environment in our market area. Therefore, commercial loans and commercial lines of credit that we originate have greater credit risk than one-to-four family residential real estate loans.
Commercial term loans are typically secured by equipment, furniture and fixtures, inventory, accounts receivable or other business assets, or, in some circumstances, such loans may be unsecured. From time to time, we also originate commercial loans that are guaranteed by the United States Small Business Administration (“SBA”) or United States Department of Agriculture (“USDA”) loan programs. Over the past several years, we have focused on increasing our commercial lending and our business strategy is to continue to increase our originations of commercial loans to small businesses in our market area, subject to our underwriting standards and market conditions. Our commercial loans are generally comprised of adjustable-rate loans, indexed to the prime rate, with terms consisting of three to seven years, depending on the needs of the borrower and the useful life of the underlying collateral. We make commercial loans to businesses operating in our market area for purchasing equipment, property improvements, business expansion or working capital. If a commercial loan is secured by equipment, the maturity of a term loan will depend on the useful life of the equipment purchased, the source of repayment for the loan and the purpose of the loan. We generally obtain personal guarantees on our commercial loans.
 The Bank also participated in the Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”), a specialized low-interest loan program funded by the U.S. Treasury Department and administered by the U.S. Small Business Administration (“SBA”) pursuant to the CARES Act and subsequent legislation. PPP loans had an interest rate of 1.0% and a two-year or five-year loan term to maturity. The SBA guaranteed 100% of the PPP loans made to eligible borrowers. The entire principal amount of the borrower’s PPP loan, including any accrued interest, was eligible to be reduced by the loan forgiveness amount under the PPP so long as employee and compensation levels of the business are maintained and the loan proceeds are used for qualifying expenses. The Paycheck Protection Program ended in May 2021. Through that date, the Bank received approval from the SBA for 1,177 loans totaling approximately $111.7 million through this program. As of this filing, the Company has submitted forgiveness applications for all of its originated loans and has five PPP loans remaining within its portfolios. Gross revenues recognized from PPP loan activities were $707,000 and $2.2 million in the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Bank held $203,000 in outstanding PPP loans in portfolio at December 31, 2022 and anticipates that all activities related to the PPP will be completed in the first quarter of 2023.
Our commercial lines of credit are typically adjustable rate lines, indexed to the prime interest rate. Generally, our commercial lines of credit are secured by business assets or other collateral, and generally payable on-demand pursuant to an annual review. Since the commercial lines of credit may expire without being drawn upon, the total committed amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements.
 Residential Real Estate Loans
 As noted above, we have shifted our primary lending focus in recent years towards originating more commercial real estate and commercial loans. However, we have retained our significant presence in the local marketplace for lending activities concentrated on originating one-to-four family, owner-occupied residential mortgage loans. Substantially all of these loans are secured by properties located in our market area.
We currently offer one-to-four family residential real estate loans with terms up to 30 years that are generally underwritten according to Federal National Mortgage Association (“Fannie Mae”) guidelines, and we refer to loans that conform to such guidelines as “conforming loans.” We generally originate both fixed-rate and adjustable-rate mortgage loans in amounts up to the maximum conforming loan limits as established by the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which as of December 31, 2022, was generally $647,200 for single-family homes in our market area.
Conforming loans are generally saleable at management’s discretion, we hold our one-to-four family residential real estate loans in our portfolio but do sell mortgages into the secondary market, at management’s discretion, as a source of liquidity or as a means of managing liquidity and interest-rate risks. Such loan sales were conducted on a limited basis in 2022 and to a substantially more significant degree in 2021. The decrease in residential mortgage sales in 2022, as compared to the previous year, was directly related to significant overall decreases in the volume of 20- and 30-year mortgage loans originated by the Bank in 2022. This decrease in originated volume was primarily due to decreased customer demand for mortgage loans resulting from significant increases in mortgage interest rates. A significant portion of our retained loan portfolio consists of fixed-rate one-to-four family residential real estate loans with terms in excess of 15 years. We also originate one-to-four family residential real estate loans secured by non-owner occupied properties. However, we generally do not make loans in excess of 80% loan-to-value on non-owner occupied properties.
 For most owner-occupied one-to-four family residential real estate loans with loan-to-value ratios of between 80% and 95%, we require the borrower to obtain private mortgage insurance (“PMI”). Our lending policies limit the maximum loan-to-value ratio on both
-  -


fixed-rate and adjustable-rate owner-occupied mortgage loans to 80% of the appraised value of the collateralized property, with the exception of a limited use product which allows for loans up to 90% with no PMI. For first mortgage loan products, we require the borrower to obtain title insurance. We also require homeowners’ insurance, fire and casualty, and, if necessary, flood insurance on properties securing real estate loans. We do not, and have never offered or invested in, one-to-four family residential real estate loans specifically designed for borrowers with sub-prime credit scores, including interest-only, negative amortization or payment option adjustable-rate mortgage loans.
 Our fixed-rate one-to-four family residential real estate loans include loans that generally amortize on a monthly basis over periods between 10 to 30 years. Fixed-rate one-to-four family residential real estate loans often remain outstanding for significantly shorter periods than their contractual terms because borrowers have the right to refinance or prepay their loans.
Our adjustable-rate one-to-four family residential real estate loans generally consist of loans with initial interest rates fixed for one, three, or five years, and annual adjustments thereafter are indexed based on changes in the one-year United States Treasury bill constant maturity rate. Our adjustable-rate mortgage loans generally have an interest rate adjustment limit of 200 basis points per adjustment, with a maximum lifetime interest rate adjustment limit of 600 basis points. Although adjustable-rate one-to-four family residential real estate loans may reduce, to an extent, our vulnerability to changes in market interest rates because they periodically re-price, as interest rates increase the required payments due from a borrower also increase (subject to rate caps), thereby increasing the potential for default by the borrower. At the same time, the ability of the borrower to repay the loan and the marketability of the underlying collateral may be adversely affected by higher interest rates. Upward adjustments of the contractual interest rate are also limited by our maximum periodic and lifetime rate adjustments.
 Residential Construction Loans
 Our one-to-four family residential real estate loan portfolio also includes residential constructions loans. Our residential construction loans generally have initial terms of up to six months, subject to extension, during which the borrower pays interest only. Upon completion of construction, these loans typically convert to permanent loans secured by the completed residential real estate. Our construction loans generally have rates and terms comparable to residential real estate loans that we originate.
Tax-exempt Loans
 We make loans to local governments and municipalities for either tax anticipation or for small expenditure projects, including equipment acquisitions and construction projects. Our municipal loans are generally fixed for a term of one year or less, and are generally unsecured. Interest earned on municipal loans is tax exempt for federal tax purposes, which enhances the overall yield on each loan. Generally, the municipality will have a deposit relationship with us along with the lending relationship.
 We also make tax-exempt loans to commercial borrowers based on obligations issued by a state or local authority to provide economic development such as the state dormitory authority.
 Home Equity Loans and Junior Liens
 Home equity loans and junior liens are made up of lines of credit secured by owner-occupied and non-owner occupied one-to-four family residences and second and third real estate mortgage loans. Home equity loans and home equity lines of credit are generally underwritten using the same criteria that we use to underwrite one-to-four family residential mortgage loans. We typically originate home equity loans and home equity lines of credit on the basis of the applicant's credit history, an assessment of the applicant's ability to meet existing obligations and payments on the proposed loan, and the value of the collateral securing the loan. Home equity loans are offered with fixed interest rates. Lines of credit are offered with adjustable rates, which are indexed to the prime rate, and with a draw period of up to 10 years and a payback period of up to 20 years. The loan-to-value ratio for our home equity loans is generally limited to 80% when combined with the first security lien, if applicable. The loan to value of our home equity lines of credit is generally limited to 80%, unless the Bank holds the first mortgage. If we hold the first mortgage, we will permit a loan to value of up to 90%, and we adjust the interest rate and underwriting standards to compensate for the additional risk.
 For all first lien position mortgage loans, we use outside independent appraisers. For second position mortgage loans where we also hold the existing first mortgage, we will use the lesser of the existing appraisal amount used in underwriting the first mortgage or assessed value. For all other second mortgage loans, we will use a third-party service which gathers all data from real property tax offices and gives the property a low, middle and high value, together with similar properties for comparison. The middle value from the third-party service will be the value used in underwriting the loan. If the valuation method for the loan amount requested does not provide a value, or the value is not sufficient to support the loan request and it is determined that the borrower(s) are credit worthy, a full appraisal may be ordered.
-  -


Home equity loans and junior liens secured by junior mortgages have greater risk than one-to-four family residential mortgage loans secured by first mortgages. We face the risk that the collateral will be insufficient to compensate us for loan losses and costs of foreclosure, after repayment of the senior mortgages, if applicable. When customers default on their loans, we attempt to work out the relationship in order to avoid foreclosure because the value of the collateral may not be sufficient to compensate us for the amount of the unpaid loan and we may be unsuccessful in recovering the remaining balance from those customers. Moreover, decreases in real estate values could adversely affect our ability to fully recover the loan balance in the event of a default.
Consumer Loans
 We are authorized to make loans for a variety of personal and consumer purposes and our consumer loan portfolio consists primarily of automobile, recreational vehicles and unsecured personal loans, as well as unsecured lines of credit and loans secured by deposit accounts. Our procedure for underwriting consumer loans includes an assessment of the applicant’s credit history and ability to meet existing obligations and payments for the proposed loan, as well as an evaluation of the value of the collateral security, if any.
Consumer loans generally entail greater credit-related risk than one-to-four family residential mortgage loans, particularly in the case of loans that are unsecured or are secured by assets that tend to depreciate in value, such as automobiles. As a result, consumer loan collections are primarily dependent on the borrower’s continuing financial stability and thus are more likely to be adversely affected by job loss, divorce, illness or personal bankruptcy. In these cases, repossessed collateral for a defaulted consumer loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment for the outstanding loan, and the remaining value often does not warrant further substantial collection efforts against the borrower.
The Company will invest from time to time in pools of collateralized consumer loans originated and serviced by financial institutions operating outside of the Company’s primary market area. Third party-originated consumer loan pools are generally acquired primarily when, in the view of management, they offer superior risk vs. return characteristics to debt securities. Such pools will, in some instances, have projected economic advantages in terms of yield and/or other portfolio characteristics, such as interest rate risk sensitivity, superior to debt securities that would otherwise be purchased and are acquired to increase the overall performance characteristics of the Company’s interest earning-asset portfolios viewed as a whole. Loans acquired through these transactions are required by the Company’s internal policies to be underwritten to standards that are consistent with those of the Company’s own underwriting guidelines and internal practices. Pre-purchase due diligence is performed that includes a thorough review of the originating institution’s regulatory compliance procedures, underwriting practices and individual loan documentation. Since these pools are subject to borrower credit default and are collateralized by out-of-market assets, the Company relies on the best efforts of the originating institution, acting as the loans’ servicer, to collect on the loans within the pool and to mitigate losses due to such defaults. Such mitigation efforts include the orderly and timely liquidation of loan collateral, as necessary. Accordingly, such loan pools have both the credit risk typically associated with consumer loans and servicer risk components that are carefully monitored by the Company on an ongoing basis.
Loan Originations, Purchases, Sales and Servicing
 We benefit from a number of sources for our loan originations, including real estate broker referrals, existing customers, borrowers, builders, attorneys, and “walk-in” customers. Our loan origination activity may be affected adversely by a rising interest rate environment which may result in decreased loan demand. Other factors, such as the overall health of the local economy and competition from other financial institutions, can also impact our loan originations. Although we originate both fixed-rate and adjustable-rate loans, our ability to generate each type of loan depends upon borrower demand, market interest rates, borrower preference for fixed-rate versus adjustable-rate loans, and the interest rates offered on each type of loan by other lenders in our market area. These lenders include commercial banks, savings institutions, credit unions, and mortgage banking companies that also actively compete for local real estate loans. Accordingly, the volume of loan originations may vary from period to period.
The majority of the fixed rate residential loans that are originated each year meet the underwriting guidelines established by Fannie Mae. While infrequent, in the past, we have sold residential mortgage loans in the secondary market, and we may do so in the future, although we continue to service loans once they are sold.
From time to time, although infrequent, we may purchase commercial real estate loan participations in which we are not the lead lender. In these circumstances, we follow our customary loan underwriting and approval policies. We also have participated out portions of commercial and commercial real estate loans that exceeded our loans-to-one borrower legal lending limit and for purposes of risk diversification.
In recent years, the Bank has purchased broadly-diversified pools of essentially homogenous loans from originators outside of the Bank’s market area. These originators generally specialize in loan types, such as consumer loans, other than those loan types that the Bank specializes in. These loans, which are generally relatively short in duration, are acquired to provide supplementary interest income as well as to provide improvements to the Bank’s overall asset/liability mix, particularly with respect to interest rate risk. Third
-  -


party-originated loan pools are acquired primarily when, in the view of management, they offer superior risk vs. return characteristics to debt securities. Such loans are generally acquired through the facilitation of third-party brokerages and are serviced in perpetuity by the originating entries or their designees. Funding for loan purchases of this type is generally obtained through incremental usage of brokered deposits and/or other forms of borrowed funds. The Bank intends to purchase similar pools of loans on an occasional basis in the future if and when management believes that it is economically advantageous to do so.
 At December 31, 2022 the Bank held fifteen pools of loans originated by eleven unaffiliated third-party lenders with an aggregate amortized historical cost of $115.2 million. Of this total, $94.9 million in aggregate amortized historical cost relates to six loan pools acquired either in the fourth quarter of 2020 or during 2021, $19.9 million in aggregate amortized historical cost relates to seven loan pools acquired in 2019, and $400,000 in aggregate amortized historical cost relates to two loan pools acquired prior to 2019. Purchased loans have certain credit risk profiles distinct from those of the Bank’s self-originated portfolio, most especially the portion of the purchased loans that are classified as unsecured consumer loans. At December 31, 2022, the Bank held $32.0 million (three pools), $4.2 million (three pools), $6.0 million (one pool), and $3.9 million (one pool), in purchased pooled loans secured by consumer installment contracts, automobiles, home equity lines of credit and residential real estate, respectively. The Bank also held $26.4 million (two pools) in purchased secured commercial lines of credit. In addition, the Bank held $40.6 million (four pools) in purchased unsecured consumer loans and $2.1 million (one pool) in commercial installment loans at December 31, 2022. The loans within these pools have performed substantially as anticipated since their acquisition dates and, in many cases, have contractually-specified credit enhancement provisions provided by the Sellers that continue to reduce the Bank’s realized and potential credit exposures with respect to these loan pools. Nonperforming and delinquent loans within these loan pools are reported on an aggregate basis as components of the Bank’s overall loan performance statistics at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively.
 
The purchased pools of loans were subject to prepurchase analyses led by a team of the Bank’s senior executives and credit analysts. In each case, the Bank’s analytical processes considered the types of loans being evaluated, the underwriting criteria employed by the originating entity, the historical performance of such loans, especially in the most recent deeply recessionary environments, the collateral enhancements and other credit loss mitigation factors offered by the seller and the capabilities and financial stability of the servicing entities involved. In the view of management, from a credit risk perspective, these loan pools also benefit from broad diversification, including wide geographic dispersion, the readily-verifiable historical performance of similar loans issued by the originators, as well as the overall experience and skill of the underwriters and servicing entities involved as counterparties to the Bank in these transactions. In addition, these loan pools generally have significant underlying loan collateral and/or one or more of the following forms of credit enhancement: (1) contractual rights of loan substitution in the event of individual loan defaults, (2) retention of a portion of the principal amount of each loan by the seller, or (3) contractually-specified credit enhancement reserves accumulated from the collected cash flows generated by borrowers’ repayment activities in excess of those cash flows due to the Bank. Management believes that the substantial level of diversification within these loan pools and the presence of other mitigation factors, specific to each of the acquired pools in varying degrees, provides significant overall reduction of the potential credit risks inherent in these purchases. The performance of all purchased loan pools are monitored regularly from detailed reports and remittance reconciliations provided at least monthly by the servicing entities. 
Loan Approval Procedures and Authority
 The Bank’s lending activities follow written, non-discriminatory underwriting standards and loan origination procedures established by management and the Board of Directors. Our policies are designed to provide loan officers with guidelines on acceptable levels of risk, given a broad range of factors. The loan approval process is intended to assess the borrower’s ability to repay the loan, the viability of the loan and the adequacy of the value of the collateral that will secure the loan, if applicable.
The Board of Directors grants loan officers individual lending authority to approve extensions of credit. The level of authority for loan officers varies based upon the loan type, total relationship, form of collateral and risk rating of the borrower. Each loan officer is charged with the responsibility of achieving high credit standards. Individual lending authority can be increased, suspended or removed by the Board of Directors, as recommended by the President or Executive Vice President and Chief Banking Officer.
If a loan is in excess of any individual loan officer’s lending authority, the extension of credit must be referred to the Officer Loan Committee (“OLC”). The OLC is comprised of the President (serving as chairman), the Executive Vice President and Chief Banking Officer (serving as chair in the absence of the President), the Executive Vice President, Chief Operating Officer, as well as other members of the management team and retail and commercial lenders as may be appointed by the President. The OLC has authority to approve all commercial loans, and one-to-four family residential real estate loans where the total related credit is $1.2 million or less which are not within the lenders’ individual authority. In addition, the OLC may approve all municipal loans, where the total related credit is $2.5 million or less, and the individual loan amount is $2.5 million or less for rated municipal loans, and $1.5 million for unrated credits. The OLC has the authority to approve all consumer loans where the total related credit is $2.5 million or less and the individual loan amount is $200,000 for unsecured loans or $750,000 for secured loans. The Directors Loan Committee, which consists of members of the Bank’s Board of Directors, must approve all extensions of credit in excess of the limits for the OLC and lenders' individual authority.

Loans to One Borrower
 Under New York law, New York commercial banks are subject to loans-to-one borrower limits, which are substantially similar as those applicable to national banks, which generally restrict loans to one borrower to an amount equal to 15% of unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus, which was $22.4 million at December 31, 2022, on an unsecured basis, and an additional amount equal to 10% of unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus, which was $14.9 million at December 31, 2022, if the loan is secured by readily marketable collateral (generally, financial instruments and bullion, but not real estate), subject to exceptions.

Additionally, our internal loan policies limit the total related credit to be extended to any one borrower (after application of the rules of attribution), with respect to any and all loans with the Bank to 10% of Tier 1 and 2 capital, subject to certain exceptions. The indebtedness includes all credit exposure whether direct or contingent, used or unused.
 
 ASSET QUALITY
 Loan Delinquencies and Collection Procedures
 When a loan becomes delinquent, we make attempts to contact the borrower to determine the cause of the delayed payments and seek a solution to permit the loan to be brought current within a reasonable period of time. The outcome can vary with each individual borrower. In the case of mortgage loans and consumer loans, a late notice is sent 15 days after an account becomes delinquent. If delinquency persists, notices are sent at the 30 day delinquency mark, the 45 day delinquency mark and the 60 day delinquency mark. We also attempt to establish telephone contact with the borrower early on in the process. In the case of residential mortgage loans, included in every late notice is a letter that includes information regarding home-ownership counseling. As part of a workout agreement, we will accept partial payments during the month in order to bring the account current. If attempts to reach an agreement are unsuccessful and the customer is unable to comply with the terms of the workout agreement, we will review the account to determine if foreclosure is warranted, in which case, consistent with New York law, we send a 90 day notice of foreclosure and then a 30 day notice before legal proceedings are commenced. A consumer final demand letter is sent in the case of a consumer loan. In the case of commercial loans and commercial mortgage loans, we follow a similar notification practice with the exception of the previously mentioned information on home-ownership counseling. In addition, commercial loans do not require 90 day notices of foreclosure. Generally, commercial borrowers only receive 10 day notices before legal proceedings can be commenced. Commercial loans may experience longer workout times that may trigger a need for a loan modification that could meet the requirements of a troubled debt restructured loan.
Impaired Loans, Non-performing Loans and Troubled Debt Restructurings
 The policy of the Bank is to provide a continuous assessment of the quality of its loan portfolio through the maintenance of an internal and external loan review process. The process incorporates a loan risk grading system designed to recognize degrees of risk on individual commercial and mortgage loans in the portfolio. Management is responsible for monitoring of asset quality and risk grade designations, which are communicated to the board on a regular basis.
We generally cease accruing interest on our loans when contractual payments of principal or interest have become 90 days past due or management has serious doubts about further collectability of principal or interest, even though the loan is currently performing. A loan may remain on accrual status if it is in the process of collection and is either guaranteed or well secured. When a loan is placed on non-accrual status, unpaid interest credited to income is reversed. Interest received on non-accrual loans generally is applied against principal or interest if it is recognized on the cash basis method. Generally, loans are restored to accrual status when the obligation is brought current, has performed in accordance with the contractual terms for a reasonable period of time, generally for a minimum of six months, and the ultimate collectability of the total contractual principal and interest is no longer in doubt.
Our Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses policy (“ALLL”) establishes criteria for selecting loans to be measured for impairment based on the following:
 Residential and Consumer Loans:
•All loans rated substandard or worse, on nonaccrual, and above our total related credit (“TRC”) threshold balance of $300,000. 
 •All Troubled Debt Restructured Loans 
 Commercial Lines and Loans, Commercial Real Estate and Tax-exempt loans:
•All loans rated substandard or worse, on nonaccrual, and above our TRC threshold balance of $100,000.
 •All Troubled Debt Restructured Loans 
 -  -


Impairment is measured by determining the present value of expected future cash flows or, for collateral-dependent loans, the fair value of the collateral adjusted for market conditions and selling expenses as compared to the loan carrying value.
Troubled Debt Restructurings (“TDR”)
 TDRs are loan restructurings in which we, for economic or legal reasons related to an existing borrower’s financial difficulties, grant a concession to the debtor that we would not otherwise consider. Typically, a troubled debt restructuring involves a modification of terms of debt, such as reduction of the stated interest rate for the remaining original life of the debt, extension of the maturity date at a stated interest rate lower than the current market rate for new debt with similar risk, reduction of the face amount of the debt, or reduction of accrued interest. We consider modifications only after analyzing the borrower’s current repayment capacity, evaluating the strength of any guarantors based on documented current financial information, and assessing the current value of any collateral pledged. These modifications are made only when there is a reasonable and attainable workout plan that has been agreed to by the borrower and that is in our best interests.
Loans on non-accrual status at the date of modification are initially classified as non-accrual troubled debt restructurings. Our policy provides that troubled debt restructured loans are returned to accrual status after a period of satisfactory and reasonable future payment performance under the terms of the restructuring. Satisfactory payment performance is generally no less than six consecutive months of timely payments and demonstrated ability to continue to repay.
Foreclosed real estate
 Fair values for foreclosed real estate are initially recorded based on market value evaluations by third parties, less costs to sell (“initial cost basis”). Any write-downs required when the related loan receivable is exchanged for the underlying real estate collateral at the time of transfer to foreclosed real estate are charged to the allowance for loan losses. Values are derived from appraisals of underlying collateral or discounted cash flow analysis. Subsequent to foreclosure, valuations are updated periodically and assets are marked to current fair value, not to exceed the initial cost basis. In the determination of fair value subsequent to foreclosure, management also considers other factors or recent developments, such as, changes in absorption rates and market conditions from the time of valuation, and anticipated sales values considering management’s plans for disposition. Either change could result in adjustment to lower the property value estimates indicated in the appraisals.
 Loan delinquencies together with properties within our Foreclosed Real Estate portfolio are reviewed monthly by the Board of Directors.
 Classified Assets
 Federal regulations provide for the classification of loans and other assets, such as debt and equity securities considered by the FDIC to be of lesser quality, as “substandard,” “doubtful” or “loss.” An asset is considered “substandard” if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. “Substandard” assets include those characterized by the “distinct possibility” that the insured institution will sustain “some loss” if the deficiencies are not corrected. Assets classified as “doubtful” have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified “substandard,” with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make “collection or liquidation in full,” on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, “highly questionable and improbable.” Assets classified as “loss” are those considered “uncollectible” and of such little value that their continuance as assets without the establishment of a specific allowance for loan losses is not warranted. Assets that do not currently expose the insured institution to sufficient risk to warrant classification in one of the aforementioned categories but possess weaknesses are designated as “special mention” by our management.
 When an insured institution classifies problem assets as either substandard or doubtful, it may establish general allowances in an amount deemed prudent by management to cover losses that are both probable and reasonable to estimate. General allowances represent allowances which have been established to cover accrued losses associated with lending activities that are both probable and reasonable to estimate, but which, unlike specific allowances, have not been allocated to particular problem assets. When an insured institution classifies problem assets as “loss,” it is required either to establish a specific allowance for losses equal to 100% of that portion of the asset so classified or to charge-off such amount. An institution’s determination as to the classification of its assets and the amount of its valuation allowances is subject to review by the regulatory authorities, which may require the establishment of additional general or specific allowances.
 In connection with the filing of our periodic regulatory reports and in accordance with our classification of assets policy, we continuously assess the quality of our loan portfolio and we regularly review the loans in our loan portfolio to determine whether any loans require classification in accordance with applicable regulations. Loans are listed on the “watch list” initially because of emerging financial weaknesses even though the loan is currently performing in accordance with its terms, or delinquency status, or if the loan possesses weaknesses although currently performing. Management reviews the status of our loan portfolio delinquencies, by loan types, with the full Board of Directors on a monthly basis. Individual classified loan relationships are discussed as warranted. If a loan deteriorates in
-  -


asset quality, the classification is changed to “special mention,” “substandard,” “doubtful” or “loss” depending on the circumstances and the evaluation. Generally, loans 90 days or more past due are placed on nonaccrual status and classified “substandard.”
We also employ a risk grading system for our loans to help assure that we are not taking unnecessary and/or unmanageable risk. The primary objective of the loan risk grading system is to establish a method of assessing credit risk to further enable management to measure loan portfolio quality and the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. Further, we contract with an external loan review firm to complete a credit risk assessment of the loan portfolio on a regular basis to help determine the current level and direction of our credit risk. The external loan review firm communicates the results of their findings to the Directors Loan Committee in writing and by periodically attending the Directors Loan Committee meetings. Any material issues discovered in an external loan review are also communicated immediately to the President of the Bank. See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for further details on the Company’s credit quality indicators that define our risk grading system.
 Allowance for Loan Losses
 The allowance for loan losses represents management’s estimate of losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the date of the statement of condition and it is recorded as a reduction of loans. The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level considered adequate to provide for losses that can be reasonably anticipated. Management performs a quarterly evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance. The allowance is increased by the provision for loan losses, and decreased by charge-offs, net of recoveries. Loans deemed to be uncollectible are charged against the allowance for loan losses, and subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. All or part of the principal balance of loans receivable are charged off to the allowance as soon as it is determined that the repayment of all or part of the principal balance is highly unlikely. Non-residential consumer loans are generally charged off no later than 120 days past due on a contractual basis, unless productive collection efforts are providing results. Consumer loans may be charged off earlier in the event of bankruptcy, or if there is an amount that is deemed uncollectible. No portion of the allowance for loan losses is restricted to any individual loan type and the entire allowance is available to absorb any and all loan losses.
 The allowance is based on three major components which are: (i) specific components for impaired loans, (ii) recent historical losses and several qualitative factors applied to a general pool of loans, and (iii) an unallocated component.
The first component is the specific allowance that relates to loans that are classified as impaired. For these loans, an allowance is established when the discounted cash flows or collateral value of the impaired loan are lower than the carrying value of the loan. A loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Impairment is measured by either the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate or the fair value of the underlying collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. The majority of our loans utilize the fair value of the underlying collateral. Factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status, collateral value and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due. Loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired. Management determines the significance of payment delays and shortfalls on a case-by case basis, taking into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower, including the length and reason for the delay, the borrower’s prior payment record and the amount of shortfall in relation to what is owed.
The second component is the general allowance which covers pools of loans, by loan class, not considered impaired, smaller balance homogenous loans, such as residential real estate, home equity and other consumer loans. These pools of loans are evaluated for loss exposure based on historical loss rates for each of these categories of loans. The ratio of net charge-offs to loans outstanding within each loan class over the most recent eight quarters, lagged by one quarter, is used to generate the historical loss rates.
In addition, qualitative factors are added to the historical loss rates in arriving at the total allowance for loan losses needed for this general pool of loans. The qualitative factors include changes in national and local economic trends, the rate of growth in the portfolio, trends of delinquencies and nonaccrual balances, changes in loan policy, and changes in lending management experience and related staffing. Each factor is assigned a value to reflect improving, stable or declining conditions based on management’s best judgment using relevant information available at the time of the evaluation. These qualitative factors, applied to each product class, make the evaluation inherently subjective, as it requires material estimates that may be susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available.
 The third component may consist of an unallocated allowance which is maintained to cover uncertainties that could affect management’s estimate of probable losses. The unallocated component of the allowance, when present, reflects an additional margin for potential imprecision inherent in the underlying assumptions used in the methodologies for estimating specific and general losses in the portfolio. This component would typically be appropriate in times of significant economic dislocations or uncertainties in either, or both, the local and national economies. The unallocated allowance generally comprises less than 10% of the total allowance for loan losses and can be as little as 0% of total allowance.

When a loan is determined to be impaired, we will reevaluate the collateral which secures the loan. For real estate loans, we will obtain a new appraisal or broker’s opinion, whichever is considered to provide the most accurate value in the event of sale. An evaluation of equipment held as collateral will be obtained from an independent firm able to provide such an evaluation. Collateral will be inspected not less than annually for all impaired loans and will be reevaluated not less than every two years. Appraised values are discounted to arrive at the estimated selling price of the collateral, which is considered to be the estimated fair value. The discounts also include estimated costs to sell the property. For commercial and industrial loans secured by non-real estate collateral, such as accounts receivable, inventory and equipment, estimated fair values are determined based on the borrower’s financial statements, inventory reports, accounts receivable agings or equipment appraisals or invoices. Indications of value from these sources are generally discounted based on the age of the financial information or the quality of the assets.
 Large groups of homogeneous loans, including purchased loans, are evaluated for impairment in the aggregate. Accordingly, we do not separately identify individual residential mortgage loans with outstanding principal balances less than $300,000, home equity and other consumer loans for impairment disclosures. We make exceptions to this general rule when such loans are (1) rated substandard or worse, on nonaccrual status and are related to borrowers with total related credit exposure in excess of our threshold balance of $300,000; or (2) the loans are subject to a troubled debt restructuring agreement. The projected credit losses related to purchased loan pools are evaluated prior to purchase and the performance of those loans against expectations are analyzed at least monthly. Over the life of the purchased loan pools, the allowance for loan losses is adjusted, through the provision for loan losses, for expected loss experience, over the projected life of the loans. The expected credit loss experience is determined at the time of purchase and is modified, to the extent necessary, during the life of the purchased loan pools. The Bank does not initially increase the allowance for loan losses on the purchase date of the loan pools.
In addition, the FDIC and NYSDFS, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination, which may not be currently available to management. Based on management’s comprehensive analysis of the loan portfolio, we believe the current level of the allowance for loan losses is adequate.
 INVESTMENT AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES
 Our investment policy is established by the Board of Directors. Our investment policy dictates that investment decisions will be made based on the safety of the investment, liquidity requirements, potential returns, cash flow targets, and consistency with our interest rate risk management objectives. The Asset Liability Management Committee (the “ALCO”) of the Board of Directors acts in the capacity of an investment committee and is responsible for overseeing our investment program and evaluating on an ongoing basis our investment policy and objectives. Our President, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer have the authority to purchase and sell securities within specific guidelines established by the investment policy. All transactions are reviewed by the Board of Directors at its regular meetings.
 The general objectives of the investment securities portfolio are to assist in the overall interest rate risk management of the Bank, while generating a reasonable rate of return consistent with the risk of purchased principal, provide a source of liquidity, and reduce our overall credit risk profile. We also purchase securities to provide necessary liquidity for day-to-day operations and when investable funds exceed loan demand, as well as to provide highly liquid assets under collateralization arrangements related to municipal deposits. The effect that the proposed security purchase would have on our overall credit and interest rate risk profile and our risk-based equity ratios is also considered in evaluating the timing, mix and characteristics of investment security purchases.
All investment securities purchased/held must meet regulatory guidelines and be permissible bank investments. Our investment securities include a broad range of debt securities issued by the United States Government and its agencies and sponsored enterprises, state and municipal governments and agencies, and corporations. The Company also invests in mortgage‑backed securities issued or guaranteed by United States Government sponsored enterprises, collateralized mortgage obligations and similar debt securities issued by both government sponsored entities and private (non-governmental) issuers, and asset-backed securities that are generally issued by private entities. The Company invests primarily in debt securities but will from time to time also invest, within certain regulatory limits, in mutual funds and equity securities.
All securities purchased are classified at the time of purchase as either held-to-maturity or available-for-sale. We do not maintain a trading account. Securities purchased with the intent and ability to hold until maturity will be classified as held-to-maturity. Securities placed in the held-to-maturity category will be accounted for at amortized cost.
Securities that do not qualify or are not categorized as held-to-maturity are classified as available-for-sale. This classification includes securities that may be sold in response to changes in interest rates, the security's prepayment risk, liquidity needs, the availability of and the yield on alternative investments, and funding sources and terms. These securities are reported at fair value, which is determined on
-  -


a monthly basis. Unrealized gains and losses are reported as a separate component of capital, net of tax. The aggregate change in value of the portfolio is reported to the Board of Directors monthly.
 The composition of the investment portfolio is substantially the same for securities classified as both held-to-maturity and available-for-sale, although the portion of the securities portfolio classified as available-for-sale generally has a higher concentration of shorter-term, and/or more liquid assets. Such securities are held as part of the Bank’s liquidity management programs. The Bank holds a significant portion of its investment securities in mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations (many, but not all of which are issued by government-sponsored enterprises) and direct federal government and federal agency obligations. Federal agency issuers include the Federal Farm Credit Bank, Federal Home Loan Bank, Federal National Mortgage Association (“Fannie Mae”), Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (“Freddie Mac”) and the Government National Mortgage Association (“Ginnie Mae”), among others. For a discussion on mortgage backed securities, see “Mortgage-Backed Securities and Collateralized Mortgage Obligations.”
 As part of our membership in the FHLBNY, we are required to maintain a dividend-earning investment in FHLBNY stock. This investment is classified separately from securities due to significant restrictions on sale or transfer of the stock. For further information regarding our securities portfolio, see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements.
 MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES AND COLLATERALIZED MORTGAGE OBLIGATIONS
 We purchase mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations guaranteed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae. In recent years, the Bank has also increased the level of its investments in mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations issued by private entities. These securities are generally senior tranches, and most often the most senior tranche of multi-class issuances that provide substantial credit enhancements to their senior tranches and therefore reasonable, but not absolute, protection for the Bank from the risks of default. We invest in mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations to achieve positive interest rate spreads with minimal administrative expense, and to lower our credit risk through geographic diversification. These securities are generally relatively short in duration and therefore reduce the Bank’s sensitivity to changes in interest rates. All privately issued mortgage-backed securities held by the Bank at December 31, 2022 were either rated at or above the lowest investment grade for credit quality by a nationally-recognized statistical rating organization (a “NRSRO”) or were the most senior tranches of securitizations that were not rated by a NRSRO at the time of the securities’ issuance. We regularly monitor the credit quality of this portfolio. At December 31, 2022, no securities held by the Bank in this category had been downgraded by a NRSRO.
Mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations are created by pooling mortgages and issuing a security with an interest rate which is less than the interest rate on the underlying mortgages. These securities typically represent a participation interest in a pool of single- or multi-family mortgages and certain types of commercial real estate loans, although we generally focus our investments on mortgage related securities backed by one-to-four family real estate loans. The issuers of such securities pool and resell the participation interests in the form of securities to investors such as the Bank, and in the case of government agency sponsored issues, guarantee the payment of principal and interest to investors. Mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations generally yield less than the loans that underlie such securities because of the cost of payment guarantees, if any, and credit enhancements. These securities, which are most often fixed-rate, are usually substantially more liquid than individual mortgage loans.
 Investments in collateralized mortgage obligations involve a risk that actual prepayments may differ from estimated prepayments over the life of the security, which may require adjustments to the amortization of any premium or accretion of any discount relating to such instruments, thereby changing the net yield on such securities. There is also reinvestment risk associated with the cash flows from such securities or if such securities are redeemed by the issuer. In addition, the market value of such securities may be adversely affected in a rising interest rate environment, particularly since vast majority our collateralized mortgage obligations have a fixed rate of interest. The relatively short weighted average remaining life of our collateralized mortgage obligation portfolio mitigates our potential risk of loss in a rising interest rate environment.
 ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES
 We also purchase asset-backed securities issued by private entities. These securities typically represent a participation interest in a pool of non-mortgage loans. Asset-backed securities are created by pooling homogenous non-mortgage loans (such as unsecured consumer loans) and issuing a security with an interest rate which is less than the interest rate on the underlying loan notes. The issuers of such securities pool and resell the participation interests in the form of securities to investors such as the Bank. Asset-backed securities generally yield less than the loans that underlie such securities because of the cost of credit enhancements. These securities, which may be fixed or adjustable-rate are usually substantially more liquid than individual loans.
 
The securities of the type the Bank typically invests in are collateralized by consumer loans or commercial business trade receivables and are generally senior tranches of multi-class issuances. These tranches are offered with substantial credit enhancements and therefore reasonable, but not absolute, protection for the Company from the risks of default. We invest in asset-backed securities to achieve positive interest rate spreads with minimal administrative expense, and to lower our credit risk through geographical and asset-type
-  -


diversification. These securities are generally relatively short in duration and therefore reduce the Bank’s sensitivity to changes in interest rates. All asset-backed securities held by the Bank at December 31, 2022 were either rated at or above the lowest investment grade for credit quality by a NRSRO or were the most senior tranches of securitizations that were not rated by a NRSRO at the time of the securities’ issuance. We regularly monitor the underlying credit quality of this portfolio. At December 31, 2022, no securities held by the Bank in this category had been downgraded by a NRSRO.
 SOURCES OF FUNDS
 General
 Deposits have traditionally been our primary source of funds for use in lending and investment activities. We also rely on advances from the FHLBNY, the Certificates of Deposit Account Registry Service (“CDARS”) provided by an independent third-party, IntraFi Network, and other deposits acquired through unaffiliated third-party financial institutions as forms of brokered deposits. In addition to deposits and borrowings, we derive funds from scheduled loan payments, investment maturities, loan prepayments, retained earnings and income on interest-earning assets. While scheduled loan payments and income on interest-earning assets are relatively stable sources of funds, deposit inflows and outflows can vary widely and are influenced by prevailing market interest rates, economic conditions and competition from other financial institutions.
Deposits
 A majority of our depositors are persons or businesses who work, reside or operate in Oswego and Onondaga Counties. We offer a variety of deposits, including checking, savings, money market deposit accounts, and certificates of deposit. Deposit account terms vary, with the principal differences being the minimum balance required, the amount of time the funds must remain on deposit and the interest rate. We establish interest rates, maturity terms, service fees and withdrawal penalties on a periodic basis. Management determines the rates and terms based on rates paid by competitors, our need for funds or liquidity, overall growth goals and federal and state regulations. The flow of deposits is influenced significantly by general economic conditions, changes in interest rates and competition. The variety of deposit accounts that we offer allows us to be competitive in generating deposits and to respond with flexibility to changes in our customers’ demands. We believe that deposits are a stable source of funds, but our ability to attract and maintain deposits at favorable rates will be affected by market conditions, including competition and prevailing interest rates. In addition, the Bank holds municipal deposits, which have been a more seasonally volatile source of funds.
 The CDARS program is a form of a brokered deposit facility in which we have been a participant since 2009. In addition to offering depositors enhanced FDIC insurance coverage, being a participant in CDARS allows us to fund our balance sheet through the CDARS One-Way Buy program. This program uses a competitive bid process for available deposits, up to a varying amount that was approximately $50 million at any one weekly bidding session as of December 31, 2022, at specified terms. These deposits work well for us because of their weekly availability, coupled with their short term duration, which allows us to more closely mirror our funding needs. We believe this arrangement is a viable source of funding provided that we maintain our “well-capitalized” status. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for further details on our brokered deposits.
 In addition, from time to time, the Bank will acquire larger blocks of brokered deposits, outside of the CDARS program, that are obtained from unaffiliated third-party financial institutions. These brokered deposits generally have longer maturity dates than the CDARS deposits, can be acquired in more substantial block size, and generally have issuance rates similar to the CDARS program.

Brokered deposits are employed by the Bank’s management to supplement the funding that the Bank obtains from customer deposits and other borrowings, principally from the FHLBNY, and are used to increase the overall efficiency of the Bank’s funding mix. Management intends to continue to use brokered deposits in the future as an integral part of its overall funding strategies.

Borrowings
 The Bank has a number of existing credit facilities available to it. At December 31, 2022, the Bank had existing lines of credit at FHLBNY, the Federal Reserve Bank (“FRB”), and two other correspondent banks. We obtain advances primarily from the FHLBNY utilizing the common stock we own in the FHLBNY, qualifying residential mortgage loans held in portfolio, and certain investment securities as collateral provided certain standards related to creditworthiness are met. These advances are made pursuant to several credit programs, each of which has its own interest rate and range of maturities. FHLBNY advances are generally available to meet seasonal and other withdrawals of deposit accounts and to permit increased lending.
Subordinated Debt
 The Company has a non-consolidated subsidiary trust, Pathfinder Statutory Trust II, of which the Company owns 100% of the common equity. The Trust issued $5,000,000 of 30-year floating rate Company-obligated pooled capital securities of Pathfinder Statutory Trust II (“Floating-Rate Debentures”). The Company borrowed the proceeds of the capital securities from its subsidiary by issuing floating rate junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures having substantially similar terms. The capital securities mature in 2037 and are treated as Tier 1 capital by the FDIC and the Federal Reserve. The capital securities of the trust are a pooled trust preferred fund of Preferred Term Securities VI, Ltd., with interest rates that reset quarterly, and are indexed to the 3-month London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR)” plus 1.65%. These securities have a five-year call provision. The Company guarantees all of these securities.
 The United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”), the organization responsible for regulating LIBOR, ceased publishing LIBOR indices at the end of 2021. The Alternative Reference Rates Committee (the “ARRC”), formed by the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, had been charged with developing an alternative rate that replaced LIBOR in the United States (U.S. dollar-denominated LIBOR). The ARRC identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) as the rate that represents best practice for use in U.S. dollar-denominated LIBOR derivatives and other financial contracts. Accordingly, SOFR has currently replaced LIBOR in the substantial majority of contracts in which LIBOR was used. Management has analyzed the Company’s aggregate exposure to instruments that are indexed to LIBOR (including the Company’s acquired loan participations, fixed-income investments, hedging instruments and the Floating-Rate debt) and concluded that the adoption of SOFR will not materially impact the Company or the results of its operations.
The Company's equity interest in the trust subsidiary is included in other assets on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition at December 31, 2022 and 2021. For regulatory reporting purposes, the Federal Reserve Board has indicated that the preferred securities will continue to qualify as Tier 1 Capital subject to previously specified limitations, until further notice. If regulators make a determination that Trust Preferred Securities can no longer be considered in regulatory capital, the securities become callable and the Company may redeem them.
 On April 1, 2021 the Company redeemed its then currently-outstanding $10.0 million non-amortizing subordinated debt that was originally scheduled to mature on October 1, 2025. The Company had the right to prepay the Subordinated Debt at any time after October 15, 2020 without penalty. The terms of the Subordinated Debt required fixed interest payments at an annual interest rate of 6.25% after February 29, 2016 until the Loan’s scheduled maturity date. In the first quarter of 2021, the Company exercised its existing contractual option and issued a Notice of Redemption (“NOR”) to the holders of the 2015 Subordinated Debt, which was scheduled to mature on October 1, 2025. With the issuance of this NOR, the Company redeemed the $10.0 million 2015 Subordinated Debt, plus accrued interest on April 1, 2021. The redemption of this $10.0 million component of the Company’s outstanding subordinated debt prospectively reduced interest expense after April 1, 2021 by $625,000 annually. Interest expense, related to this borrowing, of $-0- and $156,000 was recorded in the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
On October 14, 2020, the Company executed a private placement of $25.0 million of its 5.50% Fixed to Floating Rate non-amortizing Subordinated Debt (the “2020 Subordinated Debt”) to certain qualified institutional buyers and accredited institutional investors. The 2020 Subordinated Debt has a maturity date of October 15, 2030 and initially bear interest, payable semi-annually, at a fixed annual rate of 5.50% per annum until October 15, 2025. Commencing on that date, the interest rate applicable to the outstanding principal amount due will be reset quarterly to an interest rate per annum equal to the then current three month SOFR plus 532 basis points, payable quarterly until maturity. The Company may redeem the 2020 Subordinated Debt at par, in whole or in part, at its option, any time after October 15, 2025 (the first redemption date). The 2020 Subordinated Debt is senior in the Company’s credit repayment hierarchy only to the Company’s common equity and, and any future senior indebtedness and is intended to qualify as Tier 2 capital for regulatory capital purposes for the Company. The Company paid $783,000 in origination and legal fees as part of this transaction. These fees will be amortized over the life of the 2020 Subordinated Debt through its first redemption date using the effective interest method, giving rise to an effective cost of funds of 6.22% from the issuance date calculated under this method. Accordingly, interest expense related to this transaction of $1.6 million and $1.5 million was recorded in the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

SUPERVISION AND REGULATION
 General
 Pathfinder Bank is a New York-chartered commercial bank and the Company is a Maryland corporation and a registered bank holding company. The Bank’s deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the FDIC. The Bank is subject to extensive regulation by NYSDFS, as its chartering agency, and by the FDIC, its primary federal regulator and deposit insurer. The Bank is required to file reports with, and is periodically examined by, the FDIC and the NYSDFS concerning its activities and financial condition and must obtain regulatory approvals prior to entering into certain transactions, including, but not limited to, mergers with or acquisitions of other financial institutions. As a registered bank holding company, the Company is regulated by the Federal Reserve Board.
The regulatory and supervisory structure establishes a comprehensive framework of activities in which an institution can engage and is intended primarily for the protection of depositors and the deposit insurance funds, rather than for the protection of shareholders and creditors. The regulatory structure also gives the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies, including policies concerning the establishment of deposit insurance assessment fees, classification of assets and establishment of adequate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes. Any change in such regulatory requirements and policies, whether by the New York State legislature, the NYSDFS, the FDIC, the Federal Reserve Board or the United States Congress, could have a material adverse impact on the financial condition and results of operations of the Company and the Bank.
Set forth below is a summary of certain material statutory and regulatory requirements applicable to the Company and the Bank. The summary is not intended to be a complete description of such statutes and regulations and their effects on the Company and the Bank.
The Dodd-Frank Act
 The Dodd-Frank Act significantly changed bank regulation and has affected the lending, investment, trading and operating activities of depository institutions and their holding companies. The Dodd-Frank Act created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau with extensive powers to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has broad rule-making authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws that apply to all banks and savings institutions, including the authority to prohibit “unfair, deceptive or abusive” acts and practices. Banks and savings institutions with $10 billion or less in assets, such as Pathfinder Bank, continue to be examined by their applicable federal bank regulators. The Dodd-Frank Act also gave state attorneys general the ability to enforce applicable federal consumer protection laws.
The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act of 2018 (the “EGRRCPA”)
 On May 24, 2018, the EGRRCPA was enacted, which repealed or modified certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and eased regulations on all financial institutions with the exception of the largest banks. The EGRRCPA’s provisions include, among other items: (i) exempting banks with less than $10 billion in assets from the ability-to-repay requirements for certain qualified residential mortgage loans held in portfolio; (ii) not requiring appraisals for certain transactions valued at less than $400,000 in rural areas; (iii) exempting banks that originate fewer than 500 open-end and 500 closed-end mortgages from HMDA’s expanded data disclosures; (iv) clarifying that, subject to various conditions, reciprocal deposits of another depository institution obtained using a deposit broker through a deposit placement network for purposes of obtaining maximum deposit insurance would not be considered brokered deposits subject to the FDIC’s brokered-deposit regulations; (v) raising eligibility for the 18-month exam cycle from $1 billion to banks with $3 billion in assets; and (vi) simplifying capital calculations by requiring regulators to establish for institutions under $10 billion in assets a community bank leverage ratio at a percentage not less than 8% and not greater than 10%; that such institutions may elect to replace the general applicable risk-based capital requirements for determining well-capitalized status. In addition, the law required the Federal Reserve Board to raise the asset threshold under its Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement from $1 billion to $3 billion for bank or savings and loan holding companies that are exempt from consolidated capital requirements, provided that such companies meet certain other conditions such as not engaging in significant nonbanking activities.
 New York Bank Regulation
Pathfinder Bank derives its lending, investment, branching and other authority primarily from the applicable provisions of New York State Banking Law and the regulations of the NYSDFS, as limited by federal laws and regulations. Under these laws and regulations, commercial banks, including Pathfinder Bank, may invest in real estate mortgages, consumer and commercial loans, certain types of debt securities, including certain corporate debt securities and obligations of federal, state and local governments and agencies, certain types of corporate equity securities and certain other assets. Under the statutory authority for investing in equity securities, a bank may invest up to 2% of its assets or 20% of its capital, whichever is less in exchange-registered corporate stock. Investment in the stock of a single corporation is limited to the lesser of 1% of the bank’s assets or 15% of the Bank’s capital. The Bank’s authority to invest in equity securities is constrained by federal law, as explained later. Such equity securities must meet certain earnings ratios and other tests of financial performance. A bank may also exercise trust powers upon approval of the NYSDFS. Pathfinder Bank does not presently have trust powers.
 -  -


New York State chartered banks may also invest in subsidiaries. A bank may use this power to invest in corporations that engage in various activities authorized for banks, plus any additional activities that may be authorized by the NYSDFS.
Furthermore, New York banking regulations impose requirements on loans which a bank may make to its executive officers and directors and to certain corporations or partnerships in which such persons have equity interests. These requirements include that (i) certain loans must be approved in advance by a majority of the entire Board of Directors and the interested party must abstain from participating directly or indirectly in voting on such loan, (ii) the loan must be on terms that are not more favorable than those offered to unaffiliated third parties, and (iii) the loan must not involve more than a normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features.
 Under the New York State Banking Law, the Superintendent may issue an order to a New York State chartered banking institution to appear and explain an apparent violation of law, to discontinue unauthorized or unsafe practices and to keep prescribed books and accounts. Upon a finding by the NYSDFS that any director, trustee or officer of any banking organization has violated any law, or has continued unauthorized or unsafe practices in conducting the business of the banking organization after having been notified by the Superintendent to discontinue such practices, such director, trustee or officer may be removed from office after notice and an opportunity to be heard. The Bank does not know of any past or current practice, condition or violation that may lead to any proceeding by the Superintendent or the NYSDFS against the Bank or any of its directors or officers.
New York State Community Reinvestment Regulation
Pathfinder Bank is also subject to provisions of the New York State Banking Law which imposes continuing and affirmative obligations upon banking institutions organized in New York State to serve the credit needs of its local community (“NYCRA”) which are substantially similar to those imposed by the Federal Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”). Pursuant to the NYCRA, a bank must file copies of all federal CRA reports with the NYSDFS. The NYCRA requires the NYSDFS to make a written assessment of a bank’s compliance with the NYCRA every 24 to 36 months, utilizing a four-tiered rating system and make such assessment available to the public. The NYCRA also requires the Superintendent to consider a bank’s NYCRA rating when reviewing a bank’s application to engage in certain transactions, including mergers, asset purchases and the establishment of branch offices or automated teller machines, and provides that such assessment may serve as a basis for the denial of any such application. Pathfinder Bank’s NYCRA most recent rating, dated September 30, 2021, was “satisfactory.”
Federal Regulations
 Capital Requirements.  Federal regulations require federally insured depository institutions to meet several minimum capital standards: a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 6.0%, a total capital to risk-based assets of 8.0%, and a 4.0% Tier 1 capital to total assets leverage ratio.
In determining the amount of risk-weighted assets for purposes of calculating risk-based capital ratios, all assets, including certain off-balance sheet assets (e.g., recourse obligations, direct credit substitutes, residual interests) are multiplied by a risk weight factor assigned by the regulations based on the risks believed inherent in the type of asset. Higher levels of capital are required for asset categories believed to present greater risk. Common equity Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common stockholders’ equity and retained earnings. Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common equity Tier 1 and additional Tier 1 capital. Additional Tier 1 capital includes certain noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries. Total capital includes Tier 1 capital (common equity Tier 1 capital plus additional Tier 1 capital) and Tier 2 capital. Tier 2 capital is comprised of capital instruments and related surplus, meeting specified requirements, and may include cumulative preferred stock and long-term perpetual preferred stock, mandatory convertible securities, intermediate preferred stock and subordinated debt. Also included in Tier 2 capital is the allowance for loan and lease losses limited to a maximum of 1.25% of risk-weighted assets and, for institutions that have exercised an opt-out election regarding the treatment of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, up to 45% of net unrealized gains on available-for-sale equity securities with readily determinable fair market values. Pathfinder Bank exercised the opt-out election. Calculation of all types of regulatory capital is subject to deductions and adjustments specified in the regulations. In assessing an institution’s capital adequacy, regulators take into consideration, not only these numeric factors, but qualitative factors as well, and has the authority to establish higher capital requirements for individual institutions when and where deemed necessary.
 In addition to establishing the minimum regulatory capital requirements, the regulations limit capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments to management personnel if the institution does not hold a “capital conservation buffer” consisting of 2.5% of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets above the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements. Notwithstanding the foregoing, pursuant to the EGRRCPA, the FDIC finalized a rule that established a community bank leverage ratio (“CBLR”). The CBLR (Tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets) was established at 9% for institutions under $10 billion in assets and such institutions may elect to utilize the CBLR threshold level of capital in lieu of the generally-applicable risk-based capital requirements under Basel III. Such institutions that meet the CBLR threshold and certain other qualifying criteria will automatically be deemed to be well-capitalized. The new rule took effect on January 1, 2020. Pursuant to the CARES Act, the federal banking agencies issued final rules to set the Community Bank Leverage Ratio at 8% beginning in the second quarter of 2020 through
-  -


the end of 2020. Beginning in 2021, the Community Bank Leverage Ratio increased to 8.5% for the calendar year. On January 1, 2022, the Community Bank Leverage Ratio requirement returned to 9%. A financial institution can elect to be subject to this new definition. The Bank did not elect to become subject to the Community Bank Leverage Ratio.
Standards for Safety and Soundness. As required by statute, the federal banking agencies have adopted final regulations and Interagency Guidelines Establishing Standards for Safety and Soundness to implement safety and soundness standards. The guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards that the federal banking agencies use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired. The guidelines address internal controls and information systems, internal audit systems, credit underwriting, loan documentation, interest rate exposure, asset growth, asset quality, earnings, compensation, fees and benefits and, more recently, safeguarding customer information. If the appropriate federal banking agency determines that an institution fails to meet any standard prescribed by the guidelines, the agency may require the institution to submit to the agency an acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the standard.
Business and Investment Activities. Under federal law, all state-chartered FDIC-insured banks, including commercial banks, have been limited in their activities as principal and in their equity investments to the type and the amount authorized for national banks, notwithstanding state law. Federal law permits certain exceptions to these limitations.
The FDIC is also authorized to permit state banks to engage in state authorized activities or investments not permissible for national banks (other than non-subsidiary equity investments) if they meet all applicable capital requirements and it is determined that such activities or investments do not pose a significant risk to the FDIC insurance fund. The FDIC has adopted regulations governing the procedures for institutions seeking approval to engage in such activities or investments. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 specified that a state bank may control a subsidiary that engages in activities as principal that would only be permitted for a national bank to conduct in a “financial subsidiary,” if a bank meets specified conditions and deducts its investment in the subsidiary for regulatory capital purposes.
Prompt Corrective Regulatory Action. Federal law requires, among other things, that federal bank regulatory authorities take “prompt corrective action” with respect to banks that do not meet minimum capital requirements. For these purposes, the law establishes five capital categories: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized.
An institution is deemed to be “well capitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, a leverage ratio of 5.0% or greater and a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 6.5% or greater. An institution is “adequately capitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0% or greater, a leverage ratio of 4.0% or greater and a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 4.5% or greater. An institution is “undercapitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 8.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a leverage ratio of less than 4.0% or a common equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 4.5%. An institution is deemed to be “significantly undercapitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.0%, a leverage ratio of less than 3.0% or a common equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 3.0%. An institution is considered to be “critically undercapitalized” if it has a ratio of tangible equity (as defined in the regulations) to total assets that is equal to or less than 2.0%.
 “Undercapitalized” banks must adhere to growth, capital distribution (including dividend) and other limitations and are required to submit a capital restoration plan. A bank’s compliance with such a plan must be guaranteed by any company that controls the undercapitalized institution in an amount equal to the lesser of 5% of the institution’s total assets when deemed undercapitalized or the amount necessary to achieve the status of adequately capitalized. If an “undercapitalized” bank fails to submit an acceptable plan, it is treated as if it is “significantly undercapitalized.” “Significantly undercapitalized” banks must comply with one or more of a number of additional measures, including, but not limited to, a required sale of sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized, a requirement to reduce total assets, cessation of taking deposits from correspondent banks, the dismissal of directors or officers and restrictions on interest rates paid on deposits, compensation of executive officers and capital distributions by the parent holding company. “Critically undercapitalized” institutions are subject to additional measures including, subject to a narrow exception, the appointment of a receiver or conservator within 270 days after being designated “critically undercapitalized.”
At December 31, 2022, Pathfinder Bank was well-capitalized.
Transactions with Related Parties. Transactions between a bank (and, generally, its subsidiaries) and its related parties or affiliates are limited by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act. An affiliate of a bank is any company or entity that controls, is controlled by or is under common control with the bank. In a holding company context, the parent bank holding company (“BHC”) and any companies which are controlled by such parent holding company are affiliates of the bank. Generally, Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act limit the extent to which the bank or its subsidiaries may engage in “covered transactions” with any one affiliate to 10% of such institution’s capital stock and surplus and contain an aggregate limit on all such transactions with all affiliates to an amount
-  -


equal to 20% of such institution’s capital stock and surplus. The term “covered transaction” includes the making of loans, purchase of assets, issuance of a guarantee and similar transactions.
In addition, loans or other extensions of credit by the institution to the affiliate are required to be collateralized in accordance with specified requirements. The law also requires that affiliate transactions be on terms and conditions that are substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the institution, as those provided to non-affiliates.
 Pathfinder Bank’s authority to extend credit to its directors, executive officers and 10% shareholders, as well as to entities controlled by such persons, is currently governed by the requirements of Sections 22(g) and 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation O of the Federal Reserve Board. Among other things, these provisions generally require that extensions of credit to insiders:
 •be made on terms that are substantially the same as, and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than, those prevailing for comparable transactions with unaffiliated persons and that do not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features; and
 •not exceed certain limitations on the amount of credit extended to such persons, individually and in the aggregate, which limits are based, in part, on the amount of Pathfinder Bank’s capital.
 In addition, extensions of credit in excess of certain limits must be approved by Pathfinder Bank’s Board of Directors. Extensions of credit to executive officers are subject to additional limits based on the type of extension involved.
 Enforcement. The FDIC has extensive enforcement authority over insured state banks, including Pathfinder Bank. That enforcement authority includes, among other things, the ability to assess civil money penalties, issue cease and desist orders and remove directors and officers. In general, enforcement actions may be initiated in response to violations of laws and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices. The FDIC also has authority under federal law to appoint a conservator or receiver for an insured bank under certain circumstances. The FDIC is required, with certain exceptions, to appoint a receiver or conservator for an insured state non-member bank if the bank was “critically undercapitalized” on average during the calendar quarter beginning 270 days after the date on which the institution became “critically undercapitalized.”
Federal Insurance of Deposit Accounts. The Dodd-Frank Act permanently increased the maximum amount of deposit insurance for banks, savings institutions and credit unions to $250,000 per depositor.
The FDIC assesses insured depository institutions to maintain its Deposit Insurance Fund. Under the FDIC’s risk-based assessment system, institutions deemed less risky pay lower assessments. Assessments for institutions of less than $10 billion of assets are now based on financial measures and supervisory ratings derived from statistical modeling estimating the probability of failure of an institution’s failure within three years. Assessment rates for institutions of the Bank’s size ranged from 1.5 to 30 basis points effective through December 31, 2022. The FDIC has authority to increase insurance assessments and adopted a final rule in October 2022 to increase initial base deposit insurance assessment rates by two basis points beginning in the first quarterly assessment period of 2023. As a result, effective January 1, 2023, assessment rates for institutions of the Bank’s size will range from 2.5 to 32 basis points.
 Insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that an institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC. We do not currently know of any practice, condition or violation that may lead to termination of our deposit insurance.
Community Reinvestment Act. Under the CRA, a bank has a continuing and affirmative obligation, consistent with its safe and sound operation, to help meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low and moderate income neighborhoods. The CRA does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions nor does it limit an institution’s discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community. The CRA does require the FDIC, in connection with its examination of a bank, to assess the institution’s record of meeting the credit needs of its community and to take such record into account in its evaluation of certain applications by such institution, including applications to establish or acquire branches and merger with other depository institutions. The CRA requires the FDIC to provide a written evaluation of an institution’s CRA performance utilizing a four-tiered descriptive rating system. Pathfinder Bank’s latest FDIC CRA rating, dated May 13, 2019, was “satisfactory.”
Federal Reserve System. The Federal Reserve Board regulations require banks to maintain non-interest-earning reserves against their transaction accounts (primarily negotiable order of withdrawal (NOW) and regular checking accounts). In March 2020, due to a change in its approach to monetary policy due to COVID-19, the Federal Reserve Board announced an interim rule to amend Regulation D requirements and reduce reserve requirement ratios to zero. The Federal Reserve Board has indicated that it has no plans to re-impose reserve requirements, but may do so in the future if conditions warrant.
 -  -


Federal Home Loan Bank System. Pathfinder Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank System, which consists of eleven regional Federal Home Loan Banks. The Federal Home Loan Bank System provides a central credit facility primarily for member institutions as well as other entities involved in home mortgage lending. As a member of the FHLBNY, Pathfinder Bank is required to acquire and hold a specified amount of shares of capital stock in the FHLBNY. As of December 31, 2022, Pathfinder Bank was in compliance with this requirement.
 Other Regulations
 Interest and other charges collected or contracted for by Pathfinder Bank are subject to state usury laws and federal laws concerning interest rates. Pathfinder Bank’s operations are also subject to federal laws applicable to credit transactions, such as the:
•Truth-In-Lending Act, governing disclosures of credit terms to consumer borrowers;
 •Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, requiring that borrowers for mortgage loans for one-to-four family residential real estate receive various disclosures, including good faith estimates of settlement costs, lender servicing and escrow account practices, and prohibiting certain practices that increase the cost of settlement services;
 •The TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure Rule, commonly known as the TRID rule. This rule amended the Truth in Lending Act and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act to integrate several consumer disclosures for mortgage loans;
 •Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, requiring financial institutions to provide information to enable the public and public officials to determine whether a financial institution is fulfilling its obligation to help meet the housing needs of the community it serves;
 •Equal Credit Opportunity Act, prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, creed or other prohibited factors in extending credit;
 •Fair Credit Reporting Act, governing the use and provision of information to credit reporting agencies;
 •Fair Debt Collection Act, governing the manner in which consumer debts may be collected by collection agencies; 
 •Truth in Savings Act;
 •Rules and regulations of the various federal agencies charged with the responsibility of implementing such federal laws;
 •Right to Financial Privacy Act, which imposes a duty to maintain confidentiality of consumer financial records and prescribes procedures for complying with administrative subpoenas of financial records;
 •Electronic Funds Transfer Act and Regulation E promulgated thereunder, which govern automatic deposits to and withdrawals from deposit accounts and customers’ rights and liabilities arising from the use of automated teller machines and other electronic banking services;
 •Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act (also known as “Check 21”), which gives “substitute checks,” such as digital check images and copies made from that image, the same legal standing as the original paper check;
 •USA PATRIOT Act, which requires banks operating to, among other things, establish broadened anti-money laundering compliance programs, due diligence policies and controls to ensure the detection and reporting of money laundering. Such required compliance programs are intended to supplement existing compliance requirements, also applicable to financial institutions, under the Bank Secrecy Act and the Office of Foreign Assets Control regulations; and
 •Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which places limitations on the sharing of consumer financial information by financial institutions with unaffiliated third parties. Specifically, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act requires all financial institutions offering financial products or services to retail customers to provide such customers with the financial institution’s privacy policy and provide such customers the opportunity to “opt out” of the sharing of certain personal financial information with unaffiliated third parties.
Holding Company Regulation
 The Company, as a BHC, is subject to examination, regulation, and periodic reporting under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, as administered by the Federal Reserve Board. The Company is required to obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board to acquire all, or substantially all, of the assets of any bank or bank holding company. Prior Federal Reserve Board approval would be required for the Company to acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting securities of any bank or BHC if it would, directly or indirectly, own or control more than 5% of any class of voting shares of the bank or bank holding company.
A BHC is generally prohibited from engaging in, or acquiring, direct or indirect control of more than 5% of the voting securities of any company engaged in non-banking activities. One of the principal exceptions to this prohibition is for activities found by the Federal Reserve Board to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto. Some of the
-  -


principal activities that the Federal Reserve Board has determined by regulation to be closely related to banking are: (i) making or servicing loans; (ii) performing certain data processing services; (iii) providing securities brokerage services; (iv) acting as fiduciary, investment or financial advisor; (v) leasing personal or real property under certain conditions; (vi) making investments in corporations or projects designed primarily to promote community welfare; and (vii) acquiring a savings association.
The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 authorizes a BHC that meets specified conditions, including depository institutions subsidiaries that are “well capitalized” and “well managed,” to opt to become a “financial holding company.” A “financial holding company” may engage in a broader array of financial activities than permitted a typical bank holding company. Such activities can include insurance underwriting and investment banking. The Company has elected to be a “financial holding company.”
 In December 2014, legislation was passed by Congress that required the Federal Reserve Board to revise its “Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement” to exempt bank and savings and loan holding companies with less than $1.0 billion of consolidated assets from the consolidated capital requirements, provided that such companies meet certain other conditions such as not engaging in significant nonbanking activities. The Federal Reserve Board maintains authority to apply the consolidated capital requirements to any bank or savings and loan holding company as warranted for supervisory purposes. Regulations implementing the exemption were effective in May 2015.
 On August 28, 2018, pursuant to EGRRCPA, the Federal Reserve Board issued an interim final rule revising the Policy Statement increasing the consolidated asset limit to $3 billion. Under the Policy Statement, a BHC that meets certain Qualitative Requirements:
 •is exempt from the FRB's risk-based capital and leverage rules (Appendixes A and D of Regulation Y); and
 •may use debt to finance up to 75% of the purchase price of an acquisition allowing a BHC to have a debt-to-equity ratio of up to 3:1.
 The Policy Statement now applies to a BHC with consolidated assets of less than $3 billion that meets the following Qualitative Requirements: (i) it is not engaged in significant non-banking activities either directly or through a non-bank subsidiary; (ii) it does not conduct significant off-balance sheet activities, including securitizations or asset management or administration, either directly or through a non-bank subsidiary; or (iii) it does not have a material amount of debt or equity securities outstanding (other than trust preferred securities) that are registered with the SEC. BHCs that meet these Qualitative Requirements are determined to be "Qualifying BHCs". A Qualifying BHC is exempt from the FRB's risk-based capital and leverage rules. As a consequence, it does not have to comply with the Basel III Capital Adequacy rules. Each subsidiary bank of a Qualifying BHC must comply with the Basel III Capital Adequacy rules (or the Community Bank Leverage Ratio) and must be well-capitalized. If any subsidiary bank is not, the Federal Reserve Board expects it to become well-capitalized within a brief period of time. This Policy Statement applies to the Company.
 A BHC is generally required to give the Federal Reserve Board prior written notice of any purchase or redemption of then outstanding equity securities if the gross consideration for the purchase or redemption, when combined with the net consideration paid for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding 12 months, is equal to 10% or more of the company’s consolidated net worth. The Federal Reserve Board may disapprove such a purchase or redemption if it determines that the proposal would constitute an unsafe and unsound practice, or would violate any law, regulation, Federal Reserve Board order or directive, or any condition imposed by, or written agreement with, the Federal Reserve Board. The Federal Reserve Board has adopted an exception to that approval requirement for well-capitalized bank holding companies that meet certain other conditions. The Federal Reserve Board has issued guidance which requires consultation with the Federal Reserve Board prior to a redemption or repurchase in certain circumstances.
 The Federal Reserve Board has issued a policy statement regarding the payment of dividends by BHCs. In general, the Federal Reserve Board’s policies provide that dividends should be paid only out of current earnings and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention by the BHC appears consistent with the organization’s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. The Federal Reserve Board’s policies also require that a BHC serve as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary banks by using available resources to provide capital funds during periods of financial stress or adversity and by maintaining the financial flexibility and capital-raising capacity to obtain additional resources for assisting its subsidiary banks where necessary. The Dodd-Frank Act codified the source of strength policy. Under the prompt corrective action laws, the ability of a BHC to pay dividends may be restricted if a subsidiary bank becomes undercapitalized. These regulatory policies could affect the ability of the Company to pay dividends or otherwise engage in capital distributions.
The Company and the Bank will be affected by the monetary and fiscal policies of various agencies of the United States Government, including the Federal Reserve System. In view of changing conditions in the national economy and in the money markets, it is impossible for management to accurately predict future changes in monetary policy or the effect of such changes on the business or financial condition of the Company or the Bank.
The Company’s status as a registered BHC under the Bank Holding Company Act will not exempt it from certain federal and state laws and regulations applicable to corporations generally, including, without limitation, certain provisions of the federal securities laws.

Federal Securities Laws
 The Company’s common stock is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. We are subject to the information, proxy solicitation, insider trading restrictions and other requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
 The registration under the Securities Act of 1933 of the Company’s shares of common stock issued in the Company’s initial stock offering does not cover the resale of those shares. Shares of common stock purchased by persons who are not our affiliates may be resold without registration. Shares purchased by our affiliates are subject to the resale restrictions of Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933. If we meet the current public information requirements of Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, each affiliate of ours that complies with the other conditions of Rule 144, including those that require the affiliate’s sale to be aggregated with those of other persons, would be able to sell in the public market, without registration, a number of shares not to exceed, in any three-month period, the greater of 1% of our outstanding shares, or the average weekly volume of trading in the shares during the preceding four calendar weeks. In the future, we may permit affiliates to have their shares registered for sale under the Securities Act of 1933.
 Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
 The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 addresses, among other issues, corporate governance, auditing and accounting, executive compensation, and enhanced and timely disclosure of corporate information. We have prepared policies, procedures and systems designed to ensure compliance with these regulations.
 
FEDERAL AND STATE TAXATION
 
Deferred Income Tax Assets and Liabilities. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined using the liability method. Under this method, the net deferred tax asset or liability is recognized for the future tax consequences. This is attributable to the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases as well as net operating and capital loss carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates applied to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income tax expense in the period that includes the enactment date. If current available evidence about the future raises doubt about the likelihood of a deferred tax asset being realized, a valuation allowance is established. The judgment about the level of future taxable income, including that which is considered capital, is inherently subjective and is reviewed on a continual basis as regulatory and business factors change.
Federal Taxation
 General. The Bank and the Company are subject to federal income taxation in the same general manner as other corporations, with some exceptions discussed below. The following discussion of federal taxation is intended only to summarize certain pertinent federal income tax matters and is not a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to the Company or the Bank.
The Company’s federal tax returns are statutorily subject to potential audit for the years 2019 through 2022. No federal income tax returns are under audit as of the date of this report.
 Method of Accounting. For federal income tax purposes, the Company currently reports its income and expenses on the accrual method of accounting and uses a tax year ending December 31 for filing its federal and state income tax returns.
Bad Debt Reserves. Prior to 1996, Pathfinder Bank was permitted to establish a reserve for bad debts and to make annual additions to the reserve. These additions could, within specified formula limits, be deducted in arriving at our taxable income. As a result of tax law changes in 1996, Pathfinder Bank was required to use the specific charge-off method in computing its bad debt deduction beginning with its 1996 federal tax return. Savings institutions were required to recapture any excess reserves over those established as of December 31, 1987 (base year reserve). At December 31, 2022, Pathfinder Bank had no reserves subject to recapture in excess of its base year reserves. The Bank continues to be required to use the specific charge-off method to account for tax bad debt deductions.
Taxable Distributions and Recapture. Prior to 1996, bad debt reserves created prior to 1988 were subject to recapture into taxable income if Pathfinder Bank failed to meet certain thrift asset and definitional tests or made certain distributions. Tax law changes in 1996 eliminated thrift-related recapture rules. However, under current law, pre-1988 tax bad debt reserves remain subject to recapture if Pathfinder Bank makes certain non-dividend distributions, repurchases any of its common stock, pays dividends in excess of earnings and profits, or fails to qualify as a “bank” for tax purposes. At December 31, 2022, our total federal pre-base year bad debt reserve was approximately $1.3 million.

Net Operating Loss Carryovers. Federal tax law allows net operating losses to be carried forward indefinitely with the net operating loss deduction limited to 80% of taxable income in any carryforward year.
 Corporate Dividends Received Deduction. The Company may exclude from its federal taxable income 100% of dividends received from Pathfinder Bank as a wholly-owned subsidiary by filing consolidated tax returns. The corporate dividends received deduction is 65% when the corporation receiving the dividend owns at least 20% of the stock of the distributing corporation. The dividends-received deduction is 50% when the corporation receiving the dividend owns less than 20% of the distributing corporation.
 Employee Compensation. A publicly held corporation is not permitted to deduct compensation in excess of $1 million per year paid to certain employees. Federal tax law eliminates certain exceptions to the $1 million limit applicable under prior law related to performance-based compensation, such as equity grants and cash bonuses that are paid only on the attainment of performance goals.
Business Asset Expensing. Federal tax law allows taxpayers to immediately expense the entire cost of certain depreciable tangible property and real property improvements acquired and placed in service after September 27, 2017 and before January 1, 2023 (with an additional year for certain property). This 100% bonus depreciation is phased out proportionately for property placed in service on or after January 1, 2023 and before January 1, 2027 (with an additional year for certain property).

Diversity and Inclusion
 An inclusive open-minded community that engages excellence and embraces diversity is fundamental to supporting the Pathfinder Bank vision to be a local bank that the community trusts. The communities in which we serve include persons of various race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, socio-economic status, age, physical and cognitive ability, religion and political belief. We are committed to valuing and sharing the strength of our differences in a safe and positive environment.
 
Our primary goal is to attract and cultivate a dynamic and cultural sensitivity that exemplifies, promotes and celebrates diversity. This definition of diversity includes recognition and appreciation of the uniqueness of each individual. We seek to hire well-qualified team members who are, at least as importantly, a good fit for our value system. Our selection and promotion processes are without bias and include the active recruitment of minorities and women.

With a commitment to equality, inclusion and workplace diversity, we focus on understanding, accepting, and valuing the differences between people. To accomplish this, we continue our efforts through our Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Committee made up of several employee representatives from areas located throughout our market footprint. We collaborate with local business partners to better our understanding and position ourselves to improve and fulfill our commitment to diversity and inclusion. Our goal is to build and leverage a diverse and inclusive workforce and workplace by building leadership capability and organizational capacity. This requires all team members to do their part. Management must possess diversity and inclusion competencies to lead and manage an engaged workforce. All team members must treat their colleagues with respect by listening to different viewpoints, opinions, thoughts and ideas and embracing a culture of inclusion.
 
A commitment to diversity and inclusion is essential to reflecting the values of our team members and the society we serve today. It makes business sense because it helps us to attract and retain the best talent, it enables us to understand and meet clients' needs more effectively and thus provide a better quality service. We continue our commitment to equal employment opportunity through a robust affirmative action plan, which includes annual compensation analyses and ongoing reviews of our selection and hiring practices, alongside a continued focus on building and maintaining a diverse workforce.

Learning and Development
 We invest in the growth and development of our team members by providing a multi-dimensional approach to learning that empowers, intellectually grows, and professionally develops our colleagues. We encourage and support the growth and development of our team members and, wherever possible, seek to fill positions by promotion and transfer from within the organization. Continual learning and career development is advanced through performance and development conversations between team members and their managers, internally developed training programs, customized corporate training engagements and educational reimbursement programs. Reimbursement is available to team members enrolled in pre-approved degree or certification programs at accredited institutions that teach skills or knowledge relevant to our business, in compliance with Section 127 of the Internal Revenue Code, and for seminars, conferences, and other training events team members attend in connection with their job duties. We will be recruiting for a Corporate Trainer in early 2023. This individual will report to Human Resources and be dedicated to this initiative.
Retention Efforts
 Employee retention helps us operate efficiently and achieve one of our business objectives. We believe our commitment to living out our core values, actively prioritizing concern for our team members’ well-being, supporting our team members’ career goals, offering competitive wages and providing valuable fringe benefits aids in retention of our top-performing team members . In addition, nearly all of our team members are stockholders of the Company through participation in our Employee Stock Ownership Plan, which aligns employee and stockholder interests by providing stock ownership on a tax-deferred basis at no investment cost to our employees. At December 31, 2022, over 34% of our current staff had been with us for ten years or more. There is a team assigned to retention efforts as a strategic initiative for 2023 and forward.
