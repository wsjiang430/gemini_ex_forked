ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
We currently operate two U.S. software-as-a-service, or SaaS, businesses, Chime and Trucker Path. Our businesses help companies, small business owners, and sole proprietors streamline their operations, reach more customers, and close business transactions using our SaaS products and services.
We launched our SaaS businesses in the United States in August 2016 with Chime, an all-in-one real estate solution provider. In August 2022, we acquired Rentancy, LTD., a U.K based provider of bookkeeping and operations management solutions to property managers and landlords. In December 2017, we acquired Trucker Path, Inc., a transportation network company specializing in online and mobile services for the trucking industry in the United States.
We began our operations in China in 2002 and incorporated our current holding company Renren Inc., in February 2006 in the Cayman Islands under our prior name, Oak Pacific Interactive. Through a corporate restructuring in March 2006, Oak Pacific Interactive became the holding company. In December 2010, we changed our corporate name from Oak Pacific Interactive to Renren Inc. In May 2011, we completed our initial public offering and the ADSs representing our Class A ordinary shares began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “RENN.” Since our initial public offering, we acquired and/or disposed of a number of businesses, including an online video sharing website, group-buying services business, consumer financing, online gaming, mobile live streaming and used automobile.
With the acquisition of our SaaS businesses and then the completion of the Kaixin deconsolidation in June 2021, we have completed a transition of our global business to the United States and North America. Effective January 1, 2023, we also transitioned from a foreign private issuer to a domestic issuer. Commencing fiscal year 2021, we officially moved our global headquarters from Beijing, China to Phoenix, Arizona, where most of our executive and senior management now resides. Our SaaS businesses, whose sales are almost exclusively to customers within the United States, generate the majority of our revenue. A significant portion of our research and development team resides in China, with engineers also employed in the Philippines, United States, Pakistan, and Eastern Europe. Our

sales and marketing and customer service operations, focused on acquiring and servicing North American customers, are located in the United States and the Philippines.
For a full discussion of the history and development of our business, please refer to Items 4A and 4B of our Annual Report on Form 20-F for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 filed with the SEC on May 2, 2022.
Our Strengths
We believe that our success and growth strategy benefit from the following key strengths:

● | Comprehensive product features and solutions: We have designed SaaS products that cover a broad customer requirement spectrum, are easy to use, and that we are continually enhancing in response to the needs of our customers. We believe our SaaS products provide features that customers use in operating their businesses every day and that our products’ features and functionality compare favorably with competitive offerings on the market.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Lean-startup and product-led growth company culture: We believe that our company culture and management systems focus managers and operating personnel on achieving growth efficiently. In addition to monitoring top line growth, we closely monitor operating performance, cash sources and uses, and key operating measures including customer acquisition cost, operating margins, and efficiency. Our product-led growth mindset drives us to iterate quickly and use customer acquisition cost and product adoption trends to direct investment and adjust priorities rapidly. We believe our culture enables continuous improvement and innovation with cost efficiency and instills managerial disciplines to allocate resources wisely. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Large and Growing Customer Installs: Our SaaS businesses serve a large base of active users and subscribers. We believe our active users and subscribers provide us the opportunity to offer additional paid products and services to paid subscribers and convert active users to paying users. SaaS active users, especially engaged users, also provide for growing Network effects which drive increased brand awareness, product usage, ecosystem and partner networks, and referrals from existing users. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Strategy
Our goal is to identify, acquire, operate, and grow SaaS businesses, including outside the United States where opportunities exist, in market segments with high prospects for growth. We seek to invest in or acquire SaaS businesses in industries we expect to benefit from SaaS, including, but not limited to, business process automation, sales cycle time reduction, improved customer reach and engagement, and enabling network effects that connect industry participants so they may expand their networks and transact business more efficiently. Although we intend to operate and grow our SaaS businesses, we will divest of such businesses in part or in full when we believe it is in the best interest of the Company and its stakeholders. The key elements of our strategy:

● | Grow our customer base: The markets for our SaaS Services are large and fragmented with the workforce we serve comprised of owner operators and real estate agents. Our SaaS offerings provide solutions that allow us to reach individual operators and agents using inbound marketing, customer service, and referrals from active users of our products. Our services also provide features and functionality to service fleets and real estate brokerages which we intend to grow through our traditional channels and the use of traditional field sales. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Increase revenue from existing customers: We will continue to direct our leveraged development operations to invest in features and functionalities that allow us to develop new features and services that our customers’ will purchase and use to expand their reach and make their work easier. This will include making investments to better serve enterprise and mid-market accounts and to improve and simplify the work our customers perform, using legacy processes, with our SaaS services or through offerings from partners in our ecosystem. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Pursue partnerships and acquisitions: We plan to selectively pursue partnerships and acquire complementary businesses that expand our addressable market, add technologies and teams that allow us to enhance our platforms, accelerate the pace of innovation, or allow us to resell and offer services and products that our active users and subscribers would buy through our platforms.

Chime
We started our SaaS business with the launch of Chime, an all-in-one CRM and sales acceleration platform, in August 2016. Chime is a comprehensive SaaS platform designed to help real estate professionals close more deals faster. The platform combines IDX websites, lead generation, marketing automation, advanced lead management, and powerful AI to cost-effectively capture and convert leads into new business. Our subscribing real estate professionals use Chime to launch and oversee marketing campaigns, track leads, build customer relationships, manage websites, and seamlessly communicate with teams and associates across the entire real estate customer lifecycle using multiple devices. In August 2022, we acquired Rentancy, LTD. A UK based property management operations SaaS product and services company. The acquisition of Rentancy marks the extension of our platform and initial entry into serving the property management market with SaaS products and services.
Chime allows users to import lead and contact information of potential buyers and sellers from third-party platforms onto the Chime platform. Chime can automatically categorize potential real estate transactions based on type, zip code, budget, source, and other features. Chime allows individual real estate professionals, real estate teams, or brokerages to display and market properties and services, to source and engage with potential buyers and sellers, to distribute potential deals among team members, monitor deal progress, and monitor key performance indicators to evaluate the efficiency and performance of their real estate sales activities. Chime users may leverage artificial intelligence to auto-respond to inquiries from potential buyers and sellers with customized scripted responses. Chime enables real estate professionals to keep in touch with clients by text, phone calls, and emails. Chime provides IDX to real estate professionals to help them design customized websites. Chime also allows users to download property data from multiple property listing databases and displays those properties on their websites. Chime users also have the ability to publish comparative market analyses and similar reports for their clients. Utilizing Chime’s advertising services, real estate professionals can place advertisements on third-party websites and platforms to generate leads and demand for listings. Chime also offers mailed print advertising services to its clients.
Trucker Path
In December 2017, we acquired 100% of Trucker Path, Inc., a transportation network company specializing in online and mobile services for the trucking industry in North America. Its core product is the Trucker Path application, a trip planning companion for truck drivers, which enables a large community of truck drivers to assist each other in updating the real-time status of relevant points-of-interest along their route, plan trips, and use navigational assistance, including turn-by-turn assistance, to their destinations, including detailed directions within shipping and receiving docks. Trucker Path helps truck drivers find truck stops, parking, weigh stations, truck washes, restaurants, hotels, rest areas, and more. Real-time information, such as availability of parking or the cost of fuel, is provided for these points-of-interest. Over 370,000 businesses are listed as points-of-interest on Trucker Path, for which truck drivers can add their own ratings and reviews. Trucker Path’s companion app known as TruckLoads brings truck drivers, freight brokers, and shippers together onto a single digital freight exchange. Truck drivers can search for loads and customize their search criteria by geography, trailer type, pickup date and destination, among other things. They can also set up push notifications for loads in their area or loads that fit their most recent search criteria. Truck drivers can combine TruckLoads with Trucker Path to source loads, plan routes that maximize the amount of time they spend carrying loads, and reach their destination more safely and efficiently by avoiding obstacles such as clearance, hazmat, weight limit and no truck zone restrictions. Brokers and shippers can find carriers for their loads, complete contracts, and track their loads while in transit from pickup to delivery. Trucker Path serves SMB truck fleets with its enterprise Transportation Management System offering called Trucker Path COMMAND, which combines the core driver app with an operator portal to enable fleet managers to organize and dispatch drivers, communicate throughout the organization, track job progress and manage their business through a single unified portal. Trucker Path also offers its community an in-app Marketplace of discounted products and services drivers and small trucking companies need including fuel discounts, tax and accounting services, medical and life insurance, and more. We also sell in-app point-of-interest and banner advertising to businesses that market and sell their products and services to Trucker Path users. The Trucker Path platform has over 800,000 active users and 90,000 paid subscriptions.
Technology
Chime has an engineering team of 148 members, including front-end and back-end developers, mobile developers, product managers and Quality Assurance personnel. We are actively releasing product updates every month based on user feedback and our team’s analysis.

Trucker Path has an engineering team of 167 members, including mobile developers, front end/back end engineers, product managers and Quality Assurance personnel. We actively release product updates on all of our products, namely Trucker Path, TruckLoads, and Trucker Path Command.
Intellectual Property
Our intellectual property includes trademarks related to our brands and services, copyrights in software, patents and other intellectual property rights and licenses. We seek to protect our intellectual property assets and brand through a combination of monitoring and enforcement of trademark, patent, copyright and trade secret protection laws in the United States and other jurisdictions, as well as through confidentiality agreements and procedures.
Sales and Marketing
We have built our brands through a multitude of avenues, including:

● | industry trade shows;
--+----------------------


● | online digital marketing;
--+--------------------------


● | publicity of major milestones and achievements;
--+------------------------------------------------


● | collaboration with relevant partners; and
--+------------------------------------------


● | email marketing on opted-in subscribers to our product updates and industry news.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Like most SaaS companies, the majority of Chime’s sales are from leads derived from online digital marketing and closed by our internal sales teams. When sales inquiries come in from the marketing channels mentioned above, our sales team books a demo with a potential customer, completes the demo, and tries to close the deal. During 2021, we released the Enterprise version of its product and expanded our sales team to convert enterprise customers. Enterprise customers, due to the number of seats they require, the large fees, long contract durations, and unique requirements typically require more interaction between Chime sales professionals and the customer, multiple touches, and a longer sales cycle than Chime’s traditional SMB customer-base.
The main marketing channels for Trucker Path include online digital marketing, as well as publicity of our product milestones and industry research on various media outlets. We employ an inside sales team, located in the Philippines and the United States, to sell our Trucker Path Command products, onboard customers, provide customer support, and convert users of our products to paid subscribers. We offer our Command product as well as offerings that bundle our Driver, TruckLoads, and Command applications to Fleets that operate multiple trucks. These multi-truck and Enterprise accounts require more touches and a longer sales cycle than Trucker Path’s traditional owner operator customer-base.
Key Agreements
Not applicable.
Competition
For Chime, we compete with various Real Estate CRM vendors as well as a few integrated marketing-centric platforms. We also compete with other CRMs, Salesforce partners, and companies who offer digital marketing solutions for realtors, as well as direct mail service vendors. As we enter the Property Management market, we expect to increasingly compete with vendors that provide software and services to property managers and landlords.
Trucker Path mainly competes with other map service providers for professional truckers, small fleet navigation and trip optimization service providers, and other digital load boards. We also compete with other companies that sell advertising on behalf of businesses that serve the needs of truckers.

Government Regulation
We are subject to numerous United States (U.S.) federal, state, and foreign laws and regulations covering a wide variety of subject matters. Like other companies in the technology industry, we face scrutiny from both U.S. and foreign governments with respect to our compliance with laws and regulations. Many of these laws and regulations are evolving and their applicability and scope, as interpreted by the courts, remain uncertain.
Our compliance with these laws and regulations may be onerous and could, individually or in the aggregate, increase our cost of doing business, make our products and services less useful, limit our ability to pursue certain business models, cause us to change our business practices, affect our competitive position relative to our peers, and/or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.
For additional information about government regulation applicable to our business, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”
Seasonality
The sales performance of Chime has a small correlation with seasonality, but it mostly fluctuates with the macro cycle of the real estate market. For Trucker Path, seasonality has a more obvious impact. Our sales are mainly driven by active users, primarily long-haul truck drivers. Usually during winter months, when the U.S. and Canada experience more extreme weather, and long holidays, such as Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year, transportation demands decrease, and typically increase again with the return of Spring.
Employees and human capital resources
As of December 31, 2022, we had 601 full-time employees. Of these full-time employees, 323 employees are engaged in research and development activities, 212 are engaged in sales and marketing, and 66 are engaged in management and administration. As of December 31, 2022, we had 124 employees in the United States, 292 employees in China, 146 employees in the Philippines, and 39 employees in other countries. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We believe we maintain a good working relationship with our employees, and we have not experienced any major labor disputes.
We operate in a highly competitive environment for human capital, particularly as we seek to attract and retain talent with solid experience in the SaaS sectors. We believe that we offer our employees competitive compensation packages and a dynamic work environment that encourages initiative and is based on merit. As a result, we have generally been able to attract and retain qualified personnel and maintain a stable core management team. Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and additional employees. To help promote alignment between our employees and our shareholders, all employees are currently eligible to participate in our equity incentive plans through the receipt of new hire and annual equity grants. We believe that in addition to incentivizing growth that leads to shareholder value, broad eligibility for our equity incentive plans helps promote employee retention.
