ITEM 1. BUSINESS



We are a blank check company incorporated as a Cayman Islands exempted company. We were formed for the purpose of entering into a merger, capital share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or other similar business combination (a “Business Combination”) with one or more businesses or entities, which we refer to as a “target business.” While we may pursue an initial Business Combination with any target business and in any sector or geographical location, we intend to focus our search on targets in energy transition technologies, such as battery materials, energy storage, electric vehicle (“EV”) infrastructure and advanced recycling in emerging/frontier countries including the Commonwealth of Independent States (“CIS”), South and South-East Asia and Middle East and North Africa (“MENA”) regions. 



On September 8, 2021, we consummated an initial public offering (the “Initial Public Offering”) of 15,000,000 units at $10.00 per unit and the sale of 8,400,000 warrants at a price of $1.00 per private warrant in a private placement to our sponsor, Oxus Capital Pte. Ltd and its underwriters that closed simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering. We have listed the units on the Nasdaq Capital Market (“Nasdaq”). On September 13, 2021, the underwriters exercised their over-allotment option in full, according to which we consummated the sale of an additional 2,250,000 units, at $10.00 per unit, and the sale of an additional 900,000 private warrants, at $1.00 per private warrant, generating total gross proceeds of $23.40 million.



A total of $175,950,000 of the net proceeds from the Initial Public Offering (including the additional units) and the sale of private placement warrants and additional private placement warrants was deposited in a trust account established for the benefit of our public shareholders.

The Business Combination Agreement was unanimously approved by Oxus’ and Borealis’ respective board of directors. Under the Business Combination Agreement, the shareholders of Borealis (“Borealis Shareholders”) will receive from New Oxus, in the aggregate, a number of shares of New Oxus equal to (a) the Borealis Value (as defined below) divided by (b) $10.00.

Extension



On March 2, 2023, our shareholders approved an amendment to our Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association (as amended, the “Charter”) (the “Extension Amendment”). The Extension Amendment extends the date by which we must consummate our initial Business Combination (the “Extension”) from March 8, 2023, upon additional funds being deposited into the Company’s trust account (such date, the “Termination Date”) to up to December 8, 2023, or such earlier date as determined by our board of directors (the “Board,” such date, the “Extended Date”).



In connection with the shareholder vote to approve the Extension Amendment, the Holders of 15,300,532 Class A ordinary shares property exercised their right to redeem their shares for cash at a redemption price of approximately $10.41 per share, for an aggregate redemption amount of approximately $159.34 million (the “March Redemption”), leaving approximately $20.3 million in the Trust Account.

On March 3, 2023, our sponsor funded $200,000 through the Amended Note (as defined below), out of which $180,000 was deposited into the Trust Account as the initial deposit of the Extension Loan.



On March 15, 2023, our sponsor funded an additional $100,000 through the Amended Note (as defined below).




Our Founder and Management Team



We seek to capitalize on the substantial deal sourcing, investing and operating expertise of our founder, non-executive Chairman and director, Kenges Rakishev, our Chief Executive Officer, Kanat Mynzhanov, and our Chief Financial Officer, Askar Mametov, as well as our independent directors, Shiv Vikram Khemka, Christophe Charlier and Karim Zahmoul.



Mr. Rakishev is a global investor and entrepreneur who focuses on acquiring and investing in businesses that can benefit from his group’s operating expertise. Over the course of his career, Mr. Rakishev has acquired and directly or indirectly invested in more than 50 businesses in metals & mining, oil, petrochemical, banking, fintech, information technology, ecommerce, logistics and insurance industries, including a current portfolio of ten active companies worldwide. He is the sole shareholder and chief executive officer of Fincraft (listed on the Kazakhstan Stock Exchange since 2019), chairman of the board of Fincraft Resources JSC (formerly SAT & Company)(listed on the Kazakhstan Stock Exchange since 2008), chairman of the board of Battery Metals Technologies Ltd.,, president of Kazakhstan Boxing Federation, independent director of Satbayev Kazakh National Technical University, co-founder of Saby Charitable Foundation, and was one of the early investors in StoreDot and Net Element (Nasdaq: NETE). Mr. Rakishev was ranked 12th on the Forbes list of the most influential persons in Kazakhstan in 2020.



In 2013, Singulariteam Fund, a venture capital fund owned by one of Mr. Rakishev’s group’s companies, was an early investor in StoreDot. StoreDot is a pioneer of extreme fast charging (XFC) batteries that overcome the critical barrier to mainstream EV adoption — range and charging anxiety. The company has revolutionized the conventional Li-ion battery by designing and synthesizing proprietary organic and inorganic compounds, making it possible to fully charge an EV in just five minutes. The company was named “the pioneer of 2020” by BNEF, as one of ten game-changing technology companies creating a more sustainable future.



Mr. Rakishev is a significant shareholder and Chairman of Fincraft Resources JSC, which has expertise building, investing and operating internationally in the natural resources and disruptive technology industries. Through its subsidiary Battery Metals Technologies Ltd., the company is targeting metals necessary for electrification (in particular, nickel, cobalt and lithium) and has a significant nickel opportunity project in Kazakhstan. Kazakhstan is strategically located, linking China and South Asia with Russia and Western Europe by road, rail and port, and therefore is of great importance to China’s “Belt and Road” strategy. Fincraft Resources JSC recognized the potential to produce nickel from laterite ores of the Gornostaevskoe deposit using in-situ leaching (ISL) techniques, which offers significant economic, environmental and ecological advantages over conventional mining by extracting metals from the ground without physically removing the rock in which they are found. As a result, little or no tailing or waste rock is generated. In addition, ISL allows for increasing and decreasing production output more cost effectively than conventional mining.

From 2013 to 2018, Mr. Rakishev was a non-executive director of Central Asia Metals Plc (AIM: CAML). In 2014, Mr. Rakishev became a major shareholder of BTA, which is currently a subsidiary of Fincraft. As of April 2021, Fincraft has over $1.2 billion in total assets. From 2015 to 2017, Mr. Rakishev was a controlling shareholder and served as the chairman of Kazkommertsbank JSC, the largest Kazakh commercial bank. From 2017 to 2019, Mr. Rakishev was a major shareholder of Petropavlovsk Plc., a member of London’s FTSE 250 index and is one of the five largest gold mining companies in Russia. In these positions, he offered support on strategic development, including helping to resolve management conflicts as well as short-term liquidity issues.



Mr. Rakishev is an active investor in start-ups that are developing some of the most disruptive and impressive technologies today, from EV battery technology, mobile payments, artificial intelligence and augmented reality to robotics and healthcare technology. He helps to establish an entrepreneurial environment as a foundation for growth, while offering support, resources, and advice.



In addition to Mr. Rakishev, we expect to benefit from the experience and networks of the following members of our management team:

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the past successes of Mr. Rakishev and our other officers and directors, and their respective affiliates do not guarantee that we will be able to identify a suitable candidate for our initial Business Combination or realize success with respect to any Business Combination we may consummate. You should not rely on the historical record of such individuals’ or entity’s performance as indicative of our future performance. Additionally, in the course of their respective careers, members of our management team may have been involved in businesses and deals that were unsuccessful. In addition, our officers and directors may have conflicts of interest with other entities to which they owe fiduciary or contractual obligations with respect to initial Business Combination opportunities.



Business Strategy



Our acquisition and value creation strategy is to identify and complete the initial Business Combination with a target in an industry that complements the experience and expertise of our founder and management team. We believe our founder’s broad experience owning and operating private and public companies positions us for a successful Business Combination. We also believe the resources and experience of our management team will provide us with an in-depth understanding of targets located in the CIS and other countries in South and South-East Asia and MENA regions, operating in energy transition technologies.



We expect to distinguish ourselves by leveraging our extensive internal and external network of relationships to create a significant pipeline of Business Combination opportunities. We have significant experience dealing with key stakeholders, including shareholders, administrators, governmental agencies as well as equity sponsors, lending institutions, family offices, investment banks, restructuring advisers, attorneys, brokers and employees built over many years of investing and operating businesses in different regions.



We believe our sponsor’s and management team’s deal sourcing, investing and operating expertise, as well as their extensive network of contacts in our focus regions will uniquely position us to take advantage of positive trends in our target industries. We believe this expertise and network of contacts will provide us access to a number of potential target businesses that could be attractive public companies in the United States.





5







We will evaluate a wide-range of organic and strategic growth opportunities to identify synergies, bolster a target’s competitive position and develop new areas of growth for it. We also intend to leverage our management team’s vision and substantial expertise in building vertically-integrated businesses when possible.



Acquisition Criteria



We intend to acquire a company that we believe can offer an attractive risk-adjusted returns for shareholders. Fundamental analysis, including historical and projected financial and operating data, extensive financial modelling and in-depth market risks reviews are the core to our investment strategy, as well as extensive legal and intellectual properties due diligence to evaluate a target company and to complete a thorough analysis of the potential impact of a Business Combination.



We intend to acquire companies or assets that we believe have some or all of the following attributes:




● | The potential to benefit from being publicly traded with access to the public capital markets and reduced cost of equity and debt capital to pursue further growth opportunities;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | A professional management team whose interests are aligned with our investors (we may enhance the capabilities of the target’s business team by recruiting talent through our network of contacts);
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The potential to grow organically as well as through acquisitions;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


● | A defensible position within a target market as a result of a differentiated technology or other competitive advantages;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | A proven business model;
--+-------------------------


● | The collective capabilities of our management can be leveraged to tangibly improve the operations and market position of the target; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | A history of strong operating and financial results with proven track records.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------




Given our management team’s extensive experience investing in a target’s industries, we expect that we may be familiar with the prospective target’s end-market, competitive landscape and business model. We intend to construct an operating and financial plan designed to significantly increase shareholder value. When necessary, we intend to assemble a team of industry and financial experts to supplement the management teams’ efforts. We expect to demonstrate to the target and its shareholders that we have the resources and expertise to provide the strategic and operational direction necessary to grow the business and improve the overall strategic prospects for the combined companies.



These criteria and guidelines are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of an initial Business Combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general criteria and guidelines as well as other considerations, factors, guidelines, and criteria that our management team may deem relevant. In the event that we decide to enter into a Business Combination with a target business that does not meet the above criteria and guidelines, we will disclose that the target business does not meet the above criteria and guidelines in our shareholder communications related to our initial Business Combination, which would be in the form of proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as applicable, that we would file with the SEC.



In evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct a thorough due diligence review which may encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, inspection of facilities, as well as a review of financial and other information that will be made available to us. We will also utilize our operational and capital allocation experience.






6







We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial Business Combination with a business that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers, or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial Business Combination with a business that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions that our initial Business Combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view.



Members of our management team will directly or indirectly own founder shares and/or private warrants following the Initial Public Offering and, accordingly, may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial Business Combination. Further, each of our officers and directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular Business Combination if the retention or resignation of any such officers and directors is included by a target business as a condition to our initial Business Combination.



Each of our officers and directors presently has, and any of them in the future may have additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a Business Combination opportunity to such entities. Accordingly, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a Business Combination opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such opportunity to such entity. We do not believe, however, that the fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our officers or directors will materially affect our ability complete our Business Combination. Our Charter provides that we renounce our interest in any corporate opportunity offered to any director or officer unless such opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of our company and such opportunity is one we are legally and contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for us to pursue.



Effecting a Business Combination



General



We are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any substantive commercial business for an indefinite period of time following the Initial Public Offering. We intend to utilize cash derived from the proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the private placement of private warrants, our ordinary shares, debt or a combination of these in effecting a Business Combination, including the proposed Business Combination with Borealis. A Business Combination may involve the acquisition of, or merger with, a company which does not need substantial additional capital, but which desires to establish a public trading market for its shares, while avoiding what it may deem to be adverse consequences of undertaking a public offering itself. These include time delays, significant expense, loss of voting control and compliance with various federal and state securities laws. In the alternative, we may seek to consummate a Business Combination with a company that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth. While we may seek to effect simultaneous Business Combinations with more than one target business, we will probably have the ability, as a result of our limited resources, to effect only a single Business Combination.
Sources of Target Businesses



 We expect that our principal means of identifying potential target businesses will be through the extensive contacts and relationships of our sponsor, initial shareholders, officers and directors. While our officers and directors are not required to commit any specific amount of time in identifying or performing due diligence on potential target businesses, our officers and directors believe that the relationships they have developed over their careers and their access to our sponsor’s contacts and resources will generate a number of potential Business Combination opportunities that will warrant further investigation. We also anticipate that target business candidates will be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment bankers, venture capital funds, private equity funds, leveraged buyout funds, management buyout funds and other members of the financial community. Target businesses may be brought to our attention by such unaffiliated sources as a result of being solicited by us through calls or mailings. These sources may also introduce us to target businesses they think we may be interested in on an unsolicited basis, since many of these sources will have read this Annual Report and know what types of businesses we are targeting.





7







Our officers and directors must present to us all target business opportunities that have a fair market value of at least 80% of the assets held in the trust account at the time of the agreement to enter into the initial Business Combination, subject to any pre-existing fiduciary or contractual obligations. While we do not presently anticipate engaging the services of professional firms or other individuals that specialize in business acquisitions on any formal basis (other than EarlyBirdCapital and Sova Capital as described elsewhere in this Annual Report), we may engage these firms or other individuals in the future, in which event we may pay a finder’s fee, consulting fee or other compensation to be determined in an arm’s length negotiation based on the terms of the transaction. In no event, however, will our sponsor, initial shareholders, officers, directors or their respective affiliates be paid any compensation or fees of any kind, including finder’s, consulting fees and other similar fees, prior to, or for any services they render in order to effectuate, the consummation of an initial Business Combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is), other than the $10,000 per month administrative fee, the repayment of up to $300,000 in loans from our sponsor and reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses. Our audit committee will review and approve all reimbursements and payments made to our sponsor, initial shareholders, officers, directors or our or their respective affiliates, with any interested director abstaining from such review and approval.



We have no present intention to enter into a Business Combination with a target business that is affiliated with any of our officers, directors or sponsor. However, we are not restricted from entering into any such transactions and may do so if (i) such transaction is approved by a majority of our disinterested independent directors and (ii) we obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm, or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions, that the Business Combination is fair to our unaffiliated shareholders from a financial point of view.



Selection of a Target Business and Structuring of a Business Combination



Subject to our management team’s pre-existing fiduciary obligations and the limitations that a target business have a fair market value of at least 80% of the balance in the trust account at the time of the execution of a definitive agreement for our initial Business Combination, as described below in more detail, and that we must acquire a controlling interest in the target business, our management will have virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting a prospective target business. We have not established any specific attributes or criteria (financial or otherwise) for prospective target businesses other than as described above under the caption “Investment Criteria.” In evaluating a prospective target business, our management may consider a variety of factors, including one or more of the following:




● | financial condition and results of operation;
--+----------------------------------------------


● | growth potential;
--+------------------


● | brand recognition and potential;
--+---------------------------------


● | experience and skill of management and availability of additional personnel;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | capital requirements;
--+----------------------


● | competitive position;
--+----------------------


● | barriers to entry;
--+-------------------


● | stage of development of the products, processes or services;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


● | existing distribution and potential for expansion;
--+---------------------------------------------------


● | degree of current or potential market acceptance of the products, processes or services;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | proprietary aspects of products and the extent of intellectual property or other protection for products or formulas;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | impact of regulation on the business;
--+--------------------------------------


● | regulatory environment of the industry;
--+----------------------------------------


● | costs associated with effecting the Business Combination;
--+----------------------------------------------------------


● | industry leadership, sustainability of market share and attractiveness of market industries in which a target business participates; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | macro competitive dynamics in the industry within which the company competes.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------




These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular Business Combination will be based, to the extent relevant, on the above factors as well as other considerations deemed relevant by our management in effecting a Business Combination consistent with our business objective. In evaluating a prospective target business, we will conduct an extensive due diligence review which will encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and inspection of facilities, as well as review of financial and other information which is made available to us. This due diligence review will be conducted either by our management or by unaffiliated third parties we may engage, although we have no current intention to engage any such third parties.

The time and costs required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete the Business Combination cannot presently be ascertained with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which a Business Combination is not ultimately completed will result in a loss to us and reduce the amount of capital available to otherwise complete a Business Combination.



Fair Market Value of Target Business



The Nasdaq listing rules require that the target business or businesses that we acquire must collectively have a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the balance of the funds in the trust account at the time of the execution of a definitive agreement for our initial Business Combination. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if we are not then listed on Nasdaq for whatever reason, we would no longer be required to meet the foregoing 80% fair market value test.



We currently anticipate structuring a Business Combination to acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial Business Combination where we merge directly with the target business or a newly formed subsidiary or where we acquire less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or shareholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such Business Combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our shareholders prior to the Business Combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post- transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the Business Combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we could acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target; however, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our shareholders immediately prior to our initial Business Combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial Business Combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of trust account balance test.



The fair market value of the target will be determined by our board of directors based upon one or more standards generally accepted by the financial community (such as actual and potential sales, earnings, cash flow and/or book value). The proxy solicitation materials or tender offer documents used by us in connection with any proposed transaction will provide public shareholders with our analysis of the fair market value of the target business, as well as the basis for our determinations. If our board is not able to independently determine that the target business has a sufficient fair market value, we will obtain an opinion from an unaffiliated, independent investment banking firm, or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions, with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. We will not be required to obtain an opinion from an investment banking firm as to the fair market value if our board of directors independently determines that the target business complies with the 80% threshold.



Lack of Business Diversification



We may seek to effect a Business Combination with more than one target business, although we expect to complete our Business Combination with just one business. Therefore, at least initially, the prospects for our success may be entirely dependent upon the future performance of a single business operation. Unlike other entities which may have the resources to complete several Business Combinations of entities operating in multiple industries or multiple areas of a single industry, it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations or benefit from the possible spreading of risks or offsetting of losses. By consummating a Business Combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may:

● | subject us to numerous economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact upon the particular industry in which we may operate subsequent to a Business Combination, and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | result in our dependency upon the performance of a single operating business or the development or market acceptance of a single or limited number of products, processes or services.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




If we determine to simultaneously acquire several businesses and such businesses are owned by different sellers, we will need for each of such sellers to agree that our purchase of its business is contingent on the simultaneous closings of the other acquisitions, which may make it more difficult for us, and delay our ability, to complete the Business Combination. With multiple acquisitions, we could also face additional risks, including additional burdens and costs with respect to possible multiple negotiations and due diligence investigations (if there are multiple sellers) and the additional risks associated with the subsequent assimilation of the operations and services or products of the acquired companies in a single operating business.

Limited Ability to Evaluate the Target Business’ Management



Although we intend to scrutinize the management of a prospective target business when evaluating the desirability of effecting a Business Combination, we cannot assure you that our assessment of the target business’ management will prove to be correct. In addition, we cannot assure you that the future management will have the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. Furthermore, the future role of our officers and directors, if any, in the target business following a Business Combination cannot presently be stated with any certainty. While it is possible that some of our key personnel will remain associated in senior management or advisory positions with us following a Business Combination, it is unlikely that they will devote their full-time efforts to our affairs subsequent to a Business Combination. Moreover, they would only be able to remain with the company after the consummation of a Business Combination if they are able to negotiate employment or consulting agreements in connection with the Business Combination. Such negotiations would take place simultaneously with the negotiation of the Business Combination and could provide for them to receive compensation in the form of cash payments and/or our securities for services they would render to the company after the consummation of the Business Combination. While the personal and financial interests of our key personnel may influence their motivation in identifying and selecting a target business, their ability to remain with the company after the consummation of a Business Combination will not be the determining factor in our decision as to whether or not we will proceed with any potential Business Combination. Additionally, we cannot assure you that our officers and directors will have significant experience or knowledge relating to the operations of the particular target business.



Following a Business Combination, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management of the target business. We cannot assure you that we will have the ability to recruit additional managers, or that any such additional managers we do recruit will have the requisite skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management.



Shareholders May Not Have the Ability to Approve an Initial Business Combination



In connection with any proposed Business Combination, including the proposed Business Combination with Borealis, we will either (1) seek shareholder approval of our initial Business Combination at a meeting called for such purpose at which shareholders may seek to convert their shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed Business Combination or don’t vote at all, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable), or (2) provide our shareholders with the opportunity to sell their shares to us by means of a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a shareholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable), in each case subject to the limitations described herein. The decision as to whether we will seek shareholder approval of a proposed Business Combination or will allow shareholders to sell their shares to us in a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would otherwise require us to seek shareholder approval. If we determine to engage in a tender offer, such tender offer will be structured so that each shareholder may tender all of his, her or its shares rather than some pro rata portion of his, her or its shares. In that case, we will file tender offer documents with the SEC which will contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial Business Combination as is required under the SEC’s proxy rules. Whether we seek shareholder approval or engage in a tender offer, we will consummate our initial Business Combination only if we have net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 either immediately prior to or upon consummation of such Business Combination and, if we seek shareholder approval, a majority of the outstanding ordinary shares voted are voted in favor of the Business Combination.



We chose our net tangible asset threshold of $5,000,001 to ensure that we would avoid being subject to Rule 419 promulgated under the Securities Act. However, if we seek to consummate an initial Business Combination with a target business that imposes any type of working capital closing condition or requires us to have a minimum amount of funds available from the trust account upon consummation of such initial Business Combination, we may need to have more than $5,000,001 in net tangible assets upon consummation and this may force us to seek third party financing which may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. As a result, we may not be able to consummate such initial Business Combination and we may not be able to locate another suitable target within the applicable time period, if at all. Public shareholders may therefore have to wait until after the Extended Date in order to be able to receive a pro rata share of the trust account.



Our sponsor, initial shareholders, officers and directors have agreed (1) to vote any ordinary shares owned by them in favor of any proposed Business Combination, (2) not to convert any ordinary shares in connection with a shareholder vote to approve a proposed initial Business Combination and (3) not sell any ordinary shares in any tender in connection with a proposed initial Business Combination.





10







None of our officers, directors, sponsor, initial shareholders or their affiliates has indicated any intention to purchase units or Class A ordinary shares in the Initial Public Offering or from persons in the open market or in private transactions. However, if we hold a meeting to approve a proposed Business Combination and a significant number of shareholders vote, or indicate an intention to vote, against such proposed Business Combination or that they wish to convert their shares, our officers, directors, sponsor, initial shareholders or their affiliates could make such purchases in the open market or in private transactions in order to influence the vote and reduce the number of conversions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, our officers, directors, sponsor, initial shareholders and their affiliates will not make purchases of ordinary shares if the purchases would violate Section 9(a)(2) or Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act, which are rules designed to stop potential manipulation of a company’s shares.



Conversion Rights



At any meeting called to approve an initial Business Combination, public shareholders may seek to convert their shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed Business Combination or do not vote at all, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial Business Combination, less any taxes then due but not yet paid. Alternatively, we may provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to sell their Class A ordinary shares to us through a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a shareholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, less any taxes then due but not yet paid.



Our sponsor, initial shareholders and our officers and directors will not have conversion rights with respect to any ordinary shares owned by them, directly or indirectly, whether acquired prior to the Initial Public Offering or purchased by them in the Initial Public Offering or in the aftermarket. In addition, the holders of the underwriter founder shares have agreed to waive their conversion rights with respect to the underwriter founder shares they hold.



We may require public shareholders, whether they are a record holder or hold their shares in “street name,” to either (i) tender their certificates to our transfer agent or (ii) deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using Depository Trust Company’s Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian System (the “DWAC System”), at the holder’s option, in each case prior to a date set forth in the proxy materials sent in connection with the proposal to approve the Business Combination.



There is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced delivery process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC System. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker a nominal amount and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise conversion rights. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising conversion rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated. However, in the event we require shareholders seeking to exercise conversion rights prior to the consummation of the proposed Business Combination and the proposed Business Combination is not consummated this may result in an increased cost to shareholders.



Any proxy solicitation materials we furnish to shareholders in connection with a vote for any proposed Business Combination will indicate whether we are requiring shareholders to satisfy such certification and delivery requirements. Accordingly, a shareholder would have from the time the shareholder received our proxy statement up until the vote on the proposal to approve the Business Combination to deliver his shares if he wishes to seek to exercise his conversion rights. This time period varies depending on the specific facts of each transaction. However, as the delivery process can be accomplished by the shareholder, whether or not he is a record holder or his shares are held in “street name,” in a matter of hours by simply contacting the transfer agent or his broker and requesting delivery of his shares through the DWAC System, we believe this time period is sufficient for an average investor. However, we cannot assure you of this fact. Please see the section titled “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Risks Associated with Our Business — In connection with any shareholder meeting called to approve a proposed initial Business Combination, we may require shareholders who wish to convert their shares in connection with a proposed Business Combination to comply with specific requirements for conversion that may make it more difficult for them to exercise their conversion rights prior to the deadline for exercising their rights” for further information on the risks of failing to comply with these requirements.



Any request to convert such shares once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to the vote on the proposed Business Combination or the expiration of the tender offer. Furthermore, if a holder of public shares delivered his certificate in connection with an election of their conversion and subsequently decides prior to the applicable date not to elect to exercise such rights, he may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically).



If the initial Business Combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public shareholders who elected to exercise their conversion rights would not be entitled to convert their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the trust account. In such case, we will promptly return any shares delivered by public holders.





11







Limitation on Conversion upon Completion of our Initial Business Combination if We Seek Shareholder Approval



Notwithstanding the foregoing, if we seek shareholder approval of our initial Business Combination and we do not conduct conversions in connection with our initial Business Combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our Charter provides that a public shareholder, together with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from seeking conversion rights with respect to more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in the Initial Public Offering, which we refer to as the “Excess Shares.” We believe this restriction will discourage shareholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to exercise their conversion rights against a proposed Business Combination as a means to force us or our management to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a public shareholder holding more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in the Initial Public Offering could threaten to exercise its conversion rights if such holder’s shares are not purchased by us or our management at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our shareholders’ ability to convert no more than 15% of the shares sold in the Initial Public Offering without our prior consent, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of shareholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete our initial Business Combination, particularly in connection with a Business Combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. However, we would not be restricting our shareholders’ ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our initial Business Combination.
Liquidation if No Business Combination



Our Charter provides that we will have until the Extended Date to complete an initial Business Combination. If we have not completed an initial Business Combination by such date, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem 100% of the outstanding public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including any interest not previously released to us but net of taxes payable, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders’ rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining shareholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject (in the case of (ii) and (iii) above) to our obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law.



Our sponsor, initial shareholders, officers and directors have agreed that they will not propose any amendment to Charter (A) to modify the substance or timing of our obligations with respect to conversion rights as described in this Annual Report or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to shareholders’ rights or pre-initial Business Combination activity, unless we provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to convert their public shares upon such approval at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest not previously released to us but net of taxes payable, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares. This conversion right shall apply in the event of the approval of any such amendment, whether proposed by our sponsor, initial shareholders, executive officers, directors or any other person.



We are required to seek to have all third parties (including any vendors or other entities we engage after the Initial Public Offering) and any prospective target businesses enter into agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind they may have in or to any monies held in the trust account. As a result, the claims that could be made against us will be limited, thereby lessening the likelihood that any claim would result in any liability extending to the trust. We therefore believe that any necessary provision for creditors will be reduced and should not have a significant impact on our ability to distribute the funds in the trust account to our public shareholders. Nevertheless, Marcum LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, and the underwriters of our Initial Public Offering, will not execute agreements with us waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account. Furthermore, there is no guarantee that other vendors, service providers and prospective target businesses will execute such agreements. Nor is there any guarantee that, even if they execute such agreements with us, they will not seek recourse against the trust account. Our sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to ensure that the proceeds in the trust account are not reduced below $10.20 per share by the claims of target businesses or claims of vendors or other entities that are owed money by us for services rendered or contracted for or products sold to us, but we cannot assure you that it will be able to satisfy its indemnification obligations if it is required to do so. We have not asked our sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations, nor have we independently verified whether our sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations and believe that our sponsor’s only assets are securities of our company. Therefore, we believe it is unlikely that our sponsor will be able to satisfy its indemnification obligations if it is required to do so. Additionally, the agreement our sponsor entered into specifically provides for two exceptions to the indemnity it has given: it will have no liability (1) as to any claimed amounts owed to a target business or vendor or other entity who has executed an agreement with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind they may have in or to any monies held in the trust account, or (2) as to any claims for indemnification by the underwriters of the Initial Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. As a result, if we liquidate, the per-share distribution from the trust account could be less than $10.20 due to claims or potential claims of creditors.





12







We anticipate notifying the trustee of the trust account to begin liquidating such assets promptly after our 18th month and anticipate it will take no more than 10 business days to effectuate such distribution. The holders of the founder shares and private shares have waived their rights to participate in any liquidation distribution from the trust account with respect to such shares. There will be no distribution from the trust account with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless. We will pay the costs of any subsequent liquidation from our remaining assets outside of the trust account. If such funds are insufficient, our sponsor has contractually agreed to advance us the funds necessary to complete such liquidation (currently anticipated to be no more than approximately $15,000) and has contractually agreed not to seek repayment for such expenses.



If we are unable to complete an initial Business Combination and expend all of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering, other than the proceeds deposited in the trust account, and without taking into account interest, if any, earned on the trust account, the initial per-share redemption price would be $10.20.



Our public shareholders shall be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only in the event of our failure to complete a Business Combination within the required time period, if the shareholders seek to have us convert or purchase their respective shares upon a Business Combination which is actually completed by us or upon certain amendments to our Charter prior to consummating an initial Business Combination. In no other circumstances shall a shareholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account.



If we are forced to file a winding-up petition bankruptcy case or a winding-up petition or an involuntary bankruptcy case is filed against us which is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy or insolvency law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our shareholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the trust account, we cannot assure you we will be able to return to our public shareholders at least $10.20 per share.



If we are forced to file a winding-up petition bankruptcy case or a winding-up petition or an involuntary bankruptcy case is filed against us which is not dismissed, any distributions received by shareholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy laws as either a “preferential transfer” or a “fraudulent conveyance.” As court could seek to recover all amounts received by our shareholders. Furthermore, because we intend to distribute the proceeds held in the trust account to our public shareholders promptly after the Extended Date, this may be viewed or interpreted as giving preference to our public shareholders over any potential creditors with respect to access to or distributions from our assets. Furthermore, our board may be viewed as having breached their fiduciary duties to our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, and thereby exposing itself and our company to claims of punitive damages, by paying public shareholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. We cannot assure you that claims will not be brought against us for these reasons.



Charter



Our Charter contains certain requirements and restrictions relating to the Initial Public Offering that will apply to us until the consummation of our initial Business Combination. These provisions cannot be amended without the approval of a majority of our shareholders. If we seek to amend any provisions of our Charter (A) to modify the substance or timing of our obligations with respect to conversion rights as described in this Annual Report or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to shareholders’ rights or pre-initial Business Combination activity, we will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to convert their public shares upon the approval of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest not previously released to us but net of taxes payable, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares. This conversion right shall apply in the event of the approval of any such amendment, whether proposed by our sponsor, initial shareholders, executive officers, directors or any other person. Our sponsor, initial shareholders, officers and directors have agreed to waive any conversion rights with respect to any founder shares, private shares and any public shares they may hold in connection with any vote to amend our Charter. Specifically, our Charter provides, among other things, that:

● | we shall either (1) seek shareholder approval of our initial Business Combination at a meeting called for such purpose at which shareholders may seek to convert their shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed Business Combination or don’t vote at all, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable), or (2) provide our shareholders with the opportunity to sell their shares to us by means of a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a shareholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable), in each case subject to the limitations described herein;

Corporate Information



Our executive offices are located at 300/26 Dostyk Avenue, Almaty, Kazakhstan 050020 and our telephone number is +7 (727) 355-8021. Our corporate website address is www.oxusacquisition.com. The information contained on, or accessible through our corporate website or any other website that we may maintain is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report.



We are a Cayman Islands exempted company. Exempted companies are Cayman Islands companies conducting business mainly outside the Cayman Islands and, as such, are exempted from complying with certain provisions of the Companies Act (As Revised). As an exempted company, we have applied for and received a tax exemption undertaking from the Cayman Islands government that, in accordance with Section 6 of the Tax Concessions Act (As Revised) of the Cayman Islands, for a period of 20 years from the date of the undertaking, no law which is enacted in the Cayman Islands imposing any tax to be levied on profits, income, gains or appreciations will apply to us or our operations and, in addition, that no tax to be levied on profits, income, gains or appreciations or which is in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax will be payable (i) on or in respect of our shares, debentures or other obligations or (ii) by way of the withholding in whole or in part of a payment of dividend or other distribution of income or capital by us to our shareholders or a payment of principal or interest or other sums due under a debenture or other obligation of us.



We are an emerging growth company as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (which we refer to herein as the JOBS Act). As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.



In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.



We will remain an emerging growth company for up to five years. However, if our annual gross revenue is $1.07 billion or more, if our non-convertible debt issued within a three year period exceeds $1 billion or the market value of our ordinary shares that are held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million on the last day of the second fiscal quarter of any given fiscal year, we would cease to be an emerging growth company as of the following fiscal year.



Additionally, we are a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates exceeds $250 million as of the end of that year’s second fiscal quarter, or (2) our annual revenues exceeded $100 million during such completed fiscal year and the market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the end of that year’s second fiscal quarter.

Competition



In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business, we have in the past and, if the proposed Business Combination with Borealis is not completed, may in the future encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting Business Combinations directly or through affiliates. Many of these competitors possess greater technical, human and other resources than us and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors. While we believe there may be numerous potential target businesses that we could acquire with the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering, our ability to compete in acquiring certain sizable target businesses may be limited by our available financial resources.



The following also may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses:




● | our obligation to seek shareholder approval of a Business Combination or engage in a tender offer may delay the completion of a transaction;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | our obligation to convert or repurchase Class A ordinary shares held by our public shareholders may reduce the resources available to us for a Business Combination; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | our outstanding warrants and unit purchase options, and the potential future dilution they represent.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




Any of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating a Business Combination. Our management believes, however, that our status as a public entity and potential access to the United States public equity markets may give us a competitive advantage over privately held entities having a similar business objective as ours in acquiring a target business with significant growth potential on favorable terms.



If we succeed in effecting a Business Combination, there will be, in all likelihood, intense competition from competitors of the target business. We cannot assure you that, subsequent to a Business Combination, we will have the resources or ability to compete effectively.



Employees



We have two executive officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters and intend to devote only as much time as they deem necessary to our affairs. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business (such as Borealis)has been selected for the Business Combination and the stage of the Business Combination process the company is in. Accordingly, once a suitable target business to acquire (such as Borealis) has been located, management may spend more time investigating such target business and negotiating and processing the Business Combination (and consequently spend more time on our affairs) than had been spent prior to locating a suitable target business. We presently expect our executive officers to devote such amount of time as they reasonably believe is necessary to our business. We do not intend to have any full- time employees prior to the consummation of a Business Combination.
Periodic Reporting and Audited Financial Statements



We have registered our units, Class A ordinary shares and warrants under the Exchange Act and have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, our annual report will contain financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public accountants.



We will provide shareholders with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of any proxy solicitation materials or tender offer documents sent to shareholders to assist them in assessing the target business. These financial statements will need to be prepared in accordance with or reconciled to United States generally accepted accounting principles or international financial reporting standards as promulgated by the International Accounting Standards Board. We cannot assure you that any particular target business identified by us as a potential acquisition candidate will have the necessary financial statements. To the extent that this requirement cannot be met, we may not be able to acquire the proposed target business.



We may be required to have our internal control procedures audited for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2022 as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. A target company may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition.

RISKS FACTORS SUMMARY



An investment in our securities involves a high degree of risk. The occurrence of one or more of the events or circumstances described in the section entitled “Risk Factors,” alone or in combination with other events or circumstances, may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. In that event, the trading price of our securities could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment. Such risks include, but are not limited to, the following:

● | We may not be able to complete our initial Business Combination before the Extended Date, in which case we would cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, and we would redeem our public shares for a pro rata portion of the funds in the trust account, and we would liquidate. In such event, our warrants would expire worthless.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Your only opportunity to affect the investment decision regarding a potential Business Combination may be limited to the exercise of your right to convert your shares to cash.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Our initial shareholders control a substantial interest in us and thus may influence certain actions requiring a shareholder vote.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We may not obtain a fairness opinion with respect to the target business that we seek to acquire and therefore you may be relying solely on the judgment of our board of directors in approving a proposed Business Combination.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We may issue additional shares or debt securities to complete a Business Combination, which would reduce the equity interest of our shareholders and likely cause a change in control of our ownership.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We may be unable to obtain additional financing, if required, to complete a Business Combination or to fund the operations and growth of the target business.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Resources could be wasted in researching acquisitions that are not consummated, which could materially adversely affect subsequent attempts to locate and acquire or merge with another business.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Our search for a Business Combination, and any target business with which we ultimately consummate a Business Combination, may be materially adversely affected by the recent coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and other events, and the status of debt and equity markets.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We may have a limited ability to assess the management of a prospective target business and, as a result, may effect our initial Business Combination with a target business whose management may not have the skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | If we consummate a Business Combination with a target company with assets located in the CIS or other country in South and South-East Asia and MENA regions, our results of operations and prospects could be subject to the economic, political, and legal policies, developments, and conditions in the country in which we operate. Further, the laws applicable to such company will likely govern all of our material agreements and we may not be able to enforce our legal rights.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | There may be tax consequences to our Business Combination that may adversely affect us.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Our officers and directors presently have fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities and, accordingly, may have conflicts of interest in determining to which entity a particular business opportunity should be presented.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | Our officers and directors may have interests in a potential Business Combination that are different than yours, which may create conflicts of interest.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Nasdaq may delist our securities from trading on its exchange, which could limit investors’ ability to make transactions in our securities and subject us to additional trading restrictions.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We may amend the terms of the warrants in a manner that may be adverse to holders of public warrants with the approval by a majority of the then outstanding public warrants.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We may redeem your unexpired warrants prior to their exercise at a time that is disadvantageous to you, thereby making your warrants worthless.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | If third parties bring claims against us, and if our directors decide not to enforce the indemnification obligations of our sponsor, or if our sponsor does not have the funds to indemnify us, the proceeds held in the trust account could be reduced and the per-share redemption amount received by shareholders may be less than $10.20 per share.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Provisions in our Charter may inhibit a takeover of us, which could limit the price investors might be willing to pay in the future for our ordinary shares and could entrench management.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Our shareholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against us to the extent of distributions received by them upon redemption of their shares.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We may not hold an annual meeting of shareholders until after the consummation of our initial Business Combination.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We are a newly formed company with no operating history, and, accordingly, you have no basis on which to evaluate our ability to achieve our business objective.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | If we are deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act, we may be required to institute burdensome compliance requirements and our activities may be restricted, which may make it difficult for us to complete our initial Business Combination.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We are an emerging growth company and smaller reporting company within the meaning of the Securities Act, and if we take advantage of certain exemptions from disclosure requirements available to emerging growth companies, this could make our securities less attractive to investors and may make it more difficult to compare our performance with other public companies.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Cyber incidents or attacks directed at us could result in information theft, data corruption, operational disruption and/or financial loss.
