The Bank is subject to the supervision and regulation of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”). 
Lake Shore Savings Bank’s principal business consists of attracting retail deposits from the general public in the areas surrounding its branch offices and investing those deposits, together with funds generated from operations, primarily in commercial real estate loans, one- to four-family residential mortgage loans, home equity lines of credit and, to a lesser extent, commercial business loans, consumer loans, and investment securities. Our revenues are principally derived from interest earned on our loans and investment securities.

Market Area
Lake Shore Savings Bank is a community bank that offers a variety of banking products to serve the market areas surrounding our eleven branch offices located within the Western New York region of New York State. 
Our geographic market area for loans and deposits is principally located within Erie and Chautauqua Counties, within Western New York. As of the most recent United States Census Bureau population census as of July 1, 2021, Erie and Chautauqua Counties had an estimated combined population of approximately 1.0 million. Our market area is bounded by Lake Erie to the west and Canada to the north, and includes the city of Buffalo, the second largest metropolitan area in the State of New York by population. The market area includes 11 hospitals, a medical school and a major cancer research and treatment facility, along with a centralized medical campus to cultivate clinical care, research, education and entrepreneurship. The area has several colleges and universities, community colleges and various vocational and technical schools. Western New York is home to professional sports franchises and an international airport. The area hosts a broad diversity of industry, commercial establishments and financial institutions as well as a skilled and productive workforce. 
New York State currently has several incentive programs for businesses to invest in the Western New York region. One example is the “Start-Up NY” program, which offers tax incentives to start, expand or relocate a qualified business to a tax-free area within the state, primarily near a university or community college campus, in order to access top talent and research facilities. Qualified businesses for this program include advance materials & manufacturing, biotech & life sciences, tech & electronics, and optics & imaging. This program has generated significant interest in Western New York for new business development, due to its proximity to 

 

Canada, history of being a strong industrial and manufacturing center, and the number of quality colleges and universities in the area. 
The Erie County region and the City of Buffalo experienced strong economic expansion prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, including major growth in the health care and education sectors, and resurgence in the central business district, which has led to an influx of private investment in development of hotels and housing in the downtown sector. The Buffalo Niagara Medical Campus has grown significantly with the construction of a new children’s hospital, expansion of an existing cancer/research hospital and construction of a new medical school by the State University of New York at Buffalo. Development on the waterfront has centered on redevelopment of property for mixed use, including public access and private development that includes office space, ice rinks, hotels and restaurants. There has also been an increased interest in innovative start-up companies, driven by the investment of 43North, which holds an annual competition enhanced by significant funding to attract innovative start-up companies to relocate to Buffalo, NY. This type of economic development has had a positive impact on the small business and middle-market customers that we focus on and we believe we will be able to capitalize on opportunities created by this economic growth. Although the COVID-19 pandemic slowed down certain aspects of economic development and economic activity during 2020 through 2022, the regional economy remains diversified, the housing market remains strong and various commercial and housing development projects continue to move forward. The lending opportunities in our market area remain dynamic and we believe that such activity will continue. 
Our primary market area has historically been stable, with a diversified base of employers and employment sectors. The local economies that we serve are not dependent on one key employer. Transportation equipment is a large manufacturing industry in the Buffalo area, as well as production of automobile component parts. The principal employment sectors are service-related, wholesale and retail trade, and durable-goods manufacturing. 
Our future growth will be influenced by the strength of our regional economy, other demographic trends and the competitive environment. We believe that we have developed lending products and marketing strategies to address the credit-related needs of the residents and small businesses in our local market area.

Competition

We face intense competition both in making loans and attracting deposits. Western New York has a significant number of financial institutions, including a super regional bank which has its headquarters in Buffalo, NY, and branches of large money centers and regional and super regional banks which have resulted from the consolidation of the banking industry in New York and surrounding states. Many of these competitors have greater resources and offer additional services than we do. We also face significant competition from online service providers who offer financial services, including loan and deposit products.

Our competition for loans comes principally from commercial banks, savings banks, mortgage banking companies, credit unions, online retail mortgage lenders and other financial service companies. The most direct competition for deposits comes from commercial banks, savings banks, credit unions, and online banks. We face additional competition for deposits from non-depository competitors such as mutual funds, securities and brokerage firms and insurance companies. We are significantly smaller than many of the financial institution competitors in our market area. Some of our competitors are not subject to the same degree of regulation as that imposed on federal savings banks or federally insured institutions, and these other institutions may be able to price loans and deposits more aggressively. Competition for deposits, for the origination of loans and the provision of other financial services may limit the Company’s growth and adversely impact its profitability in the future.

We expect competitive pressure to remain intense primarily due to technological advances and the continuing trend of consolidation in the financial services industry. Technological advances have lowered barriers to entry in our local market area by allowing banks to expand their geographic reach by providing services over the internet and have made it possible for non-depository institutions, including fintech companies, 

 

to offer products and services that have traditionally been provided by banks. We believe the primary factors in competing for deposits and loans is through personalized service, knowledge of the local market area and its economy, local decision making, technological convenience via mobile and online banking and active participation and support of the communities we serve. 

Lending Activities
General. Our principal lending activity is the origination of fixed rate and adjustable rate mortgage loans collateralized by commercial and residential real estate primarily located within our market area. The Bank also originates commercial business loans, home equity loans and consumer loans. We retain the majority of loans that we originate. However, we may sell residential mortgage loans into the secondary market, with retention of servicing rights, in order to manage interest rate and liquidity risk when deemed appropriate. Additional efforts to manage interest rate risk include the origination of shorter-term, adjustable rate loans. 

The loan portfolio composition table is set forth in Part II, Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” section of this Report.

(3)State of New York Mortgage Agency.
(4)During 2022 and 2021, we sold $1.0 million and $13.0 million, respectively, of long-term fixed rate residential mortgage loans with low yields to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (“FHLMC”) in order to offset long-term interest rate risk.

Commercial Real Estate Loans. We remained focused on originating commercial real estate loans and have assembled a strong team of loan officers to grow this portfolio. As such, the Bank’s primary lending activity is the origination of commercial real estate loans to finance the purchase of real property or to refinance real property. Real property generally consists of developed real estate, such as office buildings, warehouses, retail properties, mixed use properties, self-storage units and multi-family apartment complexes and is typically held as collateral for the loan. For the majority of our commercial real estate loan portfolio, the collateral is primarily located within the Bank’s primary market area. At December 31, 2022, commercial real estate loans totaled $304.0 million and represented 52.7% of the Bank’s total loan portfolio. Commercial real estate loans that are collateralized by multi-family apartment complexes made up 47.4% of the commercial real estate loan portfolio as of December 31, 2022 and totaled $156.2 million. In underwriting commercial real estate loans, consideration is given to historic and expected net operating income generated by the real estate; the age and condition of the collateral; the financial resources and income level of the borrower and any guarantors; current and projected occupancy levels; location of the property; and the borrower’s business experience. Our 

 

commercial real estate loans are appraised by third party independent appraisers approved by the board of directors. Personal guarantees are typically obtained from commercial real estate borrowers. 
We originate a variety of fixed and adjustable-rate commercial real estate loans generally for terms of five to 10 years and payments based on an amortization schedule of up to 20 to 25 years. Adjustable-rate loans are typically based on an index such as the prime rate or the FHLBNY advance rates with an added spread based on the type, size and risk of the loan. The rate is typically fixed for the first five years of the loan. Some adjustable-rate loans are subject to an interest rate floor. We typically lend up to a maximum loan-to-value ratio of 50% to 80% depending on the type and condition of the property being financed. Commercial real estate loans require a minimum debt service coverage ratio ranging from 1.15 to 1.50 depending on the type of property being financed and the strength of the personal guarantees of the owners. Fixed rate loans are typically subject to prepayment premiums if the loan is paid off within five years of origination and prior to the scheduled maturity.

Commercial real estate loans have larger balances and involve a greater degree of risk than one- to four-family residential loans. Of primary concern in multi-family and nonresidential real estate lending is the borrower’s creditworthiness and the feasibility and cash flow potential of the project. Payments on loans secured by nonresidential properties often depend on the successful operation and management of the properties or underlying businesses. As a result, repayment of such loans may be subject to a greater extent, than residential real estate loans, to adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy. To monitor cash flows on nonresidential properties, we require borrowers and/or loan guarantors to provide annual financial statements on larger multi-family and commercial real estate loans. In reaching a decision on whether to make a multi-family or nonresidential real estate loan, we consider the net cash flow of the project, the borrower’s expertise, credit history and the value of the underlying property. In addition, we monitor the tenancy of the properties as to occupancy, lease rates, term of lease and tenant credit worthiness. Commercial real estate loans typically involve larger loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers, which generally require substantially greater evaluation and oversight efforts. Our loan policies limit the amount of loans to a single borrower or group of borrowers to reduce this risk and are designed to set such limits within those prescribed by applicable federal statutes and regulations. We engage a third party to periodically conduct a credit review of the commercial real estate portfolio, including compliance with the Bank’s underwriting standards and policy requirements. In addition, we engage a third party to perform property site inspections on an annual basis as required by our Commercial Loan Policy. 

Commercial Construction. We originate loans primarily to established local developers to finance the construction of commercial and multi-family properties. We provide construction loans to local developers for the construction of one-to four-family residential developments. We also originate rehabilitation loans, enabling a borrower to partially or totally refurbish an existing structure, which are structured as construction loans and monitored in the same manner. 
These loans typically have a construction period of up to 24 months or longer, whereby draws are taken and interest only payments are made. As part of the draw process, inspection and lien checks are required prior to the disbursement of the proceeds. Interest rates on disbursed funds are based on the rates and terms set at closing. The majority of our commercial real estate construction loans are variable rate loans with rates tied to the prime rate, plus a premium. A floor rate may also be established in conjunction with a variable rate loan. A minimum of interest only payments on disbursed funds must be made on a monthly basis during the construction period. At the end of the construction period, the loan may convert to a commercial real estate mortgage. At December 31, 2022, construction loans totaled $22.9 million, or 4.0% of the total loan portfolio. 
Construction loans can be affected by economic conditions and the value of the underlying property. Construction loans may have additional risks related to advancing loan funds during construction due to the uncertain value of the property prior to the completion of construction. The repayment of a construction loan is, to a large degree, dependent on the successful and timely completion of the construction of the subject property. Construction delays may further impair the borrower’s ability to repay the loan. The Bank limits its risks during 

 

the construction period as disbursements are not made until the required work for each advance has been completed and a lien check has been performed.
One- to Four-Family Residential Mortgage Lending. At December 31, 2022, our one- to four-family residential loans (including residential construction loans) totaled $175.9 million and represented 30.5% of the total loan portfolio. Our residential mortgage loan originations are obtained from customers, residents of our local communities or referrals from local real estate agents, brokers, attorneys, or builders. The majority of residential loans originated are fixed rate loans; although we do offer adjustable rate loan products to our customers. Lake Shore Savings has historically retained the majority of residential mortgage loans that it originates. This may increase Lake Shore Savings exposure to interest rate risk with the recent increases in market interest rates, because the yield earned on fixed-rate assets would remain fixed, while the rates paid by Lake Shore Savings for deposits and borrowings may increase, which could result in lower net interest income. In an effort to manage interest rate risk, the Bank has begun in recent years to sell long term, lower yielding, fixed rate residential mortgages at origination in the secondary market, with servicing retained. 
One- to four-family residential mortgage loan originations are generally for terms up to 30 years; however, we do offer and have successfully originated loans with shorter terms of 10, 15, or 20 years. One- to four-family residential real estate loans may remain outstanding for significantly shorter periods than their contractual terms as borrowers may refinance or prepay loans at their option without penalty. Conventional one- to four-family residential mortgage loans originated by us customarily contain “due-on-sale” clauses that permit us to accelerate the indebtedness of the loan upon transfer of ownership of the mortgaged property. We do not offer “interest only” mortgage loans or “negative amortization” mortgage loans. 
Our residential lending policies and procedures ensure that the majority of one- to four-family residential mortgage loans generally conform to secondary market guidelines, although we also originate non-conforming loans. We underwrite all conforming loans (i.e. loans with less than a $647,200 loan balance during 2022) using the criteria required by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (“FHLMC”). We originate one- to four-family residential mortgage loans with a loan-to-value ratio up to 100%, and up to 101% with our United States Department of Agriculture (“USDA”) Rural Development Guaranteed Loan Program (“GLP”) mortgage loan product. Mortgages originated with a loan-to-value ratio exceeding 80% normally require private mortgage insurance. 
During 2022, we sold $1.3 million of fixed rate, conforming long-term residential mortgage loans with low yields at the time of origination in order to manage interest rate risk. We may also offer loans through programs offered by the State of New York Mortgage Agency (“SONYMA”) which are originated for sale. We retain all servicing rights for one- to four-family residential mortgage loans that we sell. 
We also originate loans above the lending limit for conforming loans, which we refer to as “jumbo loans.” We originate jumbo loans with fixed-rates and terms of up to 30 years. At December 31, 2022, jumbo loans totaled $8.0 million, or 4.6% of the one- to four-family residential mortgage portfolio. Jumbo loans carry greater risk than conforming loans as there are a limited number of potential buyers for this type of real estate which results in greater price volatility. As a result, these loan types are subject to more conservative underwriting requirements.
We originate one- to four-family mortgage loans on non-owner occupied properties that the borrower holds for investment purposes. These loans have a higher interest rate and shorter term than loans for an owner-occupied property. The loans typically have a fixed interest rate, terms up to 25 years and a loan to value ratio up to 75%. As of December 31, 2022 these loans represented $19.4 million or 11.0% of the one- to four-family residential mortgage portfolio. 
We offer adjustable rate mortgage loans with a maximum term of 30 years. When an adjustable rate mortgage is originated, the initial interest rate is established based on market conditions and competitor rates. The rate adjusts annually after one, five, or seven years, depending on the loan product. After the initial fixed 

 

rate time period, the interest rate on these loans will re-price based upon a specific U.S. Treasury index plus an additional margin, taking into consideration the cap and floor rates established at the time of loan origination.
The retention of adjustable rate one- to four-family residential mortgage loans in our loan portfolio helps reduce our exposure to changes in interest rates. However, there are unquantifiable credit risks resulting from potential increased costs to the borrower as a result of the pricing of adjustable rate residential mortgage loans. During periods of rising interest rates, the risk of default on one- to four-family residential adjustable rate mortgage loans may increase due to the increase of interest cost to the borrower. Furthermore, changes in the interest rates on adjustable rate mortgages may be limited by an initial fixed-rate period or by contractual limits on periodic interest rate adjustments, and as such adjustable rate loans may not adjust as quickly as our interest-bearing liabilities during a period of rapid increases in interest rates. During periods of decreasing interest rates, prepayments on adjustable rate loans may increase if the borrower can obtain a lower fixed interest rate, which may cause a decrease in loan yields with an offsetting increase in interest rate risk. 
Lake Shore Savings originates construction-to-permanent loans for the purpose of construction of primary and secondary residences. The Bank issues a commitment and has one closing which encompasses both the construction phase and permanent financing. The construction phase is a maximum of twelve months and requires the borrower to make interest only payments at the rate stated in the loan agreement. The loan to value on construction-to-permanent loans cannot exceed 80.0% of the estimated completed value at the end of the project. 

One- to four-family real estate loans can be affected by economic conditions and the value of the underlying collateral. The majority of our one- to four-family residential loans are backed by property located in Western New York and are affected by economic conditions in this market area. Western New York’s housing market has consistently demonstrated stability in home prices despite economic conditions, resulting in stable collateral value and lower risk of loss.

Construction lending generally involves a greater degree of risk as the repayment of the loan is dependent on the successful and timely completion of the project. Lake Shore Savings completes inspections during the construction phase prior to any disbursements, which limits the Bank’s risk. Construction delays may impair the borrower’s ability to repay the loan. 

Home Equity Loans and Lines of Credit. We currently provide all-in-one home equity lines of credit and have provided home equity loans in the past to our customers. Home equity lines of credit are generally made for owner-occupied homes, and are secured by first or second mortgages on residences. At December 31, 2022, home equity loans and lines of credit totaled $53.1 million and represented 9.2% of the total loan portfolio. The all-in-one home equity line of credit must have a minimum line amount of $5,000 up to a maximum of 90% of the total loan-to-value ratio for qualified borrowers. The all-in-one home equity line of credit product has interest rates tied to the prime rate and generally have a 15 year draw period and a 15 year payback period. Since 2010, our adjustable rate home equity loans include limits on decreases in the interest rate of the loan. The decrease in the interest rate may not be below the “floor” rate established at the time of origination. A customer has the option to convert either a portion, or the entire line of credit balance, to a term loan at a fixed rate of interest. As the customer pays down the balance on the term loan, the funds available on the line of credit increase by a like amount. All-in-one home equity lines of credit have 30 year maximum terms.
Home equity loans can be affected by economic conditions and the value of the underlying property. Home equity loans may have increased risk of loss if the Company does not hold the first mortgage resulting in the Company being in a secondary position in the event of collateral liquidation. At December 31, 2022, home equity loans and lines of credit where the Company does not hold the first mortgage represented 31.3% of the outstanding principal within our home equity loan portfolio. During periods of rising interest rates, the risk of default on home equity loans may increase due to the increase of interest cost to the borrower.
In 2020, we began offering an investment property line of credit which is similar to our home equity line of credit product. The investment property line of credit loans are generally made for non-owner occupied one- 

 

to four-family residential properties with a first-lien position and a loan to value ratio up to 70%. The loan has a 10-year draw period. At the end of the draw period, the line is restricted, and the outstanding balance of the loan is amortized over a 10-year repayment period. The investment property line of credit have interest rates tied to the prime rate.

Commercial Loans. In addition to commercial real estate loans, we also engage in commercial business lending, (also known as C&I lending) primarily to small businesses. A commercial business loan may be a business installment loan, line of credit, or other commercial loan. At December 31, 2022, commercial business loans totaled $19.6 million, or 3.4% of the total loan portfolio. Most of our commercial business loans have fixed interest rates, and are for terms generally not in excess of five years. In underwriting commercial business loans, consideration is typically given to the financial condition and the debt service coverage capabilities of the borrower/operating entity, projected cash flows and collateral value. Whenever possible, we collateralize these loans with a first lien on general business assets and a specific lien on the equipment being purchased and require personal guarantees from principals of the borrower. We offer commercial loan services designed to give business owners borrowing opportunities for modernization, inventory, equipment, construction, real estate, purchases or improvements, working capital, vehicle purchases, and the refinancing of existing corporate debt.

Commercial business loans are generally considered to involve a higher degree of risk than residential mortgage loans because the collateral underlying the loans may be in the form of furniture, fixtures, and equipment and/or inventory subject to market obsolescence and accounts receivable which must be monitored. Commercial business loans may also involve relatively large loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers, with the repayment of such loans typically dependent on the successful operation and income stream of the borrower’s operation. Such risks can be significantly affected by economic conditions. In addition, commercial business lending generally requires substantially greater oversight efforts compared to residential real estate lending. Accordingly, the repayment of a commercial loan depends primarily on the creditworthiness of the borrower (and any guarantors), while liquidation of collateral is a secondary and may be an insufficient source of repayment. We engage a third party to conduct an annual credit review of the commercial business loan portfolio, including compliance with the Bank’s underwriting standards and policy requirements. 
Consumer Loans. To a lesser extent, we offer a variety of consumer loans. At December 31, 2022, consumer loans totaled $1.2 million, or less than 1% of the total loan portfolio. Generally, the volume of consumer lending has declined as borrowers have opted for home equity lines of credit, which have lower interest rates. The largest component of our consumer loan portfolio are personal consumer loans and overdraft lines of credit. Our consumer loan portfolio also consists of vehicle loans, loans secured by certificates of deposit, secured and unsecured property improvement loans, and other secured loans. 
Consumer loans tend to have a higher credit risk due to the loans being either unsecured or secured by rapidly depreciable assets. Furthermore, consumer loan payments are dependent on the borrower’s continuing financial stability, and therefore are more likely to be adversely affected by job loss, divorce, illness or personal bankruptcy. The application of various federal and state laws, including federal and state bankruptcy and insolvency laws, may limit the amount which can be recovered on consumer loans in the event of a default.
Loan Participations. From time to time, we may originate a commercial real estate loan or commercial business loan which may exceed our internal lending or concentration limits and sell a portion of the loan to another community bank. The participating bank is typically located in New York State and its lending team is known by our commercial lenders. This allows our Bank to meet the needs of its customers and comply with its internal lending limits. In some instances, we may purchase participation interests in loans where we are not the lead lender. In both of these circumstances, we follow our customary loan underwriting and approval policies. We have strong relationships with other community banks in our primary market area that may desire to purchase participations, and we may increase our sales of participations in the future, if deemed appropriate. At December 31, 2022, our sold participations in commercial real estate and commercial business loans totaled $20.7 million and $258,000, respectively, all of which were collateralized by properties or business assets within our primary market area in Western New York. We may also purchase commercial real estate loan or commercial business loan participations in the future if deemed appropriate and at December 31, 2022, our purchased participations 

 

all in commercial business loans totaled $230,000. All of the Bank’s loan participations are collateralized by properties or business assets within our primary market area.
Loan Approval Procedures and Authority. Our lending policies are approved annually by our Board of Directors. Branch managers have the authority to originate home equity or consumer loans up to amounts approved by the Board of Directors. Home equity loans and consumer loans secured by real estate in excess of $25,000 and all one- to four-family residential mortgage loans up to $647,200 require approval by the Internal Residential Loan Committee; loans between $647,200 and $1.0 million, require approval of the Internal Residential Loan Committee and designated bank officers or loan committee member. Any of the above-mentioned loans with non-standard terms such as high loan-to-value ratios will require additional approval levels, up to and including approval by the board of directors. All non-commercial loans that are in excess of $1.0 million, require full Board approval. 

Commercial Loan Officers have the authority to originate commercial real estate and commercial business loans up to amounts approved by the Board of Directors. Commercial loans with total one obligor credit in excess of $100,000 and up to $1.5 million require the approval of two members of the Internal Commercial Loan Committee, one of which must be a designated member of executive management. Commercial loans with total one obligor credit in excess of $1.5 million and up to $5.0 million require majority approval by the Board Loan Committee. Commercial loans with total obligor credit in excess of $5.0 million require full Board approval. Loans with exceptions require a higher approval level.

Current Lending Procedures. Upon receipt of a completed loan application from a prospective borrower, we order a credit report and verify certain other information. If necessary, we obtain additional financial or credit related information. We require an appraisal for all residential and commercial real estate loans and home equity loans, including loans made to refinance existing mortgage loans. Appraisals are performed by licensed third-party appraisal firms. An appraisal management firm, approved by the Board of Directors has been engaged to handle all requests for appraisals on residential real estate loans. We require title insurance on all one- to four-family residential and commercial real estate loans and certain other loans. We also require property and casualty insurance on all real estate loans, and if applicable, we require borrowers to obtain flood insurance prior to closing. Based on loan-to-value ratios and lending guidelines, escrow accounts may be required for such items as real estate taxes, property and casualty insurance, flood insurance, and private mortgage insurance premiums.

Asset Quality
One of our key operating objectives has been, and continues to be, maintaining a high level of asset quality. Our high proportion of commercial real estate and one- to four-family residential mortgage loans primarily collateralized by property in Western New York, which historically has had stable property values, the maintenance of sound credit standards for new loan originations, our loan review procedures, including third party loan reviews, and strong executive management focus on credit quality have been factors in monitoring and managing our levels of credit risk. These factors have contributed to our strong financial condition.
Collection Procedures. We have adopted a loan collection policy to maintain adequate control on the status of delinquent loans and to ensure compliance with the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Dodd-Frank Act, the Consumer Protection Act and the New York State Real Property Actions and Proceedings Law. When a borrower fails to make required payments on a residential, home equity, commercial, or consumer loan, we take a number of steps to induce the borrower to cure the delinquency and restore the loan to a current status. 
Prior to proceeding with any foreclosure action in the case of a secured loan, we will review the collateral to determine whether its possession would be cost-effective for us. In cases where the collateral fails to fully secure the loan, in addition to repossessing the collateral, we may also sue on the note underlying the loan. 
Non-performing Loans and Non-performing Assets. Loans are periodically reviewed for performance. Management determines that a loan is impaired or non-performing when it is probable that at least a portion of 

 

the loan will not be collected in accordance with the original loan terms due to a deterioration in the financial condition of the borrower or in the value of the underlying collateral. When a loan is determined to be impaired, the measurement of the loan is based on the present value of the expected future cash flows, or the fair value of the collateral, if the loan is collateral-dependent. If the impaired value is less than the loan balance, the loss is recorded against the allowance for loan losses. Loans are placed on non-accrual status either when reasonable doubt exists as to the full timely collection of interest and principal, or when a loan becomes 90 days past due, unless an evaluation by the internal Asset Classification Committee indicates that the loan is in the process of collection and is either guaranteed or well secured. When our Asset Classification Committee designates loans on which we stop accruing interest income as non-accrual loans, we reverse outstanding interest income that was previously credited. We return a non-accrual loan to accrual status when factors indicating doubtful collection no longer exist and the borrower has performed for a period of at least six months. 

Real estate acquired as a result of foreclosure is classified as foreclosed real estate until such time as it is sold. We record foreclosed real estate at its fair value less estimated selling costs at the date of acquisition. If a foreclosure action is commenced and the loan is not brought current, paid in full, or refinanced before the foreclosure sale, the property could be sold at the foreclosure sale (to an outside bidder). If not, and we retain the property, then we will sell the real property securing the loan as soon thereafter as practical. During 2020 and 2021, foreclosure proceedings were delayed as a result of COVID-19, by the State of New York and the various lending agencies such as Freddie Mac, USDA, and SONYMA. The majority of these agencies ended the foreclosure moratoriums during 2021, but the State of New York allowed for further payment deferrals if the borrower could prove a COVID-19 impact. The New York state foreclosure moratorium ended on January 15, 2022. 

Troubled debt restructurings (“TDRs”) occur when we grant borrowers concessions that we would not otherwise grant but for economic or legal reasons pertaining to the borrower’s financial difficulties. A concession is made when the terms of the loan modification are more favorable than the terms the borrower would have received in the current market under similar financial difficulties. These concessions may include, but are not limited to, modifications of the terms of the debt, the transfer of assets or the issuance of an equity interest by the borrower to satisfy all or part of the debt, or the substitution or addition of borrower(s). The Company identifies loans for potential TDRs primarily through direct communication with the borrower and evaluation of the borrower’s financial statements, revenue projections, tax returns and credit reports. Even if the borrower is not presently in default, management will consider the likelihood that cash flow shortages, adverse economic conditions, and negative trends may result in a payment default in the near future. Generally, we will not return a TDR to accrual status until the borrower has demonstrated the ability to make principal and interest payments under the restructured terms for at least six consecutive months. Our TDRs are impaired loans, which may result in specific allocations of the allowance for loan losses and subsequent charge-offs, if appropriate.
Refer to Part II, Item 7 “Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Part IV, Financial Statements, Note 2 and Note 5 elsewhere in this report for additional details on nonperforming loans, impaired loans and TDRs.

Classification of Loans. Federal regulations require us to regularly review and classify our loans. In addition, our regulators have the authority to identify problem loans and, if appropriate, require them to be classified. Management closely monitors the quality of the loan portfolio and has established a loan review process designed to help grade the quality of the Company’s loan portfolio. The credit quality grade helps management make a consistent assessment of each loan relationship’s credit risk. Consistent with regulatory guidelines, the Company classifies loans and other assets considered of lesser quality. Such ratings coincide with the “Substandard”, Doubtful”, and “Loss” classifications used by federal regulators in their examination of financial institutions. A “Substandard” classification indicates that a loan has one or more defined weaknesses and are characterized by the distinct possibility that we will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. A “Doubtful” classification has all the weaknesses of a “Substandard” classification with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full highly questionable and improbable. Loans classified as “Loss” are considered uncollectible and continuance as an asset of the Company is no longer warranted.

 


Regulations also provide for a “special mention” category (i.e. criticized loans), described as loans which do not currently expose us to a sufficient degree of risk to warrant classification but do possess credit deficiencies or potential weaknesses deserving our close attention. When we classify loans as either substandard or doubtful, we set aside a loss reserve for such loans as we deem prudent. When we classify problem loans as loss, we typically charge-off the outstanding loan balance against the allowance for loan losses reserve. Our determination as to the classification of our loans and the amount of our loss allowances are subject to review by our regulators, which can require that we establish additional loss allowances. For further discussion on how management determines when a loan should be classified, refer to Note 5 in the consolidated financial statements located elsewhere in this report.
Allowance for Loan Losses. The allowance for loan losses is a valuation account that reflects our evaluation of the losses inherent in our loan portfolio, the composition of the loan portfolio, specific impaired loans and current economic conditions. We maintain the allowance through provisions for loan losses that we charge to income. We charge losses on loans against the allowance for loan losses when we believe the collection of the loan is unlikely, and all possible avenues of repayment have been analyzed, including the potential of future cash flow, the value of the underlying collateral, and strength of any guarantors or co-borrowers.
Our evaluation of risk in maintaining the allowance for loan losses includes the review of all loans on which the collectability of principal may not be reasonably assured. We consider the following qualitative and environmental factors as part of this evaluation: historical loan loss experience; payment status; the estimated value of the underlying collateral; changes in lending policies, procedures and loan review system; changes in the experience, ability, and depth of lending management and other relevant staff; trends in loan volume and the nature of the loan portfolio; and national and local economic conditions. There may be other factors that may warrant consideration in maintaining an allowance at a level sufficient to provide for probable loan losses. Although our management believes that it has established and maintained the allowance for loan losses to reflect losses inherent in our loan portfolio, based on its evaluation of the factors noted above, future additions may be necessary if economic and other conditions differ substantially from the current operating environment.

In addition, various regulatory agencies periodically review our allowance for loan losses as an integral part of their examination process. These agencies, including the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, may require us to increase the allowance for loan losses or the valuation allowance for foreclosed real estate based on their evaluation of the information available to them at the time of their examination.

The allowance consists of allocated, general and unallocated components. The allocated component relates to loans that are considered impaired. For these loans an allowance is established when the discounted cash flows, collateral value or observable market price of an impaired loan is lower than the carrying value of the loan. Refer to Note 5 in the consolidated financial statements located elsewhere in this report for more information on our impaired loans. The general component covers all other loans and is based on historical loss experience adjusted for qualitative and environmental factors, as mentioned above. An unallocated component may be maintained to cover uncertainties that could affect management’s estimate of probable losses, such as downturns in the local economy. The unallocated component of the allowance reflects the margin of imprecision inherent in the underlying assumptions used in the methodologies for estimating allocated and general losses in the portfolio. 









The following table presents our allocation of the allowance for loan losses by loan category and the percentage of loans in each category to total loans at the end of the years indicated. The allowance for loan losses allocated to each category is not necessarily indicative of inherent losses in any category and does not restrict the use of the allowance to absorb losses in other categories.

Investment Activities
General.  The general objectives of the investment portfolio are to provide for the overall asset/liability management of the Bank. All of our securities carry market risk, as increases in market rates of interest may cause a decrease in the fair value of the securities. Our investment policy is designed primarily to manage the interest rate sensitivity of our assets and liabilities, to provide collateral for pledging requirements on borrowings, to generate a favorable return without incurring undue interest rate or credit risk, to complement our lending activities and to provide and maintain liquidity within established guidelines. Our investment policy outlines the pre-purchase analysis, credit, and interest rate risk assessment guidelines and due diligence documentation required for all permissible investments. In addition, our policy requires management to routinely monitor the investment portfolio as well as the markets for changes which may have a material, negative impact on the credit quality of our holdings. Our Board of Directors reviews and approves our investment policy on an annual basis. The Board of Directors has delegated primary responsibility for ensuring that the guidelines in the investment policy are followed to the Asset-Liability Committee of the Board. The board designates members of executive management with the authority to purchase securities within established plans and guidelines. All transactions are reviewed by the Asset/Liability Committee of the Board of Directors which meets at least quarterly. 
In establishing our investment strategies, we consider our interest rate sensitivity, the types of securities to be held, liquidity and other factors. The Company has engaged an independent financial advisor to recommend investment securities according to a plan which has been approved by the Asset/Liability Committee and the Board of Directors. Federal savings banks have authority to invest in various types of assets, including 

 

U.S. Government obligations, securities of various federal agencies, obligations of states and municipalities, mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, collateralized-mortgage obligations, certain time deposits of insured banks and savings institutions, certain bankers’ acceptances, repurchase agreements, loans of federal funds, and, subject to certain limits, corporate debt and commercial paper.
The Company has classified all of its investments in debt securities as “available for sale.” The debt securities are reported at fair value, and unrealized gains and losses on debt securities are excluded from earnings and reported, net of deferred taxes, as a separate component of equity. Our current securities portfolio consists of collateralized mortgage obligations, mortgage backed securities, asset-backed securities, U.S. Government Agency bonds, and municipal bonds. Nearly all of our mortgage backed securities are directly or indirectly insured or guaranteed by FHLMC, the Government National Mortgage Association (“GNMA”) or the Federal National Mortgage Association (“FNMA”, or “Fannie Mae”). The municipal securities we invest in are fixed-rate investment grade bonds issued primarily by municipalities in New York State, have maturities of 20 years or less and many have private insurance guaranteeing repayment. The majority of municipal securities in our portfolio are unlimited general obligation bonds. 
Fair values of available for sale securities are based on a market approach. Securities which are fixed income instruments that are not quoted on an exchange, but are traded in active markets, are valued using prices obtained from our custodian, which uses third party data service providers.
We also have investments in equity securities, specifically FHLBNY stock, which must be held as a condition of membership in the Federal Home Loan Bank system. The level of investment is largely dependent on our level of borrowings from the FHLBNY. The investment in FHLBNY stock is considered restricted and is reported at cost on the consolidated statements of financial condition. The related changes in fair market value of equity securities is reported in other non-interest income on the consolidated statements of income.
Classification of Investments. Federal regulations require us to regularly review and classify our investments based on credit risk in determining credit quality of investment portfolios as well as for calculating risk based capital. A decline in the market value of a security due to interest rate fluctuations is not a basis for adverse classification. Instead, the classification is based on the likelihood of the timely and full collection of principal and interest. 
In assessing the credit quality of securities in our investment portfolio, we conduct an internal risk analysis, which includes a review of third party research and analytics. If our research indicates that an issuer of a security does not have adequate capacity to meet its financial obligations for the life of the asset, the Company will review the security and consider it for classification.
A security may be classified as Substandard, Doubtful or Loss, similar to loan classifications described above.
Our determination as to the classification of our investments is subject to review by our regulators. We regularly review our investment portfolio to determine whether any investments require classification in accordance with applicable regulations. Our review of our investment portfolio at December 31, 2022 resulted in two private-label asset-backed securities being classified, as the issuer may not have an adequate capacity to meet its financial commitments over the projected life of the investment or the risk of default by the obligor was possible, resulting in an expectation that the Bank would not receive the full and timely repayment of principal and interest as expected. These two securities had an amortized cost of $0 and an aggregate fair value of $96,000 at December 31, 2022. Five securities were evaluated for other-than-temporary impairment as of December 31, 2022. We concluded that no other than temporary impairment charges needed to be recorded during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we recaptured $15,000 and $59,000 respectively, of prior year other-than-temporary impairment charges. The recaptured amounts are reflected in the “recovery on previously impaired investment securities” line item in the consolidated statements of income.







Bank Owned Life Insurance. The Bank owns several Bank Owned Life Insurance (“BOLI”) policies totaling $23.2 million and $22.9 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The purpose of these policies is to offset the costs of supplemental employee retirement benefit (“SERP”) plans promised to members of management and non-employee directors. Refer to Note 11 in the notes to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F-1 of this report for more information on the SERP plans. The lives of certain key Bank employees and non-employee directors are insured, and Lake Shore Savings Bank is the sole beneficiary and will receive any benefits upon the employee or non-employee’s death. The policies were purchased from various life insurance companies. The design of the plan allows the cash value of the policy to be designated as an asset of the Bank. The asset’s value will increase by the crediting rate, which is a rate set by each insurance company and is subject to change on a quarterly, semi-annual or annual basis. The growth of the value of the asset will be recorded in non-interest income on the consolidated statements of income. Because this is a life insurance product, current federal tax laws exempt the income from federal income taxes.
Bank owned life insurance is not secured by any government agency nor are the policies’ asset values or death benefits secured specifically by any collateral. The Bank has worked closely with its advisor to select insurance companies and the bond ratings and financial condition of the underlying insurance companies are monitored on a quarterly basis. The failure of one of these insurance companies could result in a significant loss to the Bank. Other risks include the possibility that the favorable tax treatment of the income could change, that the crediting rate will not increase in a manner comparable to market interest rates, or that this type of plan will no longer be permitted by the Bank’s regulators. This asset is considered illiquid because, although the Bank may terminate the policies and receive the original premium plus all earnings at any time, such an action would require the payment of federal income taxes on all earnings since inception.
Sources of Funds
General. Deposits are our major source of funds for lending and other investment purposes. We may also borrow funds, primarily from the Federal Home Loan Bank of NY (“FHLBNY”), to supplement the amount of funds available for lending and daily operations. In addition, we derive funds from loan and mortgage-backed securities principal repayments and prepayments and from interest and proceeds from the maturity and call of investment securities, along with cash flows from operations. Loan repayments are a relatively stable source of funds, while deposit inflows and outflows and loan prepayments are significantly influenced by general interest rates, pricing strategies and economic conditions.
Deposits. We offer a variety of deposit accounts having a range of interest rates and terms. We currently offer regular savings deposits (consisting of Christmas Club, and statement savings accounts), money market savings and checking accounts, interest-bearing and non-interest bearing checking accounts (i.e., demand deposits), health savings accounts, retirement accounts, time deposits and Interest on Lawyer Accounts (“IOLA”). In addition to accounts for individuals, we also offer commercial savings, checking and money market accounts designed for the small to medium sized businesses operating in our market area. 
Deposit flows are influenced significantly by general and local economic conditions, changes in prevailing interest rates, pricing of deposits, and competition. Our deposits are obtained from communities surrounding our branch offices and we rely primarily on paying competitive rates, service, and long-standing relationships with customers to attract and retain these deposits. We may also rely on brokers to obtain deposits for liquidity purposes. We are a participant in the IntraFi Network Deposits program. This program offers our depositors enhanced FDIC insurance coverage. On May 24, 2018, the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act of 2018 was signed into law and as a result reciprocal deposits obtained via the IntraFi Network Deposits program are generally not considered brokered deposits. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had $8.1 million and $13.4 million of depositor funds placed in the IntraFi Network Deposits program. At December 31, 2022, we had $1.7 million of brokered deposits while there were no brokered deposits at December 31, 2021. 

When we determine our deposit rates, we consider local competition, U.S. Treasury securities offerings, our liquidity needs, and the rates charged on other sources of funds. We generally review our deposit mix and 

 

pricing on a weekly basis. Our deposit pricing strategy has generally been to offer competitive rates to attract funds and to focus on the acquisition of lower cost core deposits as opportunities arise.



The following table presents our time deposit accounts categorized by interest rates which mature during each of the years set forth below and the amounts of such time deposits by interest rate at December 31, 2022 and 2021.

Over three months through six months | | 262 
Over six months to twelve months | | 9,519 
Over twelve months | | 17,898
Total | $ | 28,289


Borrowings. The Company maintains borrowing arrangements in the form of lines of credit through the Federal Reserve Bank of NY as well as three other depository institutions. The Company may also obtain term borrowings from the FHLBNY. Our borrowings typically consist of a mix of short-term and long-term FHLBNY advances. At December 31, 2022 we had $12.6 million of short-term borrowings and $25.0 million of long-term debt from the FHLBNY. In comparison, we had $22.0 million of long-term debt from the FHLBNY at December 31, 2021. 

Additional information regarding our deposits and borrowings are included in Notes 7 and 8 in the notes to our consolidated financial statements beginning on page F-1 of this report. Also, refer to “Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources” for additional information on sources of funds.








Subsidiary Activities
Lake Shore Savings Bank is the only subsidiary of Lake Shore Bancorp. Lake Shore Savings Bank has no subsidiaries.

Employees and Human Capital Resources
Our core values of “Putting People First and Helping our Customers, Energizing our Employees, Respecting our Stockholders and Serving our Communities” begins with our Bank employees and their well-being. As a community bank, our employees are integral to the establishment of personal relationships with each of our customers, and as such are critical to the success of our Company.

As of December 31, 2022, Lake Shore Savings Bank employed 113 full-time employees and 7 part-time employees. Lake Shore Savings employees are not represented by a collective bargaining unit. Management believes that it has good relations with its employees.

Management encourages and supports the growth and development of all its employees by providing internal and external educational opportunities. Employees have the opportunity to participate in instructor led classroom training, third party webinars, seminars, conferences, and local leadership training groups, in an effort to increase their knowledge. Whenever possible, the Company seeks to fill its open positions through internal promotions and transfers from within the organization.

As part of our efforts to attract and retain employees, as well as support their health and well-being, we provide, in addition to competitive salaries, a comprehensive benefit package that provides health, dental, life, disability and other ancillary insurance benefits, as well as a generous paid time off policy. In addition, through our 401K, profit sharing and ESOP programs the Company facilitates the future financial well-being of its employees.  Nearly all of our employees are stockholders in the Company through their participation in our Employee Stock Ownership Plan. Employee participation helps align employee and stockholder interests by providing stock ownership on a tax-deferred basis at no investment cost to our associates. These benefits, when combined with incentive compensation and bonus programs, serve as rewards for performance and as retention vehicles.

Supervision and Regulation
General

Lake Shore Savings Bank, a federally chartered savings bank, is subject to regulation, examination, and supervision by the OCC, while Lake Shore Bancorp, Inc. and Lake Shore, MHC, which are federally chartered savings and loan holding companies, are subject to regulation, examination, and supervision by the Federal Reserve Board. Under this system of federal regulation, financial institutions are periodically examined to ensure that they satisfy applicable standards with respect to their capital adequacy, asset quality, management, earnings, liquidity, and sensitivity to market interest rates. Lake Shore Savings also is regulated, to a lesser extent, by the FDIC with respect to insurance of deposit accounts and the Federal Reserve Board, with respect to the payment of dividends and other matters. The regulation and supervision by these government agencies establishes a comprehensive framework of activities in which an institution may engage and is intended primarily for the protection of the FDIC’s deposit insurance fund and depositors. Lake Shore Savings’ relationship with its depositors and borrowers also is regulated to a great extent by both federal and state laws, especially in matters concerning the ownership of deposit accounts and the form and content of Lake Shore Savings’ mortgage documents. 

Certain of the regulatory requirements that are applicable to Lake Shore Savings, Lake Shore Bancorp and Lake Shore, MHC are described below. This description of statutes, regulations and other documents is not intended to be a complete explanation of such statutes, regulations and other documents and their effect on Lake 

 

Shore Savings, Lake Shore Bancorp and Lake Shore, MHC and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the actual statutes, regulations and other documents.

Consent Order 
Effective as of February 9, 2023, the Bank and the OCC entered into a Consent Order (the “Order”). The Order replaces the prior Agreement between the Bank and the OCC dated July 13, 2022 (“Written Agreement”), which has been terminated in connection with the entry into the Order. The Order provides, among other things, that the Bank will take the following actions within specified time frames as set forth in the Order:

The foregoing description of the Order is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full Order which was included in a Form 8-K filed on February 15, 2023 with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

Troubled Condition Status
The Bank has been designated as being in “Troubled Condition” under the rules and regulations of the OCC. As a result of this designation, the Bank must notify the OCC at least 30 days prior to the addition or replacement of a board member, or the employment or change in responsibilities of anyone who is, who will become, or performs the duties of a senior executive officer. Furthermore, the Bank must file an application with, and receive the consent of, the OCC with the concurrence of the FDIC, prior to the Bank entering into any agreement to pay and prior to making certain severance payments to our directors, officers and employees.
Individual Minimum Capital Requirement 
Pursuant to an Individual Minimum Capital Requirement, the Bank has been directed by the OCC to maintain a Tier 1 Leverage capital ratio of 10% and a Total Risk-Based capital ratio of 13%. In order to be considered “well-capitalized” by the OCC, a savings bank must maintain a Tier 1 Leverage capital ratio of 5% and a Total Risk-Based capital ratio of 10%. At December 31, 2022, the Bank’s Tier 1 Leverage capital ratio was 12.40% and its Total Risk-Based capital ratio was 18.09% and accordingly the Bank was in compliance with its Individual Minimum Capital Requirement and was considered well-capitalized.
Federal Banking Regulation 

Business Activities. A federal savings bank derives its lending and investment powers from the Home Owners’ Loan Act, as amended, and the regulations of the OCC. Under these laws and regulations, Lake Shore Savings may originate mortgage loans secured by residential and commercial real estate, commercial business loans and consumer loans, and it may invest in certain types of debt securities and certain other assets. Certain types of lending, such as commercial real estate, commercial business and consumer loans, are subject to an aggregate limit calculated as a specified percentage of Lake Shore Savings’ capital or assets. Specifically, Lake Shore Savings may invest in non-residential real estate loans which may not in the aggregate exceed 400% of capital, commercial business loans up to 20% of assets in the aggregate and consumer loans up to 35% of assets in the aggregate. Lake Shore Savings also may establish subsidiaries that may engage in activities not otherwise permissible for Lake Shore Savings, including real estate investment and securities and insurance brokerage.

Examinations and Assessments. Lake Shore Savings Bank is primarily supervised by the OCC, and as such is required to file reports with and is subject to periodic examination by the OCC. Lake Shore Savings Bank is also required to pay assessments to the OCC to fund the agency’s operations. 

Capital Requirements. Federal regulations require a federal savings bank to meet certain minimum capital standards. The minimum capital standards consist of a common equity Tier 1 (“CET1”) capital ratio of 4.5% of risk-weighted assets, a uniform leverage ratio of 4%, a Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 6% of risk-weighted assets and a total capital ratio of at least 8% of risk-weighted assets. In order to be considered well-capitalized, the Bank must have a CET1 ratio of 6.5%, a Tier 1 ratio of 8%, a total risk-based capital ratio of 10% and a leverage ratio of 5%. The Bank is also required to meet an Individual Minimum Capital Requirement as described above. The regulatory standards require unrealized gains and losses on certain “available for sale” securities holdings to be included for purposes of calculating regulatory capital unless a one-time opt-out is exercised. Lake Shore Savings Bank has exercised this one-time opt-out and therefore excluded unrealized gains and losses on certain “available-for-sale” securities holdings for purposes of calculating regulatory capital when applying the general rule. Additional restraints are also imposed on the inclusion in regulatory capital of mortgage-servicing assets, deferred tax assets and minority interests. 

Capital definitions include:

Common equity Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common stockholders’ equity, including retained earnings but excluding accumulated other comprehensive income. 
Tier 1 capital is generally defined as Common Equity Tier 1 capital and Additional Tier 1 capital. 
Additional Tier 1 capital generally includes certain noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries. 
Total capital includes Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital. 
Tier 2 capital is comprised of capital instruments and related surplus meeting specific requirements, and may include cumulative preferred stock, long-term perpetual preferred stock, mandatory convertible securities, subordinated debt and intermediate preferred stock. Also included in Tier 2 capital is the allowance for loan and lease losses limited to a maximum of 1.25% of risk-weighted assets and, for institutions that have not exercised an opt-out election regarding the treatment of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (“AOCI”), up to 45% of net unrealized gains on available-for-sale equity securities with readily determinable fair market values. Lake Shore Savings has exercised this one time opt-out election and does not include AOCI in its regulatory capital when applying the general rule. 

Additionally, a savings bank that retains credit risk in connection with an asset sale may be required to maintain additional regulatory capital because of the recourse back to the savings bank. In assessing an institution’s capital adequacy, the federal regulators take into consideration not only these numeric factors but also qualitative factors as well and has the authority to establish higher capital requirements for individual associations where necessary. 




In determining the amount of risk-weighted assets, all assets, including certain off-balance sheet assets, are multiplied by a risk-weight factor assigned by federal regulations based on the risks believed inherent in the type of asset. The capital requirements assign a higher risk weight to asset categories believed to present a great risk. For example, a risk weight of 0% is assigned to cash and U.S. government securities, a risk weight of 50% is generally assigned to prudently underwritten first lien one to four family residential mortgages, a risk weight of 100% is assigned to commercial and consumer loans, a risk weight of 150% is assigned to certain past due loans and a risk weight of between 0% and 600% is assigned to permissible equity interests, depending on certain specified factors. 

The regulations limit a banking organization’s capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments if the banking organization does not hold a “capital conservation buffer” consisting of 2.5% of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets in addition to the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, pursuant to the EGRRCPA, the OCC finalized a rule effective January 2020 that established a minimum community bank leverage ratio (tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets) of 9% for institutions under $10 billion in assets. An institution may elect to utilize the community bank leverage ratio in lieu of the general applicable risk-based capital requirements under Basel III. Such institutions that meet the community bank leverage ratio and certain other qualifying criteria will automatically be deemed to be well-capitalized. 

Effective January 1, 2020, the Bank elected to opt in and utilize the community bank leverage ratio framework on its quarterly call report. An institution that temporarily ceases to meet any qualifying criteria is provided with a two-quarter grace period to again achieve compliance. Failure to meet the qualifying criteria within the grace period or maintain a leverage ratio of 9% in 2022 requires the institution to comply with the generally applicable capital requirements. 

 At December 31, 2022, Lake Shore Savings’ capital exceeded the community bank leverage ratio of 9% and was considered to be well-capitalized. 

Prompt Corrective Action Regulations. Under the prompt corrective action regulations, the OCC is required and authorized to take supervisory actions against undercapitalized federal savings banks. For this purpose, a savings bank is placed in one of the following categories based on the savings bank’s capital:
well-capitalized (at least 5% leverage capital, 6.5% common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital, 8% Tier 1 risk-based capital and 10% total risk-based capital or if applicable, a community bank leverage ratio of 9.0% for 2022);
adequately capitalized (at least 4% leverage capital, 4.5% common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital, 6% Tier 1 risk-based capital and 8% total risk-based capital); 
undercapitalized (less than 4% leverage capital, 4.5% common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital, 6% Tier 1 risk-based capital or 8% total risk-based capital); 
significantly undercapitalized (less than 3% leverage capital, 3% common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital, 4% Tier 1 risk-based capital or 6% total risk-based capital); and
critically undercapitalized (less than 2% tangible capital).

Generally, the OCC is required to appoint a receiver or conservator for a savings bank that is “critically undercapitalized” within specific time frames. “Undercapitalized” institutions are subject to certain restrictions, such as on capital distributions and growth. The regulations also provide that a capital restoration plan must be filed with the OCC within 45 days of the date a savings bank receives notice that it is “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized” or “critically undercapitalized.” Any holding company for the savings bank 

 

required to submit a capital restoration plan must guarantee the lesser of: an amount equal to 5% of the savings bank’s assets at the time it was notified or deemed to be undercapitalized by the OCC, or the amount necessary to restore the savings bank to adequately capitalized status. This guarantee remains in place until the OCC notifies the savings bank that it has maintained adequately capitalized status for each of four consecutive calendar quarters. The OCC has the authority to require payment and collect payment under the guarantee. The failure of a holding company to provide the required guarantee will result in certain operating restrictions on the savings bank, such as restrictions on the ability to declare and pay dividends, pay executive compensation and management fees, and increase assets or expand operations. The OCC may also take any one of a number of discretionary supervisory actions against undercapitalized savings banks, including the issuance of a capital directive and the replacement of senior executive officers and directors. 

At December 31, 2022, Lake Shore Savings met the criteria for being considered “well-capitalized.” 

Capital Distributions. Federal regulations govern capital distributions by a federal savings bank, which include cash dividends, stock repurchases and other transactions charged to the capital account. 

Among other requirements, every federal savings bank in the mutual holding company structure must file an application with the OCC prior to paying a dividend or making a capital distribution.

Every federal savings bank that is a subsidiary of a holding company must file a notice with the Federal Reserve Board, at least 30 days before the board of directors declares a dividend or approves a capital distribution.

The OCC and the Federal Reserve Board may disapprove an application or notice if:
the savings bank would be undercapitalized following the distribution;
the proposed capital distribution raises safety and soundness concerns; or
the capital distribution would violate a prohibition contained in any statute, regulation or agreement.

In addition, the Federal Deposit Insurance Act provides that an insured depository institution shall not make any capital distribution if, after making such distribution, the institution would be undercapitalized.

The Company’s Board of Directors has suspended quarterly dividend payments to the Company’s stockholders. The Board of Directors made this decision in order to focus the capital resources of the Company and the Bank on addressing the operational, compliance and governance items described in the Consent Order. 
Loans to One Borrower. Generally, a federal savings bank may not make a loan or extend credit to a single borrower in excess of 15% of unimpaired capital and surplus. An additional amount may be loaned, equal to 10% of unimpaired capital and surplus, if the loan is secured by readily marketable collateral, which generally does not include real estate. As of December 31, 2022, Lake Shore Savings Bank was in compliance with the loans-to-one borrower limitations.
Qualified Thrift Lender Test. As a federal savings bank, Lake Shore Savings is subject to a qualified thrift lender, or “QTL,” requirement by meeting one of two tests: The Home Owners’ Loan Act (“HOLA”) QTL test or the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) Domestic Building and Loan Association (“DBLA”) test. The federal savings bank may use either test to qualify and may switch from one test to the other.
 Under the HOLA QTL test, Lake Shore Savings must maintain at least 65% of its “portfolio assets” in “qualified thrift investments” in at least nine months of the most recent 12-month period. “Portfolio assets” generally means total assets of a savings institution, less the sum of specified liquid assets up to 20% of total assets, goodwill and other intangible assets, and the value of property used in the conduct of the savings bank’s business.

 


“Qualified thrift investments” includes various types of loans made for residential and housing purposes, investments related to such purposes, including certain mortgage-backed and related securities, and loans for personal, family, household and certain other purposes up to a limit of 20% of portfolio assets. “Qualified thrift investments” also include 100% of an institution’s credit card loans, education loans and small business loans. 

Under the IRS DBLA test, the Bank must meet the business operations test and the 60% of assets test. The business operations test requires that the federal savings bank’s business consists primarily of acquiring the savings of the public (75% of its deposits and other obligations must be held by the general public) and investing in loans (more than 75% of its gross income consists of interest on loans and government obligations and various other specified types of operating income that federal savings bank’s ordinarily earn). For the 60% of assets test, the Bank must maintain at least 60% of its total in “qualified investments” as of the close of the taxable year or, at the option of the federal savings bank, may be computed on the basis of the average assets outstanding during the taxable year. 

A savings bank that fails the QTL test must either convert to a commercial bank charter or operate under specified restrictions. The Dodd-Frank Act made noncompliance with the QTL test potentially subject to agency enforcement action for violation of law. At December 31, 2022, Lake Shore Savings Bank opted to utilize the HOLA QTL test and satisfied the requirements of this test for the entire 12-month period. 

Liquidity. A federal savings institution is required to maintain a sufficient amount of liquid assets to ensure its safe and sound operation. We seek to maintain a ratio of liquid assets not subject to pledge as a percentage of deposits and borrowings of 15% or greater. 

Refer to Part II, Item 7 “Management Discussion and Analysis – Liquidity and Capital Resources” elsewhere in this report for additional details on liquidity. 

Community Reinvestment Act and Fair Lending Laws. All savings banks have a responsibility under the Community Reinvestment Act and related federal regulations to help meet the credit needs of their communities, including low-and moderate-income neighborhoods. In connection with its examination of a federal savings bank, the OCC is required to assess the savings bank’s record of compliance with the Community Reinvestment Act. In addition, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act prohibit lenders from discriminating in their lending practices on the basis of characteristics specified in those statutes. A savings bank’s failure to comply with the provisions of the Community Reinvestment Act could, at a minimum, result in denial of certain corporate applications, such as branches or mergers, or in restrictions on its activities. The failure to comply with the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act could result in enforcement actions by the OCC, as well as other federal regulatory agencies and the Department of Justice. Lake Shore Savings Bank received an “outstanding” Community Reinvestment Act rating in its most recent federal examination.

Transactions with Related Parties. A federal savings bank’s authority to engage in transactions with its “affiliates” is limited by OCC regulations and by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act. The term “affiliate” for these purposes generally means any company that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with an insured depository institution such as Lake Shore Savings Bank. Lake Shore Bancorp, Inc. and Lake Shore, MHC are affiliates of Lake Shore Savings Bank. In general, transactions with affiliates must be on terms that are as favorable to the savings bank as comparable transactions with non-affiliates. In addition, certain types of these transactions are restricted to an aggregate percentage of the savings bank’s capital. Collateral in specified amounts must usually be provided by affiliates in order to receive loans from the savings bank. In addition, OCC regulations prohibit a savings bank from lending to any of its affiliates that are engaged in activities that are not permissible for bank holding companies and from purchasing the securities of any affiliate, other than a subsidiary. Finally, transactions with affiliates must be consistent with safe and sound banking practices and may not involve low-quality assets. The OCC requires savings banks to maintain detailed records of all transactions with affiliates.




Lake Shore Savings’ authority to extend credit to its directors, executive officers and 10% stockholders, as well as to entities controlled by such persons, is currently governed by the requirements of Sections 22(g) and 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation O of the Federal Reserve Board. Among other things, these provisions require that extensions of credit to insiders (i) be made on terms that are substantially the same as, and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than, those prevailing for comparable transactions with unaffiliated persons and that do not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features, and (ii) not exceed certain limitations on the amount of credit extended to such persons, individually and in the aggregate, which limits are based, in part, on the amount of Lake Shore Savings Bank’s capital. In addition, Lake Shore Savings Bank’s board of directors must approve extensions of credit in excess of certain limits. Extensions of credit to executive officers are subject to additional restrictions based on the category of loan.

At December 31, 2022, Lake Shore Savings is in compliance with Regulation O. 

Cybersecurity. In addition to the provisions in the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act relating to data security, the Company and its subsidiaries are subject to many federal and state laws, regulations and regulatory interpretations which impose standards and requirements related to cybersecurity. For example, federal regulatory statements regarding cybersecurity indicates that financial institutions should design multiple layers of security controls to establish lines of defense and to ensure that risk management processes also address the risk posed by compromised customer credentials, including security measures to reliably authenticate customers accessing internet-based services of the financial institution. Additionally, the statements indicate that a financial institution’s management is expected to maintain sufficient business continuity planning processes to ensure the rapid recovery, resumption and maintenance of the institution’s operations after a cyber-attack involving destructive malware. A financial institution is also expected to develop appropriate processes to enable recovery of data and business operations and address rebuilding network capabilities and restoring data if the institution or its critical service providers fall victim to this type of cyber-attack. Financial institutions that fail to observe this regulatory guidance on cybersecurity may be subject to various regulatory sanctions, including financial penalties. 

In November 2021, the federal bank regulatory agencies issued a final rule requiring banking organizations to notify their primary federal regulator as soon as possible and no later than 36 hours of determining that a “computer-security incident” that rises to the level of a “notification incident,” as those terms are defined in the final rule, has occurred. A notification incident is a “computer-security incident” that has materially disrupted or degraded, or is reasonably likely to materially disrupt or degrade, the banking organization’s ability to deliver services to a material portion of its customer base, jeopardize the viability of key operations of the banking organization, or impact the stability of the financial sector. The final rule also requires bank service providers to notify any affected bank to or on behalf of which the service provider provides services “as soon as possible” after determining that it has experienced an incident that materially disrupts or degrades, or is reasonably likely to materially disrupt or degrade, covered services provided to such bank for four or more hours. The rule was effective April 1, 2022, with compliance required by May 1, 2022.

Anti-Money Laundering and OFAC. Under federal law, financial institutions must maintain anti-money laundering programs that include established internal policies, procedures, and controls. Financial institutions are also prohibited from entering into specified financial transactions and account relationships and must meet enhanced standards for due diligence and customer identification. Financial institutions must take reasonable steps to conduct enhanced scrutiny of account relationships to guard against money laundering and to report any suspicious transactions. Law enforcement authorities have been granted increased access to financial information maintained by financial institutions. Bank regulators routinely examine institutions for compliance with these obligations. The U.S. Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control, or "OFAC," is responsible for helping to ensure that U.S. entities do not engage in transactions with certain prohibited parties, as defined by various Executive Orders and Acts of Congress. OFAC publishes lists of persons, organizations, and countries suspected of aiding, harboring or engaging in terrorist acts, known as Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons. If the Bank finds a name on any transaction, account or wire transfer that is on an OFAC list, the Bank must freeze or block such account or transaction, file a suspicious 

 

activity report and notify the appropriate authorities. The U.S. Treasury Department's Financial Crises Enforcement Network ("FinCEN") rules include customer due diligence requirements for banks, including a requirement to identify and verify the identity of beneficial owners of customers that are legal entities, subject to certain exclusions and exemptions.

The Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2020 (“AMLA”), which amends the BSA, was enacted in January 2021. The AMLA is intended to comprehensively reform and modernize U.S. bank secrecy and anti-money laundering laws. Among other things, it codifies a risk-based approach to anti-money laundering compliance for financial institutions; requires the U.S. Department of the Treasury to promulgate priorities for anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism policy; requires the development of standards for testing technology and internal processes for BSA compliance; expands enforcement and investigation-related authority, including increasing available sanctions for certain BSA violations; and expands BSA whistleblower incentives and protections. In June 2021, FinCEN issued the priorities for anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism policy required under AMLA. The national priorities include: (i) corruption, (ii) cybercrime, (iii) terrorist financing, (iv) fraud, (v) transnational crime, (vi) drug trafficking, (vii) human trafficking and (viii) proliferation financing.

Enforcement. The OCC has primary enforcement responsibility over federal savings institutions and has the authority to bring enforcement action against all “institution-affiliated parties,” including stockholders, and attorneys, appraisers and accountants who knowingly or recklessly participate in wrongful action likely to have an adverse effect on an insured institution. Formal enforcement action may range from the issuance of a capital directive or cease and desist order, to removal of officers and/or directors of the institution and the appointment of a receiver or conservator. Civil penalties cover a wide range of violations and actions, and range up to $25,000 per day, unless a finding of reckless disregard is made, in which case penalties may be as high as $1.0 million per day. The FDIC also has the authority to terminate deposit insurance or to recommend to the OCC that enforcement action be taken with respect to a particular savings institution. If the OCC does not take action, the FDIC has authority to take action under specified circumstances.

Standards for Safety and Soundness. Federal law requires each federal banking agency to prescribe certain standards for all insured depository institutions. These standards relate to, among other things, internal controls, information systems and audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate risk exposure, asset growth, compensation, and other operational and managerial standards as the agency deems appropriate. The federal banking agencies adopted Interagency Guidelines Prescribing Standards for Safety and Soundness to implement the safety and soundness standards required under federal law. The guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards that the federal banking agencies use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired. The guidelines address internal controls and information systems, internal audit systems, credit underwriting, loan documentation, interest rate risk exposure, asset growth, compensation, fees and benefits. If the appropriate federal banking agency determines that an institution fails to meet any standard prescribed by the guidelines, the agency may require the institution to submit to the agency an acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the standard. If an institution fails to meet these standards, the appropriate federal banking agency may require the institution to submit a compliance plan.

Insurance of Deposit Accounts. Lake Shore Savings is a member of the Deposit Insurance Fund, which is administered by the FDIC. Deposit accounts in the Bank are insured by the FDIC. The Dodd-Frank Act permanently increased the maximum amount of deposit insurance for banks and savings institutions to $250,000 per depositor. 

The FDIC imposes an assessment for deposit insurance on all depository institutions. The FDIC’s assessment system is based on each institution’s total assets less tangible capital and, for institutions of Lake Shore Savings’ asset size, ranges from 1.5 basis points to 30 basis points through December 31, 2022. Assessment rates are risk based and are based on a formula which uses financial measures and supervisory ratings derived from a statistical model estimating the probability of failure over three years. 




The FDIC has authority to increase insurance assessments and adopted a final rule in October 2022 to increase initial base deposit insurance assessment rates by 2 basis points beginning in the first quarterly assessment period of 2023. As a result, effective January 1, 2023, assessment rates for institutions of the Bank’s size will range from 3.5 to 32 basis points.

As a result of the Consent Order described above, the Bank expects its deposit insurance assessments to increase in the near future.

Insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that an institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC. We do not currently know of any practice, condition or violation that may lead to termination of our deposit insurance.

Prohibitions Against Tying Arrangements. Federal savings banks are prohibited, subject to some exceptions, from extending credit to or offering any other service, or fixing or varying the consideration for such extension of credit or service, on the condition that the customer obtain some additional service from the institution or its affiliates or not obtain services of a competitor of the institution.

Federal Home Loan Bank System. Lake Shore Savings is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank System, which consists of eleven regional Federal Home Loan Banks. The Federal Home Loan Bank System provides a central credit facility primarily for member institutions. As a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York, Lake Shore Savings is required to acquire and hold shares of capital stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank. As of December 31, 2022, Lake Shore Savings was in compliance with this requirement.

Other Regulations 

Interest and other charges collected or contracted for by Lake Shore Savings are subject to state usury laws and federal laws concerning interest rates. Lake Shore Savings’ operations are also subject to federal laws applicable to credit transactions, such as the: 
Truth-In-Lending Act, governing disclosures of credit terms to consumer borrowers; 
Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, requiring that borrowers for one- to four-family residential real estate loans receive various disclosures, including good faith estimates of settlement costs, lender servicing and escrow account practices;
Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, requiring financial institutions to provide information to enable the public and public officials to determine whether a financial institution is fulfilling its obligation to help meet the housing needs of the community it serves;
Equal Credit Opportunity Act, prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, creed or other prohibited factors in extending credit;
Fair Credit Reporting Act, governing the use and provision of information to credit reporting agencies;
Fair Debt Collection Act, governing the manner in which consumer debts may be collected by collection agencies;
Truth in Savings Act; and
Rules and regulations of the various federal agencies charged with the responsibility of implementing such federal laws.

The operations of Lake Shore Savings also are subject to the: 
Right to Financial Privacy Act, which imposes a duty to maintain confidentiality of consumer financial records and prescribes procedures for complying with administrative subpoenas of financial records; 
Electronic Funds Transfer Act and Regulation E promulgated thereunder, which govern automatic deposits to and withdrawals from deposit accounts and customers’ rights and liabilities arising from the use of automated teller machines and other electronic banking services; 

 


Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act (also known as “Check 21”), which gives “substitute checks,” such as digital check images and copies made from that image, the same legal standing as the original paper check; 
The USA PATRIOT Act, which requires savings banks to, among other things, establish broadened anti-money laundering compliance programs, and due diligence policies and controls to ensure the detection and reporting of money laundering. Such required compliance programs are intended to supplement existing compliance requirements, also applicable to financial institutions, under the Bank Secrecy Act and the Office of Foreign Assets Control Regulations; and 
The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which places limitations on the sharing of consumer financial information by financial institutions with unaffiliated third parties. Specifically, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act requires all financial institutions offering financial products or services to retail customers to provide such customers with the financial institution’s privacy policy and provide such customers the opportunity to “opt out” of the sharing of certain personal financial information with unaffiliated third parties.

Holding Company Regulation

General. Lake Shore, MHC and Lake Shore Bancorp are savings and loan holding companies within the meaning of the Home Owners’ Loan Act. As such, Lake Shore, MHC and Lake Shore Bancorp are registered with the Federal Reserve Board and are subject to Federal Reserve Board regulations, examinations, supervision and reporting requirements. In addition, the Federal Reserve Board has enforcement authority over Lake Shore, MHC and Lake Shore Bancorp, and their non-bank subsidiaries. Among other things, this authority permits the Federal Reserve Board to restrict or prohibit activities that are determined to be a serious risk to the subsidiary savings institution. As federal corporations, Lake Shore, MHC and Lake Shore Bancorp are generally not subject to state business organization laws.

Permitted Activities. Pursuant to Section 10(o) of the Home Owners’ Loan Act and Federal Reserve Board regulations and policy, a mutual holding company and a federally chartered mid-tier holding company such as Lake Shore Bancorp may engage in the following activities:

(i)investing in the stock of a savings institution; 
(ii)acquiring a mutual savings bank through the merger of such savings institution into a savings institution subsidiary of such holding company or an interim savings bank subsidiary of such holding company; 
(iii)merging with or acquiring another holding company, one of whose subsidiaries is a savings institution; 
(iv)investing in a corporation, the capital stock of which is available for purchase by a savings institution under federal law or under the law of any state where the subsidiary savings institution or savings institutions share their home offices; 
(v)furnishing or performing management services for a savings institution subsidiary of such company; 
(vi)holding, managing or liquidating assets owned or acquired from a savings subsidiary of such company; 
(vii)holding or managing properties used or occupied by a savings institution subsidiary of such company; 
(viii)acting as trustee under deeds of trust; 
(ix)any other activity (A) that the Federal Reserve Board, by regulation, has determined to be permissible for bank holding companies under Section 4(c) of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, unless the Federal Reserve Board, by regulation, prohibits or limits any such activity for savings and loan holding companies; or (B) in which multiple savings and loan holding companies were authorized (by regulation) to directly engage on March 5, 1987; 
(x)any activity permissible for financial holding companies (if such status is elected by the Company) under Section 4(k) of the Bank Holding Company Act, including securities and insurance underwriting; and 

 


(xi)purchasing, holding, or disposing of stock acquired in connection with a qualified stock issuance if the purchase of such stock by such savings and loan holding company is approved by the Federal Reserve Board.

If a mutual holding company acquires or merges with another holding company, the holding company acquired or the holding company resulting from such merger or acquisition may only invest in assets and engage in activities listed in (i) through (xi) above, and has a period of two years to cease any nonconforming activities and divest of any nonconforming investments.

The Home Owners’ Loan Act prohibits a savings and loan holding company, including Lake Shore Bancorp and Lake Shore, MHC, directly or indirectly, or through one or more subsidiaries, from acquiring more than 5% of another savings institution or holding company thereof, without prior written approval of the Federal Reserve Board. It also prohibits the acquisition or retention of, with certain exceptions, more than 5% of a non-subsidiary company engaged in activities other than those permitted by the Home Owners’ Loan Act; or acquiring or retaining control of an institution that is not federally insured. In evaluating applications by holding companies to acquire savings institutions, the Federal Reserve Board must consider the financial and managerial resources, future prospects of the company and institution involved, the effect of the acquisition on the risk to the insurance fund, the convenience and needs of the community and competitive factors.

The Federal Reserve Board is prohibited from approving any acquisition that would result in a multiple savings and loan holding company controlling savings institutions in more than one state, subject to two exceptions: (i) the approval of interstate supervisory acquisitions by savings and loan holding companies, and (ii) the acquisition of a savings institution in another state if the laws of the state of the target savings institution specifically permit such acquisitions. The states vary in the extent to which they permit interstate savings and loan holding company acquisitions.

Capital. The Dodd-Frank Act, required the Federal Reserve Board to establish minimum consolidated capital requirements for all depository institution holding companies that are as stringent as those required for insured depository institutions. However, savings and loan holding companies of under $3.0 billion in consolidated assets are exempt from consolidated regulatory capital requirements, unless the Federal Reserve Board determines otherwise. As a result, the MHC and Lake Shore Bancorp will be exempt from the regulatory capital requirements until consolidated assets exceed $3.0 billion.

Source of Strength. The Dodd-Frank Act extended the “source of strength” doctrine to savings and loan holding companies. The Federal Reserve Board has promulgated regulations implementing the “source of strength” policy that requires holding companies act as a source of strength to their subsidiary depository institutions by providing capital, liquidity and other support in times of financial stress. Federal Reserve Board policies also provide that holding companies should pay dividends only out of current earnings and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention by the holding company appears consistent with the organization’s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. The ability of a holding company to pay dividends may be restricted if a subsidiary bank becomes undercapitalized. These regulatory policies may affect the ability of a savings and loan holding company to pay dividends or otherwise make capital distributions.

Waivers of Dividends by Lake Shore, MHC. Federal regulations require federally-chartered mutual holding companies to give the Federal Reserve Board notice before waiving the receipt of dividends, and provides that in the case of “grandfathered” mutual holding companies, like Lake Shore, MHC, the Federal Reserve Board “may not object” to a dividend waiver if the board of directors of the mutual holding company waiving dividends determines that the waiver: (i) would not be detrimental to the safe and sound operation of the subsidiary savings bank; and (ii) is consistent with the board’s fiduciary duties to members of the mutual holding company. To qualify as a grandfathered mutual holding company, a mutual holding company must have been formed, issued stock and waived dividends prior to December 1, 2009. Lake Shore, MHC qualifies as a grandfathered mutual holding company. Federal regulations further provide that the Federal Reserve Board may not consider waived dividends in determining an appropriate exchange ratio upon the conversion of a grandfathered mutual holding company to stock form. The Federal Reserve Board has issued an interim final 

 

rule that also requires, as a condition to waiving dividends, that each mutual holding company obtain the approval of a majority of the eligible votes of its members within 12 months prior to the declaration of the dividend being waived. The Company’s Board of Directors has suspended quarterly dividend payments to the Company’s stockholders. The Board of Directors made this decision in order to focus the capital resources of the Company and the Bank on addressing the operational, compliance and governance items described in the Order. Lake Shore, MHC will solicit its members (depositors of Lake Shore Savings Bank) to vote on future proposals to waive the MHC’s receipt of quarterly cash dividends when applicable. It is expected that Lake Shore, MHC will continue to waive future dividends, if the Company declares dividends to its stockholders in the future, except to the extent dividends are needed to fund Lake Shore, MHC’s continuing operations, subject to the ability of Lake Shore, MHC to obtain regulatory approval of its requests to waive dividends and its ability to obtain future member approval of dividend waivers. For more information, see Item 1A, “Risk Factors – Our ability to pay dividends is subject to the ability of Lake Shore Savings to make capital distributions to Lake Shore Bancorp and the waiver of dividends by Lake Shore, MHC.”

Conversion of Lake Shore, MHC to Stock Form. Federal Reserve Board regulations permit Lake Shore, MHC to convert from the mutual form of organization to the capital stock form of organization (a “Conversion Transaction”). There can be no assurance when, if ever, a Conversion Transaction will occur, and the board of directors has no current intention or plan to undertake a Conversion Transaction. In a Conversion Transaction, a new stock holding company would be formed as the successor to Lake Shore Bancorp (the “New Holding Company”), Lake Shore, MHC’s corporate existence would end, and certain depositors of Lake Shore Savings Bank would receive the right to subscribe for shares of the New Holding Company. In a Conversion Transaction, each share of common stock held by stockholders other than Lake Shore, MHC (“Minority Stockholders”) would be automatically converted into a number of shares of common stock of the New Holding Company determined pursuant to an exchange ratio that ensures that Minority Stockholders own the same percentage of common stock in the New Holding Company as they owned in Lake Shore Bancorp immediately prior to the Conversion Transaction. The total number of shares of common stock held by Minority Stockholders after a Conversion Transaction also would be increased by any purchases by Minority Stockholders in the stock offering conducted as part of the Conversion Transaction. Under a provision of the Dodd-Frank Act applicable to Lake Shore, MHC, Minority Stockholders would not be diluted because of any dividends waived by Lake Shore, MHC (and waived dividends would not be considered in determining an appropriate exchange ratio), in the event Lake Shore, MHC converts to stock form.

Any Conversion Transaction would be subject to approvals by Minority Stockholders and members of Lake Shore, MHC.

Liquidation Rights. Each depositor of Lake Shore Savings has both a deposit account in Lake Shore Savings and a pro rata ownership interest in the net worth of Lake Shore, MHC based upon the deposit balance in his or her account. This ownership interest is tied to the depositor’s account and has no tangible market value separate from the deposit account. This interest may only be realized in the unlikely event of a complete liquidation of Lake Shore Savings. Any depositor who opens a deposit account obtains a pro rata ownership interest in Lake Shore, MHC without any additional payment beyond the amount of the deposit. A depositor who reduces or closes his or her account (including reductions to pay for shares of common stock in the stock offering) receives a portion or all, respectively, of the balance in the deposit account but nothing for his or her ownership interest in the net worth of Lake Shore, MHC, which is lost to the extent that the balance in the account is reduced or closed.

In the unlikely event of a complete liquidation of Lake Shore Savings, all claims of creditors of Lake Shore Savings, including those of depositors of Lake Shore Savings (to the extent of their deposit balances), would be paid first. Thereafter, if there were any assets of Lake Shore Savings remaining, these assets would be distributed to Lake Shore Bancorp as Lake Shore Savings’ sole stockholder. Then, if there were any assets of Lake Shore Bancorp remaining, depositors of Lake Shore Savings would receive those remaining assets, pro rata, based upon the deposit balances in their deposit account in Lake Shore Savings immediately prior to liquidation.
