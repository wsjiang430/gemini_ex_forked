Item 1.Business.
Introduction
We are a blank check company incorporated on November 6, 2020 as a Delaware corporation and formed for the purpose of effecting an initial business combination. While we may pursue an acquisition or business combination target in any business or industry, we have focused our search on a technology business in the consumer internet or media space, including sports and entertainment verticals, with enterprise values of approximately $500 million to $2.5 billion. In particular, we have focused on finding disruptive, high growth companies, such as Infinite Reality, with a global ambition that take advantage of: (a) the rise of new consumer behaviors driven by the internet or new technologies, or (b) paradigm shifts in media, sports and entertainment that give rise to disruptive new entrants here to stay for the coming decades.
Our management team is composed of experienced dealmakers and highly regarded industry veterans in the consumer internet and media space. The management team has decades of experience investing into and operating innovative and transformative platforms in consumer internet and media, as well as scaling businesses into new geographies, especially Asia. We believe that the experience and capabilities of our management team will make us an attractive partner to potential target businesses, enhance our ability to complete a successful business combination, and add value to the business post-business combination.
Our team represents a unique combination of operating, investing, financial and transactional experience. Our team has a strong track record of creating value for shareholders in multiple consumer internet and media companies that they have led, managed and/or invested in. Our team also has a history of making substantial non-control investments that allow existing teams to continue their growth.
We believe we are an attractive partner to a target company, such as Infinite Reality. Our team has an extensive history scaling businesses and improving public companies. We have a diverse and value-added network to source and find follow-on opportunities. Our team also has experience navigating the complexities of operating as a public company. Our view is that supportive capital and a long-term orientation will be attractive as a partner first mentality will differentiate us from competition. We intend to help our target company focus on sustainable long-term value creation post close, with a high return on reinvestment.
Initial Public Offering
On March 25, 2021, we consummated our initial public offering of 12,000,000 units. Each unit consists of one share of common stock of the Company, par value $0.0001 per share, and one-half of one redeemable warrant of the Company, with each whole warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one share of common stock for $11.50 per share. The units were sold at a price of $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $120.00 million.
Simultaneously with the closing of the initial public offering, we completed the private sale of an aggregate of 390,000 private units to our sponsor and EBC, representative of the underwriters for our initial public offering, at a purchase price of $10.00 per private unit (340,000 units to our sponsor and 50,000 units to EBC), generating gross proceeds of $3.90 million. On March 30, 2021, the underwriters exercised the over-allotment option in part and purchased an additional 843,937 units, generating gross proceeds of approximately $8.44 million. In connection with the exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment option, our sponsor and EBC purchased an aggregate of 16,879 private units (14,715 units to our sponsor and 2,164 units to EBC), generating gross proceeds of $168,790 to the Company.
A total of $128.44 million, comprised of $125.87 million of the proceeds from the initial public offering and $2.57 million of the proceeds of the sale of the private units was placed in the trust account maintained by Continental, acting as trustee.

It is the job of our sponsor and management team to complete our initial business combination. Our management team is led by Matthew Hong, our Chairman and the former Chief Operating Officer of Turner Sports, and seasoned executives Thomas Bushey, our Chief Executive Officer, and Kenneth King, our Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Bushey and Mr. King have decades of experience identifying, acquiring, investing in and operating businesses, and provide depth of knowledge in capital markets. We must complete our initial business combination within the Combination Period. If our initial business combination with Infinite Reality or another target is not consummated within the Combination Period, then our existence will terminate, and we will distribute all amounts in the trust account.
Extension Meeting
On March 3, 2023, we filed a definitive proxy statement for a special meeting of our shareholders on March 21, 2023 (the “Special Meeting”) to seek an extension of the deadline by which we must consummate our initial business combination from March 25, 2023 to September 25, 2023 (the “Extension Proposal”) and to approve the adjournment of the Special Meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary or convenient, to permit further solicitation and vote of proxies in the event that there are insufficient votes for, or otherwise in connection with, the approval of the Extension Proposal (the “Adjournment Proposal”). The Special Meeting was held on March 21, 2023 and the Extension Proposal and the Adjournment Proposal were approved.
In connection with approval of the Extension Proposal, the holders of 7,744,085 shares of common stock of the Company properly exercised their right to redeem their shares for cash at a redemption price of approximately $10.17 per share, for an aggregate redemption amount of approximately $78,770,623. As a result, approximately $78,770,623 will be removed from the Company’s Trust Account to pay such holders. Following redemptions, the Company has 8,917,715 shares of common stock outstanding.
Additionally, in connection with the approval of the Extension Proposal, the sponsor or its designees have agreed to contribute to the Company as a note (i) the lesser of (a) an aggregate of $600,000 or (b) $0.04 for each public share on a monthly basis that is not redeemed in connection with the Extension Amendment for the portion of the Extension ending on June 23, 2023 (the “Initial Contribution”); plus, (ii) an aggregate of $200,000 per month (commencing on June 23, 2023 and on the 23rd day of each subsequent month) until the charter extension date (each, an “Extension Period”), or portion thereof, that is needed to complete an initial business combination (such loans, together with the Initial Contribution, the “Contribution”), which amount will be deposited into the Trust Account. Accordingly, the amount deposited per share depends on the number of public shares that remain outstanding after the redemption and the length of the extension period that will be needed to complete an initial business combination.
On March 23, 2023, the Company filed an amendment to its amended and restated certificate of incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware to extend the date by which the Company has to consummate a business combination to from March 25, 2023 to September 25, 2023.
On March 24, 2023, the Company deposited the Initial Contribution and will deposit an aggregate of $200,000 per month during each Extension Period, or portion thereof, that is needed to complete an initial business combination, which amount will be deposited into the Trust Account.
For additional information regarding the Special Meeting and related matters, see Note 11. Subsequent Events in the Notes to the Financial Statements.

Related Agreements
This section describes the material provisions of certain additional agreements entered into or to be entered into pursuant to or in connection with the Merger Agreement (the “Ancillary Agreements”) but does not purport to describe all of the terms thereof. The following summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the complete text of each of the Ancillary Agreements, a copy of which is filed as an exhibit and incorporated herein by reference.
Voting Agreement
In connection with entry into the Merger Agreement, Company and certain holders of Infinite Reality Common Stock will enter into a voting agreement (the “Voting Agreement”), pursuant to which, among other things, each such holder has agreed to vote in favor of the Merger Agreement and the Infinite Reality Merger, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Voting Agreements.
Sponsor Letter Agreement
In connection with the entry into the Merger Agreement, the Company, Infinite Reality, Pubco and the sponsor entered into a sponsor letter agreement (the “Sponsor Letter Agreement”) pursuant to which the sponsor has agreed to vote in favor of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby on the terms and conditions set forth in the Sponsor Letter Agreement.
Pursuant to the Sponsor Letter Agreement, the sponsor has also agreed that it will not transfer any shares of Pubco Common Stock held by the sponsor immediately following the Closing issued in exchange for the founder shares held by the sponsor (the “Sponsor Lock-Up Shares”) until the end of the applicable Sponsor Lock-Up Period (as defined below) with respect to such Sponsor Lock-Up Shares. As used in the Sponsor Letter Agreement, the “Sponsor Lock-Up Period” means the period beginning on the date of the Sponsor Letter Agreement and ending (i) in respect of Sponsor Lock-Up Shares of the sponsor (other than those Sponsor Lock-Up Shares specified in clause (ii) below), on the earlier to occur of (A) the date that is six calendar months after the Closing Date or (B) the Pubco Common Stock VWAP for the preceding thirty (30) consecutive trading days equals or exceeds $13.50; and (ii) in respect of Sponsor Lock-Up Shares which are allocable to the officers and directors of the sponsor, on the earlier to occur of (A) the date that is eighteen (18) calendar months after the Closing Date or (B) the termination of the Contingent Value Rights Agreement (the “CVR Agreement”) in accordance with its terms.
Lock-Up Agreement
In connection with its entry into the Merger Agreement, Infinite Reality shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, as promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of the Merger Agreement, from the holders of 1% or more of Infinite Reality stock each member of the Infinite Reality board of directors, and each officer of Infinite Reality (collectively, the “Infinite Reality Holders”), to execute lock-up agreements with Pubco (each, a “Lock-Up Agreement”), pursuant to which each Infinite Reality Holder will agree not to, during the Lock-Up Period (as defined below), offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge or otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, any of the shares issued in connection with the Mergers (the “Lock-Up Shares”), enter into a transaction that would have the same effect, or enter into any swap, hedge or other arrangement that transfers, in whole or in part, any of the economic consequences of ownership of such shares, whether any of these transactions are to be settled by delivery of any such shares, in cash, or otherwise.
As used in the Lock-Up Agreement, the “Lock-Up Period” means the period commencing on the Closing Date and ending (i) in respect of each Infinite Reality Holder (other than Infinite Reality Holders specified in clause (ii) below) and their permitted transferees, the earlier to occur of (A) the date that is six calendar months after the Closing Date or (B) the Pubco Common Stock VWAP for the preceding thirty (30) consecutive trading days equals or exceeds $13.50; and (ii) in respect of each Infinite Reality Holder who is an officer, director, or 5% beneficial owner of Infinite Reality and their permitted transferees, on the earlier to occur of (A) the date that is eighteen (18) calendar months after the Closing Date or (B) the termination of the CVR Agreement in accordance with its terms.

Contingent Value Rights Agreement
At or prior to the Closing, Pubco will enter into a CVR Agreement with a rights agent (“Rights Agent”) pursuant to which the holders of Company Common Stock (other than holders of Excluded Shares and founder shares, in respect of such shares) outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will receive one contingent value right (each, a “CVR”) for each one whole share of Company Common Stock held by such stockholder on such date. Each CVR will represent the contractual right to receive a contingent payment in the form of shares of Pubco Common Stock (or in such other form as is provided for in the CVR Agreement), in an amount to be determined on the CVR Maturity Date (as that term is defined in the CVR Agreement), and to be paid as soon as practicable after the Settlement Date but not after the Payment Date (or, if earlier, upon a Change of Control) (as such terms are defined in the CVR Agreement). The payment to be received pursuant to each CVR is an amount calculated as a function of the excess of the Target Value over the Achieved Value up to the Share Cap (as such terms are defined in the CVR Agreement). 
The contingent payments under the CVR Agreement, if they become payable, will become payable to the Rights Agent for subsequent distribution to the holders of the CVRs. There can be no assurance that any payment of any shares of Pubco Common Stock will be made or that any holders of CVRs will receive any amounts with respect thereto.
The right to the contingent payments contemplated by the CVR Agreement is a contractual right only and will not be transferable, except in the limited circumstances specified in the CVR Agreement. The CVRs will be evidenced by certificates for Pubco Units registered in the names of the holders thereof (which certificates shall also be deemed to be certificates representing CVRs) and not by separate CVR certificates. The CVRs will not have any voting or dividend rights and will not represent any equity or ownership interest in Pubco or any of its affiliates. No interest will accrue on any amounts payable in respect of the CVRs.
Other Ancillary Agreements
As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of the Merger Agreement, Infinite Reality and the Company shall negotiate in good faith and prepare (i) a registration rights agreement of Pubco, (ii) an amendment to the Warrant Agreement, dated as of March 22, 2021, by and between the Company and Continental, and (iii) the forms of amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws of Pubco (such forms together, the “Amended Pubco Charter”), in form and substance reasonably acceptable to each of the parties, in each case to be effective upon the Closing. 
Other than as specifically discussed, this Report does not assume the closing of the Infinite Reality Business Combination.
Industry Opportunity
The Covid-19 pandemic has accelerated multiple trends that were already underway in the media, consumer, sports, and/or entertainment industries. Convergence among each of the four industries, strengthened by technology, has brought about opportunities for businesses to grow and attract consumers.
The global video streaming market was valued at $50.1 billion in 2020 and is expected to grow 20.4% from 2020 to 2027. The popularity of such platforms has increased as a result of economic lockdowns, and there is higher viewership demand for major video streaming platforms, with Over-The-Top (“OTT”) media services (i.e. media content delivered over the Internet without the involvement of a traditional cable provider) accounting for 40% of global video streaming revenues in 2019, higher than traditional cable and pay-TV. The high penetration of smart devices, like smart TV and smartphone, growing demand for Video on Demand (VoD) content, and a high rate of per-user payment are some of the major factors driving the OTT market. The surging percentage of viewing time going to OTT video content is also changing the global entertainment landscape. According to the Arizona-based Limelight Networks, globally, viewers spend an average of 6.8 hours per week consuming OTT video, with the United States topping the averages at 8.6 hours.
The sports industry has also been profoundly affected by the Covid-19 pandemic. Multiple sporting events in the United States were delayed or outright cancelled. This has resulted in eSports filling in the void created by the disappearance of traditional sports on television, with positive responses from fans and consumers, being made possible by the prevalence of streaming services. Two such instances include the eNASCAR iRAcing Pro Invitational Series on Fox Sports 1, and the NBA 2K game between Phoenix Suns and Dallas Mavericks, which attracted 1.6 million and 221,000 viewers, respectively.

Additionally, the success of video streaming platforms has led to changes in the way studios release movies, as consumers watch more films from home on streaming video services. As a result, several studios have released movies in the form of Premium Video on Demand (“PVoD”) services. During the early phase of COVID-19 stay at home orders, Deloitte found that 22% of consumers had paid to rent or watch a PVoD movie, and 90% of those said they would do so again. As the pandemic has continued, studios have released more movies via PVoD, and viewership has grown. As of October 2020, 35% of consumers say they’ve watched a PVoD release.
In the coming decade, the metaverse is also emerging as the biggest new growth opportunity for several industries, given the sheer breadth of potential applications and uses and the degree of investment from large technology companies, venture capital funds, and corporations and brands. By 2023, the metaverse may generate up to $5 trillion across consumer and enterprise use cases. Industries are already implementing metaverse initiatives, although most efforts to date have been centered around marketing; learning and development for employees; virtual meetings, events, or conferences; and product design or digital twinning applications.
Of all the potential drivers of the economic impact of the metaverse, e-commerce is the largest. It is estimated to have a market impact of $2 trillion to $2.6 trillion by 2030 depending on whether a base or upside case for the metaverse’s development is realized, a contribution which is expected to dwarf sectors such as academic virtual learning (an estimated $180 billion to $270 billion impact), advertising (an estimated $144 billion to $206 billion impact), and gaming (an estimated $108 billion to $125 billion impact). 
Gaming eclipses other subsectors of the entertainment industry with its popularity. With more than three billion users globally and a total value of more than $200 billion, the gaming sector is currently a larger industry than movies and music. Consumers and companies are already experimenting with the early metaverse from socializing to fitness, commerce, virtual learning, and scores of other daily activities. While gaming is already mainstream (and providing the largest current online worlds in terms of players), additional use cases are emerging rapidly—including new AR/VR-powered social-media experiences, immersive retail, entertainment, sports, and education.
Our Business Strategy & Competitive Strengths
We have focused our search for an initial business combination with private companies, such as Infinite Reality, that have compelling unit economics combined with a clear path to positive operating cash flow. Our selection process is leveraging a unique set of relationships with proven deal-sourcing capabilities to provide us with a strong pipeline of potential targets. We expect to distinguish ourselves with our ability to:

● | Leverage our Extensive Network of Relationships to Create a Significant Pipeline Acquisition Opportunities. We believe the combination of our officers’, directors’ and advisors’ broad investment and operating experience in addition to our ability to access a deep network of public and private enterprises, experienced operators, restructuring advisors, attorneys, accountants, family offices, hedge funds, and private equity firms enables us to identify and evaluate compelling target businesses, such as Infinite Reality. Our officers and directors all remain active in identifying special opportunities and situations where there are clear catalysts for value transformation, solid growth trajectory and ability to scale beyond the domestic market.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Access a Wide Range of Global Opportunities. We believe the diverse, international experiences of our management team, advisors and sponsor provides us access to opportunities across multiple geographies. Our management team and advisors have previously invested in and built companies in North America, Europe and Asia, which offers additional growth vectors to a North American target and further areas to source potential follow-on targets.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Employ a Rigorous Systematic Process of Identifying Target Companies and Acquiring a Business that will Be Well-Received by the Public Markets. We believe that our management’s strong M&A and investment track record in both private and public markets, combined with extensive public market trading experience, provides a distinct advantage for identifying, valuing and completing a business combination that will meet our investors’ expectations.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Provide an Alternative Path to Becoming Public. We believe our structure makes us an attractive business combination partner to prospective target businesses that desire to become a publicly listed company. A merger with us will offer a target business an alternative path to a public listing rather than the traditional initial public offering process. We believe that target businesses may favor this alternative, which we believe is less expensive, while offering greater certainty of execution than the traditional

initial public offering. Furthermore, once a proposed business combination is approved by our stockholders and the transaction is consummated, the target business will have effectively become public, whereas an initial public offering is always subject to the underwriters’ ability to complete the offering, as well as general market conditions that could prevent the offering from occurring. Once public, we believe the target business should have greater access to capital and additional means of creating management incentives that are better aligned with stockholders’ interests than it would as a private company. A public company can offer further benefits by augmenting a company’s profile among potential new customers and vendors and aid in attracting talented management.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Offer Solid Execution and Structuring Capability. We believe that our management team’s and sponsor’s combined industry expertise and reputation allows them to source and complete transactions possessing structural attributes that create an attractive investment thesis. These types of transactions are typically complex and require creativity, industry knowledge and expertise, rigorous due diligence, and extensive negotiations and documentation. We believe that by focusing our investment activities on these types of transactions, we are able to generate investment opportunities that have attractive risk/reward profiles based on their valuations and structural characteristics.

● | Build and Operate Successful Multi-Billion Dollar Companies. Our management, board and advisors have decades of experience building and operating multibillion-dollar companies and have the ability to identify attractive candidates for our initial business combination. A distinguishing factor for our organization is the potential for any of our management, board or advisors to remain involved in an operating or board capacity of the newly public company post transaction. Our team has experience fostering relationships with sellers, capital providers and target management teams. Our team has also has experience integrating businesses acquired in mergers and acquisitions, and are capable of growing a business organically or inorganically if needed.

Acquisition Criteria
We have identified the following general criteria and guidelines which we believe are important in evaluating prospective target businesses, such as Infinite Reality. While we have used these criteria and guidelines in evaluating acquisition opportunities and initially target businesses with enterprise values of approximately $500 million to $2.5 billion, we may decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that only meets some but not all of these criteria and guidelines. We intend to acquire one or more businesses, like Infinite Reality, that we believe has the following characteristics:

● | Benefits from a Public Currency and Access to Public Equity Markets. Access to the public equity markets could allow the target company to utilize additional forms of capital, enhancing its ability to pursue accretive acquisitions, high-return capital projects, and/or strengthen its balance sheet and recruit and retain key employees through the use of publicly-traded equity compensation.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Has a Strong Competitive Position and Growing Platform. We seek to acquire companies that we believe possess not only established business models and sustainable competitive advantages, but also a growing platform for equity investors.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Has an Ability to Scale beyond Domestic Market. We look for a company with a product or platform which can be relevant internationally. We aim to replicate the competitive advantages within new markets as we assist the company expand.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Operated by a Talented and Incentivized Management Team. We are focusing on companies with strong and experienced management teams that desire a significant equity stake in the post-business combination company. We seek to partner with a management team and/or sellers who are well-incentivized and aligned in an effort to create stockholder value.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Benefits from Our Ability to Structure Transaction to Unlock and Maximize Value. We look for situations where our extensive experience and creativity can architect a win-win solution for both sides of the transaction.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Has Revenue and Earnings Growth Potential. We seek to acquire one or more businesses that have multiple, diverse potential drivers of revenue and earnings growth.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | In the Technology Industry and can Benefit from the Extensive Networks and Insights We Have Built. We seek targets that can use technology to drive operational improvements and efficiency gains or use technology solutions to differentiate offerings and enhance their strategic positions, and that will benefit from the extensive contacts our management team has built in such industries.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that our management may deem relevant. In the event that we decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that only meets some but not all of the above criteria and guidelines, we will disclose that the target business does not meet the above criteria in our stockholder communications related to our initial business combination, which, as discussed in this Report, would be in the form of tender offer documents or proxy solicitation materials that we would file with the SEC.
Our Acquisition Process
In evaluating a prospective target business, we conduct thorough due diligence that encompasses, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, inspection of facilities, as well as a review of financial and other information made available to us. We utilize our operational and capital allocation experience. We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions that our initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view.
Members of our management team and our independent directors directly or indirectly own founder shares, private shares and/or private warrants and, accordingly, may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial business combination. Further, each of our officers and directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination if the retention or resignation of any such officers and directors was included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our initial business combination. Each of our officers and directors presently has, and any of them in the future may have additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity. Accordingly, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such opportunity to such entity. We do not believe, however, that the fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our officers or directors will materially affect our ability to complete our business combination.
Initial Business Combination
Nasdaq rules and our amended and restated certificate of incorporation require that our initial business combination must occur with one or more target businesses, including Infinite Reality, that together have an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the assets held in the trust account (excluding taxes payable on the income earned on the trust account) at the time of the agreement to enter into the initial business combination. If our board is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria.
Effecting a Business Combination
General
We are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any substantive commercial business until we consummate our initial business combination with Infinite Reality or another target (and we have not identified any other potential targets for our initial business combination). We intend to utilize cash derived from the proceeds of our initial public offering and the sale of private units, our capital stock, debt or a combination of these in effecting a business combination. A business combination may involve the acquisition of, or merger with, a company which does not need substantial additional capital, but which desires to establish a public trading market for its shares, while avoiding what it may deem to be adverse consequences of undertaking a public offering itself. These include time delays, significant expense, loss of voting control and compliance with various federal and state securities laws. In the alternative, we may seek to consummate a business combination with a company that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth. While we may seek to effect simultaneous business combinations with more than one target business, we will probably have the ability, as a result of our limited resources, to effect only a single business combination.

Sources of Target Businesses
While we have selected Infinite Reality as the target business with which to consummate our initial business combination, we believe based on our management’s business knowledge and past experience that there are numerous potential candidates if the Infinite Reality Business Combination is not consummated. Our principal means of identifying potential target businesses are through the extensive contacts and relationships of our sponsor, initial stockholders, officers, directors and advisors. While our officers and directors are not required to commit any specific amount of time in identifying or performing due diligence on potential target businesses, our officers and directors believe that the relationships they have developed over their careers and their access to our sponsor’s contacts and resources will generate a number of potential business combination opportunities that will warrant further investigation. We also anticipate that target business candidates will be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment bankers, venture capital funds, private equity funds, leveraged buyout funds, management buyout funds and other members of the financial community. Target businesses may be brought to our attention by such unaffiliated sources as a result of being solicited by us through calls or mailings. These sources may also introduce us to target businesses they think we may be interested in on an unsolicited basis, since many of these sources will have read this report and know what types of businesses we are targeting.
Our officers and directors must present to us all target business opportunities that have a fair market value of at least 80% of the assets held in the trust account at the time of the agreement to enter into the initial business combination, subject to any pre-existing fiduciary or contractual obligations. While we do not presently anticipate engaging the services of professional firms or other individuals that specialize in business acquisitions on any formal basis (other than EBC as described elsewhere in this Report), we may engage these firms or other individuals in the future, in which event we may pay a finder’s fee, consulting fee or other compensation to be determined in an arm’s length negotiation based on the terms of the transaction. In no event, however, will our sponsor, initial stockholders, officers, directors or their respective affiliates be paid any compensation prior to, or for any services they render in order to effectuate, the consummation of an initial business combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is) other than the $10,000 per month administrative fee, the payment of consulting, success or finder fees in connection with the consummation of our initial business combination, the repayment of the $300,000 loan and reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses. Our audit committee reviews and approves all reimbursements and payments made to our sponsor, officers, directors or our or their respective affiliates, with any interested director abstaining from such review and approval.
We have no present intention to enter into a business combination with a target business that is affiliated with any of our officers, directors or sponsor and Infinite Reality is not affiliated with any of our officers, directors or our sponsor. However, we are not restricted from entering into any such transactions and may do so if (i) such transaction is approved by a majority of our disinterested independent directors and (ii) we obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm, or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions, that the business combination is fair to our unaffiliated stockholders from a financial point of view.
Selection of a Target Business and Structuring of a Business Combination
Subject to our management team’s pre-existing fiduciary obligations and the limitations that a target business, including Infinite Reality, have a fair market value of at least 80% of the balance in the trust account at the time of the execution of a definitive agreement for our initial business combination, as described below in more detail, and that we must acquire a controlling interest in the target business, our management has virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting a prospective target business. We have not established any specific attributes or criteria (financial or otherwise) for prospective target businesses. In evaluating a prospective target business, our management may consider a variety of factors, including one or more of the following:

● | financial condition and results of operation;
--+----------------------------------------------


● | growth potential;
--+------------------


● | brand recognition and potential;
--+---------------------------------


● | experience and skill of management and availability of additional personnel;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | capital requirements;
--+----------------------


● | competitive position;
--+----------------------


● | barriers to entry;
--+-------------------


● | stage of development of the products, processes or services;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


● | existing distribution and potential for expansion;
--+---------------------------------------------------

15




● | degree of current or potential market acceptance of the products, processes or services;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | proprietary aspects of products and the extent of intellectual property or other protection for products or formulas;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | impact of regulation on the business;
--+--------------------------------------


● | regulatory environment of the industry;
--+----------------------------------------


● | costs associated with effecting the business combination;
--+----------------------------------------------------------


● | industry leadership, sustainability of market share and attractiveness of market industries in which a target business participates; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | macro competitive dynamics in the industry within which the company competes.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular business combination will be based, to the extent relevant, on the above factors as well as other considerations deemed relevant by our management in effecting a business combination consistent with our business objective. In evaluating a prospective target business, we conduct an extensive due diligence review which encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and inspection of facilities, as well as review of financial and other information which is made available to us. This due diligence review is conducted either by our management or by unaffiliated third parties we may engage, although we have no current intention to engage any such third parties.
The time and costs required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete the business combination, including the Infinite Reality Business Combination, cannot presently be ascertained with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which a business combination is not ultimately completed, including the Infinite Reality Business Combination, will result in a loss to us and reduce the amount of capital available to otherwise complete a business combination.
Fair Market Value of Target Business
Nasdaq listing rules require that the target business or businesses that we acquire must collectively have a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the balance of the funds in the trust account at the time of the execution of a definitive agreement for our initial business combination and Infinite Reality met this requirement at the time we entered into the Merger Agreement with them. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if we are not then listed on Nasdaq for whatever reason, we would no longer be required to meet the foregoing 80% fair market value test.
We currently anticipate structuring a business combination to acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination where we merge directly with the target business or a newly formed subsidiary or where we acquire less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or stockholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we could acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target; however, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of trust account balance test.
The fair market value of the target will be determined by our board of directors based upon one or more standards generally accepted by the financial community (such as actual and potential sales, earnings, cash flow and/or book value). The proxy solicitation materials or tender offer documents used by us in connection with any proposed transaction will provide public stockholders with our analysis of the fair market value of the target business, as well as the basis for our determinations. If our board is not able to independently determine that the target business has a sufficient fair market value, we will obtain an opinion from an unaffiliated, independent investment banking firm, or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions, with respect to the satisfaction of 

16



such criteria. We will not be required to obtain an opinion from an investment banking firm as to the fair market value if our board of directors independently determines that the target business complies with the 80% threshold.
Lack of Business Diversification
We may seek to effect a business combination with more than one target business, although we expect to complete our initial business combination with just one business, like Infinite Reality, although there is no assurance that we will complete the Infinite Reality Business Combination. Therefore, at least initially, the prospects for our success may be entirely dependent upon the future performance of a single business operation. Unlike other entities which may have the resources to complete several business combinations of entities operating in multiple industries or multiple areas of a single industry, it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations or benefit from the possible spreading of risks or offsetting of losses. By consummating a business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may:

● | subject us to numerous economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact upon the particular industry in which we may operate subsequent to a business combination, and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | result in our dependency upon the performance of a single operating business or the development or market acceptance of a single or limited number of products, processes or services.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If we determine to simultaneously acquire several businesses and such businesses are owned by different sellers, we will need for each of such sellers to agree that our purchase of its business is contingent on the simultaneous closings of the other acquisitions, which may make it more difficult for us, and delay our ability, to complete the business combination. With multiple acquisitions, we could also face additional risks, including additional burdens and costs with respect to possible multiple negotiations and due diligence investigations (if there are multiple sellers) and the additional risks associated with the subsequent assimilation of the operations and services or products of the acquired companies in a single operating business.

Limited Ability to Evaluate the Target Business’ Management
Although we have scrutinized the management of a prospective target business, including the Infinite Reality management team, when evaluating the desirability of effecting a business combination and plan to continue to do so in the event the Infinite Reality Business Combination is not consummated and we seek other business combination opportunities, we cannot assure you that our assessment of the target business’ management will prove to be correct. In addition, we cannot assure you that the future management will have the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. Furthermore, the future role of our officers and directors, if any, in the target business following a business combination cannot presently be stated with any certainty. While it is possible that some of our key personnel will remain associated in senior management or advisory positions with us following a business combination, including the Infinite Reality Business Combination, it is unlikely that they will devote their full-time efforts to our affairs subsequent to our business combination. Moreover, they would only be able to remain with the company after the consummation of our business combination if they are able to negotiate employment or consulting agreements in connection with the business combination. Such negotiations would take place simultaneously with the negotiation of the business combination and could provide for them to receive compensation in the form of cash payments and/or our securities for services they would render to the company after the consummation of the business combination. While the personal and financial interests of our key personnel may influence their motivation in identifying and selecting a target business, their ability to remain with the company after the consummation of a business combination will not be the determining factor in our decision as to whether or not we will proceed with any potential business combination. Additionally, we cannot assure you that our officers and directors will have significant experience or knowledge relating to the operations of the particular target business.
Following a business combination, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management of the target business. We cannot assure you that we will have the ability to recruit additional managers, or that any such additional managers we do recruit will have the requisite skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management.
Stockholders May Not Have the Ability to Approve an Initial Business Combination
In connection with any proposed business combination, we will either (1) seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination at a meeting called for such purpose at which stockholders may seek to redeem their shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination or do not vote at all, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable), or (2) provide our stockholders with the opportunity to sell their shares to us by means of a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a stockholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable), in each case subject to the limitations described herein. The decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of a proposed business combination or will allow stockholders to sell their shares to us in a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would otherwise require us to seek stockholder approval. If we determine to engage in a tender offer, such tender offer will be structured so that each stockholder may tender all of his, her or its shares rather than some pro rata portion of his, her or its shares. In that case, we will file tender offer documents with the SEC which will contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination as is required under the SEC’s proxy rules. Whether we seek stockholder approval or engage in a tender offer, we will consummate our initial business combination only if we have net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 immediately prior to or upon consummation of such business combination and, if we seek stockholder approval, a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the business combination. We have no specified maximum percentage threshold for redemptions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and even those public stockholders who vote in favor of our initial business combination have the right to redeem their public shares. As a result, this may make it easier for us to consummate our initial business combination.
We chose our net tangible asset threshold of $5,000,001 to ensure that we would avoid being subject to Rule 419 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. However, if we seek to consummate an initial business combination with a target business that imposes any type of working capital closing condition or requires us to have a minimum amount of funds available from the trust account upon consummation of such initial business combination, we may need to have more than $5,000,001 in net tangible assets immediately prior to or upon consummation and this may force us to seek third party financing which may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, the Company must have cash and cash equivalents of equal to or more than $50,000,000 in order for Infinite Reality to consummate the Infinite Reality Business Combination. Consequently, we will need to arrange third party financing in order complete our business combination with Infinite Reality. As of the date of this Report, we have no binding commitments for any third party or other financing. As a result, we may not be able to consummate such initial business 

18



combination and we may not be able to locate another suitable target within the applicable time period, if at all. Public stockholders may therefore have to wait until the end of the Combination Period, or to such extended date as may be approved by our stockholders to consummate an initial business combination in order to be able to receive a pro rata share of the trust account.
We have extended the initial deadline by which we must consummate our initial business combination from March 25, 2023 to September 25, 2023 and may seek to further extend the deadline. Such an extension requires the approval of our public shareholders to amend our charter, who will be provided the opportunity to at that time to redeem all or a portion their shares which would likely have a material adverse effect on the amount held in our trust account and other adverse effects on our company, such as our ability to maintain our listing on Nasdaq.
Our sponsor, initial stockholders, officers and directors have agreed (1) to vote any shares of common stock owned by them in favor of any proposed business combination, (2) not to redeem any shares of common stock in connection with a stockholder vote to approve a proposed initial business combination and (3) not sell any shares of common stock in any tender in connection with a proposed initial business combination.
None of our officers, directors, sponsor, initial stockholders or their affiliates has indicated any intention to purchase units or shares of common stock from persons in the open market or in private transactions. However, if we hold a meeting to approve a proposed business combination and a significant number of stockholders vote, or indicate an intention to vote, against such proposed business combination or that they wish to redeem their shares, our officers, directors, sponsor, initial stockholders or their affiliates could make such purchases in the open market or in private transactions in order to influence the vote and reduce the number of redemptions. Notwithstanding the foregoing, our officers, directors, sponsor, initial stockholders and their affiliates will not make purchases of shares of common stock if the purchases would violate Section 9(a)(2) or Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act, which are rules designed to stop potential manipulation of a company’s stock.
Redemption Rights
At any meeting called to approve an initial business combination, including the Infinite Reality Business Combination, public stockholders may seek to redeem their shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination or do not vote at all, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial business combination, less any taxes then due but not yet paid. As of December 31, 2022, the amount in the trust account was approximately $10.12 per share. Alternatively, we may provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to sell their shares of our common stock to us through a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a stockholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, less any taxes then due but not yet paid. We will also provide the opportunity to redeem to our public stockholders should we seek approval to amend our charter to extend the deadline by which we are required to consummate our initial business combination.
Our sponsor, initial stockholders and our officers and directors will not have redemption rights with respect to any shares of common stock owned by them, directly or indirectly, whether acquired prior to our initial public offering or purchased by them in our initial public offering or in the aftermarket. Additionally, the holders of the representative shares and the private shares will not have redemption rights with respect to the representative shares and the private shares.
We may require public stockholders, whether they are a record holder or hold their shares in “street name,” to either (i) tender their certificates to our transfer agent or (ii) deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using DWAC System, at the holder’s option, in each case prior to a date set forth in the proxy materials sent in connection with the proposal to approve the business combination.
There is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced delivery process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC System. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker a nominal amount and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise redemption rights. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising redemption rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated. However, in the event we require stockholders seeking to exercise redemption rights prior to the consummation of the proposed business combination and the proposed business combination is not consummated this may result in an increased cost to stockholders.

19



Any proxy solicitation materials we furnish to stockholders in connection with a vote for any proposed initial business combination will indicate whether we are requiring stockholders to satisfy such certification and delivery requirements. Accordingly, a stockholder would have from the time the stockholder received our proxy statement up until the vote on the proposal to approve the business combination to deliver his, her or its shares if he, she or it wishes to seek to exercise his, her or its redemption rights. This time period varies depending on the specific facts of each transaction. However, as the delivery process can be accomplished by the stockholder, whether or not he is a record holder or his, her, or its shares are held in “street name,” in a matter of hours by simply contacting the transfer agent or his, her, or its broker and requesting delivery of his, her or its shares through the DWAC System, we believe this time period is sufficient for an average investor. However, we cannot assure you of this fact. Please see the risk factor titled “In connection with any stockholder meeting called to approve a proposed initial business combination, we may require stockholders who wish to redeem their shares in connection with a proposed business combination to comply with specific requirements for redemption that may make it more difficult for them to exercise their redemption rights prior to the deadline for exercising their rights” for further information on the risks of failing to comply with these requirements.
Any request to redeem such shares once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to the vote on the proposed business combination or the expiration of the tender offer. Furthermore, if a holder of public shares delivered his, her or its certificate in connection with an election of their redemption and subsequently decides prior to the applicable date not to elect to exercise such rights, he may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically).
If the initial business combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public stockholders who elected to exercise their redemption rights would not be entitled to redeem their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the trust account. In such case, we will promptly return any shares delivered by public holders.
If the Infinite Reality Business Combination is not completed by the end of the Combination Period, we may, with stockholder approval, extend the period of time to complete the Infinite Reality Business Combination or an initial business combination with a different target or to liquidate if we fail to complete an initial business combination within the extended period of time.
In connection with the Special Meeting and the approval of the Extension Proposal, the holders of 7,744,085 shares of common stock of the Company properly exercised their right to redeem their shares for cash at a redemption price of approximately $10.17 per share, for an aggregate redemption amount of approximately $78,770,623. As a result, approximately $78,770,623 will be removed from the Company’s Trust Account to pay such holders. Following redemptions, the Company has 8,917,715 shares of common stock outstanding.

Liquidation if No Business Combination
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, as amended, provides that we will have until the end of the Combination Period to complete an initial business combination. We may also elect to seek to extend the deadline by which we must consummate our initial business combination. If we have not completed an initial business combination within the Combination Period, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem 100% of the outstanding public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including any interest not previously released to us but net of taxes payable, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject (in the case of (ii) and (iii) above) to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law.
Our sponsor, initial stockholders, officers and directors have agreed that they will not propose any amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation that would affect our public stockholders’ ability to redeem or sell their shares to us in connection with a business combination as described herein or affect the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete a business combination within the Combination Period, unless we provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their shares of common stock upon such approval at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest not previously released to us but net of franchise and income taxes payable, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares. This redemption right shall apply in the event of the approval of any such amendment, whether proposed by our sponsor, initial stockholders, executive officers, directors or any other person.
Under the DGCL, stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against a corporation to the extent of distributions received by them in a dissolution. The pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of 100% of our outstanding public shares in the event we do not complete our initial business combination within the required time period may be considered a liquidation distribution under Delaware law. If the corporation complies with certain procedures set forth in Section 280 of the DGCL intended to ensure that it makes reasonable provision for all claims against it, including a 60-day notice period during which any third-party claims can be brought against the corporation, a 90-day period during which the corporation may reject any claims brought, and an additional 150-day waiting period before any liquidating distributions are made to stockholders, any liability of stockholders with respect to a liquidating distribution is limited to the lesser of such stockholder’s pro rata share of the claim or the amount distributed to the stockholder, and any liability of the stockholder would be barred after the third anniversary of the dissolution. It is our intention to redeem our public shares as soon as reasonably possible following the end of the Combination Period, and, therefore, we do not intend to comply with those procedures. As such, our stockholders could potentially be liable for any claims to the extent of distributions received by them (but no more) and any liability of our stockholders may extend well beyond the third anniversary of such date.
Furthermore, if the pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of 100% of our public shares in the event we do not complete our initial business combination within the required time period is not considered a liquidation distribution under Delaware law and such redemption distribution is deemed to be unlawful, then pursuant to Section 174 of the DGCL, the statute of limitations for claims of creditors could then be six years after the unlawful redemption distribution, instead of three years, as in the case of a liquidation distribution.
Because we will not be complying with Section 280 of the DGCL, Section 281(b) of the DGCL requires us to adopt a plan, based on facts known to us at such time that will provide for our payment of all existing and pending claims or claims that may be potentially brought against us within the subsequent ten years. However, because we are a blank check company, rather than an operating company, and our operations will be limited to searching for prospective target businesses to acquire, the only likely claims to arise would be from our vendors (such as lawyers, investment bankers, etc.) or prospective target businesses.

21



We are required to seek to have all third parties (including any vendors or other entities we engage after our initial public offering) and any prospective target businesses enter into agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind they may have in or to any monies held in the trust account. As a result, the claims that could be made against us will be limited, thereby lessening the likelihood that any claim would result in any liability extending to the trust. We therefore believe that any necessary provision for creditors will be reduced and should not have a significant impact on our ability to distribute the funds in the trust account to our public stockholders. Nevertheless, Marcum, our independent registered public accounting firm, and the underwriters of our initial public offering, will not execute agreements with us waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account. Furthermore, there is no guarantee that other vendors, service providers and prospective target businesses will execute such agreements. Nor is there any guarantee that, even if they execute such agreements with us, they will not seek recourse against the trust account. Our sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to ensure that the proceeds in the trust account are not reduced below $10.00 per share by the claims of target businesses or claims of vendors or other entities that are owed money by us for services rendered or contracted for or products sold to us, but we cannot assure you that it will be able to satisfy its indemnification obligations if it is required to do so. We have not asked our sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations, nor have we independently verified whether our sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations and believe that our sponsor’s only assets are securities of our company. Therefore, we believe it is unlikely that our sponsor will be able to satisfy its indemnification obligations if it is required to do so. Additionally, the agreement our sponsor entered into specifically provides for two exceptions to the indemnity it has given: it will have no liability (1) as to any claimed amounts owed to a target business or vendor or other entity who has executed an agreement with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind they may have in or to any monies held in the trust account, or (2) as to any claims for indemnification by the underwriters of our initial public offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. As a result, if we liquidate, the per-share distribution from the trust account could be less than $10.00 due to claims or potential claims of creditors.
We anticipate notifying the trustee of the trust account to begin liquidating such assets promptly after the end of the Combination Period and anticipate it will take no more than 10 business days to effectuate such distribution. The holders of the founder shares have waived their rights to participate in any liquidation distribution from the trust account with respect to such shares. There will be no distribution from the trust account with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless. We will pay the costs of any subsequent liquidation from our remaining assets outside of the trust account. If such funds are insufficient, our sponsor has contractually agreed to advance us the funds necessary to complete such liquidation (currently anticipated to be no more than approximately $100,000) and has contractually agreed not to seek repayment for such expenses.
If we are unable to complete an initial business combination and expend all of the net proceeds of our initial public offering, other than the proceeds deposited in the trust account, and without taking into account interest, if any, earned on the trust account, the initial per-share redemption price would be $10.00. As discussed above, the proceeds deposited in the trust account could become subject to claims of our creditors that are in preference to the claims of public stockholders.
Our public stockholders shall be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only in the event of our failure to complete a business combination within the Combination Period, if the stockholders seek to have us redeem or purchase their respective shares upon a business combination which is actually completed by us or upon certain amendments to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation prior to consummating an initial business combination. In no other circumstances shall a stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account.
If we are forced to file a bankruptcy case or an involuntary bankruptcy case is filed against us which is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our stockholders.
If we are forced to file a bankruptcy case or an involuntary bankruptcy case is filed against us which is not dismissed, any distributions received by stockholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy laws as either a “preferential transfer” or a “fraudulent conveyance.” As a result, a bankruptcy court could seek to recover all amounts received by our stockholders. Furthermore, because we intend to distribute the proceeds held in the trust account to our public stockholders promptly following the expiration of the Combination Period, this may be viewed or interpreted as giving preference to our public stockholders over any potential creditors with respect to access to or distributions from our assets.
Furthermore, our board may be viewed as having breached their fiduciary duties to our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, and thereby exposing itself and our company to claims of punitive damages, by paying public stockholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. We cannot assure you that claims will not be brought against us for these reasons.

Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation contains certain requirements and restrictions relating to our initial public offering that apply to us until the consummation of our initial business combination. These provisions cannot be amended without the approval of a majority of our stockholders. If we seek to amend any provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation that would affect our public stockholders’ ability to redeem or sell their shares to us in connection with a business combination as described herein or affect the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete a business combination by the end of the Combination Period, or to such extended date as may be approved by our stockholders to consummate an initial business combination, we will provide dissenting public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their public shares in connection with any such vote. This redemption right will apply in the event of the approval of any such amendment, whether proposed by our sponsor, any executive officer, director or any other person. Our sponsor, officers and directors have agreed to waive any redemption rights with respect to any founder shares and any public shares they may hold in connection with any vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. Specifically, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides, among other things, that:

● | we shall either (1) seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination at a meeting called for such purpose at which stockholders may seek to redeem their shares, regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination or do not vote at all, into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable), or (2) provide our stockholders with the opportunity to sell their shares to us by means of a tender offer (and thereby avoid the need for a stockholder vote) for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account (net of taxes payable), in each case subject to the limitations described herein;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | we will consummate our initial business combination only if we have net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 immediately prior to or upon consummation of such business combination and, if we seek stockholder approval, a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the business combination;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | if our initial business combination is not consummated or extended by the end of the Combination Period or to such extended date as may be approved by our stockholders to consummate an initial business combination, then we will redeem all of the outstanding public shares and thereafter liquidate and dissolve our company;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | we may not consummate any other business combination, merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar transaction prior to our initial business combination; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | prior to our initial business combination, we may not issue additional stock that participates in any manner in the proceeds of the trust account, or that votes as a class with the common stock sold in our initial public offering on an initial business combination.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Competition
In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Many of these competitors possess greater technical, human and other resources than us and our financial resources are relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors. While there may be numerous potential target businesses that we could acquire with the net proceeds of our initial public offering, our ability to compete in acquiring certain sizable target businesses may be limited by our available financial resources.
The following also may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses:

● | our obligation to seek stockholder approval of a business combination or engage in a tender offer may delay the completion of a transaction;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | our obligation to redeem or repurchase shares of common stock held by our public stockholders may reduce the resources available to us for a business combination; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | our outstanding warrants, and the potential future dilution they represent.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Any of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating a business combination. Our management believes, however, that our status as a public entity and potential access to the United States public equity markets may give us a competitive advantage over privately held entities having a similar business objective as ours in acquiring a target business 

23



with significant growth potential on favorable terms. If we succeed in effecting a business combination, there will be, in all likelihood, intense competition from competitors of the target business.
If we succeed in effecting a business combination, there will be, in all likelihood, intense competition from competitors of the target business. We cannot assure you that, subsequent to a business combination, we will have the resources or ability to compete effectively.
Facilities
We currently maintain our principal executive offices at 121 High Street, Floor 3, Boston, MA 02110. The cost for this space is included in the $10,000 per-month fee to our sponsor. We are charged for general and administrative services pursuant to a letter agreement between us and our sponsor. We believe, based on rents and fees for similar services, that the fee charged by our sponsor is at least as favorable as we could have obtained from an unaffiliated person. We consider our current office space adequate for our current operations.
Employees
We have two executive officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters and devote only as much time as they deem necessary to our affairs. The amount of time they devote in any time period is dependent on the stage of the business combination process the company is in. Accordingly, once a suitable target business to acquire has been located, such as Infinite Reality, management may spend more time investigating such target business and negotiating and processing the business combination (and consequently spend more time on our affairs) than had been spent prior to locating a suitable target business. We presently expect our executive officers to devote such amount of time as they reasonably believe is necessary to our business. We do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the consummation of a business combination.
Periodic Reporting and Audited Financial Statements
We have registered our units, common stock and warrants under the Exchange Act and have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, our annual report will contain financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public accountants.
We will provide stockholders with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of any proxy solicitation materials or tender offer documents sent to stockholders to assist them in assessing the target business. These financial statements will need to be prepared in accordance with or reconciled to GAAP or IFRS as promulgated by the International Accounting Standards Board. We cannot assure you that any particular target business identified by us as a potential acquisition candidate will have the necessary financial statements. To the extent that this requirement cannot be met, we may not be able to acquire the proposed target business.
Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we evaluate and report on our system of internal controls. As long as we maintain our status as an emerging growth company, we will not be required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirement on our internal control over financial reporting. The fact that we are a blank check company makes compliance with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act particularly burdensome on us as compared to other public companies because a target company with which we seek to complete our business combination may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of its internal controls. The development of the internal control of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition or merger.
We will remain an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.

24



In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following March 25, 2026, the fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.235 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period. References herein to “emerging growth company” shall have the meaning associated with it in the JOBS Act.
Additionally, we are a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds $250 million as of the end of that year’s second fiscal quarter, or (2) our annual revenues equals or exceeds $100 million during such completed fiscal year and the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds $700 million as of the end of that year’s second fiscal quarter.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
To the Shareholders and Board of Directors of
Newbury Street Acquisition Corporation
​
Opinion on the Financial Statements
​
We have audited the accompanying balance sheets of Newbury Street Acquisition Corporation (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related statements of operations, changes in stockholders’ deficit and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2022 and for the period from January 15, 2021 (inception) through December 31, 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2022 and for the period from January 15, 2021 (inception) through December 31, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
​
Explanatory Paragraph – Going Concern
​
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As more fully described in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company’s business plan is dependent on the completion of a business combination and the Company’s cash and working capital as of December 31, 2022 are not sufficient to complete its planned activities for a reasonable period of time, which is considered to be one year from the issuance date of the financial statements. The Company has also determined that the mandatory liquidation date is September 25, 2023. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. Management's plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties.
​
Basis for Opinion
​
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) ("PCAOB") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
​
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
​
Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

NOTE 1 ─ ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS OPERATIONS
Newbury Street Acquisition Corporation (the “Company”) was incorporated in Delaware on November 6, 2020. The Company is a blank check formed for the purpose of entering into a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses (the “Business Combination”).
While the Company may pursue an acquisition or business combination target in any business or industry, the Company intends to focus its search on a technology business in the consumer internet or media space, including sports and entertainment verticals. In particular, the Company shall focus on disruptive, high growth companies with a global ambition that take advantage of: (a) the rise of new consumer behaviors driven by the internet or new technologies, or (b) paradigm shifts in media, sports and entertainment that give rise to disruptive new entrants here to stay for the coming decades. The Company is an early stage and emerging growth company and, as such, the Company is subject to all of the risks associated with early stage and emerging growth companies. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had no operating activity. All activity from January 15, 2021 (commencement of operations) to December 31, 2022 relates to the Company’s formation and the public offering (the “Public Offering”). The Company will not generate any operating revenues until after the completion of a Business Combination, at the earliest. The Company generates non-operating income in the form of interest income or dividend income from the funds deposited derived in a trust account (the “Trust Account”). The Company has selected December 31 as its fiscal year end.
The Company’s management has broad discretion with respect to the specific application of the net proceeds of the Public Offering and the sale of the Private Units, although substantially all of the net proceeds are intended to be applied generally toward consummating a Business Combination. There is no assurance that the Company will be able to complete a Business Combination successfully. The Company must complete a Business Combination with one or more operating businesses or assets that together have an aggregate fair market value equal to at least 80% of the net assets held in the Trust Account, excluding taxes payable on the income earned on the trust account at the time of the Company’s signing a definitive agreement in connection with its initial Business Combination. The Company will only complete a Business Combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires an interest in the target business or assets sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”). There is no assurance that the Company will be able to successfully effect a Business Combination.
The Company will provide its holders of the outstanding Public Shares (the “public stockholders”) with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Public Shares upon the completion of a Business Combination either (i) in connection with a stockholder meeting called to approve the Business Combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether the Company will seek stockholder approval of a Business Combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by the Company. The public stockholders will be entitled to redeem their Public Shares for a pro rata portion of the amount then in the Trust Account (initially anticipated to be $10.00 per Public Share, plus any pro rata income earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company to pay its tax obligations). There will be no redemption rights upon the completion of a Business Combination with respect to the Company’s warrants. The Public Shares subject to redemption are recorded at redemption value and are classified as temporary equity in accordance with the Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 480 “Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity.” ​

NOTE 1 ─ ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS OPERATIONS (Continued)
The Company will proceed with a Business Combination if the Company has net tangible assets of at least $5,000,001 either prior to or upon such consummation of a Business Combination and, if the Company seeks stockholder approval, a majority of the shares voted are voted in favor of the Business Combination. If a stockholder vote is not required by applicable law or stock exchange rules and the Company does not decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other reasons, the Company will, pursuant to its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the “Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation”), conduct the redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing a Business Combination. If, however, stockholder approval of the transaction is required by applicable law or stock exchange rules, or the Company decides to obtain stockholder approval for business or other reasons, the Company will offer to redeem shares in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to the proxy rules and not pursuant to the tender offer rules. If the Company seeks stockholder approval in connection with a Business Combination, the Sponsor has agreed to vote its Founder Shares and any Public Shares purchased during or after the Public Offering (a) in favor of approving a Business Combination and (b) not to redeem any shares in connection with a stockholder vote to approve a Business Combination or sell any shares to the Company in a tender offer in connection with a Business Combination. Additionally, each public stockholder may elect to redeem their Public Shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction or do not vote at all.Notwithstanding the above, if the Company seeks stockholder approval of a Business Combination and it does not conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that a public stockholder, together with any affiliate of such stockholder or any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to more than an aggregate of 20% or more of the Public Shares, without the prior consent of the Company.The Company initially had up to 24 months from the closing of the Public Offering to complete a Business Combination (the “Combination Period”), or to such extended date as may be approved by our stockholders to consummate an initial business combination. On March 23, 2023, the Company filed an amendment to its Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to extend the Combination Period to September 25, 2023 (refer to Note 11). If the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period, the Company will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the Public Shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account including income earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to the Company to pay taxes (less up to $0.10 million of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the Company’s remaining stockholders and the Company’s board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to the Company’s obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law.The Sponsor has agreed to waive its liquidation rights with respect to the Founder Shares if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period. However, if the Sponsor acquires Public Shares in or after the Public Offering, such Public Shares will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period. In the event of such distribution, it is possible that the per share value of the assets remaining available for distribution will be less than the Public Offering price per Unit ($10.00).

NOTE 1 – ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS OPERATIONS (Continued)
In order to protect the amounts held in the Trust Account, the Sponsor has agreed to be liable to the Company if and to the extent any claims by a third party for services rendered or products sold to the Company, or a prospective target business with which the Company has discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account to below the lesser of (1) $10.00 per Public Share and (2) the actual amount per Public Share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, less taxes payable, provided that such liability will not apply to claims by a third party or prospective target business who executed a waiver of any and all rights to the monies held in the Trust Account nor will it apply to any claims under the Company’s indemnity of the underwriters of the Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). Moreover, in the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, the Sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims. The Company will seek to reduce the possibility that the Sponsor will have to indemnify the Trust Account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers (except the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses and other entities with which the Company does business, execute agreements with the Company waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the Trust Account.Merger Agreement
On December 12, 2022, the Company, entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) by and among (i) the Company, (ii) Infinite Reality Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (“Pubco”), (iii) Infinity Purchaser Merger Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation and a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Pubco (“Purchaser Merger Sub”), (iv) Infinity NBIR Company Merger Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation and a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Pubco (“Infinite Reality Merger Sub” and, together with Purchaser Merger Sub, the “Merger Subs,” and the Merger Subs collectively with the Company and Pubco, the “Purchaser Parties”), and (v) Infinite Reality, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Infinite Reality”).Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, (i) Purchaser Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company, with the Company continuing as the surviving entity (the “Purchaser Merger”), (ii) Infinite Reality Merger Sub will merge with and into Infinite Reality, with the Infinite Reality continuing as the surviving entity (the “Company Merger,” and together with the Purchaser Merger, the “Mergers”), and (iii) following the Mergers, the Company and the Infinite Reality will become direct wholly-owned subsidiaries of Pubco, and Pubco will become a publicly traded company.Liquidity and Going Concern
As of December 31, 2022, the Company had approximately $0.08 million in its operating bank account, approximately $129.95 million of cash held in the Trust Account to be used for a Business Combination or to repurchase or redeem its common stock in connection therewith and a working capital deficiency of approximately $2.51 million.Until the consummation of a Business Combination, the Company will be using the funds not held in the Trust Account for identifying and evaluating prospective acquisition candidates, performing due diligence on prospective target businesses, paying for travel expenditures, selecting the target business to acquire, and structuring, negotiating and consummating the Business Combination.

DECEMBER 31, 2022

NOTE 1 – ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS OPERATIONS (Continued)
The Company will need to raise additional capital through loans or additional investments from its Sponsor, stockholders, officers, directors, or third parties. The Company’s officers, directors and Sponsor may, but are not obligated to, loan the Company funds, from time to time or at any time, in whatever amount they deem reasonable in their sole discretion, to meet the Company’s working capital needs. Accordingly, the Company may not be able to obtain additional financing. If the Company is unable to raise additional capital, it may be required to take additional measures to conserve liquidity, which could include, but not necessarily be limited to, curtailing operations, suspending the pursuit of a potential transaction, and reducing overhead expenses. The Company cannot provide any assurance that new financing will be available to it on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern through September 25, 2023, the date that the Company will be required to cease all operations, except for the purpose of winding up, if a Business Combination is not consummated or extended. These financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recovery of the recorded assets or the classification of the liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.​
​
NOTE 2 ─ SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIESBasis of PresentationThe accompanying financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC.Emerging Growth Company The Company is an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, (the “JOBS Act”), and it may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in its periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.Further, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. The Company has elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, the Company, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of the Company’s financial statements with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.Use of EstimatesThe preparation of financial statement in conformity with GAAP requires the Company’s management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period.

NOTE 2 – SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)
Making estimates requires management to exercise significant judgment. It is at least reasonably possible that the estimate of the effect of a condition, situation or set of circumstances that existed at the date of the financial statements, which management considered in formulating its estimate, could change in the near term due to one or more future confirming events. Accordingly, the actual results could differ from those estimates. Cash and Cash Equivalents
The Company considers all short-term investments with a maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company did not have any cash equivalents, outside of funds held in the Trust Account.Cash Held in Trust Account At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had approximately $129.95 million and $128.45 million, respectively of assets held in Trust Account held in Treasury Bills.Common Stock Subject to Possible RedemptionAll of the 12,843,937 shares of common stock sold as part of the Units in the Public Offering contain a redemption feature which allows for the redemption of such Public Shares in connection with the Company’s liquidation if there is a stockholder vote or tender offer in connection with the Business Combination. In accordance with SEC and its staff’s guidance on redeemable equity instruments, which has been codified in ASC Topic 480-10-S99, redemption provisions not solely within the control of the Company require common stock subject to redemption to be classified outside of permanent equity. Ordinary liquidation events, which involve the redemption and liquidation of all of the entity’s equity instruments, are excluded from the provisions of ASC Topic 480.The Company recognizes changes in redemption value immediately as they occur and adjusts the carrying value of redeemable shares of common stock to equal the redemption value at the end of each reporting period. Increases or decreases in the carrying amount of redeemable shares of common stock are affected by charges against additional paid-in capital and accumulated deficit.As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the shares of common stock subject to possible redemption and included as temporary equity were as follows:

NOTE 2 – SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)
Offering CostsThe Company complies with the requirements of the ASC 340-10-S99-1. Offering costs are charged against the carrying value of common stock or stockholders’ deficit based on the relative value of the shares of common stock and the warrants, to the proceeds received from the Units sold upon the completion of the Public Offering. Offering costs consisted of legal, accounting, underwriting fees and other costs incurred through the Public Offering that were directly related to the Public Offering. The Company incurred offering costs amounting to $3.00 million as a result of the Public Offering consisting of $2.57 million of cash underwriting discount and $0.43 million of other offering costs. As such, the Company recorded $2.90 million of offering costs as a reduction of temporary equity, $0.10 million of offering costs as a reduction of permanent equity and $454 of offering cost as reduction in the statement of operations.Concentration of Credit RiskFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentration of credit risk consist of cash accounts in a financial institution which, at times, may exceed the federal depository insurance coverage of $0.25 million. The Company has not experienced losses on these accounts and management believes the Company is not exposed to significant risks on such accounts. Fair Value of Financial InstrumentsFair value is defined as the price that would be received for sale of an asset or paid for transfer of a liability, in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. GAAP establishes a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). These tiers include:
● | Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. An active market for an asset or liability is a market in which transactions for the asset or liability occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Level 2 - Observable inputs other than Level 1 inputs. Examples of Level 2 inputs include quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities and quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Level 3 - Unobservable inputs based on the Company’s assessment of the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In some circumstances, the inputs used to measure fair value might be categorized within different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In those instances, the fair value measurement is categorized in its entirety in the fair value hierarchy based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.As of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the carrying values of cash, prepaid expenses, accrued expenses, and franchise tax payable approximated their fair values due to the short-term nature of the instruments. The Company’s marketable securities held in Trust Account are comprised of investments in U.S. Treasury securities with an original maturity of 185 days. The fair value of marketable securities held in Trust Account is determined using quoted prices in active markets.

NOTE 2 – SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)
Derivative Warrant LiabilitiesThe Company does not use derivative instruments to hedge exposures to cash flow, market, or foreign currency risks. The Company evaluates all of its financial instruments, including issued stock purchase warrants, to determine if such instruments are derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives, pursuant to ASC Topic 480 and ASC Subtopic 815-15. The classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is re-assessed at the end of each reporting period.​
The 203,440 Private Warrants are recognized as derivative liabilities in accordance with ASC Subtopic 815-40. Accordingly, the Company recognizes the warrant instruments as liabilities at fair value and adjust the instruments to fair value at each reporting period. The liabilities are subject to re-measurement at each balance sheet date until exercised, and any change in fair value is recognized in the Company’s statements of operations. The fair value of the Private Warrants was initially measured at fair value using a Monte Carlo simulation model and subsequently, the fair value of the Private Warrants have been estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation model each measurement date. Net Loss Per Share of Common StockThe Company applies the two-class method in calculating earnings per share. The contractual formula utilized to calculate the redemption amount approximates fair value. The Class feature to redeem at fair value means that there is effectively only one class of stock. Changes in fair value are not considered a dividend of the purposes of the numerator in the earnings per share calculation. Net loss per share of common stock is computed by dividing the pro rata net loss between the shares of common stock subject to redemption and the shares of common stock not subject to redemption by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding for each of the periods. The calculation of diluted loss per share of common stock does not consider the effect of the warrants issued in connection with the Public Offering since the exercise of the warrants are contingent upon the occurrence of future events and the inclusion of such warrants would be anti-dilutive. The warrants are exercisable for 6,625,409 shares of common stock in the aggregate.​

NOTE 2 – SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)Income TaxesThe Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined on the basis of the differences between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.The Company recognizes deferred tax assets to the extent that it believes these assets are more likely than not to be realized. In making such a determination, the Company considers all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations. If the Company determines that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount, the Company would make an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance, which would reduce the provision for income taxes.The Company records uncertain tax positions in accordance with ASC 740 on the basis of a two-step process whereby (1) it determines whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained on the basis of the technical merits of the position and (2) for those tax positions that meet the more-likely-than- not recognition threshold, the Company recognizes the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority.The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the income tax expense line in the accompanying statement of operations. As of December 31, 2022, the company does not have uncertain tax positions or interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions.On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the “IR Act”) was enacted into law. Among other changes to the tax code, the act imposes a 1% excise tax on certain repurchases of corporate stock by certain publicly traded corporations. The 1% stock buyback tax applies to redemptions by domestic corporations occurring in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2022. The stock buyback tax may be applicable to certain SPAC redemptions, including in connection with a SPAC’s business combination. For purposes of calculating the excise tax, repurchasing corporations are permitted to net the fair market value of certain new stock issuances against the fair market value of stock repurchases during the same taxable year. In addition, a number of exceptions to the stock buyback tax are available including exceptions to certain reorganizations; however, while these exceptions may be helpful in limiting the application of the stock buyback tax in situations in which it was not intended to apply, more guidance will be necessary for taxpayers to analyze the potential application of these exceptions and whether they will be able to rely upon them.Any redemption or other repurchase that occurs after December 31, 2022, in connection with a Business Combination, extension a vote by stockholders to extend the period of time to complete the Business Combination (the “extension vote”) or otherwise, may be subject to the excise tax. Whether and to what extent the Company would be subject to the excise tax in connection with a Business Combination, extension vote or otherwise would depend on a number of factors, including (I) the fair market value of the redemptions and repurchases in connection with the Business Combination, extension or otherwise, (ii) the structure of a Business Combination, (iii) the nature and amount of any “PIPE” or other equity issuances in connection with a Business Combination (or otherwise issued not in connection with a Business Combination but issued within the same taxable year of a Business Combination) and (iv) the content of regulations and other guidance from the Treasury. In addition, because the excise tax would be payable by the Company and not by the redeeming holder, the mechanics of any required payment of the excise tax have not been determined. The foregoing could cause a reduction in the cash available on hand to complete a Business Combination and in the Company’s ability to complete a Business Combination.

NOTE 2 – SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)Income Taxes (Continued)The IRS issued Notice 2023-3 (Initial guidance regarding the application of the excise tax on repurchases of corporate stock). The notice defines stock redemptions per Internal Revenue Code (IRC) section 317(b) and also defines transactions considered to be economically similar to a repurchase including certain acquisitive reorganizations, split-offs and certain overlap complete liquidations. Further, the notice defines transaction that are not economically similar transactions including complete liquidations and certain divisive transactions. At this time, it has been determined that none of the IR Act tax provisions have an impact onto the Company’s fiscal 2022 tax provision.Recent Accounting PronouncementsIn August 2020, FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2020-06, Debt – Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging – Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40) (“ASU 2020-06”) to simplify accounting for certain financial instruments. ASU 2020-06 eliminates the current models that require separation of beneficial conversion and cash conversion features from convertible instruments and simplifies the derivative scope exception guidance pertaining to equity classification of contracts in an entity’s own equity. The new standard also introduces additional disclosures for convertible debt and freestanding instruments that are indexed to and settled in an entity’s own equity. ASU 2020-06 amends the diluted earnings per share guidance, including the requirement to use the if-converted method for all convertible instruments.The provisions of ASU 2020-06 are applicable for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, with early adoption permitted no earlier than fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2020-06 on its financial statements.Management does not believe that any recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements, if currently adopted, would have a material effect on the Company’s financial statements.

NOTE 3 ─ PUBLIC OFFERINGOn March 25, 2021, the Company closed on the sale of 12,000,000 Units at a price of $10.00 per Unit. Each Unit consists of one share of the Company’s common stock, $0.0001 par value and one-half of one redeemable warrant (the “Public Warrants”). Each whole Public Warrant offered in the Offering is exercisable to purchase one share of the Company’s common stock at an exercise price of $11.50 per share. On March 30, 2021, the underwriters exercised the over-allotment option in part and purchased an additional 843,937 Units, generating gross proceeds of $8.44 million.In connection with the Initial Public Offering, the Company granted the underwriters an option to purchase 1,800,000 shares of the Company’s common stock at the Initial Public Offering price, or $10.00 per share, for 45 days commencing on October 25, 2021 (grant date). Since this option extended beyond the closing of the Initial Public Offering, this option feature represented a call option that was accounted for under ASC 480, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity. Accordingly, the call option has been separately accounted for at a fair value with the change in fair value between the grant date and March 30, 2021 and expiration amount recorded as other income. The Company used the Black-Scholes valuation model to determine the fair value of the call option at the grant date and again at March 30, 2021 (refer to Note 10 for fair value information).

NOTE 4 ─ PRIVATE UNITSConcurrently with the closing of the Public Offering, the Sponsor and the underwriters purchased an aggregate of 390,000 Private Units generating gross proceeds of $3.90 million in aggregate in a private placement. Each private unit consists of one share of the Company’s common stock, $0.0001 par value and one-half of one redeemable warrant (the “Private Warrants”). Each whole Private Warrant will entitle the holder to purchase one share of common stock at a price of $11.50 per full share, subject to adjustment (See Note 8).As a result of the underwriters’ election to partially exercise their over-allotment option on March 30, 2021, the Sponsor and the underwriters and its designees purchased an additional 16,879 Private Units, at a purchase price of $10.00 per Private Unit.If the Company does not complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period, the proceeds from the sale of the Private Warrants will be used to fund the redemption of the Public Shares (subject to the requirements of applicable law).
NOTE 5 ─ RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONSFounder SharesOn January 15, 2021, the Sponsor paid $25,000 to cover certain offering costs of the Company in consideration for 4,312,500 shares of common stock (the “Founder Shares”).On March 22, 2021, the Sponsor returned to the Company for no consideration, an aggregate of 862,500 Founder Shares. All shares and associated amounts have been retroactively restated to reflect the share surrender (See Note 7).Furthermore, 250,000 shares of common stock (“Representative Shares”) were issued to the underwriters and their designees (“Representative”), in addition to the number of Founder Shares issued to the initial stockholders. On March 22, 2021, 50,000 Founder Shares were returned by the Representative to the Company, for no consideration, resulting in an aggregate of 200,000 Founder Shares outstanding and held by the underwriters and their designees. All shares and associated amounts have been retroactively restated to reflect the share surrender.On March 30, 2021, as a result of the underwriters’ election to partially exercise their over-allotment option, an aggregate of 239,016 Founder Shares has been forfeited.Founder Shares are subject to lock-up until the earlier of (A) 180 days after the completion of the Company’s initial business combination or (B) the date on which the Company completes a liquidation, merger, stock exchange or other similar transaction after the Company’s initial business combination that results in all of the Company’s public stockholders having the right to exchange their shares of common stock for cash, securities or other property. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the last sale price of the Company’s common stock equals or exceeds $12.50 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within any 30-trading day period commencing after the Company’s initial business combination, the Founder Shares will be released.Promissory Note – Related PartyOn November 23, 2020, the Sponsor issued an unsecured promissory note to the Company (the “Promissory Note”), pursuant to which the Company may borrow up to an aggregate principal amount of $0.30 million. The Promissory Note is non-interest bearing and was payable on the earlier of June 30, 2021, or the consummation of the Public Offering.The total outstanding balance of approximately $0.19 million was paid in full on July 30, 2021.

NOTE 5 ─ RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS (Continued)Related Party LoansIn order to finance transaction costs in connection with a Business Combination, the Sponsor or certain of the Company’s officers and directors or their affiliates may, but are not obligated to, loan the Company funds as may be required (the “Working Capital Loans”). Each loan would be evidenced by promissory note. The notes may be repaid upon completion of a Business Combination, without interest, or, at the lender’s discretion, up to $1.50 million of notes may be converted upon completion of a Business Combination into units at a price of $10.00 per unit. Such units would be identical to the Private Units. In the event that a Business Combination does not close, the Company may use a portion of proceeds held outside the Trust Account to repay the Working Capital Loans but no proceeds held in the Trust Account would be used to repay the Working Capital Loans. As of December 31, 2022, no Working Capital Loans were outstanding.In addition, on May 3, 2022, the Company issued a promissory note for up to approximately $0.4 million (the “Note”) to the Sponsor, of which $0.4 million was outstanding under the Note as of December 31, 2022. The Note is non-interest bearing and the Company must make drawdown requests in amounts no less than $10,000 unless otherwise agreed upon by the parties. The principal balance of the Note is payable on the earlier of (i) the date on which the Company consummates its initial business combination and (ii) the date that the winding up of the Company is effective (such date, the “Maturity Date”).The Company, pursuant to the Note, may at any time prior to payment in full of the principal balance of the Note elect to convert all or any portion of the unpaid principal balance of the Note into units (the “Conversion Units”) at a conversion price of $10.00 per unit. Each Conversion Unit will consist of one share of common stock of the Company and one-half of one warrant, each whole warrant exercisable for one share of common stock of the Company at a price of $11.50 per share. Since the unit includes half a warrant the conversion option should be bifurcated and accounted for as a derivative in accordance with ASC 815. However, the exercise price of a unit was greater than a public unit's fair value as of December 31, 2022, and when the Note was drawn on. The Company believes that the likelihood of the Sponsor's exercise of the option to convert the Note to a unit is de minimis. As a result, the Company recorded zero liability related to the conversion option bifurcating the underlying warrant included in the unit. The Conversion Units shall be identical to the Private Units.Additionally, the Note entitles the Sponsor to two demand registrations and unlimited piggyback registration rights for the Conversion Units (including underlying securities), which rights are the same as the registration rights provided under the registration rights agreement.Related Party Payable
At the closing of the Public Offering, the Trust Account held an excess of approximately $0.77 million, that was refunded to the Sponsor on March 26, 2021.As of December 31, 2022, an amount of $480 was payable to the Sponsor, in connection with the filing of a tax return.​

NOTE 5 ─ RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS (Continued)Administrative Support AgreementThe Company has agreed to pay the Sponsor $0.01 million per month from the effective date of the registration statement for the Public Offering (the “Registration Statement”), for office space, utilities and secretarial and administrative support. Services will terminate upon the earlier of the consummation by the Company of a business combination or the liquidation of the Company. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company paid $0.12 million for these services, of which such amount is included in the operating costs on the accompanying statements of operations.​
For the period from January 15, 2021 (commencement of operations) through December 31, 2021, the Company incurred $0.09 million for these services, of which such amount is included in the formation and operating costs on the accompanying statements of operations.​

NOTE 6 ─ COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIESRisks and UncertaintiesManagement continues to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the industry and has concluded that while it is reasonably possible that the virus could have a negative effect on the Company’s financial position, results of its operations and/or search for a target company, the specific impact is not readily determinable as of the date of these financial statements. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.​
Registration RightsPursuant to a registration rights agreement entered into on March 22, 2021, the holders of the Founder Shares and Representative Shares, as well as the holders of the Private Units (and underlying securities) and any warrants issued in payment of Working Capital Loans made to Company (and underlying securities) are entitled to registration rights. The holders of a majority of these securities are entitled to make up to two demands that the Company register such securities.The holders of a majority of the Representative Shares, Private Units and warrants issued in payment of working capital loans made to the Company (or underlying securities) can elect to exercise these registration rights at any time after the Company consummates a Business Combination. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, EarlyBirdCapital may only make a demand on one occasion and only during the five-year period beginning on the effective date of the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part. In addition, the holders have certain “piggy-back” registration rights with respect to registration statements filed subsequent to consummation of a Business Combination; provided, however, that EarlyBirdCapital may participate in a “piggy-back” registration only during the seven-year period beginning on the effective date of the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part.The registration rights agreement does not contain liquidating damages or other cash settlement provisions resulting from delays in registering the Company’s securities. The Company will bear the expenses incurred in connection with the filing of any such registration statements.

The Company is authorized to issue 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock with a par value of $0.0001 per share with such designations, voting and other rights and preferences as may be determined from time to time by the Company’s board of directors. At December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, there were no shares of preferred stock issued or outstanding.Common Stock
The Company is authorized to issue 100,000,000 shares of common stock with a par value of $0.0001 per share. On January 15, 2021, the Company issued 4,562,500 shares of common stock to the Sponsor and the underwriters and its designees. On March 22, 2021, the Sponsor and the underwriters effected a surrender of 862,500 and 50,000 shares of common stock to the Company, for no consideration. This resulted in a decrease in the total number of shares of common stock outstanding from 4,562,500 to 3,650,000. All shares and associated amounts have been retroactively restated to reflect the share surrender.On March 30, 2021, as a result of the underwriters’ election to partially exercise the over-allotment option, an aggregate of 239,016 Founder Shares has been forfeited.

No warrants will be exercisable for cash unless the Company has an effective and current registration statement covering the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants and a current prospectus relating to such shares of common stock. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a registration statement covering the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the Public Warrants is not effective within a specified period following the consummation of a Business Combination, warrant holders may, until such time as there is an effective registration statement and during any period when the Company shall have failed to maintain an effective registration statement, exercise warrants on a cashless basis pursuant to the exemption provided by Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act, provided that such exemption is available.If that exemption, or another exemption, is not available, holders will not be able to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis.

NOTE 7 ─ STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY (Continued)Public Warrants (Continued)
If the Company calls the Public Warrants for redemption, management will have the option to require all holders that wish to exercise the Public Warrants to do so on a “cashless basis,” as described in the warrant agreement. The exercise price and number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants may be adjusted in certain circumstances including in the event of a stock dividend, or recapitalization, reorganization, merger or consolidation. However, except as described below, the warrants will not be adjusted for issuance of common stock at a price below its exercise price. Additionally, in no event will the Company be required to net cash settle the warrants. If the Company is unable to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period and the Company liquidates the funds held in the Trust Account, holders of warrants will not receive any of such funds with respect to their warrants, nor will they receive any distribution from the Company’s assets held outside of the Trust Account with the respect to such warrants. Accordingly, the warrants may expire worthless.In addition, if (x) the Company issues additional common stock or equity-linked securities for capital raising purposes in connection with the closing of a Business Combination at an issue price or effective issue price of less than $9.20 per common stock (with such issue price or effective issue price to be determined in good faith by the Company’s board of directors and, in the case of any such issuance to the Sponsor or its affiliates, without taking into account any Founder Shares held by the Sponsor or such affiliates, as applicable, prior to such issuance), (y) the aggregate gross proceeds from such issuances represent more than 60% of the total equity proceeds, and interest thereon, available for the funding of a Business Combination on the date of the consummation of a Business Combination (net of redemptions), and (z) the volume weighted average trading price of its common stock during the 20 trading day period starting on the trading day prior to the day on which the Company consummates its Business Combination (such price, the “Market Value”) is below $9.20 per share, the exercise price of the warrants will be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to 115% of the greater of (i) Market Value or (ii) the price at which the Company issue the additional shares of common stock or equity-linked securities.Representative Shares
If that exemption, or another exemption, is not available, holders will not be able to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis. The Public Warrants will expire five years after the completion of a Business Combination or earlier upon redemption or liquidation.In January 2021, the Company issued to EarlyBirdCapital and its designees, 250,000 Representative Shares. On March 22, 2021, 50,000 Representative Shares were returned by EarlyBirdCapital and its designees to the Company, for no consideration. This resulted in a decrease in the total number of Representative Shares outstanding from 250,000 to 200,000.The Company accounted for the Representative Shares as an offering cost of the Public Offering, with a corresponding credit to stockholders’ equity. The Company estimated the fair value of Representative Shares to be $1,449 based upon the price of the Founder Shares issued to the Sponsor. The holders of the Representative Shares have agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any such shares until the completion of a Business Combination. In addition, the holders have agreed (i) to waive their redemption rights with respect to such shares in connection with the completion of a Business Combination and (ii) to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the Trust Account with respect to such shares if the Company fails to complete a Business Combination within the Combination Period.​

NOTE 8 ─ DERIVATIVE WARRANTS LIABILITIESThe Private Warrants will be identical to the Public Warrants underlying the Units being sold in the Public Offering, except that the Private Warrants and the shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of the Private Warrants will not be transferable, assignable or saleable until after the completion of a Business Combination, subject to certain limited exceptions. Additionally, the Private Warrants will be exercisable for cash or on a cashless basis, at the holder’s option, and be non-redeemable so long as they are held by the initial purchasers or their permitted transferees. If the Private Warrants are held by someone other than the initial purchasers or their permitted transferees, the Private Warrants will be redeemable by the Company and exercisable by such holders on the same basis as the Public Warrants.

As of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the Company has $0 and $183,530, respectively, of U.S. federal net operating loss carryover which can be carried forward indefinitely.
In assessing the realization of the deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion of all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences representing net future deductible amounts become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. After consideration of all of the information available, management believes that significant uncertainty exists with respect to future realization of the deferred tax assets and has therefore established a full valuation allowance. For the periods ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, the change in the valuation allowance was $229,982 and $142,162, respectively.
The Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and Massachusetts. The Company is subject to examination by US federal and Massachusetts tax authorities for tax years 2021 through 2022

NOTE 10 ─ FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTSThe fair value of the Company’s financial assets and liabilities reflects management’s estimate of amounts that the Company would have received in connection with the sale of the assets or paid in connection with the transfer of the liabilities in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. In connection with measuring the fair value of its assets and liabilities, the Company seeks to maximize the use of observable inputs (market data obtained from independent sources) and to minimize the use of unobservable inputs (internal assumptions about how market participants would price assets and liabilities). The following fair value hierarchy is used to classify assets and liabilities based on the observable inputs and unobservable inputs used in order to value the assets and liabilities:
● | Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. An active market for an asset or liability is a market in which transactions for the asset or liability occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Level 2 - Observable inputs other than Level 1 inputs. Examples of Level 2 inputs include quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities and quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Level 3 - Unobservable inputs based on the Company’s assessment of the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The fair value of the Private Warrants was initially measured at fair value using a Monte Carlo simulation model and subsequently, the fair value of the Private Warrants have been estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation model each measurement date. NOTE 10 ─ FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS (Continued)
For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recognized a gain resulting from a decrease in the fair value of liabilities of $107,823, presented as change in fair value of derivative warrant liabilities in the accompanying statements of operations and for the period from January 15, 2021 (Commencement of Operations) through December 31, 2021, the Company recognized a gain resulting from a decrease in the fair value of liabilities of $11,953, presented as change in fair value of derivative warrant liabilities in the accompanying statements of operations.The following table presents information about the Company’s financial assets that were measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2022, by level within the fair value hierarchy:​

NOTE 10 ─ FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS (Continued)
Transfers to/from Levels 1, 2 and 3 were recognized at the end of the reporting period.​
The estimated fair value of the Private Warrants prior to being separately listed and traded, is determined using Level 3 inputs. Inherent in a Monte Carlo simulation are assumptions related to expected stock-price volatility, expected life, risk-free interest rate and dividend yield. The Company estimates the volatility of its common stock warrants based on implied volatility from the Company’s traded warrants and from historical volatility of select peer company’s common stock that matches the expected remaining life of the warrants. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury zero-coupon yield curve on the grant date for a maturity similar to the expected remaining life of the warrants. The expected life of the warrants is assumed to be equivalent to their remaining contractual term. The dividend rate is based on the historical rate, which the Company anticipates remaining at zero.​
The following table provides quantitative information regarding Level 3 fair value measurements inputs as their measurement dates:​

NOTE 11 ─ SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
The Company evaluated subsequent events and transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date up to the date that the financial statements were issued. Other than as described herein, the Company did not identify any other subsequent events that would have required adjustment or disclosure in the financial statements. On March 3, 2023, the Company filed a definitive proxy statement for a special meeting on March 21, 2023 (the “Special Meeting”) to seek approval from its stockholders to amend the Company’s second amended and restated certificate of incorporation (the “Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation”) to further extend the date by which the Company is required to complete its initial business combination from March 25, 2023 to September 25, 2023 (the “Extension Proposal”) and to approve the adjournment of the Special Meeting to a later date or dates, if necessary or convenient, to permit further solicitation and vote of proxies in the event that there are insufficient votes for, or otherwise in connection with, the approval of the Extension Proposal (the “Adjournment Proposal”). The Extension Proposal and Adjournment Proposal were approved on March 21, 2023.In connection with approval of the Extension Proposal, the holders of 7,744,085 shares of common stock of the Company properly exercised their right to redeem their shares for cash at a redemption price of approximately $10.17 per share, for an aggregate redemption amount of approximately $78,770,623. As a result, approximately $78,770,623 will be removed from the Company’s Trust Account to pay such holders. Following redemptions, the Company has 8,917,715 shares of common stock outstanding.Additionally, in connection with the approval of the Extension Proposal, the Sponsor or its designees have agreed to contribute to the Company as a note (i) the lesser of (a) an aggregate of $600,000 or (b) $0.04 for each public share on a monthly basis that is not redeemed in connection with the Extension Amendment for the portion of the Extension ending on June 23, 2023 (the “Initial Contribution”); plus, (ii) an aggregate of $200,000 per month (commencing on June 23, 2023 and on the 23rd day of each subsequent month) until the charter extension date (each, an “Extension Period”), or portion thereof, that is needed to complete an initial business combination (such loans, together with the Initial Contribution, the “Contribution”), which amount will be deposited into the Trust Account. Accordingly, the amount deposited per share depends on the number of public shares that remain outstanding after the redemption and the length of the extension period that will be needed to complete an initial business combination.On March 15, 2023, the Company amended and restated the Note (the “Amended Note”) in its entirety to (1) increase the principal amount thereunder from $0.4 million to $0.9 million and (2) remove the right of the holder of the Amended Note to convert all or any portion of the unpaid principal balance of the note into the Company’s units and related registration rights for such units (including underlying securities). The Amended Note is non-interest bearing and is payable on the earlier of (i) the date on which the Company consummates its initial business combination or (ii) the date that the winding up of the Company is effective.On March 22, 2023, the Company amended and restated the Note (the “Second Amended Note”) to increase the principal amount of up to $0.9 million to up to $2.1 million to the Sponsor, pursuant to which the Sponsor agreed to loan to the Company up to such amount.On March 23, 2023, the Company filed an amendment to its Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware to extend the date by which the Company has to consummate a business combination to from March 25, 2023 to September 25, 2023.On March 24, 2023, the Company deposited the Initial Contribution and will deposit an aggregate of $200,000 per month during each Extension Period, or portion thereof, that is needed to complete an initial business combination, which amount will be deposited into the Trust Account.​
