Item 1. Business.
Unless the context otherwise requires, all references in this subsection to “MarketWise,” “we,” “us,” or “our” refer to the business of MarketWise, LLC and its subsidiaries prior to the Closing, and to the business of MarketWise Inc. and its subsidiaries after the Closing.
We started in 1999 with the simple idea that, if we could publish intelligent, independent, insightful, and in-depth investment research and treat the subscriber the way we would want to be treated, then subscribers would renew their subscriptions and stay with us. That simple idea worked and has guided our decisions ever since.
Today, we are a leading multi-brand platform of subscription businesses that provides premium financial research, software, education, and tools for self-directed investors. We provide our subscribers with the research, education, and tools that they need to navigate the financial markets.
We have evolved significantly since our inception in 1999.
Over the years, we have expanded our business into a comprehensive suite of investment research products and solutions. We now produce a diversified product portfolio from a variety of financial research brands such as Stansberry Research, Palm Beach Research Group, Chaikin Analytics, InvestorPlace, and Empire Financial Research. Our entire investment research product portfolio is 100% digital and channel agnostic. We offer our research across a variety of platforms, including desktop, laptop, and mobile devices, including tablets and mobile phones.
As a result of the expansion of the business, we now have 93 editors and analysts covering a broad spectrum of investments, ranging from commodities to equities, to distressed debt and cryptocurrencies. We offer 43 free and 150 paid products on multiple platforms through our 12 primary customer-facing brands. This diversity of content has allowed our business to succeed and our subscription base to grow through the many economic cycles in our over 20-year history.
We have an engaged subscriber base of approximately 841 thousand Paid Subscribers and a large and growing audience of over 15.7 million Free Subscribers. 
Millions of Investors are Taking Control of Their Finances, and We Have the Content and Tools to be Their Guide
The nature of retail investing is rapidly changing, and we are taking advantage of these trends.
Rise of the self-directed investor. Years ago, and even today, retail investors sought advice from traditional investment managers. But over the past two decades, retail investors have increasingly taken control of their own portfolios. There are several reasons for this trend. In the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, investor skepticism increased toward large financial institutions and advisors. Meanwhile, the development of online trading and the proliferation of financial information on the Internet has made it easier for investors to take control of their finances and self-direct their investments. Online brokerage platforms have slashed the cost to manage a personal trading account, so investors can now make trades for free or at a fraction of the historical cost.
As a result, the U.S. self-directed investor population is approximately 88 million people in 2022. And this self-directed population is growing by nearly 15% each year, and is expected to increase to approximately 115 million investors by 2024.1
These factors have combined to motivate individual investors to take control of their investment decision-making. These self-directed investors tend to lag the market indices so they seek the expert information to educate

and empower themselves to manage their own portfolios. As more investors take the self-directed approach to managing their financial future, there is significant demand for investment ideas, education, and market intelligence.
Demographic shifts are increasing demand for our products. Approximately 17% of the U.S. population are individuals over the age of 65. And that cohort is growing rapidly, with roughly 10,000 Americans reaching retirement age every day. Many of these people have significant retirement accounts on which they rely.
In addition, 65% of Millennials—people born between 1980 and 1994—identify themselves as “self-directed” investors. As the Millennials continue to age and grow their investment portfolios, we have a significant opportunity to serve that demographic and grow our business.
Financial markets are becoming more complex. The historical approach toward managing a personal portfolio with a mix of blue-chip stocks, corporate bonds, and cash has become antiquated. The rapid growth of investment opportunities—including products such as exchange-traded funds (“ETFs”), cryptocurrencies, options strategies, and distressed corporate debt—has given self-directed investors today many different and sophisticated ways to invest their money. And those choices continue to specialize and multiply. 
As investment options in the global financial markets increase, it becomes harder and harder for investors to stay informed and keep up with the strategies available to them. We and our teams of editors and analysts are constantly surveying the markets for new strategies to help subscribers stay current with the changing markets.
Financial research content is fragmented and price points vary. The landscape of financial research providers is fragmented, with hundreds of publications, platforms, and tools for investment research directed at distinct segments of the investing community.
Financial research providers range from free, advertising-supported platforms or crowdsourced investment websites to low-cost, “mom and pop” newsletter subscription services, many of which do not produce content at scale. There are also extremely expensive, subscription-based software platforms with data and tools designed for highly sophisticated institutional investors. 
Our Value Proposition
We empower retail investors with institutional-quality research at a price point that is accessible.
Experienced analysts, with their own unique investment strategies and philosophies, lead our brands. As a result, we do not promote a single, unified view of the markets, but instead we publish a mosaic of opinions, recommendations, and strategies.
This multi-brand approach gives our work far greater breadth, creating more diverse opportunities for our subscribers. Our brands are linked, however, by a continuous commitment to risk management and a contrarian approach to identifying investment opportunities.
Across all our brands, we focus on investments that are unloved, ignored, or unknown. Having an informed perspective in these situations gives our subscribers the best risk-to-reward opportunities.
We recognize that self-directed investors do not have the same research budget and resources at their disposal as institutional investors do. So we strive to provide them with institutional quality research at affordable price points. Unlike traditional institutional research, our offerings are significantly less expensive and more accessible. They are designed to be less technical and therefore more easily understood by the subscribers who aren’t finance professionals. At the same time, our offerings have premium content that is highly actionable.

We believe that if we publish research to help our subscribers succeed in the financial markets, they will progressively become better investors, renew their subscriptions, and become long-term customers. We have proven out this thesis throughout our over 20-year history. We have formed lifelong relationships with our subscribers by providing superior value through our offerings.
We provide a comprehensive suite of research and software solutions. 
Through 12 primary customer facing brands, we have 43 free products and 150 paid products. We cover various investment strategies, such as value investing, income, growth, commodities, cryptocurrencies, venture, crowdfunded investing, biotechnology, mutual funds, options, and trading. We find that our subscribers develop personal affinities for specific writers and certain investment styles, and specific brands. When we acquire brands or form joint ventures, which we engage in periodically, we typically maintain the existing brands because we want to avoid disrupting those relationships by interjecting a new company name or persona, since subscribers may not have any prior relationship with us. 
We typically publish our research reports on a monthly basis, although some of our products publish more frequently. We offer our entire investment research product portfolio across a variety of media, including desktops, laptops, tablets, and mobile.
During third quarter 2022, we acquired 100% ownership of certain assets and liabilities from Crowdability, Inc. (“Buttonwood Publishing”), a provider of financial newsletters. We acquired Buttonwood Publishing primarily to expand our copy and editorial talent base. 
We also offer financial software and analytical tools. 
We continue to expand our research portfolio with software and analytical tool solutions, which include the Chaikin Power Gauge, TradeStops and the Altimeter. Our software and analytical tool solutions represented 8% of our Billings on average from 2020 to 2022.
Our Chaikin Analytics brand offers a suite of stock research tools and portfolio management services that help investors pick winning stocks and drop losing stocks ahead of market shifts. Our TradeSmith brand provides a full suite of portfolio management software tools that enable individual investors to manage their portfolios using algorithms that have been back tested for results and designed to help investors manage their emotions. Our Altimetry brand offers a user-friendly database showing uniform, accounting-based financial summaries for more than 4,900 companies.
We have developed screeners, monitors, portfolio management tools, and a set of proprietary indicators that produce a composite score to rank several thousand publicly traded companies in the United States. Our various digital research platforms integrate our content with public financial data in well-designed user interfaces to provide our users with valuable tools to easily consume our research, keep track of investments, import their portfolios and more. 
Our product offerings reinforce each other and produce a strong flywheel effect across our organization. As we launch or add more products, we increase the tools available to our readers and the value we provide to our existing subscribers. This allows us to gather insights and feedback and helps us create new products and solutions.
We are dedicated to honoring our long-term commitment to subscribers.
We believe investing is a lifelong endeavor—one that requires constant learning, course corrections, openness to change, and emotional discipline. In keeping with this core belief, we strive to build long-term relationships with our subscribers.
We believe in publishing content that is educational, informative, and easy to understand, and therefore helps our subscribers become better investors over time. This reinforces our lifelong relationships with our subscribers as they can grow with our platform. This forms a “virtuous cycle” of learning and improving through our offerings. As subscribers learn more about how to manage their investments, that makes them more comfortable with 
investigating the more specialized content covered in our high-end services, which further encourages them to continue broadening their investing skill set.
Our market leadership, scale, and access to a wide set of subscribers creates strong network effects. As we grow, we have larger budgets, which allows us to reinvest back into our research platform by hiring more analysts, developing more software and tools, and launching new products, which, in turn, helps us attract more subscribers to our platform.
We are committed and continue to invest in our subscriber experience.
Our relationship with our subscribers is our most precious asset, and we strive to put the customer first in everything that we do. This customer-centric focus drives us to constantly upgrade the quality, breadth, and depth of our research in our existing products without materially increasing the cost of the subscription.
This approach also greatly affects how our customer service groups treat our subscribers when issues arise. We instill in our teams that if we cannot reasonably meet the subscriber’s expectations, then we should ask the customer how we failed them, seek a mutually agreeable solution, and, if one cannot be found, offer them a refund or other form of compensation and find a way to part as friends. This has resulted in over 80% net revenue retention for the three-year period ended December 31, 2022 across our products.
Our Growth Strategy
We are committed to growing our business by deepening our relationship with existing customers and attracting new subscribers to our platform. We did both last year. We will also pursue strategic growth as opportunities arise. Here’s how we grow our business:
Attract more subscribers. We typically acquire new subscribers through an omni-channel marketing strategy that includes display ads, email, external subscriber lists, and direct mail, as well as television and radio at times. We primarily market in these channels through free-to-paid and direct-to-paid content.
We measure our customer-acquisition performance by a matrix of new customer counts and the cost to acquire customers. The mix of our marketing spend across these channels varies among our primary customer-facing brands and depends on how well individual marketing campaigns succeed, the nature of the product, and the type of offer.
We have invested significant resources into our efforts around consumer marketing, including enterprise-wide customer relationship management (“CRM”) systems, the leveraging of artificial intelligence (“AI”) to analyze this data, and a robust database of customer information.
In all of our marketing efforts, we collect and analyze customer response data by channel and effort, down to the individual advertisement in a marketing campaign. Using this data-driven and time-tested approach, we have developed proprietary practices for customer acquisition that we believe set us apart from other companies.
As we develop our relationship with the customer, we collect information from our subscribers about what products they are purchasing, their customer experience, and any feedback they have on our free and paid products. We use this information to deepen the customer experience and present offers to our subscribers for other products that they are likely to find interesting and useful.
Deepen our relationship with our existing subscribers. In addition to our Paid Subscribers, all of our Free Subscribers have access to our extensive library of free and educational content. As our subscribers learn and gain confidence as investors, they understand the need to deploy diverse investment strategies for different market 
conditions and they explore our broad and diverse product offerings. They gain an understanding of the high quality of research that we strive to provide, and they tend to purchase additional research and software products.
Our free subscription products serve as a significant source of new Paid Subscribers, with an average annual free-to-paid conversion rate of approximately 1% to 2% between 2020 and 2022. 
Launch new products and target new markets. Over our greater than 20-year history, we have developed a breadth of products and services that are designed to educate, empower, and entertain our subscribers and provide them with actionable investment ideas. 
We offer a wide array of paid subscription products, ranging from lower priced products (e.g., subscriptions that cost $100 annually) to more expensive products (e.g., subscriptions that can cost up to $5,000 annually). The length of our subscriptions can vary from one year to what we refer to as “membership subscriptions,” where subscribers pay upfront for access to our specific products, and then only pay an annual maintenance fee ranging from $49 to $500 per year for the rest of their investing lives.
We have also developed various software applications that provide customers with algorithmic tools to search for trading ideas and manage portfolio risk. We will continue to enhance our value proposition and create additional selling opportunities through an expanded product portfolio.
We also offer members-only investing conferences where subscribers interact with our editors and analysts and can network with each other. We have a strong track record of cultivating these relationships with our subscribers, and we intend to continue that going forward.
Selectively pursue strategic growth. Over the past ten years, we have developed several joint ventures and executed strategic acquisitions to accelerate our growth, as well as increase the value of our offerings to our subscribers.
We have a strong track record of driving growth and delivering value through the successful integration of acquisitions and joint ventures. We believe our large subscriber base, easy scalability, marketing expertise, technology-based platform, and integration capabilities provide opportunities for us to drive value-added growth through acquisitions.
We have also made key investments across our platform to create a repeatable, low-cost, and scalable business model. We have invested in business functions from marketing to technology which allow us to scale rapidly.
We plan to continue investing in cutting-edge AI and advanced analytics-driven marketing tools to further optimize our marketing channels. Additionally, we have invested in our finance, technology, human resources, and other general and administrative functions to support our growth. 
Competition
The market for investment research and financial information software is evolving and is highly fragmented. As the markets in which we operate continue to mature and new technologies and competitors enter those markets, we expect competition to intensify. Our competitor categories include:
•free online financial news aggregators or customer content platforms, like Yahoo! Finance and Seeking Alpha;
•traditional financial news publishers, like the Wall Street Journal, Investor’s Business Daily, and Barron’s;
•consumer-focused online subscription businesses, such as The Motley Fool;
•institutional financial software providers, such as Bloomberg, FactSet, and IHS Markit; 
•low-cost, “mom and pop” newsletter subscription services, and
•online investing tools, such as Atom Finance and Stocktwits.
For additional information regarding the competitive environment in which we operate, see Item 1A. Risk Factors —“We face significant competition. Many of our competitors and potential competitors have larger customer bases, more established brand recognition, and greater financial, marketing, technological, and personnel resources than we do, which could put us at a competitive disadvantage. Additionally, some of our competitors and potential competitors are better capitalized than we are and able to obtain capital more easily, which could put us at a competitive disadvantage.”
Our Technology
We use technology to run our business efficiently and to better serve our customers. Our technology combines three cloud-based systems: software-as-a-service (“SaaS”); platform-as-a-service (“PaaS”); and infrastructure-as-a-service (“IaaS”). 
While we have changed providers in the past and may do so in the future, we currently use top-tier, industry leading service providers for our CRM and marketing, email delivery, subscription billing, data warehouse, and for our data center.
Our infrastructure is highly scalable and allows us to serve all of our subscribers simultaneously and consistently. Our technology architecture is scalable based on overall traffic and capacity. As a result, we do not believe that growth in the number of subscribers hinders or slows down our platform.
We also employ data redundancy solutions on the cloud to reduce the possibility that our customer data will be lost and to ensure that our platform will not experience material downtime. We apply industry-standard data security measures to protect against potential vulnerabilities in our technology.
We have invested heavily in providing a reliable and secure global platform and infrastructure. Our investments in technology, including engineers, online security, customer privacy, reliable infrastructure, and data science capabilities, enable us to efficiently innovate and deliver solutions to our customers. Our cloud platform allows our developers to build and deploy in a lean and agile fashion with a focus on quality and solution adoption.
We continue to build out our AI tools and predictive analytics capacity through identification of additional business cases and additional data features. While partnering with a nationally recognized provider, we have applied highly targetable demographic and behavioral attributes to new models and in existing models to further enhance our business value.
Our data center is cloud-based, and through this platform we have been able to integrate the various SaaS and PaaS applications within our technology ecosystem and ensure that we have high availability and redundancy with business continuity in mind in an auto-scaling architecture.
Human Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2022, we had 732 full-time employees across all of our businesses. Our employees and independent contractors work from our U.S. offices or remote locations. None of our employees are represented by a labor organization or are party to any collective bargaining arrangement.
Our success depends on our relationships with our subscribers, as well as our employees. Our employees play a key role in delivering valuable content to our subscribers, which in turn, creates long-term value for our shareholders. We truly believe we have the best employees in the market.
We seek to attract, engage, and retain top talent through competitive compensation and benefit programs, and by fostering a culture of high performance, creativity and idea exchange as well as inviting diverse perspectives that will enable our employees to thrive and be successful.
Our compensation programs include both fixed and variable components, an incentive award plan providing for equity grants, and an employee stock purchase plan, all of which we believe incentivizes our employees to perform at high levels, helps them establish long-term financial security, and encourages them to remain with us. 
Our benefits package includes health and welfare plans that provide medical, dental, and vision coverage, health savings accounts, medical and dependent care flexible spending accounts, life insurance, disability insurance, 401(k) savings plan with a company match, paid time off and other assistance, fitness and wellness programs. 
We have grown our workforce organically and acquisitively over recent years, up from 275 employees in 2017 to 732 in 2022. We consistently have interest from the applicant community as demonstrated by our high offer acceptance yield. We are also proud that all four of our eligible subsidiaries are repeatedly recognized as top workplaces by the Baltimore Sun and Sun Sentinel. 
Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of trademark and copyright to protect our intellectual property. We have registered certain of our trademarks and service marks in the United States with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and in Canada and China, and have registered copyrights on certain publications. In addition, we have registered our domain names, including MarketWise.com, with MarkMonitor. We believe the names and marks associated with our brands are of significant value and are important to our business. Accordingly, as a general policy, we monitor the use of our marks and vigorously oppose any unauthorized use of the marks. We do not hold any patents.
We seek to control access to and distribution of our proprietary information. We enter into confidentiality, nondisclosure, and non-interference agreements with our employees, consultants, customers, and vendors that generally provide that any confidential or proprietary information developed by us or on our behalf be kept confidential, and we limit access to our confidential and proprietary information to a “need to know” basis. In the normal course of business, we provide our intellectual property to third parties through licensing or restricted use agreements. In addition, our internal policies seek to protect our intellectual property against misappropriation, infringement, and unfair competition. We intend to pursue additional intellectual property protection to the extent we believe it would be beneficial and cost effective.

Upon the consummation of the Transactions, ADAC’s Class A ordinary shares, warrants, and units ceased trading on The New York Stock Exchange, and MarketWise, Inc.’s Class A common stock and warrants began trading on the Nasdaq under the symbols “MKTW” and “MKTW W,” respectively.
