Item 1. Business
Overview
 
We began operations in 2016 as a subscription-based e-commerce company. We make shopping easy, convenient, and accessible for parents by delivering, in a box, fashionable and personalized outfits for kids. kidpik provides kids clothing subscription boxes for boys and girls of varying sizes from toddler to youth that include mix-&-match coordinated outfits that are personalized based on each member’s style preferences. We focus on providing entire outfits from head-to-toe (including shoes) by designing each seasonal collection in-house from concept to box.
 
Our mission statement is “To change the way parents shop for their kids by delivering outfits that make their kids confident and happy.”
 
We take a partially integrated approach allowing us to design, merchandise and procure each seasonal collections with outfit coordination in mind from the beginning of the process and to deliver what we believe is a beneficial customer experience in terms of style, quality, value, curation, and outfit coordination.
 
We save parents time by delivering personalized, mix-&-match outfits curated by our team of seasoned stylists, that are ready to wear right out-of-the-box. Members shop from the comfort of their home and have a week to decide what to keep, return or exchange.
 
We acquire most of our new members primarily though social media marketing where we continuously explore new ads, new audiences, new channels, and by expanding into new product lines such as adding boys clothing and toddler sizes. We attribute the positive engagement of our members to having solved the following two pain points for parents and kids:
 
Difficulty of selecting fashionable outfits that match: Parents do not always have the expertise to put together stylized, fashionable looks.
 
Avoiding challenging in-store shopping experiences: Shopping for children’s clothing in stores and online can be challenging for parents. It can be time consuming, difficult, and require going to multiple stores and online ecommerce sites, which may result in additional challenges, including, but not limited to, parents being required to bring their children with them to go shopping.
 
Business Development
 
kidpik began operations in 2016, focused on personalized girls’ fashions sizes 4-14, curated in a box. Our aim was to make it easy for parents and save time by doing the shopping and styling for them, delivering personalized coordinated outfits (which we call ‘piks’), allowing them to try-on the clothing, shoes, and accessories in the comfort of their home, and within the context of their kids’ closets. We built our subscription ‘box’ which currently contains seven or eight items — five or six pieces of clothing, a pair of shoes, and an accessory — to create mix-&-match personalized outfits. Our subscription boxes are available on kidpik.com.
 
After launching with our girls’ subscription box for sizes 4-14 in 2016, we have continued to expand our product offering and marketing channels. We expanded into boys’ clothes, added larger sizes up to 16 for apparel and 6 youth for shoes, added toddler sizes down to 2T and 3T for apparel and 7 and 8 toddler shoes, launched shop.kidpik.com, where we sell our seasonal collection individually including pre-styled outfits, pre-styled boxes and gift cards, and expanded to sell on Amazon.com as Fulfilled by Amazon and Fulfilled by Merchant for pre-packs and individual items and Walmart as Fulfilled by Merchant.

We have also added new features and products to our core subscription service including add-on items, kidpik koins (our loyalty program), and on-demand boxes.
 
Initial Public Offering
 
In November 2021, the Company completed an initial public offering (the “IPO”), in which the Company issued and sold 2,117,647 shares of its authorized common stock for $8.50 per share for net proceeds of $16.1 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions, and offering costs.
Products
 
We offer all apparel categories including tops, bottoms, cardigans, jackets, dresses, and swimwear, in knit and woven fabrications. Shoes are available from size 7 toddler to size 6 youth, including sneakers, boots, sandals, and dress shoes.

We create coordinating and matching outfits from head-to-toe, providing parents a convenient, time saving, and stress-free shopping experience, while offering kids the excitement of unboxing and the opportunity to discover their own unique style.
 
Our personalized service and fashion boxes are primarily marketed towards parents and grandparents for their children and grandchildren. Our in-house team designs, merchandises, and procures all of our apparel, shoes, and accessories to our specifications.
 
As of the date of this Report, we provide e-commerce services only throughout the contiguous United States and Army Post Offices (APOs) and Fleet Post Offices (FPOs).
 
Our Strengths
 
We believe that we have five core strengths that helps kidpik thrive in the still emerging subscription-based e-commerce industry and which give us a competitive advantage:

● | kidpik CEO, Ezra Dabah, and his senior team led The Children’s Place retail stores for 17 years from 1990 to 2007

How kidpik Works
 
We are a “subscription” service with no monthly subscription or styling fees.
 
New members take a 3-minute style quiz which provides us information about silhouettes, colors, prints, fits, favorite looks, and other style preferences their kids like to wear. Members then select a box delivery frequency that works best for them – every 4, 6, or 12 weeks, and enter their shipping and payment information. In conjunction with our proprietary algorithm, our stylists select, three coordinating outfits personalized to each child’s style preferences. We send this information to our warehouse, where we pick and pack the order, ensuring that each box is packed consistently and in a manner that is intended to make opening the box an exciting event. The surprise box of personalized fashion is shipped and delivered to the member door. Members pay no styling, shipping, return or exchange fees, for their ‘boxes’ and only pay for what they keep.
 
What’s in a Box
 
Most Kidpik fashion subscription boxes contain eight items —six items of apparel, a pair of shoes and an accessory, which creates mix & match outfits, from head-to-toe. For our current members we have recently expanded our subscription box offerings, introducing a twelve -items box option. Members are informed they have 7 days to decide what to keep or return and complete the process by checking out online. Returns or exchanges of any items are easy and free. They simply put the items into the provided pre-paid bag and drop it in a USPS mailbox.
 
Membership
 
We define active subscriptions as an individual child in a member’s account who is due to receive future boxes. One member can have multiple subscriptions.
 
Business Strategy
 
We seek to capitalize on the advantages of being a digital first subscription-ecommerce fashion brand. We plan to achieve this goal by executing our business strategy:

1. | Creating a strong value equation for consumers of quality and price, our partial integration allows us to capitalize on what we believe is a significant price sensitive childrenswear market. Focusing on controlling the product and process from concept to box, which allows us to price competitively while having our products under our own kidpik label reinforces the value of our brand to consumers and gives us the opportunity to market our brand through other third-party platforms and retail outlets. 
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | Delivering personalized and styled outfits directly to a member’s door provides a seamless and easy experience for our members allowing us to connect with parents and kids emotionally, driving a stronger brand connection. 
3. | Investing in our data science and technology platforms to continuously drive a positive and frictionless member experience to increase lifetime value.

We believe effectively executing our business strategy will allow us to successfully pursue our goals to become one of the top players in the children’s clothing subscription industry. We believe focusing on personalization of fashion outfits at a value will set us apart from other children’s clothing subscription players. By delivering a consistent and seamless member experience it allows us to build trust and continue to expand our product lines into our members households. Below is a discussion of how we plan to capitalize upon our business strategy.
 
Members & Marketing Channels
 
Our first member was acquired on January 20, 2016, and we shipped our first curated girl’s fashion box on March 18, 2016. We believe we drove many of our member acquisitions through Facebook and Instagram Ads, Google Ads, email, affiliates, public relations, influencer marketing and search engine optimization (SEO), along with referrals from current members, word of mouth, and through family, friends, and communities. Beginning in 2021, we expanded our advertising to include YouTube, Snapchat, TikTok, Pinterest, and digital co-branded collaborations.
 
In the age of digital ads and e-commerce, we believe that social proof (a psychological and social phenomenon wherein people copy the actions of others in an attempt to undertake behavior in a given situation) is an important factor for buying or signing up for a product and displaying user generated content (UGC) in our marketing ads has had a role in the increase of member acquisition. We believe that our commitment to growing new channels, together with public relations, influencer marketing, and brand ambassador programs will help drive our growth.
 
We aggressively tests different ad creatives, audiences’ images, and landing pages to find what the most successful experience is for a given audience. This continuous testing provides us an opportunity to stay on top of the trends and adapt our strategy as the situation changes.
 
Add-on Items
 
In 2021, we launched add-on items, which allows members to add items to their next box. We remind members of this option before their box is styled, by sending an email featuring items available to be added. We have found that this increases the average transaction size and our average profit per box.
Member Referral Program
 
We incentivize active members to refer their family and friends to kidpik by extending a discount to their friends on their first box and awarding them a dollars-off credit when their friends make a purchase.
 
During certain promotional periods, kidpik will reward active members immediately after the friend subscribes to kidpik rather than waiting to reward them until the referred member makes a purchase, and offer additional incentives and rewards.
 
Member Loyalty Program
 
We offer the opportunity for members to earn ‘kidpik koins,’ which are part of our loyalty program. Koins are rewarded to members based on certain actions such as keeping the whole box, referring friends, and can be redeemed for free items in our online kidpik koin marketplace. Redeemed items are shipped for free in the member’s next box. We launched this program in October 2020, and it has already been used by thousands of our members.
Brand Ambassador Program
 
In November 2020, we introduced our influencer program, whereby we have pre-selected influencers and have provided free seasonal boxes to said influencers in exchange for recurring seasonal social media posts about kidpik boxes and our products. Each influencer is assigned a unique promo code and affiliate link and earns a monetary commission when their followers subscribe to kidpik. In February of 2022, we have started a program that gives influencers the ability to earn commission on shop purchases of individual items and pre-styled boxes with no subscription required on shop.kidpik.com.

-


In addition to our influencer program, in February of 2022, we launched a consumer-facing brand influencer program, supported by a third-party platform. Through this program, we inspire everyday consumers to act as influencers and to create content promoting kidpik to be shared with their friends and followers. Each consumer brand influencer is assigned a unique promo code and referral link and earns either monetary commission or a credit to their account upon registering a new subscription or completion of a sale.
 
Blog
 
In addition to our subscription and e-commerce websites, we run and manage a brand blog, www.kidpik.com/blog, where we have built a lifestyle around the kidpik brand through articles, activities, and posts, which helps to establish a brand voice and attract new members. Consumers and members can discover more about the kidpik brand story, learn fashion and lifestyle tips, and are treated to virtual events and craft projects designed for our target audience that offer fun for the entire family. Our blog allows us to host long form content and share information about new launches, digital co-branded collaborations, and brand events. The blog also hosts a library of articles that is updated to enhance our brand and serve as a host to SEO keyword searches designed to strategically increase our SEO rankings. 
Large Social Media Community
 
We have garnered a substantial number of social media followers across various platforms, particularly Facebook and Instagram. As of March 31, 2023, we had over 533,000 likes on Facebook and 123,000 followers on Instagram (a like and follow may be done by the same person). A consistent stream of user generated content, also known as UGC, is published to Facebook and Instagram by our members, which is then republished to our social media accounts, ads, emails, and more which we have found helps build social proof and trust for people to subscribe with kidpik. This UGC content accounts for some of our best performing brand assets in terms of conversion, engagement and also generates awareness through our members’ respective channels when they share about their experience with kidpik. We believe our thoughtful unboxing experience inspires members to capture the moment and share it with us and their friends.
Design & Integration Model
 
We believe we have a competitive advantage over our subscription-based e-commerce clothing competitors based on our teams’ extensive knowledge and experience of the childrenswear and footwear industries, and of implementing, optimizing, and executing in-house strong internal processes with our design, merchandising, and procurement teams.
 
All of our apparel and shoes are developed by our in-house design team in New York City. Seasonally, our design team develops a sample line, mostly created in our own sample room in China, allowing for style and trend flexibility, ensuring quality, consistency of fit, and outfit coordination. Our design, and merchandising teams continuously collaborate to ensure that the customer preferences, market trends, and product offerings are being met and we are maintaining our core fashion values. Our merchandising team also analyzes trends and feedback, as well as historical data to identify essential styles, replenishment, and quantities to support the business needs. Our design, merchandising, and styling teams work to build a collection where each style can be merchandised together to create beautiful mix-&-match outfits. Our production team works directly with suppliers and factories to produce our finalized styles, ensuring each style is made to all of our detailed specifications including quality, color, sizing, and fit. We rely on a limited number of suppliers and factories where we contract to manufacture our products and while we have long-standing relations with them, we do not have long-term contracts with these parties. For the year ended December 31, 2022, two vendors accounted for approximately 48% of inventory purchases. For the year ended January 1, 2022, three vendors accounted for approximately 49% of inventory purchases. Our production team also coordinates and provides specific instruction on all packing and shipping requirements to ensure efficiencies. Our products are shipped from our manufacturers directly to our distribution center in California, which handles all our warehousing, fulfillment, packing, outbound shipping, returns, and exchanges.

This process ensures consistency of style, quality, fit, and color along with complete outfit coordination beginning with style development to final box coordination. The process also allows us to cater to each of our members’ unique style, color, print, sparkle, fit, and other preferences as well as lifestyle categories including girly, active, classic, urban, and trendy across boys, girls, and toddlers since we design and merchandise these preferences.
 
Our internal design process allows us to control all style specifications, including color, sizing and fit, across all our apparel, shoe, and accessory categories. This ensures consistency, complete outfit coordination, and takes over the challenging aspects of the shopping experience from our members, as everything mixes and matches, from head-to-toe. Inconsistency of sizing and color differentiation is something we have found can be very frustrating when shopping for kids’ clothes from different brands.
 
We contract to manufacture with vendors for the products we sell. As of December 31, 2022, we procured merchandise from more than 28 vendors. In the event these vendors decide to terminate their relationships with us or cease supplying products, such vendors may be difficult to replace and/or the products they supply us may be more expensive or of lesser quality. It can take a significant amount of time and resources to identify, develop and maintain relationships with vendors. The termination of, or material changes to, arrangements with key vendors, disagreements with key vendors as to payment or other terms, or the failure of a key supplier or vendor to meet its contractual obligations to us may require us to contract with alternative vendors. If we have to replace key vendors, we may be subject to pricing or other terms less favorable than those we currently enjoy, and it may be difficult to identify and secure relationships with alternative vendors that are able to meet our volume requirements and quality or other standards. If we cannot replace or engage vendors who meet our specifications and standards in a short period of time, we could encounter increased expenses, shortages of items, disruptions, or delays in customer shipments. If this were to occur, we could experience delays in shipments, cancellations, and a reduction in sales revenue, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.
 
Pricing Strategy
 
The childrenswear apparel and footwear market is one of necessity, and therefore it is very price sensitive as kids regularly out-grow their clothes. Through our integration model, we control the entire process from design to merchandising, procurement and fulfillment, to offer a balanced value equation of price, quality, and fashion. This allows us to negotiate the costs directly with the suppliers, avoiding having to pay middlemen markups, enabling us to pass that savings along to our members in this very price sensitive childrenswear marketplace.
Technology Processes
 
We scale and do our best to stay ahead of the competition by putting technical innovation and execution at the heart of our business. Over the past seven years, we have invested heavily in our proprietary technology and algorithm capabilities and built a robust infrastructure that we believe is positioned accordingly to meet the thriving clothing subscription industry. Our model collects consumer data through an interactive quiz that allows us to deliver a unique and personalized experience in every box. As members keep and return items, our algorithm refines its understanding of individual preferences which improves personalization.
 
Our members provide us with dozens of initial data points that include sizes, style preferences, dislikes, and fits, that we use to personalize and style their boxes. This personalized data is refined over time by member feedback. This data is paired with our in-house algorithmic software to match members with the best combinations of outfits. The algorithm combines initial data from various sources including the style quiz, feedback given or received via product actions (i.e., returns), member box reviews, product and box-level data, target climate and seasonal information, price-related feedback, along with other proprietary information. It uses this data to generate outfit combinations designed to maximize keep rate results along several spectra including: member satisfaction, profit maximization and overall inventory optimization.

Most of our internal systems and development tools are fully custom-built and designed specifically for our unique business model. These systems allow us extensive flexibility and the ability to quickly and decisively respond to ever-changing business and technological needs. Building proprietary tools are necessary as the technical complexity of the clothing subscription business currently cannot be managed by off-the-shelf solutions. We believe that our years of proprietary technology development have only served to widen the gap between us and any potential competitors who may seek to enter the space.
 
Warehouse systems include features such as optimal pick path mapping and just-in-time replenishment of inventory from backstock, allowing pickers to operate with maximum efficiency and ensuring necessary inventory is always available in active picking locations. The system also manages a year-round cycle counting process, maintaining consistent inventory integrity which eliminates the need for an annual physical inventory.
 
Consumer facing applications include our website and mobile site, both built and managed internally. Members can interact with our service, update their style preferences, change payment methods, update delivery frequency, pause or skip a box, select add-ons, checkout for orders and seamlessly exchange items for different sizing. Multiple member retention and experience features have been built into the application as well, including refer-a-friend, loyalty (kidpik koins), add-on marketplace, and our influencer/ambassador gateways.
 
We have developed a powerful in-house application that affords our stylists and merchandising teams’ complete visibility and control over our product line. This allows styling to occur virtually and efficiently. An intuitive, easy-to-use interface allows for millions of potential outfit combinations to be created and properly tagged with dozens of data markers for usage by our proprietary algorithm. The application is fully integrated with our customer relationship management (CRM) database and inventory system and provides up-to-date visibility to inventory levels and consumer feedback.
 
Subscription and Children’s Apparel Industry Trends
 
According to 2023 estimates by Statista, in its Children’s Apparel Report 2022, revenue in the children’s apparel segment will total approximately $267 billion in 2023, of which approximately $53 billion is forecasted to be generated in the United States and is projected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 2.46% through 2027.
 
Pursuant to a February 2022 study by The Subscribed Institute, subscription businesses have consistently outperformed sales revenue growth of non-subscription businesses. Zuora, Inc., a leading subscription management platform provider, in its February 2022, bi-annual Subscription Economy Index™ (SEI), noted that subscription businesses have grown by 4.6x faster than the S&P 500 over the past decade, driven by an increase in consumer demand for the use of subscription services. The childrenswear apparel market is one of necessity, and consequently is very price sensitive as children regularly out-grow their clothes and shoes. Through our integration model, we control the majority of the process from design to merchandising, procurement and fulfillment. This allows us to negotiate the costs directly with the suppliers, avoiding having to pay middlemen markups. We believe that this integration process allows us to offer lower prices and obtain higher margins resulting in a strong value equation of price, quality and fashion.
 
We are devoted to improving personalization and experience aspects for our members and plan to continue to develop new technologies and implement new marketing strategies to stay at the forefront of subscription personalization.
 
Competition
 
The childrenswear market is highly competitive and price sensitive. We compete directly with other subscription clothing services. We also compete with department stores, mass merchants, discount stores, specialty chains and other retail stores, including their online platforms, brick-and-mortar locations, and other e-commerce companies selling children’s apparel.

11
--

Competitive Advantage
 
We believe we have a competitive advantage over online and brick-and-mortar sellers who do not offer curated, personalized fashion, fully coordinated outfits delivered free, and do not offer the convenience that our subscription service provides.
 
We further believe that the combination of our robust client dataset and refined proprietary technology offers us a competitive advantage in a marketplace with considerable barriers to entry, due to the complexity of building IT systems that can adequately support this type of clothing subscription process and the algorithm involved in yielding member personalization and satisfaction.
 
Sourcing
 
Our clothing, shoes and accessories are manufactured under our own kidpik brand name and are produced according to our own specifications. We have long-standing relationships with our manufacturers; however, we have no long-term contractual agreements. We produce our goods in two countries, China and Turkey. In 2021, we experienced delivery delays due to nationwide supply chain issues and COVID-19. Our top six factories account for over 68% of our production and, combined, have been with us for over five years on average, despite the fact that we have only been in operation for only a little over seven years. We look at various points of criteria before choosing factories - cost, product quality, social and safety conditions, reliability, minimum order quantity, technical skills, and lead times (order to delivery). We test each style with a third party to ensure that it is compliant with the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act (CPSIA) requirements. As the goods arrive at our warehouse, we inspect each style, color, and size to make sure that all products meet our standards and specifications, prior to shipping to customers.
 
We have a team of product buyers with years of experience. We have the knowledge and expertise in building each style’s cost from the bottom up.
 
Organizational History
 
We were formed as “ER18 LLC”, a Delaware limited liability company on April 16, 2015, in connection with the filing of a Certificate of Formation with the Secretary of State of Delaware. On August 24, 2015, we filed a Certificate of Amendment to our Certificate of Formation with the Secretary of State of Delaware, changing our name to Kidpik LLC. On August 18, 2016, pursuant to the filing of a Certificate of Conversion from a Limited Liability Company to a Corporation pursuant to Section 265 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, we converted from a Delaware limited liability company to a Delaware corporation (the “Conversion”). Immediately prior to the Conversion, Ezra Dabah (our current Chief Executive Officer and Chairman), his wife and their children owned 100% of the limited liability company interests. Immediately subsequent to the Conversion, Mr. and Mrs. Dabah and their children owned 671,000 shares of common stock.
 
On January 14, 2019, we filed an Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of Delaware, which had been approved by the stockholders, which among other things, affected a 10-for-1 forward stock split of our outstanding common stock and increased our authorized common stock from 1,500 shares of common stock no par value per share, to 10,000 shares of common stock, no par value per share.
 
On May 9, 2021, the stockholders approved the filing of a Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, which was subsequently filed with the Secretary of State of Delaware on May 10, 2021, which, among other things, effected a 671-for-1 forward split of our outstanding common stock, increased our authorized common stock to 75 million shares of common stock, $0.001 par value per share, and authorized 25 million shares of “blank check” preferred stock, with a par value of $0.001 per share.

Each of the forward stock splits discussed above have been retroactively reflected throughout this Report.
 
Government Regulation
 
We are subject to numerous U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations that affect companies conducting business on the internet. Many of these laws and regulations are still evolving and being tested in courts, and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business. These may involve user privacy, data protection and personal information, the privacy of consumer information and other laws regarding unfair and deceptive trade practices.
 
U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations, which in some cases can be enforced by private parties in addition to government entities, are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change. As a result, the application, interpretation, and enforcement of these laws and regulations are often uncertain, particularly in the new and rapidly evolving industry in which we operate, and may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from country to country and inconsistently with our current policies and practices.
 
Our sales of apparel, shoes and accessories, are also subject to regulation, including in the United States by the Federal Trade Commission and the Consumer Products Safety Commission (CPSC), as well as various other federal, state, local and foreign regulatory authorities. These laws and regulations principally relate to the proper labeling, advertising, marketing, manufacture, safety, shipment and disposal of our products. Because we import our products from abroad, we are also subject to import regulations and regulations relating to trade. For example, the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act, which became effective on January 1, 2012, requires us to provide certain information about our efforts to eradicate human trafficking from our supply chain.
 
Because we sell children’s products, we are also subject to the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act, which requires that children’s products: (a) comply with all applicable children’s product safety rules; (b) be tested for compliance by a CPSC-accepted accredited laboratory, unless subject to an exception; (c) have a written Children’s Product Certificate that provides evidence of the product’s compliance; and (d) have permanent tracking information affixed to the product and its packaging where practicable.
 
To the best of our knowledge, all of our suppliers and manufacturers adhere to labor and workplace standards and operate in compliance with all applicable laws, including laws prohibiting child labor, forced labor and unsafe working conditions.
 
We, as are many other companies, are also subject to environmental laws, rules and regulations which could affect our operations. We do not estimate any significant capital expenditures for environmental control matters either in the current fiscal year or in the near future.
 
Proposed or new legislation and regulations could also significantly affect our business. There currently are a number of proposals pending before federal, state, and foreign legislative and regulatory bodies.
 
For more information about laws and regulations applicable to our business, see “Risks Related to Government Regulation.”
 
Intellectual Property
 
Our intellectual property includes the content of our websites, our registered domain names, our registered and unregistered trademarks, and certain trade secrets. We believe that our intellectual property is an essential asset of our business and that our registered domain name and our technology infrastructure will give us a competitive advantage in the marketplace. We plan to rely on a combination of patent (where applicable), trademark, copyright, trade secret, including federal, state and common law rights in the United States and other countries, nondisclosure agreements, and other measures to protect our intellectual property. Despite any measures taken to protect our intellectual property, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. Our business is affected by our ability to protect against misappropriation and infringement of our intellectual property and other proprietary rights.

13
--

Trademarks and Copyrights
 
We maintain various U.S. federal and foreign (China, Canada, Mexico, the European Union and the United Kingdom) trademarks for our trademarks and also rely on federal or statutory common law copyright and trade secret protections in relation to our brand name.
Employees
 
As of the date of the filing of this Report, we had 25 full-time employees, located in New York and California. Marketing has four employees, merchandising has four employees, design has three employees, production has two employees, customer service has four employees, IT has three employees, finance has three employees, and the warehouse has two employees. On a limited basis, we may use temporary personnel to supplement our workforce as business needs arise. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement.
 
We are focused on the safety, retention and development of our existing employees and the recruitment of new employees. We promote a holistic approach to building our team and have created a culture that is inclusive, diverse and high performing. We seek out and hire team members who bring specialized, functional expertise while able to collaborate effectively across functions. We believe our compensation programs are competitive relative to others in our industry and are designed to attract, retain and reward personnel through the combination of cash-based compensation, equity-based compensation and benefits.
 
Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19)
 
In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus, which causes the infectious disease known as COVID-19, was reported in Wuhan, China. The World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a “Public Health Emergency of International Concern” on January 30, 2020 and a global pandemic on March 11, 2020. In March and April 2020, many U.S. states and local jurisdictions began issuing ‘stay-at-home’ orders. During the majority of March and April 2020, we closed our California warehouse and were not able to ship products due to stay-at-home orders which were issued in the State of California. We resumed shipping April 17, 2020, following safety protocols and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines. On an aggregate basis we lost about two weeks of potential revenue during this period where we were unable to ship products. For the months of March and April 2020, our new member acquisitions were reduced dramatically. Beginning in early May 2020 through the month of June 2020, our new member acquisitions grew significantly, most likely due to stay-at-home orders when consumers shifted to shopping online, before leveling off to expected growth numbers. Consumer trends and the availability of materials have mainly returned to pre-pandemic levels to date and the Biden administration recently has advised that it intends to end the COVID-19 national and public health emergencies on May 11, 2023.
 
Although COVID-19 has had a major impact on businesses around the world, to date, we have only experienced negative impacts regarding our warehouse shutdown from March and April 2020, and disruption in delayed arrival of our merchandise due to the pandemic. Since then, our warehouse returned to working at a full capacity; however, the full extent to which COVID-19 will ultimately impact us depends on future unknowable developments, including the duration and spread of the virus, as well as potential new seasonal outbreaks, the efficacy of vaccines, and the willingness of individuals to take such vaccines, all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting economic disruption has also led to significant volatility in the capital markets, increased inflation and interest rates. While we have taken measures to preserve our access to liquidity, our cash generated from operations has been negatively impacted and future cash flows may be impacted by recent economic conditions, volatility in capital markets, inflation and high interest rates.

Emerging Growth Company under the JOBS Act
 
As a company with less than $1.235 billion in revenue during our last fiscal year, we qualify as an “emerging growth company” under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. As an emerging growth company, we have elected to take advantage of reduced reporting requirements and are relieved of certain other significant requirements that are otherwise generally applicable to public companies. As an emerging growth company:
 
● we may present only two years of audited financial statements and only two years of related Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations;
 
● we are exempt from the requirement to obtain an attestation and report from our auditors on whether we maintained effective internal control over financial reporting under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;
 
● we are permitted to provide less extensive disclosure about our executive compensation arrangements; and
 
● we are not required to give our stockholders non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements.
 
We may take advantage of these provisions until January 2, 2027 (the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of our initial public offering) if we continue to be an emerging growth company. We would cease to be an emerging growth company if we have more than $1.235 billion in annual revenue, have more than $700 million in market value of our shares held by non-affiliates or issue more than $1.0 billion of non-convertible debt over a three-year period. We may choose to take advantage of some but not all of these reduced burdens. We have elected to provide two years of audited financial statements. Additionally, we have elected to take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act, for complying with new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until the earlier of the date we (i) are no longer an emerging growth company or (ii) affirmatively and irrevocably opt out of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act.
 
Controlled Company
 
Ezra Dabah, our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, our principal stockholder, currently controls approximately 62.2% of the voting power of our capital stock (based on shares of common stock outstanding as of March 31, 2023), and we are therefore a “controlled company” as defined under Nasdaq Marketplace Rules. We currently intend to rely on the controlled company exemptions provided under Nasdaq Marketplace Rules, which permit us to rely on certain exemptions from corporate governance rules, including: (a) an exemption from the rule that a majority of our board of directors must be independent directors; (b) an exemption from the rule that the compensation of our chief executive officer must be determined or recommended solely by independent directors; and (c) an exemption from the rule that our director nominees must be selected or recommended solely by independent directors.
