ITEM 1 – BUSINESS
Overview
 
Minim was founded in 1977 as a networking company and now delivers intelligent software to protect and improve the WiFi connections we depend on to work, learn, and live. Headquartered in Manchester, New Hampshire, Minim holds the exclusive global license to design, manufacture, and sell consumer networking products under the Motorola brand. Our cable and WiFi products, with an intelligent operating system and bundled mobile app, can be found in leading retailers and e-commerce channels in the United States (“U.S.”). Our AI-driven cloud software platform and applications make network management and security simple for home and business users, as well as the service providers that assist them— leading to higher customer satisfaction and decreased support burden.
 
Our mission is to make WiFi safe and supportive for everyone. We believe that to do this, we must develop and distribute connectivity software that delivers frequent network security updates, helpful apps, extensive personalization options, and a delightful interface. As people increasingly depend on their WiFi for streaming, working, learning, telemedicine, education, and potentially the Metaverse, our primary objective is to leverage trends and build upon our position as a leading provider of intelligent networking products. We can accomplish this by innovating advanced products with the latest connectivity standards and expanding our footprint both nationally and globally via top retailers, e-commerce platforms, and app stores.
 
As Minim has been investing in WiFi software development, cable modem products, including both cable modems and cable modem/routers (“gateways”), were Minim’s highest revenue product category between 2015 through 2022. Cable modems provide a high-bandwidth connection to the Internet through a cable service provider’s managed broadband network. Minim began shipping cable modems in 2000 and acquired a geographically-restricted license to sell Motorola-branded cable networking products in 2016. From 2016 through 2021, the Company sold networking products under its previously-owned ZOOM trademark as well as the Motorola brand. Minim’s primary means of distribution to end-users in the U.S., our primary market, is through national retailers, e-commerce platforms, and distributors. In response to demand for faster connection speeds, security by design, and increased functionality, we have invested and continue to invest resources to advance our cable modem product line.

Strategy Overview
 
Our strategy is to address the increasing demands of broadband users with advanced technology and build upon our position as a leading home networking product supplier in many of the largest U.S. high-volume retailers. The key pillars to our strategy are as follows:
 
Distribute high-margin software – Our cloud-based software is currently a companion to home networking equipment and has the potential to be distributed on its own. We are focused on transforming our established hardware sales into a platform for software distribution and have an ambitious roadmap to make it so much more. We believe quality WiFi software is a profit driver, lending to higher Average Selling Prices (ASPs) and the ability to form a lasting relationship with an end user for product upsells. In addition, our APIs allow third-party hardware vendors and ISPs to leverage Minim in their own products.
 
Customer-driven design – With continued investment in warranties and omni-channel customer service, we see our direct and frequent connection to end users as a market advantage that informs our product roadmap. The Company continues to invest in research and development with the latest connectivity standards— such as DOCSIS 3.1, WiFi 6 and 6E, EasyMesh, and 5G— to design advanced products while optimizing costs to maintain a healthy, price segmented portfolio. In 2021, the Company brought firmware development in-house (“MinimOS”) to accelerate product time-to-market and improve Quality of Experience; as part of this, Minim is now part of the widely supported TIP Open WiFi community.
 
Expand sales reach – We maintain strong sales channel relationships by delivering value-driven products in a way that complements, not challenges, our resellers’ profitability. We believe this is a competitive edge that affords us wider access to the total addressable market through both retailers and ISPs. As we invest in marketing and new product introductions to existing channels, we consider new market entrances.
 
Strengthen supply chain resiliency – The Company continues to adjust its manufacturing operations and delivery mechanisms to reduce operational costs. We continue to build supply chain diversity to improve our operational resiliency to geopolitical, weather-related, and market-based risks to our product supply.
 
Products
 
General
 
We are the creator of innovative Internet access products that dependably connect people to the information they need and the people they love. Our hardware portfolio includes: cable modems, cable modem/routers, mobile broadband modems, wireless routers, Multimedia over Coax Alliance (MoCA) adapters, and mesh home networking devices. Our SaaS platform includes: mobile applications, a web application, API suites, and an open-source embedded agent for networking devices.
 
We have sold home networking products under the globally-recognized Motorola brand, as well as under our previously owned ZOOM trademark. Our hardware and SaaS products are purchased by consumers to support and protect their family’s connected devices; ISPs to reduce support costs and increase revenue with digitally transformed support and value-added services; and by businesses to affordably support and secure satellite and remote worker networks.
 
The 2020 License Agreement applies to a wide range of products, including consumer grade cellular modems and gateways, DSL modems and gateways, and MoCA adapters for networking and home security products and services. In 2020, we extended our home networking product assortment with the launch of Motorola Mesh Router Systems and have since grown our mesh product line to include five systems including the latest generation of WiFi 6E technology. In total our catalog of hardware products has expanded to over twenty four home networking devices. In that same year, we started to enable our hardware with our Minim OS software, branded under the name Moto-Sync and providing consumers a whole home network solution.

Home Networking Hardware
 
Our networking hardware products connect homes and small offices to the Internet, create wireless networks, and extend the wireless signal. These products are now primarily available through retail and e-commerce channels in the U.S.

● | Modems and Modem/Routers (“Gateways”), which are devices that convert cable service into Internet connectivity for ethernet-only connection (modems) or ethernet and wireless connections (modem/routers). Minim’s primary cable modem sales from 2016 through 2021 were of Motorola brand products. We have obtained CableLabs® certification for our currently marketed cable modems, and these cable modems have also received a number of cable service provider certifications. Required by most service providers for interoperability on their networks, all modem and modem/router products must pass this lengthy, expensive, and technically challenging certification process. Minim plans to extend its DOCSIS 3.1 product line, adding high-performance modem/routers including WiFi 6 and mesh-capable routers. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Routers and Mesh Systems, which are devices that create WiFi networks. Mesh WiFi systems extend the signal throughout a wider area than a single router can typically cover. In 2020, Minim launched its first mesh WiFi system and plans to extend its mesh and router portfolio with WiFi 6 and WiFi 6E capabilities. 
● | Other Local Area Network Products, which are devices that create, extend, or enhance a Local Access Network. Minim currently offers MoCA adapters, which provides an Ethernet connection over coaxial cable between a MoCA-capable router and connected devices. 

 
SaaS
 
The Minim SaaS platform offers three core software components:
 

● | Minim mobile application for end users to personalize and monitor their home and office network with features such as speed testing, data usage tracking, security alerts, malware blocking, privacy settings, parental controls. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Minim web application that enables technical support representatives in ISPs and businesses to offer efficient remote support with network insights. 
● | Minim API suite and MinimOS for third-party hardware vendors, ISPs, and other partners to integrate with the Minim platform, leverage Minim functionality, and manage their own account data. A foundational component of our SaaS is an open-source embedded agent for integration with any third-party router firmware. 

Products for Markets outside North America
 
The vast majority of our sales were in North America from 2015 through 2022 because the business predominantly sold cable modem and modem/router products, and the U.S. is by far the largest market for cable modems sold through retailers. However, we expect to see growth outside North America as we expand our customer base and portfolio of retail routers, mesh systems, and other local area network products under our worldwide Motorola brand license.
 
Networking hardware products for countries outside the U.S. typically differ from a similar product for the U.S. because of varied regulatory and certification requirements, country-specific phone jacks and AC power adapters, and language needs. As a result, the introduction of new products into markets outside North America can incur significant costs and time to market. We have planned product line enhancements to enable new market expansion. Most importantly for sales outside the U.S., we are working toward selling Motorola brand home networking hardware and SaaS products in Canada and Mexico.
 
Sales Channels
 
General
 
We sell our products primarily through high-volume retailers and distributors (“B2C”), Internet service providers, individual businesses (“B2B”), service providers, value-added resellers, PC system integrators, and Original Equipment Manufacturers (“OEMs”). We support our major accounts in their efforts to discern strategic directions in the market, to maintain appropriate inventory levels, and to offer a balanced selection of attractive products.

Relatively few customers account for a substantial portion of the Company’s revenues. In 2022, two customers accounted for 10% or greater individually, and 87% in the aggregate of the Company’s total net sales. At December 31, 2022, two customers with an accounts receivable balance of 10% or greater individually accounted for a combined 75% of the Company’s accounts receivable. In 2021, two customers accounted for 10% or greater individually, and 92% in the aggregate of the Company’s total net sales. At December 31, 2021, four customers with an accounts receivable balance of 10% or greater individually accounted for a combined 86% of the Company’s accounts receivable.
 

Distributors and Retailers outside North America
 
In markets outside North America we sell and ship our hardware products primarily to distributors. Our SaaS is globally sold via licenses to ISPs and Resellers globally. We believe that sales growth outside North America will continue to require substantial additional investments of resources for product design and testing, regulatory certifications, native-language instruction manuals and software, packaging, sales support, and technical support. We have made this investment in the past for many countries, and we expect to make this investment for some countries and products in the future. However, we anticipate that the majority of sales in the next two years will come from North America, partly because the U.S. is one of the few countries with a robust retail cable modem market due to Federal regulations in the U.S. As we expand our product portfolio beyond cable modems and through Reseller relationships, we envision the proportion of our sales from countries outside the U.S. will increase.
North American High-volume Retailers and Distributors
 
In North America, we reach the retail market primarily through high-volume retailers. Our North American retailers include Best Buy, Micro Center, Target, Wal-Mart, and e-tail and e-commerce platforms including Amazon.
 
We sell significant quantities of our products through distributors, who often sell to corporate accounts, retailers, service providers, value-added resellers, equipment manufacturers, and other customers. Our North American distributors include D&H Distributing and Summit Growth Partners.
 
Internet Service Providers & Businesses
 
Minim works with over 140 ISPs and businesses with its subscription-based WiFi management and security software. Our solution enables challenger ISPs to better compete in the market with a premium WiFi solution while lowering operational costs with support call and onsite visit avoidance. For our business customers, our solution reduces the costs, deployment time, and risks to supporting and securing remote employee and satellite office networks. We are empowering the IT staff of our business customers to secure and support employee home networks and other small workspaces. Our customer base is primarily located in the US; however, we have customers all over the world, including Canada, the UK, and South Africa. In October 2022, the Company announced that it will exit from its ISP related business to focus on its core strategy.
 
OEM and Router Manufacturers
 
Our open-source embedded software agent enables third-party hardware vendors to integrate Minim in their networking devices, potentially to create a recurring revenue stream with our software services. Our system integrator and OEM customers sell our products under their own name or incorporate our products as a component of their systems. We seek to be responsive to the needs of these customers by providing on-time delivery of high- quality, reliable, cost-effective products with strong engineering and sales support.
 
Sales, Marketing and Support
 
In North America, we sell our Motorola, and Minim® products through a direct sales force and commissioned independent sales representatives to retailers; through channel resellers; and through electronics distributors.
 
We believe that Motorola is a widely recognized brand name, and we build upon this brand equity in a variety of ways, including: Amazon advertising, Google AdWords advertising, social media marketing and advertising, retailer cooperative advertising, product packaging, trade shows, and public relations. We promote Minim® brand awareness through similar means, as well as engaging in industry associations, content marketing, outbound sales development, analyst briefings, and open-source project contributions.
 
We develop quality products that are user-friendly and are designed to require minimal support. We typically support our claims of quality with product warranties of one to two years, depending upon the product. To address the needs of end-users and resellers who require assistance, we have our own staff of technical support specialists. They provide telephone support six days per week in English and Spanish and aim to continuously expand languages, availability, and support channels. Our technical support specialists also maintain a significant Internet support facility that includes email, firmware and software downloads, and a digital knowledgebase. Worldwide technical support is primarily handled from our Manchester, New Hampshire headquarters.

Research and Development
 
Our research and development efforts are focused on developing new products, enhancing the capabilities of existing products, and reducing production costs. We have developed close collaborative relationships with certain of our Original Design Manufacturer (“ODM”) suppliers and component suppliers. We work with these partners and other sources to identify and respond to emerging technologies and market trends by developing products that address these trends. We also develop all the hardware and firmware for certain products in-house, including some cellular modems and some future cellular sensors.
 
The Company’s research and development costs for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were $5.8 million and $6.2 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, we had thirty-five employees engaged primarily in research and development. Our research and development team performs hardware design and layout, mechanical design, prototype construction and testing, component specification, firmware and software development, product testing, foreign and domestic regulatory certification efforts, end-user and internal documentation, and third-party software selection and testing.
 
Manufacturing & Suppliers
 
Our products are currently designed for high-volume automated assembly to help assure reduced costs, rapid market entry, short lead times, and reliability. High-volume assembly mostly occurs in Vietnam or China. Our contract manufacturers and original design manufacturers typically obtain some or all of the components required to assemble the products based upon a Minim approved vendor list and parts list. Our manufacturers typically insert parts onto the printed circuit board, with most parts automatically inserted by machine, solder the circuit board, and test the completed assemblies. The contract manufacturer sometimes performs final packaging. For the U.S. and many other markets, packaging is often performed at our facilities in North America, allowing us to tailor the packaging and its contents for our customers immediately before shipping. This facility also performs warehousing, shipping, quality control, finishing and some software updates from time to time. We also perform circuit design, circuit board layout, and strategic component sourcing at our Boston area office. Wherever the product is built, our quality systems are used to help assure that the product meets our specifications.
 
Our North American facility is currently located in Tijuana, Mexico. From time to time, we experience certain challenges associated with the Tijuana facility, specifically relating to bringing products across the border between the U.S. and Mexico. We believe that this facility assists us in cost- effectively providing rapid response to the needs of our U.S. customers.
 
Historically, we have used one primary manufacturer for a given design. We sometimes maintain back-up production tooling at a second manufacturer for our highest-volume products. Our manufacturers are normally adequate to meet reasonable and properly planned production needs; but a fire, natural calamity, strike, financial problem, the impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic or another significant event at an assembler’s facility could adversely affect our shipments and revenues. In 2022, two suppliers provided 93% of our purchased inventory. The loss of these key suppliers, or a material adverse change in a key supplier’s business or in our relationship with a key supplier, could materially and adversely harm our business.
 
Our products include a large number of parts, most of which are available from multiple sources with varying lead times. However, most of our products include a sole-sourced chipset as the most critical component of the product. The vast majority of our cable modem chipsets come exclusively from Broadcom. Serious problems at Broadcom, including long chipset lead-times, would significantly reduce Minim’s shipments. Similar to many companies that use computer chips in their business, we also experienced supply chain issues in sourcing chips due to chipset shortages during 2021 and 2022. There can be no assurance that we will not experience such issues in the future.
 
We have experienced delays in receiving shipments of essential integrated circuits in the past, and we may experience such delays in the future. Moreover, we cannot assure that a chipset supplier will, in the future, sell chipsets to us in quantities sufficient to meet our needs or that we will purchase the specified dollar amount of products necessary to receive concessions and incentives from a chipset supplier. An interruption in a chipset supplier’s ability to deliver chipsets, a failure of our suppliers to produce chipset enhancements or new chipsets on a timely basis and at competitive prices, a material increase in the price of the chipsets, our failure to purchase a specified dollar amount of products or any other adverse change in our relationship with modem component suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
 
We are also subject to price fluctuations in our cost of goods. Our costs may increase if component shortages develop, lead-times stretch out, fuel costs rise, or significant delays develop due to labor-related issues.
 
We are also subject to the Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive (“RoHS”) and Consumer Electronics Control (“CEC”) rules, which affect component sourcing, product manufacturing, sales, and marketing.

Competition
 
The Internet access and networking industries are intensely competitive and characterized by aggressive pricing practices, continually changing customer demand patterns, rapid technological advances, and emerging industry standards. These characteristics result in frequent introductions of new products with added capabilities and features, and continuous improvements in the relative functionality and price of modems and other communications products. Our operating results and our ability to compete could be adversely affected if we are unable to:

● | successfully and accurately anticipate customer demand; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | manage our product transitions, inventory levels, and manufacturing processes efficiently; 
● | distribute or introduce our products quickly in response to customer demand and technological advances; 
● | differentiate our products from those of our competitors; or 
● | otherwise compete successfully in the markets for our products. 

 
Some of our primary competitors by product group include the following:
 

● | Cable modem and modem/router competitors: Belkin/Linksys, Commscope/Arris, D-Link, Hon Hai Network Systems (formerly Ambit Microsystems), Netgear, Sagemcom, Technicolor, TP-Link and Ubee Interactive. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Router and mesh WiFi competitors: Amazon/Eero, Amped, Apple, Asus, Belkin/Linksys, D-Link, Google, Netgear, Securifi, Tenda, TP- Link, Trendnet, and Ubiquiti. 
● | WiFi Management and Security: AirTies, Cujo AI, Plume Design, SAM Seamless Network. 

 
Many of our competitors and potential competitors have more extensive financial, engineering, product development, manufacturing, and marketing resources than we do.
 
The principal competitive factors in our industry include the following:
 

● | product performance, features, reliability and quality of service; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | price; 
● | brand image; 
● | product availability and lead times; 
● | size and stability of operations;

We believe we are able to provide a competitive mix of the above factors for our products, particularly when they are sold through retailers, computer product distributors, small to medium sized Internet service providers, and system integrators. We have been less successful in selling directly to large telecommunication providers and other large providers of broadband access services.
 
Successfully penetrating the broadband modem market presents a number of challenges, including:
 

● | the current limited retail market for broadband modems, as most consumer broadband users get their modem from their service provider; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | the relatively small number of cable, telecommunications and Internet service providers that make up the majority of the market for broadband modems in the U.S., our largest market; 
● | the significant bargaining power and market dominance of these large service providers; 
● | the time-consuming, expensive and uncertain certification processes of the various cable, mobile broadband service providers; and 
● | the strong relationships with service providers enjoyed by some incumbent equipment providers, including ARRIS for cable modems and Huawei for DSL and mobile broadband modems. 

Intellectual Property Rights
 
We rely primarily on a combination of copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets and patents to protect our proprietary rights. We have trademarks and copyrights for our firmware (software on a chip), printed circuit board artwork, instructions, packaging, and literature, and intelligent software. We also have three active patents that expire in 2031. There cannot be any assurance that any patent application will be granted or that any patent obtained will provide protection or be of commercial benefit to us, or that the validity of a patent will not be challenged. Moreover, our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate and our competitors may independently develop comparable or superior technologies.
 
We license certain technologies used in our products, typically rights to bundled software, on a non-exclusive basis. In addition, we purchase chipsets that incorporate sophisticated technology. We have received, and may receive in the future, infringement claims from third parties relating to our products and technologies. We investigate the validity of these claims and, if we believe the claims have merit, we respond through licensing or other appropriate actions. Certain of these past claims have related to technology included in modem chipsets. We forward these claims to the appropriate vendor. If we or our component manufacturers were unable to license necessary technology on a cost-effective basis, we could be prohibited from marketing products containing that technology, incur substantial costs in redesigning products incorporating that technology, or incur substantial costs defending any legal action taken against it. Where possible we attempt to receive patent indemnification from chipset suppliers and other appropriate suppliers, but the extent of this coverage varies, and enforcement of this indemnification may be difficult and costly.
