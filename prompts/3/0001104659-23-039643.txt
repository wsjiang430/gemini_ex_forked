Item 1. Business.
Background
We were incorporated in Delaware as Foresight Acquisition Corp. (“Foresight”) on August 20, 2020. On December 3, 2021 (the “Closing Date”), we completed the Business Combinations (defined and discussed more fully below) with P3 Health Group Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“P3 Health Group Holdings”) and we changed our name to P3 Health Partners Inc. Following the Business Combinations, we are organized in an “Up-C” structure, in which P3 Health Partners Inc. is the sole manager of P3 Health Group, LLC and directly owns approximately 17.1% of P3 Health Group, LLC as of December 31, 2022. Substantially all of the Company’s assets are held and operations are conducted by P3 LLC and its subsidiaries, and the Company’s only assets are equity interests in P3 LLC.
Business Combinations
The Business Combinations were effected pursuant to (1) an agreement and plan of merger, dated as of May 25, 2021 (as amended, the “Merger Agreement”), by and among Foresight, P3 Health Group Holdings and Merger Sub, and (2) the transaction and combination agreement, dated as of May 25, 2021 (as amended, the “Transaction and Combination Agreement”), by and among Foresight, FAC-A Merger Sub Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Foresight, FAC-B Merger Sub Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Foresight (together with FAC-A Merger Sub Corp., the “Merger Corps”), CPF P3 Blocker-A, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, CPF P3 Blocker-B, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (together with CPF P3 Blocker-A, LLC, the “Blockers”), CPF P3 Splitter, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, Chicago Pacific Founders Fund-A, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, and Chicago Pacific Founders Fund-B, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (together with Chicago Pacific Founders Fund-A, L.P., the “Blocker Sellers”), pursuant to which, among other things, P3 Health Group Holdings merged with and into Merger Sub (the “P3 Merger”), with Merger Sub as the surviving company, which was renamed P3 LLC, and the Merger Corps merged with and into the Blockers, with the Blockers as the surviving entities and wholly owned subsidiaries of Foresight (collectively, the “Business Combinations”).
The Business Combinations resulted in the presentation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements on different bases for the year ended December 31, 2022, the period December 3, 2021 through December 31, 2021 (the “Successor Period”), and the period January 1, 2021 through December 2, 2021 (the “Predecessor Period”). The Company has not provided pro forma statements of operations and cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. Accordingly, references to certain financial results in 2022 and 2021 may not be comparable.
Overview
P3 is a patient-centered and physician-led population health management company. We strive to offer superior care to those patients that we serve. Founded and led by physicians, P3 is a team of doctors, clinicians and healthcare professionals with a shared passion for delivering value-based care (“VBC”). We believe our leadership team’s more than 20 years of experience in VBC and population health management, combined with our strong payor relationships, large community-based physician networks and custom technology platform uniquely position us to empower physicians, align incentives for healthcare providers and payors and improve the clinical outcomes for the communities we serve.
As fellow healthcare professionals, we understand the challenges physicians face when providing VBC. We have leveraged that expertise to build our “P3 Care Model.” The key attributes that differentiate P3 include: 1) patient centricity, 2) physician leadership, and 3) our delegated/integrated care model. Tactically, we typically leverage the community’s existing healthcare infrastructure to build a strong network of local physicians. We primarily contract with local physicians to enter the P3 network using an affiliate model, rather than building and staffing our own clinics or acquiring individual practices. By doing so, we preserve the existing patient-physician relationship, allow physicians to maintain their independence and have a built-in patient panel on Day 1. We then align physician incentives and provide our team tools and technology to support our physician partners in a VBC system and care for the patients we have the honor and privilege to serve together. These affiliated physicians provided care to approximately 90% of our primary care physicians as of December 31, 2022. We augment these affiliate partnerships with employed Primary Care Physicians (“PCPs,”), P3 operated clinics, and wellness centers. Furthermore, unlike our peers, we offer a broad delegated care model 




in which we take on the responsibility to reshape the local healthcare market to provide high quality care for patients throughout the care continuum.
We operate in the $829 billion Medicare market, which covers approximately 65 million eligible lives as of 2021. This segment is supported by numerous tailwinds. Approximately 60% of Americans suffer from a chronic disease with 40% suffering from two or more. Additionally, over 10,000 individuals age into Medicare each day, with 48% choosing Medicare Advantage plans. Our core focus is the Medicare Advantage (“MA”) market, specifically counties where there are over 10,000 MA eligible lives. MA spending is expected to grow an average of 7.2% annually and MA plan penetration of the Medicare beneficiary population is projected to increase from 48% of the overall Medicare market in 2022 to 61% of the overall Medicare market by 2031.
In MA, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) pays health plans a monthly sum per member to manage all health expenses of a participating member. Our platform focuses exclusively on Medicare Advantage and manages the needs of our members through subscription-like per-member-per-month (“PMPM”) arrangements with health plans or payors. From there, the economics of our care model are further impacted by our ability to drive total cost of care savings and bend the cost curve. Our model allows us to “do well” while also “doing good.”
The U.S. healthcare system is ripe for change and disruption, and we believe that the P3 Care Model is distinctly situated to address several pain points, including:

· | Unsustainable and rising healthcare costs. The United States spent $4.3 trillion, representing 18.3% of GDP, on healthcare in 2021. National health expenditures are projected to grow 5.1% per year from 2021 to 2030, according to CMS. While representing only 17% of the United States population, the 65 and older age group accounted for 21% of all healthcare spending in 2021, with an average spend of approximately $13,000 per person. This segment is growing faster than the rest of the population and is projected to reach 22% of the United States population by 2050. Healthcare expenditures are particularly concentrated in this age group in large part due to the high rate of chronic conditions. Rising healthcare costs disproportionally impact low- and middle-income seniors, who often embrace Medicare Advantage plans. This is our area of focus given we believe we can have the greatest clinical and financial impact on this population. Improved care management of seniors is critical to reducing the rapid growth in U.S. healthcare spending.

· | Inadequate access to primary care and PCP shortages. The current fee-for-service (“FFS”) reimbursement model leads to relatively lower pay for PCPs as well as fewer quality touchpoints with patients. We believe that factors like these directly contribute to fewer physicians considering, or staying, in the field of primary care.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Sub-optimal quality of care and sub-optimal clinical outcomes.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


· | PCP burnout and dissatisfaction. The traditional FFS model values quantity over quality, which has been shown to lead to physician burnout and jeopardizes the long-term sustainability of the independent primary care business model. According to a 2022 Physicians Foundation report, six in 10 physicians show signs of burnout, compared to four in 10 in 2018. In addition, as average reimbursement rates decline in an FFS model, physicians would need to continually increase the number of patients seen to sustain their practice.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Difficulty in maintaining PCP independence. Small physician practices deliver the majority of care in the U.S.—with 53.7% of physicians working in practices with 10 or fewer physicians, per a 2021 American Medical Association report. That report also found that 2020 was the first year in which a minority (49.1%) of PCPs worked in a practice that was wholly owned by physicians (e.g., private practice). This represented a decrease of approximately 5% from 2018 (54.0%). In our experience, physicians who have chosen to work at smaller practices throughout their careers tend to do so because they value their independence. Given the increasingly significant financial and administrative burdens, these physicians are generally unable to maintain independence while effectively transitioning to a VBC model. We believe that allowing them to maintain their independence increases their engagement with population health management practices, which is key to transforming the healthcare system.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Limited collaboration between PCPs and payors. Over the years, we have seen that payors recognize the importance of PCPs in directing and managing total cost of care. Payors have attempted to increase their proximity to primary care physicians through acquisitions and investments in care delivery services and technologies. However, a payor’s ability to
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


impact physician workflows continues to be structurally limited by the multi-payor nature of most physician practices. This makes it challenging for any single payor to achieve the level of integration we believe is needed to improve clinical engagement and effectively manage healthcare costs. We believe this creates significant opportunity for a platform to partner directly and create alignment between payors and physicians.
We overcome these hurdles with a differentiated model that we believe is an attractive option for patients, physicians and payors. P3 honors the existing social and moral contract between patients and their PCPs, partnering with local physicians using an affiliate model. We risk-stratify our patients to help our physician partners prioritize care for those who need it the most. We also provide care teams to serve as an extension of the physician’s practice. These teams provide wraparound services to our patients and collaborate with the patients’ caregivers to ensure patients have the tools to successfully navigate their healthcare journey across the care continuum. We have made significant investments in technology to customize patient care management plans. Taken as a whole, our P3 Care Model helps facilitate enhanced clinical outcomes for our key stakeholders, resulting in a 98% physician retention rate from 2018 through December 31, 2022, 96% patient satisfaction rate, a hospitalization rate 34% lower than the MA FFS benchmark, and an emergency department visit rate 50% lower than the MA FFS benchmark.
We are led by one of the most experienced management teams in population health. Our executive team has a track record of more than 20 years in the healthcare industry. These years of experience have fostered strong relationships in the managed care, physician and payor segments. This is paired with a deep understanding of physicians, patients, technology, payments and branding. Lastly, the core of our care model is based on their collective years of experience in medical cost management. We believe these critical facets position our team to successfully navigate and enable the shift to patient-centric, physician-led, VBC.
We Deliver VBC to the Fastest Growing Market in Healthcare
A need for a new payment structure and an aging U.S. population
Historically, healthcare in the U.S. has been focused on reacting to acute events, which resulted in the development of the FFS payment model. The FFS model unintentionally incentivizes the volume of patients and services performed rather than the quality of services and care—resulting in a deprioritization of preventative services and overall health of the patient. Beyond sub-optimal clinical outcomes, FFS results in significant healthcare spend. As 10,000 seniors age into Medicare each day and prevalence of chronic conditions increases, the need for lower healthcare spend leads the push towards VBC and additional offerings such as Medicare Advantage.
VBC and Medicare Advantage
Medicare Advantage serves as an alternative to traditional Medicare. Medicare Advantage is an integrated plan that includes both Part A and Part B coverage. Most Medicare Advantage plans also offer Part D, vision, hearing, dental and other benefits. Typically, the out-of-pocket costs are lower for Medicare Advantage plans than traditional Medicare, but patients are limited to seeing physicians within the plan’s network and some coverage of certain specialty services may require PCPs’ referrals and plan authorizations.
Medicare Advantage has been well received since it was introduced, with penetration among Medicare beneficiaries increasing from 13% in 2004 to 48% in 2022 and is projected to increase to 61% by 2031. This trend reflects the understanding that Medicare Advantage plans are financially and clinically valuable to Medicare eligible patients.
Our Market Opportunity
We believe there is significant white space opportunity. As of December 31, 2022, we have contracted with 2,800 primary care physicians, an increase of 33% from 2,100 at December 31, 2021. This represents less than 1% of the total number of PCPs in the U.S. of approximately 502,000. The industry is primed for a platform like ours, which allows physicians to remain independent while accessing financial resources and infrastructure to support a VBC model.
We believe our total addressable market is represented by the approximately 65 million Americans (approximately 17% of the total population) who were enrolled in either traditional Medicare or Medicare Advantage nationally in 2021, which represented $829 billion of annual spend. Within this, we believe our core addressable market to be the Medicare Advantage market, specifically 




within moderate-to-highly populated Medicare Advantage eligible dense counties, which we define as having greater than 10,000 Medicare eligible lives. By multiplying these approximately 28 million Medicare Advantage members by an average $1,000 per member per month spend, we estimate this represents a core addressable market size of approximately $300 billion.
The P3 Care Model
Patient-Centric
Patient wellness, not sickness. The VBC model rewards superior clinical outcomes and value delivered to the patient. With this in mind, we built our model to consider the whole patient rather than individual illnesses as they arise. We work with our physician partners to develop a holistic view of a patient’s health over time to understand the most effective methods to empower their patients to actively participate in and better manage their health (e.g., medication adherence, complete understanding of potential impediments to receiving care).
Robust care teams. We staff dedicated care managers and care navigators to help ensure end-to-end patient care across the full continuum. Care navigators are responsible for day-to-day patient care (e.g., scheduling appointments, assisting with check-ins, etc.). Care managers, on the other hand, tend to have more medical responsibilities (e.g., reviewing patient charts, coordinating care with PCPs, ensuring appropriate documentation, etc.) and serve as a communication point across care teams. Together, they complement our network of physicians and enable the highest quality of care for our patients—ensuring they are being seen at the right time by the appropriate physician and all corresponding documentation and communication has been streamlined.
Personalized care. Using our proprietary technology platform for integrated data reporting, physicians can stratify their patient panels based on risk. Identifying patients who are high risk (or rising risk) helps prioritize those patients who may need to be seen more often or require additional resources to improve their health. Additionally, our tailored tech suite provides our physician partners with detailed insights to understand what is driving individual patient clinical outcomes and medical costs. Leveraging this data, we then collaborate with physicians to build individualized, longitudinal care plans, catered to the needs of individual patients.
Physician-Led
Collaborative and supportive partnerships. As former physicians, we have a deep understanding of the way in which physicians are trained. In our experience, most physicians not only understand the value of a VBC model, but also want to provide their patients with the highest quality care. However, the way in which most physicians today were trained caters to an FFS model. To support the VBC model, we provide training to physicians on best clinical practices based on nationally recognized care guidelines. As a result, we have seen physicians deliver cost saving, quality healthcare. Unlike some of our peers, we typically enter markets with our affiliate physician model and contract directly with physician groups or independent physicians to enter the P3 network rather than primarily building and staffing our own clinics or acquiring physician practices. By doing so, we preserve the existing patient-physician relationship and create a built-in patient panel on Day 1. Affiliate physicians retain their independence, while gaining access to P3’s teams, tools and technologies that are key to success in a VBC model. P3’s care teams become an extension of each physician’s office and support our collective patients to navigate the health care system, collaborate with caregivers, and enable a successful health care journey. All P3 affiliated physicians must pass an annual credentialing process and maintain compliance with all regulatory standards.
Aligned incentives. Our model properly aligns physicians’ incentives with clinical outcomes, ensuring patients receive the optimal care they deserve. To do this, we offer several types of incentive-based payments to our affiliated physicians. First, as physicians join our network, we continue to pay them on an FFS basis per visit, or structure a contract to offer a monthly, fixed, capitated payment for each patient paneled to their practice. Additionally, we provide quality incentive payments to our physician partners as they close quality gaps in care, enable patient access and improve documentation. Finally, as improved clinical outcomes result in reduced medical costs, we share the savings between P3 and our physician partners. These contracts were built with the physician in mind, which is reflected in our results—a 98% physician retention rate from 2018 through December 31, 2022. Aligning physician incentives with performance on growth, quality, patient disease documentation, and medical expense creates better economics within their practices.




Broad Delegated Care Model
Reshaping local healthcare. Our more than 20 years of experience in the population health management space has allowed us to build the capabilities to better control and manage the delivery of services across the full care continuum. Our team has the ability to take on additional services from our payor partners, including networking, credentialing, utilization management and claims processing. In order to take on these functions, our teams must pass regular delegation audits by CMS as well as our payor partners. By assuming responsibility for the patient’s entire care experience, we can tailor care provision and coordination to their individual needs. We take on this added burden, as it allows us to reshape the local healthcare market and accelerate the shift from a FFS model to a VBC model.
Delegated services. Through delegation, we can build local networks of physicians and specialists to meet the needs of our patients. By creating a captive network, we ensure that our network of physicians and specialists are properly educated on best clinical practices based on national recognized care guidelines. Furthermore, delegation allows us to align incentives across the full continuum, not just the PCP office. With additional tools like utilization management, we ensure that quality care is delivered in the appropriate care setting. To help with care delivery effectiveness, we perform concurrent reviews to manage acute and post-acute hospitals for length of stay and appropriateness. Finally, by taking on responsibility for processing and paying claims, we are able to ensure the appropriate payment for the appropriate care. Ownership over claims creates value and helps to accelerate the reduction of unnecessary medical costs.
P3 Technology/Health Hub
The backbone of our P3 Care Model is our proprietary technology platform—P3 Technology/Health Hub—which enables physicians, care teams, patients and their family members to engage in the care journey. Our platform was purposefully built as a data and technology-enabled care ecosystem that drives preventive rather than reactive care.
P3 Technology/Health Hub integrates clinical and claims data from more than 250 disparate data points each month from payors, outpatient and inpatient facilities and other ancillary care settings. By using P3 Technology/Health Hub at the time of patient onboarding, we are able to assign patient risk levels using our proprietary risk stratification tool that leverages multiple parameters to prioritize patients who require additional resources. We continually collect data on patients from multiple sources so our care teams can proactively and dynamically deliver individualized care based on changes to a patient’s health profile. For example, within approximately 12 hours of a hospitalization—even out of state—our physician partners are notified and alerted to the patient’s clinical status. Our care managers also monitor patient care and provide physicians with insights to enable additional care across settings and locations. These factors create a positive feedback loop, whereby our technology accelerates clinical outcomes, improving strong performance, and further growing our business.
The P3 Technology/Health Hub is built on multiple products, including:
Provider Portal. This physician-facing product enables our physician partners to understand, care for and monitor their patients. Physicians can access a risk stratified patient list based on historical diagnoses, suspect diagnoses, ER visits, chronic comorbidities and socio-economic factors, among others. By using this, P3 is able to present physicians with care opportunities, Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (“HEDIS®”) gaps in care and drug substitution opportunities, which directly translate into stronger cost management. Analyzing the risk-stratified patient-level data helps physicians and office staff strategize patient scheduling to optimize their resources and work hours to meet the healthcare needs of the patients that need the most care. Provider Portal also generates additional possible conditions that the physicians can screen for during patient visits. This exercise gives physicians a longitudinal view of patients’ health and any potential medical conditions they may have developed since their last annual wellness visit. This represents an important opportunity for physicians to address the conditions which otherwise may have been missed during initial health reviews of the patient.
Provider Portal is also used by our internal certified coders to review and reconcile claims data with electronic medical record and charts data. This provides P3 an opportunity to capture dropped or missed codes documented in the patient’s medical record that were not properly converted during the initial submission of claims by our physician partner offices. This practice also ensures that the diagnosis data that is submitted to health plans is validated with appropriate supporting documentation for seamless acceptance by CMS for year-over-year risk calculation for our patients.




P3 Care Connect. P3 Care Connect is a comprehensive management tool used by P3 care management, utilization management and concurrent review teams. P3 Care Connect enables P3 care managers to provide concierge and individualized care for specific, high-risk and special needs populations. This capability allows our platform and its constituents to deliver highly impactful clinical programs aimed to reduce cost and improve clinical outcomes while optimizing efficiency. Care orchestration through a combination of program management, cohort building, care plan and assessment builders help our care managers build more intelligent care plans. P3 Care Connect allows our care and medical management teams to process prior authorizations, track P3 patient referrals within our network throughout the care continuum and manage a concurrent review for inpatient services through an automated platform that improves efficiency and auditability of existing business workflows. This tool also enables a streamlined communication between P3 and primary care physicians, specialists and other ancillary care physicians who are involved in the care of our patients.
Analytic Management Tools. Analytic Management Tools is a business intelligence platform that converts data into visualizations and real-time metrics to empower decision making at every level across the organization. It helps our administrative teams deliver a data driven approach for a better, more engaged physician experience and act as a support system to their practices.
This tool combines data management with data analysis to evaluate and transform complex data sets into meaningful, actionable information used to support effective strategic, tactical and operational insights. It also provides comprehensive information that drives performance to improve clinical outcomes and quality of care and creates physician profiles and cost analysis to improve healthcare management. With an embedded Risk Adjustment engine, it allows the organization to determine the burden of illness for our patients while providing stratification clinical data to physicians.
Our Value Proposition
We believe that our P3 Care Model is effective, differentiated and represents a ‘win’ for all key stakeholders.
Patients
Our P3 Care Model of partnering with local physicians allows patients to maintain their relationship with their existing physicians. We believe this is key to delivering stronger clinical outcomes and support for our patients, as evidenced by our patient satisfaction rate of 96%. Our model deploys care teams for each individual patient to assist in the continuity and coordination of care. This support allows for seamless interactions across multiple physicians and various care settings. Connectivity minimizes unnecessary progression of disease or downstream care, which is evident in our results.
Physicians
We believe our model supports and empowers physicians, care teams, and practices in their transition from a traditional FFS model to a VBC model. Importantly, we enable physicians to implement VBC protocols while maintaining their independence. Additionally, our P3 Care Model leverages an innovative technology suite that provides physicians with the tools to drive better clinical outcomes. Enabling physicians to own much of this process also allows for improved personal satisfaction on their journey to VBC, resulting in our 98% physician retention rate from 2018 through December 31, 2022 on our network of approximately 2,800 physicians at December 31, 2022.
Payors
Our model is differentiated in our ability to also partner directly with payors. We have a proven ability to manage medical costs and improve clinical outcomes of our lives under management on behalf of our payor partners. This is evidenced by the receipt of inbound partnership requests from payors to improve growth, quality and profitability in their markets. We believe there is a significant and growing demand from payors as they capitate risk and transition to VBC.



Competitive Differentiation
Broad delegated care model
Under our at-risk model, we are financially responsible for the medical costs associated with our attributed patients across the care continuum. Our broad delegated care model enables us to better manage and control critical aspects of care beyond the PCP office. By taking on additional, delegated services from our payor partners, including networking, credentialing, utilization management and claims processing, we can better control care delivery, align incentives across the care continuum, and ensure that quality care is delivered and paid for in the appropriate care setting.
Rapidly scalable, capital efficient model
We have demonstrated the rapid scalability of our model with organic revenue growth of 99% from 2018 to 2022. This is in part due to the capital efficiency of our affiliate model and in part due to our ability to grow through multiple channels. Because we primarily partner with physicians and physician groups or payors, we do not need to build brick and mortar clinics or acquire practices to enter a new market; therefore, we require less upfront capital to enter a market and can take the time to establish a market presence and build patient recognition and familiarity as well as other relationships before investing significant funds. While many of our competitors employ the buy / build or joint-venture partnership model, our approach has a minimal “ramp-up” period and thus a faster expected near-term path to profitability. Furthermore, our ability to effectively leverage existing physician bases across the U.S. accelerates our speed to scale.
Highly experienced management team
Our management team has extensive experience in population health management, the MA space, and leading the transition to VBC throughout the United States.
Our executive team has worked hard to build cultural alignment around our vision to transform healthcare. This vision and values permeate throughout our organization and are embraced by our employees and partners. Furthermore, our executive team has been thoughtful and strategic about fostering a culture of mentorship to pass on their extensive industry knowledge to future P3 leaders.
Virtuous growth cycle
Our model incentivizes all constituencies across the care spectrum to work together by aligning incentives directly based on growth, care quality, patient disease documentation, and medical expense improvements. Our model creates better physician economics within their practices. When all constituencies benefit, we all capture the meaningful value generated by the P3 Care Model by improving clinical outcomes and decreasing the cost of care. Our ability to drive savings allows us to continuously innovate, support our physician partners and engage patients on the P3 platform.
Our Growth Strategy
We intend to utilize our competitive strengths and capitalize on favorable industry trends to increase our footprint within our current markets and across new states and counties to ultimately increase the number of physicians and patients we serve.
Additional membership through current relationships. Recent data suggests that the number of Medicare-eligible patients and Medicare Advantage penetration rates will continue to increase in the upcoming years. We believe that this trend will translate into increased coverage by our current payor partners in our existing markets. As these new patients enroll in Medicare Advantage through our payors, they become attributed to our platform with little incremental cost to us.
Furthermore, we believe our physician partners will also increase their patient coverage as the number of available Medicare Advantage lives increases. We expect to be favorably positioned to benefit from this source of growth, bolstered by the sticky physician-patient relationship and our platform’s ability to assist our physician partners in more effectively managing healthcare quality, patient experience and cost.




Expansion in current markets. Based on our ability to provide a compelling value proposition for physicians looking to shift to value-based care while remaining independent, we believe there is significant opportunity to grow lives in our current markets in Arizona, California, Florida, Nevada, and Oregon. Additionally, we have the opportunity to expand our existing membership base through our payor partners’ presence in our current markets.
Expansion into adjacent markets. Once we establish a presence in a geography, we are then able to leverage our regional infrastructure and our relationships with payors as we expand into adjacent geographies. We are more easily able to deploy this ‘land and expand’ strategy once we have established the P3 brand in a particular market.
Expansion into new markets. We are constantly evaluating our pipeline of opportunities to continue growing our membership. Based on our analysis and experience to date, we have identified a list of target markets that we believe are ideal candidates for the P3 Care Model, whether across physicians or payors. We can facilitate this growth through new payor contracts, new network partnerships via joint ventures or expanding into a new market as part of an existing payor contract. We target entering three to five new markets each year based on this proven strategy.
Execute on accretive acquisitions. While our growth to date has been organic, we believe there are additional robust opportunities to acquire additional lives across both physicians and payors.
Competition
The healthcare industry is highly competitive and fragmented. Our primary competition remains the status quo, FFS environment that much of the healthcare system operates in today. We currently face competition in every aspect of our business, including in offering a favorable reimbursement structure for existing physician partners and attracting payors and physician partners who are not contracted with us, from a range of large- and medium-sized local and national companies that provide care under a variety of models that could attract patients, providers and payors. Our primary competitors in the population health management space include Oak Street Health, Cano Health and agilon health, in addition to numerous local provider networks, hospitals and health systems. Moreover, large, well-financed payors have in some cases developed their own managed care services tools and may provide these services to their physicians and patients at discounted prices or may seek to expand their relationships with additional competing physicians or physician networks. Other organizations may also seek to apply specialized services or programs, including providing data analytics or disease-based programs, designed to enable physicians or payors to operate successfully under VBC arrangements. Our competitors typically vary by geography, and we may also encounter competition in the future from other new entrants. Our growth strategy and our business could be adversely affected if we are not able to continue to access existing geographies, successfully expand into new geographies or maintain or establish new relationships with payors and physician partners.
See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—We operate in a competitive industry, and if we are not able to compete effectively, our business, financial condition and results of operations will be harmed.”
The principal competitive factors in our business include the nature and caliber of relationships with physicians; patient healthcare quality, outcomes and cost; the strength of relationships with payors; the quality of the physician experience; local geography leadership position; and the strength of the underlying economic model. We believe our platform, partnership and network model enables us to compete favorably.
Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of trademark laws in the U.S. as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our trade secrets, including proprietary technology, databases and our brand.
We have a federal trademark registration application for “P3 Health Partners” in the U.S. We also have filed other applications to protect names and marks that are meaningful to our business in the U.S. across various states and local jurisdictions, including for the use of the local brand created within each of our geographies, and will pursue additional trademark registrations to the extent we believe it would be beneficial and cost-effective.
We are the controller of a variety of registered domain names that include “p3hp” and similar variations.




We have developed proprietary technology and processes that support our operational programs and clinical insights, including our P3 Technology/Health Hub, which is a proprietary system that aids in the aggregation and analysis of third-party data we collect. Our internally developed technology is continuously refined to support the needs of our platform and partners. Although we do not currently hold a patent for P3 Technology/Health Hub, we have filed provisional patent applications relating to the P3 Technology/Health Hub, and we continue to regularly assess the most appropriate methods of protecting our intellectual property and may decide to pursue available protections in the future.
We maintain our intellectual property and confidential business information in a number of ways. For instance, we have a policy of requiring all employees and consultants to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of an employment or consulting relationship with us. Our employee agreements also require relevant employees to assign to us all rights to any inventions made or conceived during their employment with us in accordance with applicable law. In addition, we have a policy of requiring individuals and entities with which we discuss potential business relationships to sign non-disclosure agreements. Lastly, our contracts with physicians include confidentiality and non-disclosure provisions.
We may be unable to obtain, maintain and enforce our intellectual property rights, and assertions by third parties that we violate their intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 600 employees. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or party to a collective bargaining agreement.
Our human capital resources objectives include sourcing, recruiting, developing, retaining, rewarding, recognizing and integrating our existing and prospective employees. We recognize that attracting, motivating and retaining diverse, skilled and purpose-driven talent at all levels is vital to continuing our success. By improving employee retention and engagement, we also improve our ability to protect the long-term interests of our stakeholders and stockholders. We invest in our employees through high-quality benefits, various health and wellness initiatives, and social events that bring our employees together to support the communities in which we live and work. We offer competitive compensation packages, ensuring fairness in internal compensation practices.
People join P3 because of our mission: to ensure providers and their patients get the healthcare they deserve. Together with our employees and physician partners, we have defined our core values as:

● | People: Our attitude is respecting and valuing everyone. Our community is strong and safe. We are “family” and we take care of each other with the same intensity as we take care of our patients.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Passion: Our heart is our patients. Our soul is our clinicians. Our strength is our people and culture.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Purpose: Our core is fixing health care. Our mindset is disciplined purposeful growth.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our human capital efforts are supported by our dedicated human resources team. This team supports the business in identifying and recruiting top talent, supporting the onboarding of new hires through an employee orientation program, providing a structured approach to performance management that allows leaders and employees to collaborate to set organizational goals, chart plans, and assign targets such that it becomes a systematic process to achieving goals and objectives and having productive conversations about performance outcomes and career development. Our talent management framework enables us to meet the human capital and business needs within the organization. From identification of critical roles to succession planning and retention management practices, the team provides resources and tools, and leads the processes and experiences that enable us to make sure that we have everything in place to successfully execute on our talent management strategy. 
Our efforts to promote a positive employee experience and build a diverse and inclusive culture are further supported and enhanced by local and national in-person and virtual events, including town halls, in-office celebrations and employee activity committees. We have also developed a taskforce that seeks to drive focused and targeted diversity and inclusion efforts, including employee focus groups and participation up and down the organization to ensure all voices are heard.




Government Regulation
Regulatory Licensing and Certification
Many states, including Florida, require regulatory approval, including licensure and certification, before establishing certain types of clinics offering certain professional and ancillary services, including the services P3 offers. The operations of the P3 owned and managed clinics are subject to extensive federal, state and local regulation relating to, among other things, the adequacy of medical care, equipment, personnel, operating policies and procedures, and proof of financial ability to operate. Our ability to operate profitably will depend in part on the ability of P3 owned and managed clinics and its providers to obtain and maintain all necessary licenses and other approvals, and maintain updates to their enrollment in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, including the addition of new clinic locations, providers and other enrollment information. In addition, certain ancillary services such as the provision of diagnostic laboratory testing require additional state and federal licensure and regulatory oversight, including oversight by CMS, under Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (“CLIA”) which requires all clinical laboratories to meet certain quality assurance, quality control and personnel standards, and comparable state laboratory licensing authorities. Standards for testing under CLIA are based on the complexity of the tests performed by the laboratory, with tests classified as “high complexity,” “moderate complexity,” or “waived.” P3 owned and managed clinics hold CLIA Certificates of Waiver and perform certain CLIA-waived tests, which subjects such clinics to certain CLIA requirements. Sanctions for failure to comply with applicable state and federal licensing, certification and other regulatory requirements include suspension, revocation or limitation of the applicable authorization, significant fines and penalties and/or an inability to receive reimbursement from government healthcare programs and other third-party payors.
With respect to P3’s providers participating in its network, P3 providers must meet minimum requirements to apply for participation or continued participation with P3 through a credentialing process, including, without limitation, having a valid, current medical license and Drug Enforcement Administration registration, if required for the provider’s scope of practice, the absence of any debarment, suspension, exclusion or other restriction from receiving payments from any government or other third-party payor program, and clearing National Practitioner Data Bank of any reports and/or disciplinary actions. P3’s credentialing program is designed to meet CMS and the National Committee for Quality Assurance (“NCQA”) credentialing requirements as well as applicable federal and state laws. P3’s credentialing committee is comprised of a group of multispecialty providers with responsibilities for thoroughly reviewing each P3 provider’s qualifications and credentials. Providers are generally recredentialed every three years or more often if necessary, which is consistent with industry guidelines. In addition, network providers are required under their participating provider agreements with P3 to have established an ongoing quality assurance program. Moreover, P3’s contracts may allow P3 to withhold compensation from time to time based upon the providers meeting certain quality metrics, including HEDIS quality measures and care coordination metrics.
State Corporate Practice of Medicine and Fee-Splitting Laws
Our arrangements with our affiliated professional entities and other physician partners are subject to various state laws, commonly referred to as corporate practice of medicine and fee-splitting laws, which are intended to prevent unlicensed persons from interfering with or influencing the physician’s professional judgment, and prohibiting the sharing of professional service fees with non-professional or business interests. These laws vary from state to state, including those where the Company does business, and are subject to broad interpretation and enforcement by state regulators. For example, the corporate practice of medicine prohibition in Nevada has only been established through attorney general opinions and there is no statutory or regulatory fee-splitting prohibition in the state. Arizona’s corporate practice of medicine was established under older case law, and more recent legislation suggests that the prohibition may not be strictly enforced in the state. Oregon prohibits the corporate practice of medicine but has an exception for professional corporations with majority physician ownership where a non-licensed person or entity may hold minority ownership interest in such professional corporation. Florida does not prohibit the corporate practice of medicine but has professional fee-splitting laws, which prohibit the sharing of professional fees based on referrals for professional services.
California’s corporate practice of medicine doctrine has been developed through statutes, case law and state attorney general opinions. The general prohibition on the corporate practice of medicine arises out of the California Business and Professions Code, which has been enforced through case law and attorney general opinions. In California, physicians and certain licensed professionals cannot be employed by non-professional corporations, except under limited exceptions which do not apply to the Company. Additionally, all clinical decisions and certain business or management decisions that result in control over a physician’s practice of medicine or a licensed professional’s clinical decisions must be made by a physician or licensed professional and not by an unlicensed person or entity. California also prohibits professional fee splitting arrangements, but management fees based on a percentage of gross 




revenue or similar arrangement that is commensurate with fair market value of services provided by the management company are generally permissible.
We believe we have structured our management services agreements with the our affiliated professional entities to comply with the corporate practice of medicine and fee-splitting laws of Nevada, and we expect to enter into similar agreements with affiliated professional entities in California and other states where we may operate in the future, where all clinical decisions and other business and management decisions that result in control over a physician’s practice of medicine or a licensed professional’s clinical decisions remain exclusively with the affiliated professional entities, their physician shareholders and the physicians and licensed professionals employed and contracted by such entities.
A determination of non-compliance against us and/or our affiliated professional entities or other physician partners based on the reinterpretation of existing laws or adoption of new laws could lead to adverse judicial or administrative action, civil or criminal penalties, receipt of cease-and-desist orders from state regulators, loss of provider licenses, and/or restructuring of these arrangements.
Healthcare Fraud and Abuse Laws
We are subject to a number of federal and state healthcare regulatory laws that restrict certain business practices in the healthcare industry. These laws include, but are not limited to, federal and state anti-kickback, false claims, self-referral and other healthcare fraud and abuse laws.
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute (“AKS”) prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made under federal and state healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
Several courts have interpreted the AKS’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the AKS has been violated.
The AKS includes statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors that protect certain arrangements. By way of example, the AKS safe harbor for value-based arrangements and the safe harbor for arrangements between managed care organizations and downstream contractors both require, among other things, that the arrangement does not induce a person or entity to reduce or limit medically necessary items or services furnished to any patient. Failure to meet the requirements of an applicable AKS safe harbor, however, does not render an arrangement illegal. Rather, the government may evaluate such arrangements on a case-by-case basis, taking into account all facts and circumstances, including the parties’ intent and the arrangement’s potential for abuse, and may be subject to greater scrutiny by enforcement agencies.
The Stark Law prohibits a physician who has a financial relationship, or who has an immediate family member who has a financial relationship, with entities providing designated health services (“DHS”) from referring Medicare and Medicaid patients to such entities for the furnishing of DHS, unless an exception applies. The Stark Law also prohibits the entity from billing for any such prohibited referral. Unlike the AKS, the Stark Law is violated if the financial arrangement does not meet an applicable exception, regardless of any intent by the parties to induce or reward referrals or the reasons for the financial relationship and the referral.
The federal False Claims Act (“FCA”) prohibits a person from knowingly presenting, or caused to be presented, a false or fraudulent request for payment from the federal government, or from making a false statement or using a false record to have a claim approved. A claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the United States government. Moreover, the government may assert that a claim including items and services resulting from a violation of the AKS or the Stark Law constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil FCA. Penalties for a violation of the FCA include fines for each false claim, plus up to three times the amount of damages caused by each false claim. Private individuals also have the ability to bring actions under these false claims laws in the name of the government alleging false and fraudulent claims presented to or paid by the government (or other violations of the statutes) and to share in any amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement. Such suits, known as qui tam actions, are pervasive in the healthcare industry.




Further, the Civil Monetary Penalties Statute authorizes the imposition of civil monetary penalties, assessments and exclusion against an individual or entity based on a variety of prohibited conduct, including, but not limited to offering remuneration to a federal health care program beneficiary that the individual or entity knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary to order or receive health care items or services from a particular provider. Moreover, in certain cases, providers who routinely waive copayments and deductibles for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries can also be held liable under the AKS and civil FCA. One of the statutory exceptions to the prohibition is non-routine, unadvertised waivers of copayments or deductible amounts based on individualized determinations of financial need or exhaustion of reasonable collection efforts. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) Office of Inspector General emphasizes, however, that this exception should only be used occasionally to address special financial needs of a particular patient. Although this prohibition applies only to federal healthcare program beneficiaries, the routine waivers of copayments and deductibles offered to patients covered by commercial payors may implicate applicable state laws related to, among other things, unlawful schemes to defraud, excessive fees for services, tortious interference with patient contracts and statutory or common law fraud.
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 (collectively, “HIPAA”), also established federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the AKS, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
Several states in which we operate have also adopted similar fraud and abuse laws as described above. The scope of these laws and the interpretations of them vary from state to state and are enforced by state courts and regulatory authorities, each with broad discretion. Some state fraud and abuse laws apply to items or services reimbursed by any payor, including patients and commercial insurers, not just those reimbursed by a federally funded healthcare program.
Violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that apply may result in significant penalties, including, without limitation, administrative civil and criminal penalties, damages, disgorgement, fines, additional reporting requirements and compliance oversight obligations, in the event that a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement is required to resolve allegations of noncompliance with these laws, the curtailment or restructuring of operations, exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs and/or individual imprisonment.
Healthcare Reform
In the United States, there have been, and we expect there will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system, many of which are intended to contain or reduce healthcare costs. By way of example, in the United States, the Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively, the “ACA”), substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers. The ACA required, among other things, CMS to establish a Medicare shared savings program that promotes accountability and coordination of care through the creation of Accountable Care Organizations (“ACOs”). The Medicare shared savings program allows for providers, physicians and other designated health care professionals and suppliers to form ACOs and voluntarily work together to invest in infrastructure and redesign delivery processes to give coordinated high quality care to their Medicare patients, avoid unnecessary duplication of services and prevent medical errors. ACOs that achieve quality performance standards established by CMS are eligible to share in a portion of the Medicare program’s cost savings. ACO program methodologies and participation requirements are updated by CMS for each performance year and participants are expected to comply with such program requirements and required to report on performance after the close of the year. ACOs that fail to comply with such program requirements can face penalties or even termination of their participation in the Medicare shared savings program.
Since its enactment, there have been judicial, executive and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the most recent judicial challenge to the ACA without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the ACA. Prior to the Supreme Court’s decision, President Biden issued an executive order initiating a special enrollment period from February 15, 2021 through August 15, 2021 for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace. The executive order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare.




In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. These changes included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers, which went into effect on April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will remain in effect through 2032, with the exception of a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022, unless additional Congressional action is taken. In addition, on January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.
Additionally, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation continues to test an array of value-based alternative payment models, including the Global and Professional Direct Contracting Model to allow Direct Contracting Entities to negotiate directly with the government to manage traditional Medicare beneficiaries and share in the savings and risks generated from managing such beneficiaries. Although we currently do not participate in these pilot payment models, we may choose to do so in the future. Additional changes that may affect our business include the expansion of new programs such as Medicare payment for performance initiatives for physicians under the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015, which first affected physician payment in 2019. At this time, it is unclear how the introduction of the Medicare quality payment program will impact overall physician reimbursement. In addition, there likely will continue to be regulatory proposals directed at containing or lowering the cost of healthcare, as government healthcare programs and other third-party payors transition from FFS to value-based reimbursement models, which can include risk-sharing, bundled payment and other innovative approaches. It is possible that the federal or state governments will implement additional reductions, increases, or changes in reimbursement in the future under government programs that may adversely affect us or increase the cost of providing our services. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue or attain growth, any of which could have a material impact on our business.
Further, healthcare providers and industry participants are also subject to a growing number of requirements intended to promote the interoperability and exchange of patient health information. For example, on April 5, 2021, healthcare providers and certain other entities became subject to information blocking restrictions pursuant to the Cures Act that prohibit practices that are likely to interfere with the access, exchange or use of electronic health information, except as required by law or specified by the HHS as a reasonable and necessary activity. Violations may result in penalties or other disincentives. It is unclear at this time what the costs of compliance with the new rules will be and what additional risks there may be to our business.
Data Privacy and Security Laws
We are subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations that govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal information, including health information privacy and security laws, data breach notification laws, and consumer protection laws and regulations (e.g., Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act). For example, HIPAA imposes obligations on “covered entities,” including certain healthcare providers, such as the affiliated professional entities, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses, and their respective “business associates” that create, receive, maintain or transmit individually identifiable health information for or on behalf of a covered entity, such as P3, as well as their covered subcontractors with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Entities that are found to be in violation of HIPAA, whether as the result of a breach of unsecured protected health information (“PHI”), a complaint about privacy practices, or an audit by HHS, may be subject to significant civil, criminal, and administrative fines and penalties and/or additional reporting and oversight obligations if required to enter into a resolution agreement and corrective action plan with HHS to settle allegations of HIPAA non-compliance.
In addition, certain state laws, such as the Confidentiality of Medical Information Act, the California Consumer Privacy Act, and the California Privacy Rights Act, govern the privacy and security of personal information, including health-related information in certain circumstances, some of which are more stringent than HIPAA and many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.
Failure to comply with these laws, where applicable, can result in the imposition of significant civil and/or criminal penalties and private litigation. Privacy and security laws, regulations, and other obligations are constantly evolving, may conflict with each other to complicate compliance efforts, and can result in investigations, proceedings, or actions that lead to significant civil and/or criminal penalties and restrictions on data processing.



Federal and State Insurance and Managed Care Laws
Regulation of downstream risk-sharing arrangements, including, but not limited to, at-risk and other value-based arrangements, varies significantly from state to state. Some states require downstream entities and risk-bearing entities to obtain an insurance license, a certificate of authority, or an equivalent authorization, in order to participate in downstream risk-sharing arrangements with payors. In some states, statutes, regulations and/or formal guidance explicitly address whether and in what manner the state regulates the transfer of risk by a payor to a downstream entity. However, the majority of states do not explicitly address the issue, and in such states, regulators may nonetheless interpret statutes and regulations to regulate such activity. If downstream risk-sharing arrangements are not regulated directly in a particular state, the state regulatory agency may nonetheless require oversight by the licensed payor as the party to such a downstream risk-sharing arrangement. Such oversight is accomplished via contract and may include the imposition of reserve requirements, as well as reporting obligations. Further, state regulatory stances regarding downstream risk-sharing arrangements can change rapidly and codified provisions may not keep pace with evolving risk-sharing mechanisms and other new value-based reimbursement models. Certain of the states where we currently operate or may choose to operate in the future regulate the operations and financial condition of risk bearing organizations like us and our affiliated providers. By way of example, P3 recently acquired Medcore HP, a licensed health plan under the Knox Keene Act, which subjects the entity to certain capital requirements, licensing or certification, governance controls, utilization review and grievance procedures, among others. While these regulations have not had a material impact on our business to date, as we continue to expand, for example, through acquisitions or otherwise, these rules may require additional resources and capitalization and add complexity to our business.
Seasonality
Our business experiences some variability depending upon the time of the year. While new patients are attributed to our platform throughout the year, we experience the largest portion of our at-risk membership growth during the first quarter. Operations in our new markets generally begin on January 1, at which time our payor partners attribute patients to our physician partners as our agreements with those payors in those geographies become effective. This coincides with the beginning of the Medicare program year, when plan enrollment selections made during the prior Annual Enrollment Period, which runs each year from October 15 to December 7, take effect.
In addition, in January of each year, CMS revises the risk adjustment factor for each patient based upon health conditions documented in the prior year, leading to an overall increase in per-member revenue. As the year progresses, our per-member revenue declines as new members join us typically with less complete or accurate documentation (and therefore lower risk-adjustment scores) and patient morbidity disproportionately impacts our higher-risk (and therefore greater revenue) members.
Medical costs will vary seasonally depending on a number of factors, including the weather and the number of calendar working days in a given period. Certain illnesses, such as the influenza virus, are far more prevalent during colder months of the year, which will result in an increase in medical expenses during these time periods. We therefore expect to see higher levels of per member medical costs in the first and fourth quarters.
