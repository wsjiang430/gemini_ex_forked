Business Overview
 
We are a clinical-stage biotechnology company that discovers and develops Anticalin® protein-based drugs to target validated disease pathways in unique and transformative ways. Our clinical pipeline includes elarekibep, formerly referred to as PRS-060/AZD1402, an inhaled IL-4Rα antagonist Anticalin protein to treat uncontrolled asthma, PRS-220, an inhaled CTGF antagonist to treat idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, or IPF, and other pulmonary fibrosis indications, and an immuno-oncology, or IO, bispecific PRS-344/S095012 targeting PD-L1 and 4-1BB. Proprietary to us, Anticalin proteins are a novel class of therapeutics validated in the clinic and through partnerships with leading pharmaceutical companies.
 
Anticalin proteins are a class of low molecular-weight therapeutic proteins derived from lipocalins, which are naturally occurring proteins typically found in human blood plasma and other bodily fluids. Anticalin proteins function similarly to monoclonal antibodies by binding tightly and specifically to a diverse range of targets. An antibody is a large protein used by the immune system to recognize a target molecule, called an antigen. We believe Anticalin proteins possess numerous advantages over antibodies in certain applications. For example, Anticalin proteins are relatively small in size and comprised of a single polypeptide chain whereas antibodies are much bigger and comprised of four polypeptide chains. The potentially greater stability and smaller size of Anticalin proteins as compared to antibodies potentially enable unique routes of Anticalin protein drug administration such as inhaled delivery. Higher-molecular-weight entities, such as antibodies, are often too large to be delivered effectively through these methods. Our Anticalin technology is modular, which allows us to design multimeric Anticalin based bi- and multi- specific proteins to bind with specificity to two or more targets at the same time. This multispecificity offers advantages in biological settings where binding to multiple targets can enhance the ability of a drug to achieve its desired effects, such as facilitating the killing of cancer cells. Moreover, unlike antibodies, the pharmacokinetic, or PK, profile of Anticalin proteins can be adjusted to potentially enable program-specific optimal drug exposure. Such differentiating characteristics suggest that Anticalin proteins have the potential, in certain cases, to become best-in-class drugs.
 
We have intellectual property rights directed to various aspects of our Anticalin technology platform, allowing for further development and advancement of both our platform and drug candidates. We believe that our ownership or exclusive license of intellectual property related to the Anticalin platform provides us with a strong intellectual property position, particularly in cases where we are seeking to address targets and diseases in a novel way and for which there is existing antibody intellectual property. We also believe that the drug-like properties of the Anticalin drug class have been demonstrated in various clinical trials with different Anticalin based drug candidates, including elarekibep and others.
 
Our core Anticalin technology and platform were developed in Germany, and we have collaborations with multiple major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as follows:
 

• | We entered into a license and collaboration agreement, or the Servier Collaboration Agreement, with Les Laboratoires Servier and Institut de Recherches Internationales Servier, or Servier, in January 2017 in IO.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | In May 2017, we entered into a license and collaboration agreement with AstraZeneca AB, or AstraZeneca, to treat respiratory diseases, or the AstraZeneca License and Collaboration Agreement as well as a Non-exclusive Anticalin Platform License Agreement. On March 29, 2021, we and AstraZeneca entered into the first amendment to the Non-exclusive Anticalin Platform License Agreement dated May 2, 2017 and the second amendment to the AstraZeneca License and Collaboration Agreement dated May 2, 2017. Under the amendments, the parties agreed to restructure certain commercial economics for the elarekibep program by adjusting various milestones and royalty provisions, while fundamentally maintaining the overall value split between AstraZeneca and the Company. In connection with the amendments, we achieved a $13.0 million milestone in connection with the initiation of the phase 2a study for this program and we and AstraZeneca entered into a subscription agreement pursuant to which we issued to AstraZeneca 3,584,230 shares of our common stock for a total purchase price of $10.0 million in a private placement transaction.

• | In February 2018, we entered into a license and collaboration agreement, or the Seagen Collaboration Agreement, with Seagen Inc. (formerly Seattle Genetics, Inc.), or Seagen, in IO. On March 25, 2021 we announced an amendment to the Seagen Collaboration Agreement whereby our option to co-develop and co-commercialize one of the three programs in the collaboration was converted to a co-promotion option for one program in the United States, with Seagen solely responsible for the development and overall commercialization of that program. Under the co-promotion option, we will be entitled to increased royalties from that program in the event that we choose to exercise the option. In addition, we entered into a clinical trial and supply agreement with Seagen to evaluate the safety and efficacy of combining cinrebafusp alfa with Seagen’s TUKYSA® (tucatinib), a small-molecule tyrosine kinase HER2 inhibitor, for the treatment of gastric cancer patients expressing lower HER2 levels (IHC2+/ISH- & IHC1+) as part of the initiated phase 2 study, which was subsequently terminated after the discontinuation of cinrebafusp alfa. Finally, as part of this transaction, we entered into a subscription agreement pursuant to which we issued to Seagen 3,706,174 shares of our common stock for a total purchase price of $13.0 million in a private placement transaction.

• | On April 24, 2021, the Company and BP Asset XII, Inc., or Boston Pharmaceuticals, a subsidiary of Boston Pharma Holdings, LLC, entered into an exclusive product license agreement, or the BP Agreement, to develop PRS-342, a 4-1BB/GPC3 preclinical immuno-oncology antibody-Anticalin fusion, or Mabcalin™, bispecific protein.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | On May 19, 2021, the Company and Genentech, Inc., or Genentech, entered into a research collaboration and license agreement, or the Genentech Agreement, to discover, develop and commercialize locally delivered respiratory and ophthalmology therapies that leverage the Company’s proprietary Anticalin technology.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In connection with our efforts to develop multispecific Anticalin based proteins designed to engage immunomodulatory targets, we have gained non-exclusive access to antibody building blocks that can be utilized to develop multispecific Mabcalin proteins.
 
Our current development plans continue to advance our promising clinical and preclinical programs including those in the therapeutic area of respiratory diseases. Our lead respiratory Anticalin based drug candidate, elarekibep, antagonizes IL-4Rα, thereby inhibiting IL-4 and IL-13, two cytokines, which are small proteins mediating signaling between cells within the human body, known to be key mediators in the inflammatory cascade that drive the pathogenesis of asthma and other inflammatory diseases. We believe that the small size and biophysical stability of elarekibep facilitates direct delivery to the lungs through the use of an inhaler, which may enable relatively high pulmonary concentrations of the drug candidate to be achieved. Information regarding the clinical trials for elarekibep is provided further below. The phase 2a asthma study for elarekibep is ongoing and topline data from part 2 of this study are expected to be reported by the middle of 2024.

Upon receipt of the topline data and notice from AstraZeneca, including a product development plan and budget, the Company will have 30 days to opt into co-development of the program with AstraZeneca at one of two levels, neither of which includes an option exercise fee. If we do not choose to participate in co-development, we would still be entitled to potential sales milestones and royalties. At the first opt-in level, Pieris would be responsible for 25% of the cost-share with a predetermined cost cap for an increased amount of potential sales milestones and royalties compared to not opting-in. At the second opt-in level, we would be responsible for 50% of the cost-share without a cost cap which would result in a gross margin share. The Company also has a separate option to co-commercialize elarekibep with AstraZeneca in the United States independent of the co-development opt-in decision.
 
Four discovery-stage respiratory programs were originally included in the AstraZeneca alliance beyond elarekibep, the targets and disease areas of which are undisclosed. In January 2022, Pieris and AstraZeneca jointly discontinued one of the four discovery-stage programs in the collaboration beyond elarekibep, for which an exploratory target was not able to be validated. In August 2022, we entered into an amendment of the AstraZeneca License and Collaboration Agreement and extended the research term for two of the then remaining three discovery-stage programs, and subsequently jointly discontinued the third discovery-stage program. Pieris retains co-development and U.S. co-commercialization options for the two discovery-stage programs.
 
The Company also continues to advance other proprietary discovery-stage respiratory programs. Our lead fully proprietary respiratory asset, PRS-220, an orally inhaled Anticalin protein targeting connective tissue growth factor, or CTGF, is being developed as a local treatment for IPF and other fibrotic lung diseases, entered a phase 1 healthy volunteer study in 2022. CTGF, a matricellular protein, is a driver of fibrotic tissue remodeling and the protein has been found over-expressed in lung tissue from patients suffering from IPF. Clinical data from a Phase 2 study with the monoclonal antibody pamrevlumab conducted by Fibrogen indicated that inhibition of CTGF reduced the decline in lung function in patients, thus demonstrating clinical proof of concept for this target. In 2021, we received a €14.2 million grant from the Bavarian Ministry of Economic Affairs, Regional Development and Energy supporting research and development of the program.
 
PRS-220 has progressed in all activities required to support a regulatory submission for clinical evaluation. We presented initial preclinical data for PRS-220 at the European Respiratory Society International Congress 2021, demonstrating a more potent and durable target engagement profile compared to a clinical-stage, systemically delivered anti-CTGF antibody benchmark. Additionally, the targeting of CTGF locally in the lung showed increased attenuation of fibrotic lung remodeling in vivo compared to the systemically delivered antibody. This outcome correlates with superior lung tissue exposure of PRS-220 compared to that of the systemically administered antibody in head-to-head studies, where intratracheally administered PRS-220 efficiently penetrates the fibrotic, interstitial lung tissue of mice. In the fourth quarter of 2022, we dosed the first subject in the phase 1 study of PRS-220 in healthy volunteers in Australia. The study is a randomized, two-part, blinded, placebo-controlled study, designed to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and immunogenicity of single and multiple ascending doses of PRS-220 when administered by oral inhalation to healthy subjects. We expect to report topline results from the study in the second half of this year.
 
PRS-400 is a fully proprietary Anticalin protein targeting Jagged-1 and is being developed as a local treatment for muco-obstructive lung diseases. Jagged-1 is one of five cell surface ligands interacting with Notch receptors. It has been demonstrated that Jagged-1/Notch signaling drives secretory cell trans-differentiation in the airways and that blocking Jagged-1/Notch signaling reduces secretory cell number, mucin expression and mucus plugging in vivo. In September 2022, we presented preclinical data at the European Respiratory Society International Congress 2022 indicating that candidate molecules inhibit Jagged-1-induced Notch 2 signaling in a dose-dependent manner and also demonstrate that PRS-400 reduces mucin expression ex vivo. Additionally, PRS-400 was found in vivo to reduce mucin gene expression and goblet cells metaplasia in mice with IL-13-induced airway inflammation. These findings suggest that PRS-400 represents a promising opportunity to address muco-obstructive respiratory diseases locally with an attractive therapeutic index.
 
We have also entered into a multi-program research collaboration and license agreement with Genentech, a member of the Roche Group, to discover, develop and commercialize locally delivered respiratory and ophthalmology therapies. Joint discovery activities in each of the two committed programs are ongoing.
 
The Company also has several IO assets in partnership with other major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. 
 
Formerly the lead IO Anticalin-based drug candidate in our pipeline, cinrebafusp alfa is a bispecific Mabcalin compound comprising a HER2-targeting antibody genetically linked to 4-1BB-targeting Anticalin proteins. Cinrebafusp alfa is designed to drive tumor localized T cell activation through tumor-targeted drug clustering mediated by HER2 expressed on tumor cells. This program was the first 4-1BB bispecific T cell co-stimulatory agonist to enter clinical development. In August 2022, we announced the decision to cease further enrollment in the two-arm, multicenter, open-label phase 2 study of cinrebafusp alfa as part of a strategic pipeline prioritization to focus our resources. Cinrebafusp alfa has demonstrated clinical benefit in phase 1 studies, including single agent activity in a monotherapy setting, and in the phase 2 study in HER2-expressing gastric cancer, giving us confidence in our broader 4-1BB franchise.
 
In January 2017, we initiated a strategic collaboration with Servier to discover and develop multiple Anticalin-based bispecific therapeutics in IO. PRS-344/S095012, a bispecific Mabcalin compound comprising a PD-L1-targeting antibody genetically linked to 4-1BB-targeting Anticalin proteins, is a clinical stage program being developed within this alliance. Preclinical data for the PRS-344/S095012 program were presented at the SITC 2018 Annual Meeting. We also exercised our option to opt into co-development and U.S. commercialization of PRS-344/S095012 during the first quarter of 2019. We hold exclusive commercialization rights for PRS-344/S095012 in the United States and will receive royalties on ex-U.S. sales from Servier for this program.
 
We achieved two preclinical milestones under the PRS-344/S095012 program, one in December 2018 and another one in February 2019, in addition to a clinical development milestone as the first patient was dosed in a global phase 1/2 in patients with solid tumors in November 2021. Pieris and Servier presented preclinical data and the phase 1/2 study design at the American Association for Cancer Research, or AACR, medical meeting in April 2022. The study is being conducted in multiple countries, including the United States. The first-in-human phase 1/2 multicenter open-label dose escalation study is designed to determine the safety and preliminary activity of PRS-344/S095012 in patients with advanced and/or metastatic solid tumors and we plan to present the escalation data at a medical meeting in 2023.
 
Formerly a program in the Servier alliance, PRS-352/S095025 is a bispecific Mabcalin compound comprising an PD-L1-targeting antibody genetically fused to Anticalin proteins specific for OX40. In December 2022, Servier decided to discontinue development of PRS-352/S095025 due to strategic portfolio reasons. The program and associated rights reverted to us and we will strategically evaluate next steps.
 
In February 2018, we initiated a strategic collaboration with Seagen to discover and develop up to three Anticalin-based tumor-targeted bispecific therapeutics in IO. We have already handed one of the programs in the Seagen collaboration, SGN-BB228 (also referenced as PRS-346), a CD228/4-1BB bispecific antibody-Anticalin compound, over to Seagen, who is responsible for further advancement and funding of the asset. In January 2023, the first patient was dosed in a Seagen-sponsored phase 1 study of SGN-BB228, which triggered a $5.0 million payment from Seagen to us. Additionally, Seagen presented preclinical data for this program at the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer 37th Annual Meeting in November 2022. We believe the achievement of a key clinical development milestone for this program validates our approach in IO bispecifics, complementing the encouraging clinical data seen with cinrebafusp alfa. During the third quarter of 2021, we initiated the second program, and during the fourth quarter of 2022, we initiated the third program within the collaboration with Seagen. We retain a co-promotion option for one of the programs in the United States.
 
PRS-342/BOS-342 is a GPC3/4-1BB bispecific Mabcalin compound that we have exclusively licensed to Boston Pharmaceuticals. Boston Pharmaceuticals continues to advance PRS-342/BOS-342 towards the clinic, with phase 1 expected to begin in the coming months.

Strategy
 
Our corporate vision is to become a fully-integrated biotechnology company by discovering and developing Anticalin-based therapeutics to target validated disease pathways in unique and transformative ways with the ultimate goal of commercializing our therapeutic products. We intend to engage with partners for many of our programs in a combination of geographic and program-based arrangements to maximize our business opportunities. We also intend to retain certain development and commercial rights on selected products as our experience in late-stage drug development grows. Key elements of our strategy include:

• | Collaborating with AstraZeneca on the execution of the elarekibep phase 2 studies. We previously reported promising data from our phase 1 SAD and MAD studies of elarekibep. We achieved a $13.0 million milestone in connection with the initiation of patient enrollment in the phase 2a study of elarekibep in the first quarter of 2021. The part 2 efficacy portion (3 mg dose) of this phase 2a study is currently ongoing following a successful sponsor evaluation of safety data from part 1a (1 and 3 mg dose compared to placebo) of the study. Successful development of elarekibep would both further validate our platform and could provide a convenient and effective option for uncontrolled asthma patients as a potential first-in-class inhaled biologic.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Advancing PRS-220 through phase 1 study. We continue developing PRS-220 as a CTGF-targeting, inhaled treatment of IPF, an indication of high unmet medical need. In addition, we are exploring PRS-220 in other types of pulmonary fibrotic diseases. We completed the drug candidate nomination stage in 2021, followed by chemistry, manufacturing, and control, or CMC, activities such as the development of a robust process for large-scale manufacturing and the development of a nebulized formulation. In the fourth quarter of 2022, we dosed the first subject in the phase 1 study of PRS-220 in healthy volunteers in Australia. We expect to report the outcome of the study in 2023.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Continuing to build our platform by entering into new partnerships and license and collaborative arrangements and advancing our currently partnered programs. We have entered into partnership and collaborative arrangements with pharmaceutical companies in a diverse range of therapeutic areas and geographies. We have active strategic partnerships with the global pharmaceutical companies Servier, AstraZeneca, Seagen, Boston Pharmaceuticals, and Genentech. Together with our partners, we intend to advance multiple drug candidates through preclinical studies and to select further drug candidates for clinical development in the future. We will also continue to seek to engage with new pharmaceutical partners that can contribute funding, experience and marketing ability for the successful development and commercialization of our current and future drug candidates.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Pursuing additional opportunities for our Anticalin technology. The flexibility of our Anticalin platform presents a unique opportunity to adapt and develop Anticalin proteins with therapeutic potential across a broad range of indications. We intend to continue to identify, vet and pursue opportunities to develop novel Anticalin-based therapeutics for respiratory diseases and additional diseases.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Pursuing other platform development activities. We continue to make investments in our Anticalin platform, including in display and other technologies used to discover and optimize Anticalin proteins against targets of interest to increase speed, throughput and caliber of the selection process. In addition, we continue to make investments in our platform for the characterization and manufacturing of Anticalin proteins to develop drug candidates with excellent drug-like properties that can be efficiently produced.

Anticalin Platform Technology
 
Our platform technology focuses on low molecular-weight Anticalin proteins that can bind tightly and specifically to a diverse range of targets. Anticalin proteins are derived from human proteins called lipocalins, which are naturally occurring low-molecular weight human proteins of approximately 17 to 21 kDa molecular mass typically found in blood plasma and other bodily fluids. The lipocalin class of proteins defines a group of specific extracellular binding proteins that, collectively, exhibit extremely high structural homology, yet have a low amino acid sequence identity (less than 20%), making them attractive “templates” for amino acid diversification. Lipocalins naturally bind to, store and transport a wide spectrum of molecules. The defining attributes of the human lipocalin class and, by extension, Anticalin proteins, engineered from the lipocalin class of proteins, are a rigidly conserved beta-barrel backbone with four flexible loops, which, together, form a cup-like binding pocket. The graphic below shows the tear lipocalin (left) and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, or NGAL (right).


We currently develop our Anticalin proteins from two scaffolds, namely the tear lipocalin, found primarily in human tear fluid as well as the lung epithelium, and NGAL, a protein involved in the innate immune system, by selection from diverse libraries with mutations in the genetic code of the ligand binding regions and regions of the proteins that are amenable for amino acid exchanges. These mutations have the potential to lead to highly specific, high-affinity binding proteins for both small and large molecular targets. Mutations are introduced at pre-defined positions, creating exponentially diverse pools of Anticalin proteins, the most potent and well-behaved of which are selected and optimized in a customized manner through in vitro selection using techniques such as phage and yeast display, which are successful techniques in antibody-based drug discovery. The ability to generate highly-diverse and high-quality Anticalin libraries and to select for the best binders among the large pool of Anticalin proteins by display technologies gives us the opportunity to select highly specific and high affinity Anticalin proteins for a wide variety of targets. The flexibility inherent in the Anticalin proteins’ cup-like structure allows us to choose both small-molecule targets that are capable of binding inside the ‘cup’ as well as larger protein targets that are predominantly bound by the flexible loop region outside of the ‘cup’. Our phase 1 studies for elarekibep, our phase 1 studies of cinrebafusp alfa, our prior phase 1 and 2 studies of PRS-080, our prior phase 1 study of PRS-050, as well as the phase 1 study of a PCSK9-specific Anticalin protein, indicate that these proteins appear to have low immunogenic potential and thereby have the potential to exhibit a favorable safety profile.
 
The below graphic illustrates Anticalin proteins binding to a small molecule (left), a small protein target (hepcidin, center) and a large protein target (CTLA4, right):


To obtain a specific Anticalin protein, we take advantage of the breadth of our proprietary Anticalin libraries, generated through our protein engineering expertise. We created, and will continue to create, proprietary Anticalin libraries by rationally diversifying certain lipocalin regions, thereby generating Anticalin libraries suitable for identifying binders to different types of targets. By utilizing bacterial and mammalian expression platforms from the earliest stages of drug discovery through current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, manufacturing, we created seamless platforms that facilitate the selection of high-quality and cost-effective drug candidates. Anticalin-based drug candidates have been proven to be suitable for expression in standard mammalian expression systems. Thus, Anticalin protein manufacturing is not limited to bacterial systems, and the expression system can be selected on a program-by-program basis. See “—Manufacturing” below.

Anticalin proteins share many of the favorable qualities of antibodies, including:
 

• | High specificity to their targets. Like antibodies, Anticalin proteins can bind their targets without binding other molecules, even molecules with very similar chemical structures or amino acid sequences, allowing for more effective treatments through, for example, minimizing off-target effects.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Tight binding and effective biological activity at their targets. Like antibodies, Anticalin proteins are able to bind their targets at subnanomolar to picomolar affinities. Anticalin proteins can potentially achieve desirable biological effects by inhibiting an undesired or inducing a desired cell activity by binding to cell-surface receptors or their ligands.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Scalability for large-scale production. Like antibodies, Anticalin proteins lend themselves to large-scale production, yet can also be produced in a range of expression systems ranging from prokaryotic (bacterial) to eukaryotic (for example, animal and fungal) cells. Anticalin proteins can take advantage of several well-understood and widely-practiced methods of protein production both in small amounts for preclinical testing and at larger scale for clinical trials and commercial production.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
While often compared to antibodies, we believe Anticalin proteins offer several advantages over antibodies, including:
 

• | Small size and biophysical stability. Anticalin proteins are small in size and consist of one single polypeptide chain. Therefore, we believe Anticalin proteins are generally more biophysically stable than antibodies, which are composed of four polypeptide chains. This will potentially enable unique routes of administration, such as pulmonary delivery. Higher-molecular-weight entities such as antibodies are often too large to be formulated and delivered effectively through these methods. We believe Anticalin proteins may also be less expensive to manufacture than antibodies due to their lower molecular weight and less bulky structure.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Optimization of half-life. Anticalin proteins can be engineered to have a half-life that is optimal for the indication area and a desired dosing schedule. Antibodies typically have half-lives of two weeks or longer, whereas Anticalin proteins can be engineered to have half-lives from hours to weeks, depending on the half-life extension technology employed, if any. This optionality allows us to exert greater control over the amount of circulating Anticalin protein in the blood and the amount of time such Anticalin proteins circulate in the blood, depending on the underlying biology we are trying to address.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Flexible formatting facilitates selection of potent T cell engagers. The molecular architecture of Anticalin proteins as a single polypeptide chain that folds into a stable eight-stranded β-barrel with exposed N- and C-termini, both not part of the binding site, makes them ideal building blocks to generate bispecific and even multispecific fusion proteins offering novel therapeutic modalities. Multispecific Anticalin-based fusion proteins can be used to pursue innovative therapeutic strategies in IO, particularly by addressing the “immunological synapse” that forms at the interface upon contact between an immune cell and a cancer cell. This can drive an efficient activation of tumor-specific T cells in the vicinity of the tumor, thereby avoiding some of the toxicities observed with peripheral T cell activation in healthy tissues. Generally, the formatting flexibility of Anticalin-based biologics offers the ability of modulating valency and geometry of the multispecific compound according to biological needs. For example, Anticalin proteins can be genetically fused to either the N- or C- terminus of the antibody heavy or light chain, thereby resulting in different geometries of the fusion protein with the antibody as well as Anticalin binding sites covering a range of distances with regard to the T cell target on the one hand and the tumor antigen on the other.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Platform for higher-order multispecificity and avoidance of cross-linking. Our Anticalin technology allows for monovalent or multivalent target engagement, including multispecificity within a single protein. We believe that a monovalent “backbone” is an advantage in situations where pure antagonism of certain cellular receptors is desired. The dual-binding nature of antibodies, which have two “arms,” can be a disadvantage when the antibodies bind to and cross-link cell-surface receptors. Such cross-linking often leads to undesirable activation of the cells bearing those receptors. Single-action, or monovalent, Anticalin proteins have only a single binding site and by that do not induce cross-linking. Further, when it is called for by the biology we are addressing, we can create multispecific Anticalin-based proteins that can simultaneously bind (i) two or more different targets or (ii) different epitopes on the same target by genetically linking Anticalin proteins with distinct specificities or by genetic fusion of an Anticalin protein with an antibody. We believe this multispecificity offers advantages in biological settings where binding to multiple targets can enhance the ability of a drug to achieve its desired effects, such as killing cancer cells. Novel Anticalin proteins genetically fused to each other or to existing antibodies for simultaneous target engagement are expressed as a fusion protein without generally compromising on manufacturability.

Implementation of the Anticalin Platform Technology: Our Drug Candidate Pipeline
 
All of our drug candidates are in the early stage of development, and we anticipate that it will likely be several years before any of our drug candidates could be commercialized. The following table summarizes the status of our current drug candidates and programs:
Elarekibep Targeting IL-4Rα in Asthma
 
Elarekibep is an Anticalin drug candidate targeting IL-4Rα, a cell surface receptor expressed on immune cells in the lung. IL-4Rα is specific for the cytokine IL-4 and the closely related cytokine IL-13, both key drivers of the immune system. Elarekibep is derived from human tear lipocalin, has a 20 pM affinity for human IL-4Rα and has a favorable stability profile. Following the results reported in the “Clinical data” section below, and presented at the American Thoracic Society International Conference in May 2019 and European Respiratory Society International Congress in October 2019, AstraZeneca started a global phase 2a study of elarekibep. We believe that elarekibep represents a first-in-class inhaled biologic targeting IL-4Rα for the treatment of asthma. Elarekibep is being developed in partnership with AstraZeneca, as further described below.
 
Asthma market
 
Asthma is a very common chronic airway disorder affecting more than 300 million people worldwide according to the Global Initiative for Asthma, including approximately 25 million Americans according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control. Of these 25 million, approximately 4 million are children. Asthma is responsible for 13 million physician visits per year including approximately 2 million emergency visits in the United States, according to the American Lung Association. In the United States between 2008 and 2013, asthma was responsible for approximately $3 billion in losses due to missed work and school days, approximately $29 billion due to asthma-related deaths, and approximately $50 billion in medical costs. This resulted in a total cost of asthma in the United States of approximately $82 billion in 2013 according to the American Thoracic Society.
 
In 2021, of the approximately 22 million asthma patients over 12 years of age in the United States, about 55%, or 12 million, had moderate-to-severe asthma; of the approximately 20 million asthma patients over 12 years of age in EU5, about 54%, or 10.8 million, had moderate-to-severe asthma. Of all GINA4 and GINA5 patients, over half have uncontrolled asthma, which amounts to approximately 4.6 million patients in the United States and approximately 4.1 million in EU5 according to an analysis prepared by Artisan Healthcare Consulting. There are several biologics approved for moderate-to-severe uncontrolled asthma in the United States and Europe. Omalizumab is an anti-IgE monoclonal antibody marketed by Roche/Genentech and Novartis for moderate-to-severe persistent allergic asthma and chronic idiopathic urticaria; in 2022, Roche/Genentech and Novartis reported total global sales for omalizumab in the amount of $3,734 million. Mepolizumab is an anti-IL5 monoclonal antibody marketed by GlaxoSmithKline, or GSK, for severe eosinophilic asthma; in 2022, GSK reported global sales for mepolizumab in the amount of $1,714 million. Benralizumab is an anti-IL5 receptor monoclonal antibody marketed by AstraZeneca for severe eosinophilic asthma; in 2022 AstraZeneca reported global sales for benralizumab in the amount of $1,396 million. Dupilumab is an anti-IL4Rα monoclonal antibody marketed by Sanofi/Regeneron for atopic dermatitis and moderate-to-severe uncontrolled asthma; in 2022, Sanofi/Regeneron reported total global sales of dupilumab in the amount of $8,793 million. Tezepelumab is an anti-TSLP monoclonal antibody marketed by Amgen and AstraZeneca for severe asthma; tezepelumab was approved by the FDA in December 2021. In 2022, Amgen and AstraZeneca reporting total global sales of tezepelumab in the amount of $174 million.

Challenges in using conventional therapy
 
The current standard of care for persistent, moderate-to-severe allergic asthma is high-dose inhaled corticosteroids or ICS often in combination with inhaled long-acting beta-adrenergic agonists, or LABA. In uncontrolled moderate-to-severe allergic asthma, omalizumab is sometimes given to patients in addition to ICS/LABA combinations. Omalizumab was approved for this condition in the United States in 2003. Outside of the United States, omalizumab is approved for severe asthma. Omalizumab works by binding to the immune mediator immunoglobulin E, or IgE, and inhibiting IgE-mediated activation of mast cells and basophils, types of white blood cells. It has also been shown to impact some diseases, such as asthma, which are driven by eosinophils, another important class of immune cells. However, patient response to omalizumab has been shown to be inconsistent, as reported in a publication by McNicholl and Heaney in 2008 in the journal Core Evidence, which explained that in only some studies did omalizumab improve lung function. Furthermore, general asthma symptoms are also typically unaffected by omalizumab. Finally, in 2007, the FDA issued a black box warning for omalizumab due to reported cases of anaphylaxis, a potentially life-threatening allergic reaction suffered by some patients who had taken the drug.
 
Beyond omalizumab, there are five approved biologics, or antibodies, for the treatment of asthma. Three target the IL-5 pathway, one targets IL-4Rα, and one targets thymic stromal lymphopoietin, or TSLP. GSK's mepolizumab, which targets IL-5, was approved for severe eosinophilic asthma in adults and children older than 12 in 2015. Teva’s reslizumab, also targeting IL-5, was approved in 2016 and AstraZeneca’s benralizumab, which targets IL-5 receptor alpha, or IL-5Rα, was approved in November 2017. Amgen's and AstraZeneca's tezepelumab, which targets TSLP, was approved in December 2021 as an add-on maintenance treatment for patients ages 12 years and older with severe asthma. Regeneron's and Sanofi's dupilumab is an antibody that targets IL-4Rα that is delivered subcutaneously and was approved for the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis in March 2017. In October 2018, the companies announced that the FDA had approved dupilumab as “add-on maintenance therapy in patients with moderate-to-severe asthma aged 12 years and older with an eosinophilic phenotype or with oral corticosteroid-dependent asthma.” In the phase 3 Liberty Asthma Quest study, dupilumab (300 mg every 2 weeks) in the pre-specified high eosinophilic group (eosinophil blood count of ≥ 300 cells/microliter) demonstrated a reduction in annualized rate of severe exacerbations by 67.4% and an improvement in forced expiratory volume in one second, or FEV1, by 0.24L. The Liberty Asthma Venture trial evaluated dupilumab in oral glucocorticoid-dependent severe asthma patients. In the overall population, the percentage of patients that decreased oral corticosteroid use by 50% or more was 80% in the dupilumab group versus 50% for placebo (or a 60% relative reduction), while decreasing the rate of severe exacerbations by 59% and improving FEV1 by 0.22L versus placebo. In the high eosinophilic group, dupilumab decreased the rate of severe exacerbations by 71% and improved FEV1 by 0.32L versus placebo (Rabe et al., 2018).
 
Advantages to inhalation as a route of administration for elarekibep
 
We believe that local delivery via inhalation may lead to a better tolerability profile than systemically administered antibodies. Since dosing by inhalation is a common route of administration in asthma patients, it could represent a more convenient dosage regimen for patients than dosing of antibodies by injection. Elarekibep was safe and well-tolerated in a SAD phase 1 study, and was evaluated in a MAD phase 1 study with interim data suggesting that elarekibep was safe and well-tolerated at all doses, led to a statistically significant reduction in FeNO and showed dose-dependent systemic target engagement in patients with mild asthma and elevated levels of FeNO.
 
Preclinical data
 
In in vitro assays, elarekibep specifically bound to immobilized targets such as human IL-4Rα in a concentration-dependent manner. We tested the binding of elarekibep to various targets in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, or ELISA, a standard in vitro assay platform. In these tests, elarekibep bound to IL-4Rα with subnanomolar affinity and it did not bind to three other human cell-surface interleukin receptors (IL-6R, IL-18Rα, IL-23Rα). Furthermore, the activity of IL-4 and IL-13 was inhibited by elarekibep in a dose-dependent manner. The charts below show the inhibition of IL-4- (left) or IL-13- (right) induced proliferation in human TF-1 cells in vitro by elarekibep.

In in vivo assays in mice genetically altered to express human IL-4Rα, human IL-4 and IL-13, low doses of lung delivered elarekibep inhibited the induction of eotaxin protein, a marker of airway inflammation, in lung tissue following pulmonary delivery. We observed this inhibition at both the RNA and protein levels compared both to buffer and to tear lipocalin (control).
 
The chart below shows the duration of elarekibep-mediated inhibition of eotaxin gene expression in lung tissue by a single pulmonary dose in mice:



When we administered IL-13 into the lung of humanized mice (that express human IL-4, IL-13 and IL-4Rα), inflammation was induced as determined by eotaxin expression, which was not inhibited when phosphate buffered saline, or PBS, or human wild type lipocalin was administered into the lung. In contrast to the PBS or wild-type lipocalin administration, increases in eotaxin expression were prevented when elarekibep was administered into the lung before IL-13. As demonstrated in the above chart, the model showed the inhibitory potential lasts for up to 24 hours after elarekibep administration. We have also demonstrated that elarekibep reduces the inflammation associated with antigen challenge in a mouse asthma model. The chart below shows that pre-treatment with elarekibep reduces the lung levels of the key inflammatory cells’ eosinophils and lymphocytes, a profile that supports the hypothesis that lung delivery of an IL-4Rα antagonist to asthmatics may be viable approach to the treatment of asthma.

Clinical data
 
Elarekibep was tested in a nebulized formulation in 54 healthy volunteers at nominal dose levels ranging from 0.25 mg to 400 mg in a phase 1 SAD study; the drug candidate was safe and well-tolerated in the volunteers in that study. Data from that study were presented at the American Thoracic Society International Conference in May 2019 showing that elarekibep was well-tolerated when given as a single inhaled or intravenous doses to healthy volunteers and there was systemic target engagement (as measured by pSTAT6 inhibition) at doses greater than 2 mg. Elarekibep was also tested in a phase 1 multiple-ascending dose, or MAD, study in 30 patients that were randomized to receive delivered doses via nebulizer ranging from 2 mg to 60 mg (5 mg to 150 mg nominal dose) twice daily for nine consecutive days and one final dose on the 10th day, and 12 patients were randomized to receive placebo at the same intervals. We presented interim data from the elarekibep phase 1 MAD study at the 2019 European Respiratory Society International Congress in October 2019 and reported that elarekibep was safe and well-tolerated at all doses, led to a statistically-significant reduction in FeNO, a validated biomarker for eosinophilic airway inflammation and showed dose-dependent systemic target engagement in patients with mild asthma and elevated levels of FeNO (≥ 35ppb). Statistically significant and pronounced inhibition of FeNO relative to placebo was observed at all doses. When comparing the 20 mg elarekibep powered cohort (n=12) to placebo, the primary statistical analysis using the emax model demonstrated a 36% relative reduction in FeNO (p-value <0.0001). Systemic target engagement was dose-dependent and closely aligned with systemic exposure of the drug, consistent with results of the phase 1 SAD study. Minimal systemic exposure and target engagement were observed at the 2 mg dose, suggesting that local target engagement by the drug may be sufficient to reduce airway inflammation, as evidenced by FeNO reduction at that 2 mg dose level.
 
We sponsored the phase 1 SAD/MAD studies for elarekibep, after which AstraZeneca took responsibility for further clinical development of elarekibep. The phase 2a asthma study is ongoing in multiple sites globally. This phase 2a study is a two-part, multi-center, placebo-controlled clinical study of elarekibep to evaluate elarekibep at three dose levels, 1, 3 and 10 mg, using a dry powder formulation administered twice daily. In part 1a of the study, 31 asthma patients, controlled on standard of care (medium dose inhaled corticosteroids, or ICS, with long-acting beta agonists, or LABA, were randomized to receive elarekibep at 1 mg or 3 mg, or to receive a placebo twice daily over four weeks to establish the safety profile and pharmacokinetics of the dry powder formulation of elarekibep. The safety review following completion of part 1a included an evaluation, compared to placebo, of the incidence of adverse events, changes in laboratory markers (immuno-biomarkers, clinical chemistry, and hematology), and forced expiratory volume in one second, or FEV1. Following the safety review, AstraZeneca began enrollment of part 2a (1 mg and 3 mg dose efficacy) of the study to evaluate efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of elarekibep administered twice daily to asthma patients, uncontrolled on medium dose ICS with LABA, that have a blood eosinophil count of ≥ 150 cells/μL and FeNO ≥ 25 ppb in the 1 mg and 3 mg arms and a placebo arm. Following a four-week run-in period, patients will be dosed and monitored over four weeks. FEV1 improvement at four weeks compared to placebo will be the primary endpoint in this portion of the study. Also following the safety review, AstraZeneca initiated part 1b of the study to evaluate the safety of the 10 mg dose in asthma patients controlled on standard of care who will receive elarekibep twice daily over four weeks, and has since completed enrollment in part 1b. In the second quarter of 2022, AstraZeneca conducted a reforecast of the study, which has taken into account the global challenges of recruiting for respiratory clinical trials caused by the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and broadened enrollment criteria in part 2 (previously referenced as part 2a) of the study to facilitate recruitment of the study. AstraZeneca also now plans to focus part 2 on the 3 mg cohort for the efficacy readout and plans to stop enrollment for the 1 mg cohort. AstraZeneca no longer plans to enroll the 10 mg cohort for the efficacy readout (previously referenced as part 2b). Topline results from part 2 of this study are expected to be reported by the middle of 2024.
 
PRS-220 Targeting Connective Tissue Growth Factor (CTGF) in IPF
 
Our lead fully proprietary respiratory asset, PRS-220, an orally inhaled Anticalin protein targeting CTGF, is being developed as a local treatment for IPF and has passed the drug candidate nomination stage in 2021. The project is currently in phase 1 clinical development in Australia. The first-in-human study is a randomized, two-part, blinded, placebo-controlled study, designed to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and immunogenicity of single and multiple ascending doses of PRS-220 when administered by oral inhalation to healthy subjects. We received a €14.2 million grant from the Bavarian Ministry of Economic Affairs, Regional Development and Energy supporting research and development of the program.
 
What is IPF?
 
IPF is a devastating and fatal lung disease of unknown cause with median survival of only three to five years after diagnosis. In patients with IPF, fibrotic remodeling and excess deposition of extracellular matrix, or ECM, causes the destruction of lung architecture leading to loss of lung elasticity and lung function, impairment of gas exchange and finally organ failure. To date, there is no cure for IPF. Treatment options for IPF are very limited, with two FDA-approved drugs, Ofev (nintedanib) and Esbriet (pirfenidone), only capable of slowing down disease progression but not arresting the insidious progression of the disease. Moreover, due to gastrointestinal and other drug-related side effects, nintedanib and pirfenidone are not well-tolerated, leading many patients to discontinue treatment. Thus, a high unmet medical need exists for alternative treatment options for IPF that effectively attenuate the lung function decline or arrest the insidious decline of lung function while offering an improved safety profile with fewer side effects and greater tolerability.

Biology of CTGF 
 
CTGF, or CCN2, is a member of the CCN family of proteins, a family of matricellular proteins associated with the ECM involved in intercellular signaling. In adulthood, CTGF is expressed at a low level but can be strongly induced by certain stimuli such as cytokines, growth factors or mechanical stress.
 
CTGF contributes to the control of various biological processes, such as proliferation, differentiation, adhesion and angiogenesis. CTGF is known to interact with a variety of proteins including receptors, cytokines and ECM proteins. Among the different cytokines and growth factors that interact with CTGF, transforming growth factor β, or TGF-β, is known to play a crucial role in the development of fibrotic diseases. In order to mediate functions such as cell adhesion, motility and tissue remodeling, CTGF interacts with integrins and components of the ECM such as fibronectin, aggrecan and heparan sulfate proteoglycans. Specifically, in the context of cell adhesion, CTGF is thought to play a role as a molecular bridge between the ECM to integral cell surface proteins.
 
Role and validation of CTGF as a target for IPF
 
The pathogenesis of fibrosis is considered to be a dysregulated wound healing process in response to repetitive microinjuries leading to excessive deposition of ECM and impairment of tissue function. CTGF has been associated with fibrotic remodeling in various organs and is highly expressed in fibrotic tissues of different origin, including renal fibrosis, scleroderma, cardiac fibrosis and IPF.
 
CTGF is a key mediator of wound healing and fibrosis through its interaction with several factors regulating cell proliferation, differentiation, motility, adhesion, and ECM deposition. TGF-β and CTGF are widely regarded as universal mediators of fibrogenesis. TGF-β has been identified as a transcriptional regulator of CTGF, and as supported by preclinical studies, both cytokines are thought to promote fibrotic tissue remodeling in a collaborative manner.
 
In lung tissue from IPF patients, CTGF levels are found to be elevated when compared to donor tissue with epithelial cells and myofibroblasts being the main cell types expressing the protein in diseased lung tissues (Figure 1).
 


Figure 1 | Immunohistochemistry of CTGF in human (A) donor and (B) IPF lung tissues.
---------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Inhibition of CTGF by monoclonal antibodies in preclinical models of lung fibrosis provided evidence supporting its function as a driver of fibrotic lung remodeling in vivo. Lung specific overexpression of CTGF in mice demonstrated that CTGF is sufficient to drive fibrotic remodeling of the lung in vivo. Moreover, local targeting of CTGF in the lung using an siRNA-based approach attenuated bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis in mice. Based on this evidence, we believe that local targeting of CTGF in the lung is essential to achieve anti-fibrotic activity.

Current approaches to clinical CTGF targeting 
 
In a phase 2 clinical trial (PRAISE), the anti-CTGF monoclonal antibody pamrevlumab/FG-3019 attenuated disease progression in patients suffering from IPF, demonstrating proof of concept for targeting of CTGF for the treatment of IPF. In the PRAISE study, a relative reduction of the decline in percentage of predicted forced vital capacity ("FVC") by 60.3% was observed at week 48, as compared to placebo. Patients in the pamrevlumab group also experienced fewer protocol-defined progression events (defined as death or ≥10 % decline in FVC %-predicted) as compared to the placebo group. In addition, pamrevlumab demonstrated good tolerability with a safety profile similar to placebo. The overall frequency of treatment-emergent adverse events was similar in the treatment and the placebo groups. The safety and efficacy of pamrevlumab will be further evaluated in phase 3 trials (ZEPHYRUS I + II; NCT03955146, NCT04419558) in patients with IPF.
 
Rationale for local targeting of CTGF
 
Based on the high expression of CTGF in lung tissue of IPF patients and its reported pro-fibrotic role in the lung in preclinical models, local targeting of CTGF in the lung is considered essential for driving the anti-fibrotic effect. PRS-220 is being developed as a first-in-class inhaled antagonist of the pro-fibrotic mediator CTGF. The inhaled route of administration of PRS-220 offers several advantages over pamrevlumab, the parenterally administered CTGF-targeted monoclonal antibody that is currently in clinical development for IPF.
 
In comparison to parenteral administration of a monoclonal antibody, inhaled administration of PRS-220 is expected to result in greater exposure of the drug at the site of the disease. Meanwhile, it is known that parenterally administered monoclonal antibodies have a low lung bioavailability with approximately 15% penetrating the lung tissue. Moreover, inhaled administration of PRS-220 is also expected to result in greater lung exposure by avoidance of the CTGF drug “sink” in the peripheral circulation. CTGF is present in the circulation and levels were found to be increased in IPF patients. Another advantage of an inhaled therapy is the convenience of home-based dosing with a portable, handheld nebulizer, as opposed to the office-based injections or intravenous route of delivery of parenteral monoclonal antibodies such as pamrevlumab.
 
Preclinical data
 
PRS-220 is a NGAL-based mutant selected from Pieris’ proprietary Anticalin libraries using phage display technology and high-throughput screening. PRS-220 binds to CTGF with high affinity in the picomolar range as measured by surface plasmon resonance, or SPR, and does not show binding to other members of the CCN2 protein family. Compared to the anti-CTGF antibody pamrevlumab, PRS-220 binds with higher affinity and retains a more stable target engagement over a longer period of time (Figure 2).
 


Figure 2 | SPR binding experiment showing the binding of PRS-220 (left) and pamrevlumab (right) to CTGF. The 1:1 binding model was used to fit the data of PRS-220. The bivalent analyte model was used to fit the data of the antibody pamrevlumab. CTGF-Fc was immobilized on a CM5 chip, and PRS-220 and pamrevlumab were used as analytes. Pamrevlumab was generated in-house.
---------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
PRS-220 targets the functionally active epitope of CTGF as shown by competition ELISA where PRS-220 effectively displaces the clinically active pamrevlumab from CTGF (Figure 3).

To assess the lung biodistribution of PRS-220 upon local lung delivery, we challenged mice with bleomycin to induce lung fibrosis. Once fibrosis was established in the animals, fluorescently-labeled PRS-220 was given intratracheally and the distribution of the drug was analyzed using Light Sheet imaging, revealing a favorable lung tissue distribution profile of PRS-220 in the fibrotic lungs. PRS-220 was not only detected in the airways but also penetrated the fibrotic, interstitial lung tissue (Figure 4A). Compared to intravenously administered pamrevlumab, which was analyzed in parallel, PRS-220 showed a higher coverage of the fibrotic tissue (Figure 4B).
 


Figure 4 | Lung biodistribution of PRS-220 upon intratracheal delivery to fibrotic lungs of mice. (A) Alexa-647 labeled PRS-220 (100 µg/mouse) was administered to the lungs of mice via the intratracheal route at day 21 after bleomycin challenge. The lung tissue distribution was analyzed 2, 8, and 24 hours after PRS-220 administration by Light Sheet imaging of the left lung lobes (630 nm excitation channel). The figure shows representative 3D overview images (scale bars 500 µm) and magnified 2D sections from 3D scanned lungs (scale bars 150 µm). Lungs of saline treated mice imaged at the PRS-220 specific wavelength served as negative controls.

Developability assessments of PRS-220 showed favorable biophysical properties ensuring robustness and stability for large-scale manufacturing and nebulized inhaled administration. Aerosols generated using vibrating mesh technology show aerodynamic properties suitable for effective lung deposition.
 
PRS-400 Targeting Jagged-1
 
 PRS-400 is a fully proprietary Anticalin protein targeting Jagged-1 and is being developed as an inhaled treatment for muco-obstructive lung diseases. Jagged-1 is one of five cell surface ligands interacting with Notch receptors. As the Notch pathway is active in multiple other organs, an inhaled intervention is especially suited to circumvent side effects previously described in clinical trials with systemically delivered molecules. It has been demonstrated that Jagged-1/Notch signaling drives secretory cell trans-differentiation in the airways and that blocking Jagged-1/Notch interaction reverses mucus-producing cells in favor of ciliated cells, thereby limiting mucus hypersecretion and airway obstruction, major pathogenic features in chronic airway diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD, cystic fibrosis, non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis and asthma. Mucus hypersecretion and mucus plugging are thought to correlate with impaired lung function and exacerbation rate. We envision that PRS-400 has the potential to improve quality of life in patients with muco-obstructive lung diseases by exiting the vicious cycle of bacterial infection, inflammation and mucus hypersecretion.  
 
 Preclinical data demonstrated that PRS-400 Anticalin proteins potently inhibit Jagged-1-induced Notch 2 signaling in a dose-dependent manner in a cell reporter assay, locally and efficiently reduce expression of major airway mucins (MUC5AC and MUC5B) and reduce the number of goblet cells in ex vivo and in vivo models thereby addressing key pathogenic features of muco-obstructive lung diseases. These preclinical findings corroborate our vision that PRS-400 represents a promising opportunity to improve quality of live by reducing the mucus burden in patients with muco-obstructive lung diseases.

AstraZeneca Respiratory Collaboration beyond Elarekibep
 
As further described below, our license and collaboration agreement with AstraZeneca, or the AstraZeneca Collaboration Agreement, includes two programs beyond elarekibep. We retain co-development and co-commercialization rights to both of those programs. Discovery work is ongoing for on all of the additional development candidates under the collaboration. The targets and disease areas of those two programs are undisclosed.
Genentech Collaboration
 
In May 2021, we and Genentech, a member of the Roche Group, entered into a multi-program Research Collaboration and License Agreement to discover, develop and commercialize locally delivered respiratory and ophthalmology therapies that leverage the Company’s proprietary Anticalin-based technology. These two focus areas of the collaboration are uniquely suited to the advantages offered by the small size of Anticalin proteins when delivered locally. The first two programs have been initiated and Pieris is responsible for discovery research and early preclinical development of these programs, and Genentech will be responsible for IND-enabling activities, clinical development, and commercialization of the programs. Genentech will also have the option to select additional targets in return for an option exercise fee.

PRS-344/S095012
 
PRS-344/S095012 consists of a PD-L1-targeting antibody and 4-1BB-targeting Anticalin proteins genetically fused to each arm of the C-terminal heavy chain of the antibody.
 
4-1BB is a co-stimulatory receptor belonging to the TNFR super-family. Clustering of 4-1BB on the surface of T cells leads to T cell activation, proliferation and cytokine secretion. The mode of action of PRS-344/S095012 is to promote 4-1BB clustering by bridging 4-1BB-positive T cells with PD-L1-positive tumor cells, and to thereby provide a potent co-stimulatory signal to tumor antigen-specific T cells. PRS-344/S095012 is intended to localize 4-1BB activation in the tumor in a PD-L1 dependent manner. PD-L1 is a transmembrane protein belonging to the B7 family and is expressed on a variety of cells including T cells, B cells, epithelial cells and vascular endothelial cells. Most importantly, PD-L1 is found at high levels on tumor cells of several cancer types including but not limited to melanoma, lung, bladder, colon and breast cancer. Binding of PD-L1 to its receptor PD-1 leads to exhaustion of tumor-infiltrating T cells. PRS-344/S095012 blocks the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction and thus is capable of reversing T cell exhaustion in the tumor microenvironment. Preclinical data shows that the synergistic effect observed by targeting PD-L1 and 4-1BB simultaneously is stronger with PRS-344/S095012 than with the combination of anti-PD-L1 and anti-4-1BB antibodies.
 


Figure 5 | The combination of anti-PD-L1 benchmark and anti-4-1BB benchmark demonstrates the strong synergistic effect of T cell co-stimulation and checkpoint blockade in T cell activation. With PRS-344/S095012, this synergistic effect is massively increased.
---------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Regulatory clearance for the phase 1/2 study of PRS-344/S095012, a 4-1BB/PD-L1 bispecific, has been granted in multiple countries and the first patient was dosed in November 2021. The first-in-human study consists of evaluating the safety and tolerability profile of PRS-344/S095012 and determining its maximum tolerated dose, or MTD, and/or the recommended phase 2 dose, or RP2D, in patients with solid tumors. In addition, the PK profile as well as pharmacodynamic effects of PRS-344/S095012 will be characterized in the study. Any initial signs of anti-tumoral activity will be correlated to safety and PK and further explored in expansion cohorts.

IO Market with respect to PRS-344/S095012
 
In 2022, there were approximately 1.918 million estimated new cancer cases in the United States (NCI Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program) and approximately 19.3 million cancer cases worldwide in 2020 (IARC GLOBOCAN 2020). The direct medical cost for cancer in the United States in 2015 was estimated to be approximately $80.2 billion by the Agency for Healthcare research and Quality, or the AHRQ.
 
Checkpoint inhibitors such as PD-1 and CTLA4-targeting antibodies have revolutionized the way certain cancers are treated and in 2018 the Noble Prize in Medicine was awarded to Dr. James Allison and Dr. Tasuku Honjo for their discovery of CTLA-4 and PD-1-targeting antibodies, respectively. By the end of 2022, a total of seven anti-PD-1 or PD-L1 monoclonal antibodies and two CTLA4 targeting antibodies have been approved in the United States. In addition, other than the seven anti-PD-1 or PD-L1 monoclonal antibodies approved in the United States, nine other anti-PD-1 antibodies had been approved in China by the end of 2022. The majority of the global sales of checkpoint inhibitors comes from two anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibodies: pembrolizumab marketed by Merck & Co and nivolumab marketed by Bristol-Myers Squibb. In 2022, Merck & Co reported sales of $20.937 billion for pembrolizumab and Bristol-Myers Squibb reported sales of $8.249 billion for nivolumab.
 
Servier Collaboration beyond PRS-344/S095012
 
In February 2020, we and Servier agreed to extend the research term of the three programs in development beyond PRS-344/S095012 for one year. This research extension included reimbursement for Pieris’ internal efforts and an extension of the research license. As part of the expiration of the initial research term, the option to expand the collaboration beyond the initial five committed programs also expired. In March 2020, Servier notified us of its decision to discontinue co-development of two earlier preclinical stage programs for strategic reasons based upon an extensive portfolio review. In December 2022, Servier discontinued the development of PRS-352/S095025, a bispecific Mabcalin compound comprising an PD-L1-targeting antibody genetically fused to Anticalin proteins specific for OX40, for strategic reasons. 
Seagen Collaboration 
 
In addition, our collaboration with Seagen to discover and develop Anticalin-based tumor-targeted bispecific antibody-Anticalin therapeutics in IO includes three programs.
 
We achieved a key development milestone for one of the programs, a CD228 x 4-1BB, or SGN-BB228, bispecific tumor-targeted costimulatory agonist, in the Seagen collaboration in 2020, triggering a $5 million milestone payment. We handed the program over to Seagen, which is responsible for further advancement and funding of the asset. Seagen presented preclinical data for this program at the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer 37th Annual Meeting. In January 2023, we announced that the first patient was dosed in a Seagen-sponsored phase 1 study of SGN-BB228, which triggered a $5 million milestone payment from Seagen to us. The program is one of three current programs in the Seagen alliance, and we believe the achieved milestone further validates our approach for developing immuno-oncology bispecifics, complementing the previously reported phase 1 clinical data seen with cinrebafusp alfa.
 
In March 2021, Seagen made a $13.0 million equity investment in Pieris as part of an ongoing collaboration between the companies. The companies also entered into a clinical trial and supply agreement, or CTSA, to evaluate the safety and efficacy of combining Pieris' cinrebafusp alfa with Seagen's tucatinib, a small-molecule tyrosine kinase HER2 inhibitor, for the treatment of gastric cancer patients expressing lower HER2 levels (IHC2+/ISH- & IHC1+) as part of the phase 2 study conducted by Pieris. The CTSA was later terminated in the third quarter of 2022 after we ceased enrollment in cinrebafusp alfa. The companies also amended their existing immuno-oncology collaboration whereby Pieris' option to co-develop and co-commercialize the second of three programs in the collaboration was converted to a co-promotion option for one of the three programs in the United States. During the third quarter of 2021, we initiated the second program, and during the fourth quarter of 2022, we initiated the third program within the collaboration with Seagen.

Boston Pharmaceuticals Collaboration 
 
In April 2021, we and Boston Pharmaceuticals, a subsidiary of Boston Pharma Holdings, LLC, entered into an exclusive product license agreement to develop PRS-342/BOS-342, a GPC3/4-1BB preclinical immuno-oncology bispecific Mabcalin protein. We completed the material and know-how transfer to BP and are currently supporting BP in manufacturing and IND-readiness activities for PRS-342/BOS-342 to initiate phase 1 in 2023.
Competition
 
The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. While we believe that our technology, development experience, scientific knowledge and strategies provide us with competitive advantages, we face and will continue to face intense competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and governmental agencies, and public and private research institutions, both in the United States and worldwide.
 
We compete, or will compete, with existing and new therapies that may become available in the future. Some of these competitors are pursuing the development of pharmaceuticals that target the same diseases and conditions that our drug candidates target. Any drug candidates that we are able to develop and commercialize will compete with existing and new drugs being developed by our competitors. Our competitors may develop or market products or other novel technologies that are more effective, safer, more convenient or less costly than any that may be commercialized by us or may obtain regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours.
 
The acquisition or licensing of pharmaceutical products is also very competitive, and a number of more established companies, some of which have acknowledged strategies to license or acquire products and many of which are bigger, have more institutional experience and have greater cash flows than us, may have competitive advantages over us, as may other emerging companies taking similar or different approaches to product licenses and/or acquisitions. In addition, a number of established research-based pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies may acquire products in late stages of development to augment their internal product lines, which may provide those companies with an even greater competitive advantage.
 
There are a number of other companies presently working to develop therapies for respiratory diseases and cancer, including divisions of large pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies of various sizes. There are also a variety of available drug therapies marketed for these diseases. Our drug candidates, if any are approved, may compete with these existing drug and other therapies, and to the extent they are ultimately used in combination with or as an adjunct to these therapies, our drug candidates may not be competitive with them. Some of the currently approved drug therapies are branded and subject to patent protection, and others are available on a generic basis. Many of these approved drugs are well-established therapies and are widely accepted by physicians, patients and third-party payors. As a result, market acceptance of, and a significant share of the market for, any of our drug candidates that we successfully introduce to the market will pose challenges.
 
In addition to currently marketed therapies, there are also a number of drugs in clinical development to treat respiratory diseases and cancer. These medicines in development may provide efficacy, safety, convenience and other benefits that are not provided by currently marketed therapies and may not be provided by any of our current or future product candidates. As a result, they may provide significant competition for any of our product candidates.
 
Many of our competitors will have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we have. Additional mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical industry may result in even more resources being concentrated in some of our competitors. Competition may increase further as a result of advances made in the commercial applicability of technologies and greater availability of capital for investment in these fields. Our success will be based in part on our ability to build, obtain regulatory approval for and market acceptance of, and actively manage a portfolio of drugs that addresses unmet medical needs and creates value in patient therapy.
 
    21 

  

In addition, our competitors may have a variety of drugs in development or awaiting market approval that could reach the market and become established before we have a product to sell. Our competitors may also develop alternative therapies that could further limit the market for any drugs that we may develop. Many of our competitors are using technologies or methods different or similar to ours to identify and validate drug targets and to discover novel small molecule or biologic drugs. Many of our competitors and their collaborators have significantly greater experience than we do in the following:
 

• | identifying and validating targets;
--+------------------------------------


• | screening compounds against targets;
--+-------------------------------------


• | performing preclinical and clinical trials of potential pharmaceutical products; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | obtaining regulatory approval.
--+-------------------------------

 
In addition, many of our competitors and their collaborators have substantially greater advantages in the following areas:
 

• | capital resources;
--+-------------------


• | research and development resources;
--+------------------------------------


• | manufacturing expertise and capabilities; and
--+----------------------------------------------


• | sales and marketing capabilities.
--+----------------------------------

 
Smaller companies also may prove to be significant competitors, particularly through proprietary research discoveries and collaborative arrangements with large pharmaceutical and established biotechnology companies. Many of our competitors have products that have been approved by the FDA, or its foreign counterparts, or are in advanced development. We face competition from other companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies and other public and private research organizations for collaborative arrangements with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, in recruiting and retaining highly-qualified scientific and management personnel and for licenses to additional technologies. Developments by others may render our product candidates or our technologies obsolete. Our failure to compete effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business.
 
Elarekibep
 
Like elarekibep, new developments for the treatment of uncontrolled moderate to severe asthma patients mainly include drug candidates targeting the Th2 pathway by interfering with IL-4/IL-13, IL-5, TSLP or CRTH2. Such agents include mepolizumab (GSK, IL-5), reslizumab (Teva, IL-5), benralizumab (AstraZeneca, IL-5Rα), tezepelumab (Amgen/AstraZeneca, TSLP) and CBP201 (Connect Biopharma, IL-4Rα). These drugs are in later clinical development than elarekibep or have been approved for severe eosinophilic asthma. Dupilumab (Sanofi/Regeneron, IL-4Rα) has been approved for moderate to severe asthma; the antibody omalizumab, directed against IgE, is also approved and marketed for the treatment of uncontrolled, moderate to severe asthma patients. However, in contrast to elarekibep, these antibodies are given to patients through injection and distribute systemically through the blood stream. AZD8360 (AstraZeneca/Amgen), an inhaled antibody fragment that targets TSLP is currently in phase 1 clinical development. There are a number of other companies presently marketing or developing other therapies for asthmatic patients.
 
PRS-220
 
In addition to the currently approved drugs, Ofev (nintedanib) and Esbriet (pirfenidone), there are multiple other programs in development for the treatment of IPF. The majority of these programs are at an early stage and include a variety of targets. There is one competing program targeting CTGF in phase 3 clinical development, pamrevlumab (Fibrogen), an antibody administered by intravenous infusion. Besides pamrevlumab, there are further programs targeting CTGF at an early stage of development. Other late-stage competitors include, tyvaso (United Therapeutics, inhaled formulation of treprostinil sodium) and BI-1015550 (Boehringer Ingelheim, PDE4B), which are currently being tested in phase 3 clinical trials. Furthermore, a number of competing programs are in phase 2 clinical development, such as GB-0139 (Galecto, galectin-3), BMS-986278 (Bristol-Myers Squibb, LPA1), CC-539 (Bristol-Myers Squibb, JNK1), PLN-74809 (Pliant Therapeutics, avbeta1/avbeta 6) and setanaxib (GenKyoTex, NOX1/4), whereby the first listed program is administered by inhalation and the subsequent programs are administered orally. Additionally, to the previously stated competitors, there are several other programs that are being developed for the treatment of IPF.
 
IO programs
 
The rationale behind the multispecific tumor-targeted co-stimulatory molecules is to activate the immune system in the tumor microenvironment. Other companies that also develop multispecific drug candidates designed to activate the immune system in a tumor dependent manner by targeting a co-stimulatory receptor, such as 4-1BB, include Roche, Merus, Inhibrx and Genmab, among others. Additionally, there are multiple drug candidates in preclinical or clinical trials targeting other co-stimulatory receptors, either in a tumor dependent or monospecific manner, including OX40, CD40, GITR, CD27 and ICOS.
 
The first checkpoint inhibitor targeting CTLA-4, ipilimumab, was approved for the treatment of melanoma patients in 2011 and is being marketed by Bristol-Myers Squibb. Nivolumab from Bristol-Myers Squibb was approved for the treatment of melanoma in 2014 as the first PD-1 inhibitor. Pembrolizumab from Merck & Co was the second PD-1 inhibitor to be approved and the first one in the United States. In addition to nivolumab and pembrolizumab, there are multiple approved checkpoint inhibitors targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway, for example, those from Roche, AstraZeneca, Regeneron, Pfizer and Merck KGaA.
 
Additionally, a number of other companies, such as Amgen, Affimed, Macrogenics, F-star, Xencor, Immunocore and Zymeworks, also pursue other multispecific approaches in oncology, in which such therapies are in clinical or preclinical development.
 
    22 

  

PRS-344/S095012
 
PRS-344/S095012 is bispecific Mabcalin protein targeting 4-1BB and PD-L1. PRS-344/S095012 is designed to promote 4-1BB clustering by bridging 4-1BB-positive T cells with PD-L1-positive tumor cells, and to thereby provide a co-stimulatory signal to tumor antigen-specific T cells. Furthermore, the direct PD-L1- targeting activity of PRS-344/S095012 may provide an additional therapeutic benefit by checkpoint blockade. Multiple companies have publicly disclosed competing 4-1BB and PD-L1 bispecific programs, including, for example, Genmab in collaboration with BioNTech (GEN1046), Merus (MCLA-145), Inhibrx in collaboration with Elpiscience (INBRX-105), F-star (FS-222), Numab in collaboration with CStone (NM21-1480), ABL Bio in collaboration with I-MAB (ABL503), Antengene (ATG-101), among others.
     23 

  

Manufacturing
 
We do not own or operate, and currently have no plans to establish, any manufacturing facilities. We currently rely and expect to continue to rely on third-party contract manufacturer organizations, or CMOs, for the manufacture of our drug candidates for larger scale preclinical and clinical testing, as well as for commercial quantities of any drug candidates that may be approved for marketing.
 
We currently rely on multiple CMOs for all of our clinical supplies, including drug substances and finished drug products, and label and packaging for our preclinical research and clinical trials, including the phase 1/2 study for PRS-344/S095012, and the phase 1 study for PRS-220.
 
We believe that we will be able to contract with other CMOs to obtain drug substances if our existing sources of drug substances were no longer available or sufficient, but there is no assurance that the drug substances would be available from other CMOs on acceptable terms, on the timeframe that our business would require or at all. We do not have supply commitments or other arrangements in place with our existing CMOs. We also do not currently have arrangements in place for redundant supply of bulk drug substance. We have also experienced reduced capacity offered by CMOs due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
 
We do not have any current contractual relationships for the manufacture of commercial supplies of any of our drug product candidates if they are approved. We intend to enter into agreements with a CMO and, as needed, one or more back-up manufacturers for the commercial production of our product candidates as they near potential approval.
 
Any drug products to be used in clinical trials and any approved product that we may commercialize will need to be manufactured in facilities, and by processes, that comply with the FDA’s cGMP requirements and comparable requirements of the regulatory agencies of other jurisdictions in which we are seeking approval. We currently employ internal resources to manage our CMOs.
 
We believe that elarekibep, PRS-344/S095012, PRS-220 and our other Anticalin branded drug candidates can be manufactured in reliable and reproducible biologic processes from readily available starting materials. Elarekibep is produced using a bacterial expression system similar to those that have been used in the past for the production of other proteins and which systems are widely used in the industry. PRS-344/S095012 and PRS-220 are produced using mammalian expression systems similar to those systems that are widely used in the industry for the production of antibodies. We believe that the manufacturing process is amenable to scale-up and will not require unusual or expensive equipment. We expect to continue to develop, on our own or with our collaborators, drug candidates that can be produced cost-effectively at contract manufacturing facilities.
 
Intellectual Property and Exclusivity
 
Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain exclusivity of our proprietary Anticalin-based technologies through intellectual property protection for our drug candidates, libraries of different protein scaffolds and consensus sequences, the fundamental Anticalin platform technology, including novel therapeutic and diagnostic discoveries, as well as other proprietary know-how and trade secrets, and to operate without infringing on the intellectual property rights of others.
 
We seek to protect our exclusive position of Anticalin technologies by, among other means, prosecuting our own international, U.S. and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development and implementation of our business. We have established intellectual property protection in relation to our Anticalin technologies in key global markets, including in North America, Europe and Asia. We also rely on trade secrets for confidential know-how, which we generally seek to protect through contractual (for example, confidentiality) agreements with employees and third parties.
 
We have protected the goodwill of our Company and our drug candidates, created through innovation and development, by putting in place trademark registrations of the Pieris and Anticalin marks as well as several defensive registrations.
 
We currently, and expect that we will continue to, file patent applications and maintain granted patents directed to our key drug candidates in an effort to establish intellectual property positions relating to new compositions of matter for these drug candidates, as well as novel medical applications of these compounds in the treatment, prevention or diagnosis of various indications. We also intend to seek patent protection, if available, with respect to biomarkers that may contribute to selecting the right patient population for the use of any of our drug candidates, or with respect to pharmaceutical formulations that may be useful to produce final medicinal products.
 
We own, or are the exclusive licensee of, a patent portfolio consisting of several issued U.S. patents, and their respective counterparts in a number of foreign jurisdictions, including pending patent applications under the Patent Cooperation Treaty, pending U.S. patent applications and corresponding pending patent applications in a number of foreign jurisdictions as well as pending provisional patent applications, as described in further detail below.
     24 

  

In applicable jurisdictions, such as the United States, we will seek patent term extensions for certain issued patents of ours. If we obtain marketing approval for our drug candidates in the United States or certain jurisdictions outside of the United States, we may be eligible for regulatory protection, such as 4 years of data exclusivity and 12 years of market exclusivity for new biological entities in the United States and as mentioned below, up to five years of patent term extension potentially available in the United States, eight to 11 years of data and marketing exclusivity potentially available for new drugs in the European Union, up to five and a half years of patent extension in Europe (supplemental protection certificate) and eight years of exclusivity, similar to data exclusivity in the United States, potentially available in Japan under its re-examination system. There can be no assurance that we will qualify for any such regulatory exclusivity or that any such exclusivity will prevent competitors from seeking approval solely on the basis of their own studies. See “Government Regulation.”
 
We hold issued patents and pending patent applications in the United States and other foreign jurisdictions, which patents or patent applications are related to libraries of different scaffolds and consensus sequences such as human NGAL and human tear lipocalin, and are expiring or expected to expire between 2023 and 2043, subject to any patent term adjustments and terminal disclaimers in the United States. We also own a number of patents and patent applications at various stages of prosecution directed towards compositions of matter and in some cases, formulations or methods of use, of our preclinical and clinical drug candidates. Where possible, we will pursue patent term adjustments in the United States and any applicable foreign jurisdictions.
 
As a result of our research and licensing agreement, or the TUM License, with Technische Universität München, or TUM, we hold a worldwide exclusive license to multiple issued patents and pending patent applications. These patents and patent applications relate to Anticalin proteins derived from hNGAL lipocalin muteins and/or a library of an hNGAL scaffold of a certain consensus sequence, which patent is expected to expire in 2029, subject to any patent term adjustments or terminal disclaimers in the United States. We also hold an exclusive license to issued patents or pending patent applications related to bacterial lipocalin muteins and a1m lipocalin muteins.
 
We hold a number of issued patents and pending patent applications in the United States and foreign jurisdictions directed to newly-discovered or improved scaffold libraries of lipocalin muteins, compounds derived therefrom (i.e., specific drug candidates) or the uses of such compounds to treat, prevent and mitigate certain diseases and conditions whose pathological development involve the targets of interest as well as to diagnose, prognose and select treatments for the diseases and conditions. We would expect that these patents and any patents that may issue from pending applications would likely expire between 2029 and 2043 without taking into account possible patent term adjustments or other extensions. However, any and all of these pending patent applications may not result in issued patents, and not all issued patents may be maintained in force for their entire term. We are actively pursuing intellectual property protection for our IO drug candidates in key global markets that, if granted, could expire as late as 2042 or later depending on the date of the filing of such patent applications.
 
In addition to issued patents, we hold trademarks in the United States for the Pieris and Anticalin marks. Similarly, we hold their respective counterparts, as registered trademarks, in a number of foreign jurisdictions. We will continue to look for trademark protection for the goodwill associated with our Company and our drug candidates in the countries or regions where we will have investment, research and development, sales or other activities.
 
We also rely upon unpatented trade secrets and know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive advantage. We strive to protect our proprietary information, in part, by using confidentiality agreements and/or invention assignment agreements with our collaborators, scientific advisors, employees and consultants. The confidentiality agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of agreements requiring invention assignment, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through a relationship with a third party. We also actively manage our publication and patent applications in that we only disclose information necessary to stir scientific interest or demonstrate patentability without materially compromising the secrecy of our valuable trade secrets and know-how. While we consider trade secrets and know-how to be a critical component of our intellectual property, trade secrets and know-how can be difficult to protect. In particular, with respect to our technology platform, we anticipate that these trade secrets and know-how will, over the course of time, be disseminated within the industry through independent development, the publication of journal articles describing the methodology and the movement of personnel skilled in the technology from academic to industry positions and vice versa. As a result, those proprietary trade secrets and know-how may lose their value to us over a period of time, and we may lose any competitive advantage afforded by them, as they become public knowledge.
 
Strategic Partnerships
 
Since inception, we have entered into several strategic partnerships and other license or option agreements to complement our drug discovery and development. Specifically, we have entered into strategic partnerships with Servier, AstraZeneca, Seagen and Genentech, or collectively, the Strategic Partnerships. Under the Strategic Partnerships, we have developed and conducted or will develop and conduct selection and screening of drug candidates, as well as in vitro potency and efficacy testing, using our Anticalin-brand drug discovery platform, our Anticalin libraries and other proprietary methods to generate, identify and characterize drug candidates against certain biological targets associated with several diseases. The current Strategic Partnerships have provided us with approximately $172.2 million in cash from upfront and milestone payments through December 31, 2022. With respect to discontinued agreements, we have no ongoing performance obligations and do not expect to receive any significant additional consideration pursuant to those agreements.
 
    25 

  

Under our ongoing Strategic Partnerships, our partners are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize drug candidates identified in the course of the collaboration. We are entitled to receive from our partners’ research, development and regulatory milestone payments and, in some cases, including in the Servier, AstraZeneca, Seagen and Genentech collaborations, royalties on net sales for products developed and commercialized under these collaborations. With respect to most of our Strategic Partnerships, we have commercial rights, including the option to co-develop, co-commercialize or co-promote one or more therapeutic programs with the applicable partners. We plan to continue to actively seek out additional collaboration partners that fit within our corporate development strategy.
 
The Strategic Partnerships represent our collaborations in our therapeutic areas of respiratory diseases, as well as IO, and include co-development and co-commercialization options. Certain terms and conditions of these Strategic Partnerships are summarized below.
 
Our collaboration with AstraZeneca
 
On May 2, 2017, we entered into the AstraZeneca Collaboration Agreement and a Non-exclusive Anticalin Platform Technology License Agreement with AstraZeneca, or the AstraZeneca Platform License, collectively referred to as the AstraZeneca Agreements, which became effective on June 10, 2017, following expiration of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976. Under the AstraZeneca Agreements the parties will advance several novel inhaled Anticalin proteins. On March 29, 2021, we entered into the first amendment to the Non-exclusive Anticalin Platform License Agreement dated May 2, 2017 and the second amendment to the License and Collaboration Agreement dated May 2, 2017. Under the amendments, the parties agreed to restructure certain commercial economics for the elarekibep program by adjusting various milestones and royalty provisions, while fundamentally maintaining the overall value split between AstraZeneca and the Company. In connection with the amendments, we entered into a Subscription Agreement pursuant to which we have agreed to issue to AstraZeneca 3,584,230 shares of our common stock for a total purchase price of $10.0 million in a private placement transaction. In August 2022, we entered into an amendment to the License and Collaboration Agreement and extended the research term for two of the then remaining discovery-stage programs.
 
Under the AstraZeneca Agreements, we received an upfront, non-refundable payment of $45.0 million. In addition, we initiated a phase 1 study for elarekibep, or the AstraZeneca Lead Product, in December 2017 for which we received a $12.5 million milestone payment. In March 2021, we achieved a $13.0 million milestone in connection with the initiation of the phase 2a study for this program. We are also eligible to receive research, development, commercial and sales milestone payments and royalty payments. The total potential milestones, as of December 31, 2022, were categorized as follows: research, development and commercial milestones up to $0.7 million and sales milestones up to $3.9 billion. We may receive tiered royalties on sales of potential products commercialized by AstraZeneca and for co-developed products and gross margin share of worldwide sales, depending on our level of committed investment.
 
The term of each of the AstraZeneca Agreements ends upon the expiration of all of AstraZeneca’s payment obligations under such AstraZeneca Agreement. The AstraZeneca Collaboration Agreement may be terminated by AstraZeneca in its entirety for convenience beginning 12 months after its effective date upon 90 days’ notice or, if we have obtained marketing approval for the marketing and sale of a product, upon 180 days’ notice. Each program may be terminated at AstraZeneca’s option; if any program is terminated by AstraZeneca, we will have full rights to such program. The AstraZeneca Collaboration Agreement may also be terminated by AstraZeneca or us for material breach upon 180 days’ notice of a material breach (or 30 days with respect to payment breach), provided that the applicable party has not cured such breach by the permitted cure period (including an additional 180 days if the breach is not susceptible to cure during the initial 180-day period) and dispute resolution procedures specified in the AstraZeneca Collaboration Agreement have been followed. Each party may also terminate an AstraZeneca Agreement if the other party challenges the validity of patents related to certain intellectual property licensed under such AstraZeneca Agreement, subject to certain exceptions for infringement suits, acquisitions and newly-acquired licenses. The AstraZeneca Collaboration Agreement may also be terminated due to the other party’s insolvency and may in certain instances be terminated on a product-by-product and/or country-by-country basis. The AstraZeneca Platform License will terminate upon termination of the AstraZeneca Collaboration Agreement, on a product-by-product and/or country-by-country basis.
 
Our collaboration with Servier
 
On January 4, 2017, we entered into the Servier Collaboration Agreement and a non-exclusive Anticalin platform license agreement with Servier, or the Servier Platform License, collectively referred to as the Servier Agreements. Pursuant to the terms of the Servier Agreements, we, along with Servier, initially pursued five bispecific therapeutic programs. In September 2019, Servier notified the Company of its decision to discontinue co-development of PRS-332, a PD-1-LAG-3 bispecific that served as the initial development program under the Pieris-Servier alliance, for strategic reasons. After having conducted an extensive portfolio review, Servier decided in March 2020 to discontinue development of two earlier-stage programs in the collaboration. In December 2022, Servier decided to focus on continued and accelerated development of the most advanced program, PRS-344/S095012, and discontinue PRS-352/S095025 for strategic reasons. 
     26 

  

Under the Servier Agreements, we received an upfront payment of €30.0 million (approximately $32.0 million) and have achieved two preclinical milestones related to PRS-344/S095012 as well as one clinical milestone related to PRS-344/S095012 and one preclinical milestone related to PRS-352/S095012. We may also receive additional development-dependent and commercial milestone payments for PRS-344/S095012. The total development, regulatory and sales-based milestone payments to us, as of December 31, 2022, could be up to €19.0 million during the life of the collaboration and are dependent on the final number of projects pursued and the number of co-development options exercised by us. We will share preclinical and clinical development costs for each co-developed program with Servier. In addition, we will be entitled to receive tiered royalties up to low double digits on the sales of commercialized products in the Servier territories.
 
The term of each of the Servier Agreements ends upon the expiration of all of Servier’s payment obligations under such Servier Agreement. The Servier Agreements may be terminated by either of us for material breach upon 90 days’ or 120 days’ notice of a material breach, with respect to the Servier Collaboration Agreement and the Servier Platform License, respectively, provided that the applicable party has not cured such breach by the applicable 90-day or 120-day permitted cure period, and dispute resolution procedures specified in the applicable Servier Agreement have been followed. The Servier Agreements may also be terminated due to the other party’s insolvency or for a safety issue, and may in certain instances be terminated on a product-by-product and/or country-by-country basis. The Servier Platform License will terminate upon termination of the Servier Collaboration Agreement, on a product-by-product and/or country-by-country basis.
 
Our collaboration with Seagen 
 
On February 8, 2018, we entered into the Seagen Collaboration Agreement and a non-exclusive Anticalin platform technology license agreement with Seagen, or the Seagen Platform License, collectively referred to as the Seagen Agreements, pursuant to which the parties will develop multiple targeted bispecific IO treatments for solid tumors and blood cancers.
 
Under the terms of the Seagen Agreements, Seagen paid us a $30 million upfront fee and will pay tiered royalties on net sales up to the low double-digits. Additionally, Seagen will pay us up to $1.2 billion in total success-based payments, as of December 31, 2022, across three product candidates. The companies will pursue multiple antibody-Anticalin proteins during a research phase, and Seagen has the option to select up to three therapeutic programs for further development. On March 25, 2021 we announced an amendment to the Seagen Collaboration Agreement whereby our option to co-develop and co-commercialize the second of three programs in the collaboration was converted to a co-promotion option for one of the three programs in the United States, with Seagen solely responsible for the development and overall commercialization of that program. We will be entitled to increased royalties in the event that we choose to exercise the co-promotion option for that program. As a result of this amendment, Seagen will solely develop, fund and commercialize all three programs. Seagen may also decide to select additional candidates from the initial research phase for further development in return for the payment to us of additional fees, milestone payments and royalties.
 
The term of each of the Seagen Agreements ends upon the expiration of all of Seagen’s payment obligations under such Seagen Agreement. The Seagen Collaboration Agreement may be terminated by Seagen on a product-by-product basis for convenience beginning 12 months after its effective date upon 90 days’ notice or, for any program where a pivotal study has been initiated, upon 180 days’ notice. Any program may be terminated at Seagen’s option. If any program is terminated by Seagen after a pre-defined pre-clinical stage, we will have full rights to continue such program. If any program is terminated by Seagen prior to such pre-defined pre-clinical stage, we will have the right to continue to develop such program but will be obligated to offer a co-development option to Seagen for such program. The Seagen Collaboration Agreement may also be terminated by Seagen or us for an uncured material breach by the other party upon 90 days’ notice, subject to extension for an additional 90 days if the material breach relates to diligence obligations and subject, in all cases, to dispute resolution procedures. The Seagen Collaboration Agreement may also be terminated due to the other party’s insolvency and may in certain instances, including for reasons of safety, be terminated on a product-by-product basis. Each party may also terminate the Seagen Agreements if the other party challenges the validity of any patents licensed under the Seagen Agreements, subject to certain exceptions. The Seagen Platform License will terminate upon termination of the Seagen Collaboration Agreement, whether in its entirety or on a product-by-product basis.
 
In June 2020, we and Seagen entered into amendments to the Seagen Agreements, or together, the Amendment. The Amendment extended the deadline for Seagen to nominate a second and third antibody target, both of which have since been nominated, and triggered a $5.0 million milestone payment due from Seagen as Seagen made a go decision on SGN-BB228. In January 2023, we announced that the first patient was dosed in SGN-BB228 and Seagen paid us a $5.0 million milestone fee in connection with this achievement.
 
Finally, as part of this transaction, we entered into a subscription agreement pursuant to which we agreed to issue to Seagen 3,706,174 shares of our common stock for a total purchase price of $13.0 million, or $3.51 per share, in a private placement transaction.

Our collaboration with Boston Pharmaceuticals
 
On April 24, 2021, we and BP Asset XII, Inc., or Boston Pharmaceuticals, a subsidiary of Boston Pharma Holdings, LLC, entered into an exclusive product license agreement, or the BP Agreement, to develop PRS-342/BOS-342, a 4-1BB/GPC3 preclinical immuno-oncology Mabcalin bispecific protein.
 
Under the terms of the BP Agreement, Boston Pharmaceuticals exclusively licensed worldwide rights to PRS-342/BOS-342. We received an upfront payment of $10.0 million and are further entitled to receive up to $352.5 million in development, regulatory and sales-based milestone payments, tiered royalties up to low double-digits on sales of PRS-342 and a percentage of consideration received by Boston Pharmaceuticals in the event of a sublicense of a program licensed under the BP Agreement or a change of control of Boston Pharmaceuticals. We will also contribute up to $4.0 million toward manufacturing activities.
 
The term of the BP Agreement ends upon the expiration of all of Boston Pharmaceuticals’ payment obligations thereunder. The BP Agreement may be terminated by Boston Pharmaceuticals in its entirety for convenience beginning nine months after its effective date upon 60 days’ notice or, for any program under the BP Agreement which has received marketing approval, upon 120 days’ notice. If any program is terminated by Boston Pharmaceuticals, we will have full rights to continue such program. The BP Agreement may also be terminated by Boston Pharmaceuticals or us for an uncured material breach by the other party upon 180 days’ notice (60 days in the case of non-payment of undisputed amounts due and payable), subject to extension for an additional 180 days in certain cases and subject, in all cases, to dispute resolution procedures. The Agreement may also be terminated due to the other party’s insolvency. We may also terminate the BP Agreement if Boston Pharmaceuticals challenges the validity of any patents licensed under the BP Agreement, subject to certain exceptions.
 
We do not have any obligations to assist in the research and development efforts of Boston Pharmaceuticals under the BP Agreement. However, we have an obligation to fund up to $4.0 million in costs, including out-of-pocket costs incurred by Boston Pharmaceuticals, in connection with the manufacture of products under the BP Agreement. The arrangement with Boston Pharmaceuticals provides for the transfer of the following: (i) exclusive license of PRS-342/BOS-342, (ii) non-exclusive Pieris platform license, (iii) initial know-how, (iv) product cell line license, and (v) materials (as each such term is defined under the BP Agreement).

Our collaboration with Genentech
 
On May 19, 2021, we and Genentech, Inc., or Genentech, entered into a Research Collaboration and License Agreement, or the Genentech Agreement, to discover, develop and commercialize locally delivered respiratory and ophthalmology therapies that leverage the Company’s proprietary Anticalin technology. Upon signing the Genentech Agreement, Genentech paid the Company a $20 million upfront fee. In addition, we may be eligible to receive up to approximately $1.4 billion in additional milestone payments across multiple programs, as well as tiered royalty payments on net sales at percentages ranging from the mid-single to low double-digits, subject to certain standard reductions and offsets.
 
Under the terms of the Genentech Agreement, we will be responsible for discovery and preclinical development of two initial programs. We will be responsible for research activities following target nomination through the late-stage research go decision. We and Genentech will then collaborate on drug candidate characterization until the development go decision. After the development go decision, Genentech will be responsible for pursuing the preclinical and clinical development of each program, and thereafter, the commercialization efforts. Each party will be responsible for the costs incurred to perform their respective responsibilities. Genentech has an option to expand the collaboration to encompass two additional programs with the payment of a $10 million fee per additional program. If Genentech exercises its option to start additional programs, payment to us of additional fees, milestone payments and royalties would result.
 
Unless earlier terminated, the term of the Genentech Agreement continues until no royalty or other payment obligations are or will become due under the Genentech Agreement. The Genentech Agreement may be terminated (i) by either party based on insolvency or breach by the other party and such insolvency proceeding is not dismissed or such breach is not cured within 90 days; or (ii) after nine months from the effective date of the Genentech Agreement, by Genentech as a whole or on a product-by-product and/or country-by-country basis upon 90 days’ prior written notice before the first commercial sale of a product or upon 180 days’ prior written notice after the first commercial sale of a product.
 
While the Genentech Agreement allows for up to four research programs, only two research programs are initially identified and committed in the Genentech Agreement. To reach a total of up to four research programs, we have granted Genentech options to nominate an additional two collaboration targets of their choosing, subject to the legal availability of the target to be researched. Genentech will have three years after the effective date to nominate the subsequent targets. We have also granted Genentech options to replace any of the collaboration targets identified with another target. However, at no point will there be more than four identified collaboration targets for which there are ongoing research programs.
 
The arrangement with Genentech provides for the transfer of the following goods or services: (i) exclusive research and commercial license for the collaboration programs, (ii) a non-exclusive platform improvement license, (iii) research and development services, (iv) participation in a governance committee, and (v) replacement target options on the first two programs upon a screening failure, which were assessed as material rights.
 
In-License Agreements
 
In addition to the Strategic Licenses and Other License Agreements, we have in-licensed a number of technologies and therapeutics, hereinafter referred to as the In-License Agreements, to advance our pipeline and programs, some of which are described below.
 
TUM License
 
On July 4, 2003, we entered into our TUM License which was subsequently renewed and amended on July 26, 2007. The TUM License established a joint research effort led by Professor Arne Skerra, Chair of Biological Chemistry of TUM, to optimize Anticalin technologies for use in therapeutic, prophylactic and diagnostic applications and as research reagents, and to gain fundamental insights in lipocalin scaffolds. We provided certain funding for TUM research efforts performed under the agreement. The research phase of this collaboration ended on February 28, 2013.
 
Under the terms of the TUM License, TUM assigned to us certain materials and records resulting from the research. We retained rights to inventions made by our employees, and TUM assigned to us all inventions made under the agreement jointly by our employees and TUM personnel, provided that our employees made certain inventive contributions. With respect to all other inventions made in the course of the research, TUM granted to us worldwide exclusive license rights under patents and patent applications claiming such inventions. TUM retained rights to practice these inventions for research and teaching purposes.
 
As a result of research efforts to date under the TUM License, we hold a worldwide exclusive license under our agreement with TUM to multiple patents and patent applications related to certain Anticalin proteins and libraries. We bear the costs of filing, prosecution and maintenance of patents assigned or licensed to us under the agreement.
     29 

  

As consideration for the assignments and licenses, we are obliged to pay to TUM license payments on development of our proprietary products claimed by patents assigned or licensed to us by TUM. For each of such proprietary products developed by us, we could be required to pay up to an aggregate of approximately €0.2 million ($0.2 million) in license payments to TUM under the agreement.
 
We also are obliged to pay low single-digit royalties, including annual minimum royalties, on sales of such products. Should we grant licenses or sublicenses to those patents to third parties, we are obliged to share a percentage of resulting revenue with TUM, which percentage of resulting revenue is creditable against our annual license payments to TUM. Our payment obligations are reduced by our proportionate contribution to a joint invention. Payment obligations terminate on expiration or annulment of the last patent covered by the agreement.
 
We can terminate the licenses to any or all licensed patents upon specified advance notice to TUM. TUM may terminate the license provisions of the agreement only for cause. Termination of the agreement does not terminate our rights in patents assigned to us.
 
Pieris and TUM initiated discussions in the second quarter of 2018 to clarify, expand and restructure the TUM License, including the parties’ obligations under such license agreement. The parties’ discussions relate to revised commercial terms and to re-initiating additional collaborations between faculty at TUM and Pieris. While an amended and restated license agreement has not yet been completed, we intend to enter into such an amendment. These discussions may also lead to an increase in our collaborative research activities with TUM.
 
Kelun License Agreement
 
In connection with our efforts to develop multispecific Anticalin-based proteins designed to engage immunomodulatory targets, during the second quarter of 2017, we entered into a license and transfer agreement, or the Kelun Agreement, with Sichuan Kelun-Biotech Biopharmaceutical Co. Ltd., or Kelun. Under the Kelun Agreement, Kelun has granted to us a non-exclusive worldwide license (with the right to sublicense) under certain intellectual property owned or controlled by Kelun to research, develop, manufacture and commercialize bi- and multi- specific fusion proteins that include an antibody developed by Kelun specific for an undisclosed target and one or more Anticalin proteins.
Government Regulation
 
The research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, marketing, sales, among other things, of drug products are extensively regulated by governmental authorities in the United States and other countries. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations and other regulatory requirements, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources
     30 

  

U.S. Government regulation of drug and biological products 
 
In the United States, the FDA regulates human drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDCA, and in the case of biologics, also under the Public Health Service Act, or the PHSA, and their implementing regulations. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending new drug applications, or NDAs, or biologics license applications, or BLAs, or the agency’s issuance of warning letters, or the imposition of fines, civil penalties, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions and/or criminal prosecution brought by the FDA and the U.S. Department of Justice or other governmental entities.
 
The process required by the FDA before a drug or biologic may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
 

• | completion of preclinical laboratory tests, potentially including animal studies and formulation studies according to Good Laboratory Practices regulations or other applicable regulations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, or ethics committee at each clinical trial site before each clinical trial may be initiated;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with applicable IND regulations, current good clinical practices, or cGCPs, and other clinical-trial related regulations to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the investigational product for each proposed indication;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an NDA or BLA for marketing approval, including payment of application user fees;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the drug or biologic is produced to assess compliance with cGMP to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the product's identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | potential FDA audit of the clinical trial sites to assure compliance with cGCPs and the integrity of the clinical data submitted in support of the NDA or BLA; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA or BLA, including satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review of the product candidate, where appropriate or if applicable, prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the product in the United States.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Preclinical studies
 
Before testing any drug or biological product candidate in humans, the product candidate must undergo rigorous preclinical testing. The preclinical developmental stage generally involves laboratory evaluations of drug chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as studies to evaluate toxicity in animals and potential for other adverse events, which support subsequent clinical testing and rationale for subsequent therapeutic use.
 
 The Consolidated Appropriations Act for 2023, signed into law on December 29, 2022, (P.L. 117-328) amended both the FDCA and PHSA to specify that nonclinical testing for drugs and biologics, respectively, may, but is not required to, include in vivo animal testing. According to the amended language, a sponsor may fulfill nonclinical testing requirements by completing various in vitro assays (e.g., cell-based assays, organ chips, or microphysiological systems), in silico studies (i.e., computer modeling), other human or non-human biology-based tests (e.g., bioprinting), or in vivo animal tests. The sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical studies, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational product to humans and must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. 
 
The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements, including good laboratory practices, or GLP, regulations for safety and toxicology studies. Some long-term nonclinical testing, such as animal tests of reproductive adverse events and carcinogenicity, may continue after an IND for an investigational drug candidate is submitted to the FDA and human clinical trials have been initiated.
 
Human clinical trials in support of an NDA or BLA 
 
All clinical trials must be conducted under the supervision of qualified investigators. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring the safety and effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Study subjects must sign an informed consent form before participating in a clinical trial. There are also requirements governing the reporting of on-going clinical trials and clinical trial results to public registries. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the clinical trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence. Clinical holds may also be imposed by the FDA at any time before or during studies due to safety concerns or non-compliance.
     31 

  

In addition, an IRB representing each institution that is participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution, and the IRB must thereafter conduct a continuing review and re-approve the trial at least annually. The IRB must review and approve, among other things, the trial protocol and informed consent information to be provided to clinical trial subjects. An IRB must operate in compliance with FDA regulations.
 
Information about certain clinical trials, including details of the protocol and eventually study results, also must be submitted within specific time frames to the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, for public dissemination on the ClinicalTrials.gov data registry. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigators and other aspects of the clinical trial is made public as part of the registration of the clinical trial. Sponsors are also obligated to disclose the results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed in some cases for up to two years after the date of completion of the trial. Failure to timely register a covered clinical study or to submit study results as provided for in the law can give rise to civil monetary penalties and also prevent the non-compliant party from receiving future grant funds from the federal government. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Final Rule and NIH's complementary policy on ClinicalTrials.gov registration and reporting requirements became effective in 2017, and the government has begun enforcing those requirements against non-compliant clinical trial sponsors.
 
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
 

• | Phase 1: The product candidate is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, such as cancer, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2: This phase involves studies in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3: Clinical trials are undertaken with an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population, often at geographically dispersed clinical study sites. These studies are intended to establish the overall risk-benefit ratio of the product candidate and provide, if appropriate, an adequate basis for product labeling. These trials may include comparisons with placebo and/or other comparator treatments. The duration of treatment is often extended to mimic the actual use of a product during marketing.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of an NDA or BLA.
 
Congress also recently amended the FDCA, as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act for 2023, in order to require sponsors of a Phase 3 clinical trial, or other “pivotal study” of a new drug to support marketing authorization, to design and submit a diversity action plan for such clinical trial. The action plan must include the sponsor’s diversity goals for enrollment, as well as a rationale for the goals and a description of how the sponsor will meet them. Sponsors must submit a diversity action plan to the FDA by the time the sponsor submits the relevant clinical trial protocol to the agency for review. The FDA may grant a waiver for some or all of the requirements for a diversity action plan. It is unknown at this time how the diversity action plan may affect Phase 3 trial planning and timing or what specific information FDA will expect in such plans, but if the FDA objects to a sponsor’s diversity action plan, it may delay trial initiation.
 
Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events, or SAEs, occur. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the clinical protocol, cGCP, or other IRB requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
 
During the development of a new drug or biological product, sponsors have the opportunity to meet with the FDA at certain points, including prior to submission of an IND, at the end of phase 2, and before submission of an NDA or BLA. These meetings can provide an opportunity for the sponsor to share information about the data gathered to date, for the FDA to provide advice, and for the sponsor and the FDA to reach agreement on the next phase of development. Sponsors typically use the end of phase 2 meeting to discuss their phase 2 clinical results with the agency and to present their plans for the pivotal phase 3 studies that they believe will support approval of the new drug or biological product.
 
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional nonclinical studies and must also develop additional information about the physical characteristics of the drug or biological product and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency and purity of the final drug or biological product. For biological products in particular, the PHSA emphasizes the importance of manufacturing control for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined in order to help reduce the risk of the introduction of adventitious agents. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
     32 

  

Marketing application submission and FDA review
 
Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical studies and clinical trials, along with information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, and controls and proposed labeling, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA or BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. Our Anticalin-based product candidates are proteins that will be regulated as biological products subject to the BLA marketing pathway. BLAs must contain proof of the biological product candidate’s safety, purity, potency and efficacy for its proposed indication or indications. Data may come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and efficacy of a product’s use or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product to the satisfaction of the FDA. Under federal law, each NDA or BLA must be accompanied by a significant user fee, and the sponsor of an approved NDA or BLA is also subject to an annual program fee. These fees are typically adjusted annually, but exemptions and waivers may be available under certain circumstances.
 
The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs and BLAs within 60 days of receipt and informs the sponsor by the 74th day after the FDA’s receipt of the submission whether an application is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA or BLA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing.
 
After the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. As noted above, the FDA has agreed to specified performance goals in the review process of NDAs and BLAs. Applications are meant to be reviewed within ten months from the date it is accepted for submission or filing, and the applications for “priority review” products are meant to be reviewed within six months from the date the application is accepted for submission or filing, as discussed in more detail below. The review process may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider new information or in the case of a clarification provided by the applicant to address an outstanding deficiency identified by the FDA following the original submission.
 
Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, for original BLAs, the FDA has ten months from the filing date in which to complete its initial review of a standard application and respond to the applicant, and six months from the filing date for an application with "priority review." For all BLAs and new molecular entity, or NME, NDAs, the ten and six-month time periods run from the filing date; for all other original applications, the ten and six-month time periods run from the submission date. Despite these review goals, it is not uncommon for FDA review of an NDA or BLA to extend beyond the goal date.
 
Before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA will typically conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities for the new product to determine whether the manufacturing processes and facilities comply with cGMPs. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. The FDA also may inspect the sponsor and one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with cGCP requirements and the integrity of the clinical data submitted to the FDA.
 
Additionally, the FDA may refer any NDA or BLA, including applications for novel biologic candidates which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to an advisory committee. Typically, an advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations when making final decisions on approval. The FDA likely will re-analyze the clinical trial data, which could result in extensive discussions between the FDA and the applicant during the review process. The FDA also may require the development of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, if it determines that a REMS is necessary to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh its risks and to assure the safe use of the drug or biological product. The REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans and/or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries or other risk minimization tools. The FDA determines the requirement for a REMS, as well as the specific REMS provisions, on a case-by-case basis. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the NDA or BLA must submit a proposed REMS. The FDA will not approve a BLA without a REMS, if required.
 
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, as amended, a BLA or supplement to a BLA must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric populations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric population for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of pediatric data or full or partial waivers. The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or the FDASIA, enacted in 2012, made permanent the PREA to require a sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a product that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration to submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan, or PSP, within sixty days of an end-of-phase 2 meeting or, if there is no such meeting, as early as practicable before the initiation of the phase 3 or phase 2/3 clinical trial. The initial PSP must include an outline of the pediatric study or studies that the sponsor plans to conduct, including trial objectives and design, age groups, relevant endpoints and statistical approach, or a justification for not including such detailed information, and any request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the requirement to provide data from pediatric studies along with supporting information. The FDA and the sponsor must reach an agreement on the PSP. A sponsor can submit amendments to an agreed upon initial PSP at any time if changes to the pediatric plan need to be considered based on data collected from pre-clinical studies, early phase clinical trials or other clinical development programs.
     33 

  

The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing is cGMP-compliant to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity. The FDA reviews a BLA to determine, among other things whether the product is safe, pure and potent and that the facility (or facilities) in which it is manufactured, processed, packed or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, purity and potency. The approval process is lengthy and often difficult, and the FDA may refuse to approve an NDA or BLA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or may require additional clinical or other data and information. On the basis of the FDA’s evaluation of the NDA or BLA and accompanying information, including the results of the inspection of the manufacturing facilities, the FDA may issue either an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter, or CRL. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A CRL indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application will not be approved in its present form. A CRL generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. The CRL may require additional clinical or other data, additional pivotal phase 3 clinical trial(s) and/or other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, preclinical studies or manufacturing. If a CRL is issued, the applicant may choose to either resubmit the NDA or BLA addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter or withdraw the application. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA or BLA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in response to an issued CRL in either two or six months depending on the type of information included. Even with the submission of this additional information, however, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.
 
If a product receives regulatory approval from the FDA, the approval is limited to the conditions of use (e.g., patient population, indication) described in the application. Further, depending on the specific risk(s) to be addressed, the FDA may require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval trials, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a product’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution and use restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing trials or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.
 
Fast Track, Breakthrough Therapy and Priority Review Designations 
 
The FDA is authorized to designate certain products for expedited development or review if they are intended to address an unmet medical need in the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition. These programs include fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation and priority review designation.
 
To be eligible for a fast track designation, the FDA must determine, based on the request of a sponsor, that a product is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address an unmet medical need by providing a therapy where none exists or a therapy that may be potentially superior to existing therapy based on efficacy or safety factors. Fast track designation provides opportunities for more frequent interactions with the FDA review team to expedite development and review of the product. The FDA may also review sections of the NDA or BLA for a fast track product on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor and the FDA agree on a schedule for the submission of the application sections and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA or BLA. In addition, fast track designation may be withdrawn by the sponsor or rescinded by the FDA if the designation is no longer supported by data emerging from the clinical trial process.
 
In addition, with the enactment of FDASIA in 2012, Congress created a new regulatory program for product candidates designated by FDA as “breakthrough therapies” upon a request made by the IND sponsors. A breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug or biologic that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug or biologic may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Drugs or biologics designated as breakthrough therapies may also be eligible for accelerated approval of their respective marketing applications. The FDA must take certain actions with respect to breakthrough therapies, such as holding timely meetings with and providing advice to the product sponsor, which are intended to expedite the development and review of an application for approval of a breakthrough therapy.
     34 

  

Finally, the FDA may designate a product for priority review if it is a drug or biologic that treats a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. The FDA determines at the time that the marketing application is submitted, on a case-by-case basis, whether the proposed drug represents a significant improvement in treatment, prevention or diagnosis of disease when compared with other available therapies. Significant improvement may be illustrated by evidence of increased effectiveness in the treatment of a condition, elimination or substantial reduction of a treatment-limiting drug reaction, documented enhancement of patient compliance that may lead to improvement in serious outcomes, or evidence of safety and effectiveness in a new subpopulation. A priority review designation is intended to direct overall attention and resources to the evaluation of such applications, and to shorten the FDA’s goal for taking action on a marketing application from ten months to six months for an original BLA or for an NME NDA from the date of filing.
 
Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. Furthermore, fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation and priority review do not change the standards for approval and may not ultimately expedite the development or approval process.
 
Accelerated approval pathway 
 
In addition, products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval from the FDA and may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the drug product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. The FDA may also grant accelerated approval for such a drug or biologic when the product has an effect on an intermediate clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality, or IMM, and that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on IMM or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval perform post-marketing clinical trials to verify and describe the predicted effect on IMM or other clinical endpoint, and the product may be subject to expedited withdrawal procedures. Drugs and biologics granted accelerated approval must meet the same statutory standards for safety and effectiveness as those granted traditional approval.
 
For the purposes of accelerated approval, a surrogate endpoint is a marker, such as a laboratory measurement, radiographic image, physical sign or other measure that is thought to predict clinical benefit, but is not itself a measure of clinical benefit. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. An intermediate clinical endpoint is a measurement of a therapeutic effect that is considered reasonably likely to predict the clinical benefit of a drug, such as an effect on IMM. The FDA has limited experience with accelerated approvals based on intermediate clinical endpoints, but has indicated that such endpoints generally may support accelerated approval when the therapeutic effect measured by the endpoint is not itself a clinical benefit and basis for traditional approval, if there is a basis for concluding that the therapeutic effect is reasonably likely to predict the ultimate long-term clinical benefit of a drug.
 
The accelerated approval pathway is most often used in settings in which the course of a disease is long and an extended period of time is required to measure the intended clinical benefit of a drug, even if the effect on the surrogate or intermediate clinical endpoint occurs rapidly. For example, accelerated approval has been used extensively in the development and approval of drugs for treatment of a variety of cancers in which the goal of therapy is generally to improve survival or decrease morbidity and the duration of the typical disease course requires lengthy and sometimes large clinical trials to demonstrate a clinical or survival benefit.
 
The accelerated approval pathway is usually contingent on a sponsor’s agreement to conduct, in a diligent manner, additional post-approval confirmatory studies to verify and describe the drug’s clinical benefit. As a result, a product candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase 4 or post-approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint.
  In addition, as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act for 2023, Congress provided FDA additional statutory authority to mitigate potential risks to patients from continued marketing of ineffective drugs previously granted accelerated approval. Under these recent amendments to the FDCA, the agency may require a sponsor of a product granted accelerated approval to have a confirmatory trial underway prior to approval. The sponsor must also submit progress reports on a confirmatory trial every six months until the trial is complete, and such reports will be published on FDA’s website. 
 Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or to confirm the predicted clinical benefit of the product during post-marketing studies, allows the FDA to withdraw approval of the drug.
 
 Congress also recently amended the law to give FDA the option of using expedited procedures to withdraw product approval if the sponsor’s confirmatory trial fails to verify the claimed clinical benefits of the product. 
 All promotional materials for product candidates being considered and approved under the accelerated approval program are subject to prior review by the FDA.
 
Patent term restoration
 
Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of our drugs, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension. These patent term extensions permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for any patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND, and the submission date of an NDA or BLA, plus the time between the submission date of an NDA or BLA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension, and the extension must be applied for prior to expiration of the patent. The United States Patent and Trademark Office, or the USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration.

Pediatric exclusivity 
 
Pediatric exclusivity is a type of non-patent marketing exclusivity available in the United States and, if granted, it provides for the attachment of an additional six months of marketing protection to the term of any existing regulatory exclusivity or listed patents. This six-month exclusivity may be granted if an NDA sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly respond to a Written Request from the FDA for such data. The data do not need to show the product to be effective in the pediatric population studied; rather, if the clinical trial is deemed to fairly respond to the FDA’s request, the additional protection is granted. If reports of requested pediatric studies are submitted to and accepted by the FDA within the statutory time limits, whatever statutory or regulatory periods of exclusivity or patent protection cover the product are extended by six months. This is not a patent term extension, but it effectively extends the regulatory period during which the FDA cannot approve another application. The issuance of a Written Request by the FDA does not require the sponsor to undertake the described studies.
 
Reference product exclusivity for biological products
 
In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act was enacted in the United States and included the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or the BPCIA. The BPCIA amended the PHSA to create an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are biosimilar to or interchangeable with an FDA-licensed reference biological product. Since that time, the FDA has approved approximately 40 biosimilars, including the first interchangeable monoclonal antibody biosimilar in 2021. The FDA has also issued several guidance documents outlining its approach to reviewing and approving biosimilars and interchangeable biosimilar, and has created a public database that contains information on all FDA-licensed biological products, including biosimilars, called the Purple Book.
 
A biosimilar product is defined as one that is highly similar to a reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components and for which there are no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of the safety, purity and potency of the product. An interchangeable product is a biosimilar product that can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product in any given patient and, for products administered multiple times to an individual, that the product and the reference product may be alternated or switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biological product without such alternation or switch. Upon licensure by the FDA, an interchangeable biosimilar may be substituted for the reference product without the intervention of the health care provider who prescribed the reference product.
 
The biosimilar applicant must demonstrate that the product is biosimilar based on data from (1) analytical studies showing that the biosimilar product is highly similar to the reference product; (2) animal studies (including toxicity); and (3) one or more clinical studies to demonstrate safety, purity and potency in one or more appropriate conditions of use for which the reference product is approved. In addition, the applicant must show that the biosimilar and reference products have the same mechanism of action for the conditions of use on the label, route of administration, dosage and strength, and the production facility must meet standards designed to assure product safety, purity and potency.
 
A reference biological product is granted 12 years of market exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the product, and the first approved interchangeable biologic product will be granted an exclusivity period of up to one year after it is first commercially marketed.
  As part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act for 2023, Congress amended the PHSA in order to permit multiple interchangeable products approved on the same day to receive and benefit from this one-year exclusivity period. 
  If pediatric studies are performed and accepted by the FDA as responsive to a Written Request, the 12-year exclusivity period will be extended for an additional six months. In addition, the FDA will not accept an application for a biosimilar or interchangeable product based on the reference biological product until four years after the date of first licensure of the reference product. “First licensure” typically means the initial date the particular product at issue was licensed in the United States. Date of first licensure does not include the date of licensure of (and a new period of exclusivity is not available for) a supplement for the reference product for a subsequent application filed by the same sponsor or manufacturer of the reference product (or licensor, predecessor in interest or other related entity) for a change that results in a new indication, route of administration, dosing schedule, dosage form, delivery system, delivery device or strength or for a modification to the structure of the biological product that does not result in a change in safety, purity or potency. Therefore, one must determine whether a new product includes a modification to the structure of a previously licensed product that results in a change in safety, purity or potency to assess whether the licensure of the new product is a first licensure that triggers its own period of exclusivity. Whether a subsequent application, if approved, warrants exclusivity as the “first licensure” of a biological product is determined on a case-by-case basis with data submitted by the sponsor.
 
The BPCIA is complex and is still being interpreted and implemented by the FDA and by federal judges. In addition, recent government proposals have sought to reduce the 12-year reference product exclusivity period. Other aspects of the BPCIA, some of which may impact the BPCIA exclusivity provisions, have also been the subject of recent litigation. As a result, the ultimate impact, implementation and meaning of the BPCIA continues to be subject to uncertainty.

Orphan drug designation and exclusivity
 
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the United States a drug for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA or BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication, except in very limited circumstances, for seven years. Orphan drug exclusivity, however, also could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same drug as defined by the FDA for treatment of the same indication. Recent court cases have challenged FDA’s approach to determining the scope of orphan drug exclusivity; however, at this time the agency continues to apply its long-standing interpretation of the governing regulations and has stated that it does not plan to change any orphan drug implementing regulations.
 
Post-approval requirements
 
Following approval of a new product, the manufacturer and the approved product are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, monitoring and recordkeeping activities, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, product sampling and distribution restrictions, complying with promotion and advertising requirements, which include restrictions on promoting drugs for unapproved uses or patient populations (i.e., “off-label use”) and limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities. Although physicians may prescribe legally available products for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such uses. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability. If there are any modifications to the product, including changes in indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, the applicant may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new NDA/BLA or an NDA/BLA supplement, which may require the applicant to develop additional data or conduct additional nonclinical studies and clinical trials. The FDA may also place other conditions on approvals including the requirement for a REMS to assure the safe use of the product. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. Any of these limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the commercial promotion, distribution, prescription or dispensing of products. Product approvals may be withdrawn for non-compliance with regulatory standards or if problems occur following initial marketing.
 
FDA regulations require that products be manufactured in specific approved facilities and in accordance with cGMPs. The cGMP regulations include requirements relating to organization of personnel, buildings and facilities, equipment, control of components and drug product containers and closures, production and process controls, packaging and labeling controls, holding and distribution, laboratory controls, records and reports and returned or salvaged products. The manufacturing facilities for our product candidates must meet cGMP requirements and satisfy the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities’ satisfaction before any product is approved and our commercial products can be manufactured. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our products in accordance with cGMP regulations. These manufacturers must comply with cGMP regulations that require, among other things, quality control and quality assurance, the maintenance of records and documentation and the obligation to investigate and correct any deviations from cGMP. Manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs or biologics are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. Future inspections by the FDA and other regulatory agencies may identify compliance issues at the facilities of our CMOs that may disrupt production or distribution or require substantial resources to correct. In addition, the discovery of conditions that violate these rules, including failure to conform to cGMPs, could result in enforcement actions, and the discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved NDA or BLA, including voluntary recall and regulatory sanctions as described below.
     37 

  

Once an approval of a drug is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in mandatory revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information, imposition of post-market surveillance studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks, or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
 

• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | fines, warning letters or other enforcement-related letters or clinical holds on post-approval clinical trials;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs/BLAs or supplements to approved NDAs/BLAs, or suspension or revocation of product approvals;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


• • | consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment or exclusion from federal health care programs; and/or mandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and the issuance of corrective information.
----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, which regulates the distribution of drugs and drug samples at the federal level, and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of drug distributors by the states. Both the PDMA and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution. More recently, the Drug Supply Chain Security Act, or DSCSA, was enacted with the aim of building an electronic system to identify and trace certain prescription drugs distributed in the United States, including most biological products. The DSCSA mandates phased-in and resource-intensive obligations for pharmaceutical manufacturers, wholesale distributors and dispensers over a 10‑year period that is expected to culminate in November 2023. From time to time, new legislation and regulations may be implemented that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the approval, manufacturing and marketing of products regulated by the FDA.
 
 For example, FDA released proposed regulations in February 2022 to amend the national standards for licensing of wholesale drug distributors by the states; establish new minimum standards for state licensing third-party logistics providers; and create a federal system for licensure for use in the absence of a state program, each of which is mandated by the DSCSA. 
  It is impossible to predict whether further legislative or regulatory changes will be enacted, or FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations changed or what the impact of such changes, if any, may be.
 
Regulation outside of the United States
 
In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our products outside of the United States. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product candidate, we must obtain approval from the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries or economic areas, such as the 27-member European Union, before we may commence clinical trials or market products in those countries or areas. With the United Kingdom withdrawal from the European Union on January 31, 2020, UK licensing decisions were transferred from EMA to The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, or MHRA, the UK Regulatory Body. For a period of two years following January 1, 2021, the UK continued to adopt decisions taken by the European Commission on the approval of new marketing authorizations. However, companies will be required to submit an identical application to the MHRA upon the Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, positive opinion of the application. The MHRA will then wait for the European Commission decision on approval. The approval process and requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly between countries and jurisdictions and can involve additional testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries and jurisdictions might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction may negatively impact the regulatory process in others.
 
European Union drug development, review and approval
 
In the European Union, our product candidates also may be subject to extensive regulatory requirements. As in the United States, medicinal products can be marketed only if marketing authorization from the competent regulatory agencies has been obtained. Similar to the United States, the various phases of pre-clinical and clinical research in the European Union are subject to significant regulatory controls.
 
The Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC, the Directive 2005/28/EC on GCP, and the related national implementing provisions of the individual EU Member States previously governed the system for the approval of clinical trials in the European Union. Under this system, an applicant had to obtain prior approval from the competent national authority of the EU Member States in which the clinical trial is to be conducted. Furthermore, the applicant could only start a clinical trial at a specific study site after the competent ethics committee has issued a favorable opinion.
     38 

  

In 2014, the new Clinical Trials Regulation, (EU) No 536/2014, Clinical Trials Regulation, was adopted and it became effective on January 31, 2022. The Clinical Trials Regulation is directly applicable in all of the EU Member States, as it repealed the Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC. The extent to which ongoing clinical trials will be governed by the Clinical Trials Regulation depends on when the Clinical Trials Regulation became applicable and on the duration of the individual clinical trial. If a clinical trial continues for more than three years from the day on which the Clinical Trials Regulation became applicable, the Clinical Trials Regulation will at that time begin to apply to the clinical trial.
 
The Clinical Trials Regulation aims to simplify and streamline the approval of clinical trials in the European Union. The main characteristics of the regulation include: a streamlined application procedure via a single entry point, the “EU portal” or Clinical Trial Information System, or CTIS; a single set of documents to be prepared and submitted for the application as well as simplified reporting procedures for clinical trial sponsors; and a harmonized procedure for the assessment of applications for clinical trials, which is divided in two parts. Part I is assessed by the competent authorities of all EU Member States in which an application for authorization of a clinical trial has been submitted (Member States concerned). Part II is assessed separately by each Member State concerned. Strict deadlines have been established for the assessment of clinical trial applications. The role of the relevant ethics committees in the assessment procedure will continue to be governed by the national law of the concerned EU Member State. However, overall related timelines will be defined by the Clinical Trials Regulation. Use of the CTIS became mandatory for new clinical trial application submissions as of February 1, 2023.
 
To obtain a marketing authorization of a drug in the European Union, we may submit marketing authorization applications, or MAA, either under the so-called centralized or national authorization procedures.
 
Centralized procedure
 
The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization following a favorable opinion by the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, that is valid in all EU member states, as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. The centralized procedure is compulsory for medicines produced by specified biotechnological processes, products designated as orphan medicinal products, advanced-therapy medicines (such as gene-therapy, somatic cell-therapy or tissue-engineered medicines) and products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of specified diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative disorders or autoimmune diseases and other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases. The centralized procedure is optional for products that represent a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation, or whose authorization would be in the interest of public health. Under the centralized procedure the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA by the EMA is 210 days, excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or the CHMP. Accelerated assessment might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is expected to be of a major public health interest, particularly from the point of view of therapeutic innovation. The timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA under the accelerated assessment procedure is of 150 days, excluding stop-clocks.
 
National authorization procedures
 
There are also two other possible routes to authorize medicinal products in several EU countries, which are available for investigational medicinal products that fall outside the scope of the centralized procedure:
 

• | Decentralized procedure. Using the decentralized procedure, an applicant may apply for simultaneous authorization in more than one EU country of medicinal products that have not yet been authorized in any EU country and that do not fall within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Mutual recognition procedure. In the mutual recognition procedure, a medicine is first authorized in one EU Member State, in accordance with the national procedures of that country. Following this, further marketing authorizations can be sought from other EU countries in a procedure whereby the countries concerned agree to recognize the validity of the original, national marketing authorization.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Under the above-described procedures, before granting the marketing authorization, the EMA or the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA make an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy.
     39 

  

Conditional approval
 
In specific circumstances, E.U. legislation (Article 14(7) Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 and Regulation (EC) No 507/2006 on Conditional Marketing Authorizations for Medicinal Products for Human Use) enables applicants to obtain a conditional marketing authorization prior to obtaining the comprehensive clinical data required for an application for a full marketing authorization. Such conditional approvals may be granted for product candidates (including medicines designated as orphan medicinal products) if (1) the risk-benefit balance of the product candidate is positive, (2) it is likely that the applicant will be in a position to provide the required comprehensive clinical trial data, (3) the product fulfills unmet medical needs and (4) the benefit to public health of the immediate availability on the market of the medicinal product concerned outweighs the risk inherent in the fact that additional data are still required. A conditional marketing authorization may contain specific obligations to be fulfilled by the marketing authorization holder, including obligations with respect to the completion of ongoing or new studies, and with respect to the collection of pharmacovigilance data. Conditional marketing authorizations are valid for one year, and may be renewed annually, if the risk-benefit balance remains positive, and after an assessment of the need for additional or modified conditions or specific obligations. The timelines for the centralized procedure described above also apply with respect to the review by the CHMP of applications for a conditional marketing authorization.
 
Pediatric studies
 
Prior to obtaining a marketing authorization in the European Union, applicants have to demonstrate compliance with all measures included in an EMA-approved Pediatric Investigation Plan, or PIP, covering all subsets of the pediatric population, unless the EMA has granted a product-specific waiver, a class waiver, or a deferral for one or more of the measures included in the PIP. The respective requirements for all marketing authorization procedures are set forth in Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, which is referred to as the Pediatric Regulation. This requirement also applies when a company wants to add a new indication, pharmaceutical form or route of administration for a medicine that is already authorized. The Pediatric Committee of the EMA, or PDCO, may grant deferrals for some medicines, allowing a company to delay development of the medicine in children until there is enough information to demonstrate its effectiveness and safety in adults. The PDCO may also grant waivers when development of a medicine in children is not needed or is not appropriate, such as for diseases that only affect the elderly population.
 
Before a marketing authorization application can be filed, or an existing marketing authorization can be amended, the EMA determines that companies actually comply with the agreed studies and measures listed in each relevant PIP.
 
European Union regulatory exclusivity
 
In the European Union, new products authorized for marketing (i.e., reference products) qualify for eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity upon marketing authorization. The data exclusivity period prevents generic or biosimilar applicants from relying on the pre-clinical and clinical trial data contained in the dossier of the reference product when applying for a generic or biosimilar marketing authorization in the European Union during a period of eight years from the date on which the reference product was first authorized in the European Union. The market exclusivity period prevents a successful generic or biosimilar applicant from commercializing its product in the EU until ten years have elapsed from the initial authorization of the reference product in the EU. The ten-year market exclusivity period can be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies.
 
European Union orphan designation and exclusivity
 
The criteria for designating an orphan medicinal product in the European Union, are similar in principle to those in the United States. Under Article 3 of Regulation (EC) 141/2000, a medicinal product may be designated as orphan if (1) it is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition; (2) either (a) such condition affects no more than five in 10,000 persons in the European Union when the application is made, or (b) the product, without the benefits derived from orphan status, would not generate sufficient return in the European Union to justify investment; and (3) there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of such condition authorized for marketing in the European Union, or if such a method exists, the product will be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition, as defined in Regulation (EC) 847/2000. Orphan medicinal products are eligible for financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and are, upon grant of a marketing authorization, entitled to ten years of market exclusivity for the approved therapeutic indication. The application for orphan designation must be submitted before the application for marketing authorization. The applicant will receive a fee reduction for the marketing authorization application if the orphan designation has been granted, but not if the designation is still pending at the time the marketing authorization is submitted. Orphan designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.
     40 

  

The ten-year market exclusivity in the European Union may be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the product no longer meets the criteria for orphan designation, for example, if the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. Additionally, marketing authorization may be granted to a similar product for the same indication at any time if:
 

• | the second applicant can establish that its product, although similar, is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the applicant consents to a second orphan medicinal product application; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the applicant cannot supply enough orphan medicinal product.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------

 
PRIME designation
 
The EMA grants access to the Priority Medicines, or PRIME, program to investigational medicines for which it determines there to be preliminary data available showing the potential to address an unmet medical need and bring a major therapeutic advantage to patients. As part of the program, the EMA provides early and enhanced dialogue and support to optimize the development of eligible medicines and speed up their evaluation, aiming to bring promising treatments to patients sooner. 
 
Periods of authorization and renewals
 
A marketing authorization is valid for five years in principle and the marketing authorization may be renewed after five years on the basis of a re-evaluation of the risk-benefit balance by the EMA or by the competent authority of the authorizing member state. To this end, the marketing authorization holder must provide the EMA or the competent authority with a consolidated version of the file in respect of quality, safety and efficacy, including all variations introduced since the marketing authorization was granted, at least six months before the marketing authorization ceases to be valid. Once renewed, the marketing authorization is valid for an unlimited period, unless the European Commission or the competent authority decides, on justified grounds relating to pharmacovigilance, to proceed with one additional five-year renewal. Any authorization which is not followed by the actual placing of the drug on the E.U. market (in case of centralized procedure) or on the market of the authorizing member state within three years after authorization ceases to be valid (the so-called sunset clause).
 
Rest of the world regulation
 
For other countries outside of the European Union and the United States, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Additionally, the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with cGCP requirements and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
 
If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
 
Coverage, pricing and reimbursement
 
Sales of pharmaceutical products approved by the FDA will depend in significant part on the availability of third-party coverage and reimbursement for the products. Third-party payors include government healthcare programs in the United States such as Medicare and Medicaid, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. These third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services. In addition, significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved healthcare products. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the approved products for a particular indication. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our products, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA or other comparable regulatory approvals. Moreover, a payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Third-party reimbursement may not be sufficient to maintain price levels high enough to realize an appropriate return on investment in product development. Our product candidates may not be considered cost-effective. It is time consuming and expensive to seek reimbursement from third-party payors. Reimbursement may not be available or sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a competitive and profitable basis.
     41 

  

In addition, in some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that drug products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of our product candidate to currently available therapies (so-called health technology assessment, or HTA) in order to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for drug products but monitor and control prescription volumes and issue guidance to physicians to limit prescriptions. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products. Historically, products launched in the European Union do not follow price structures of the United States and generally tend to by significantly lower.
 
The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, there can be considerable pressure by governments and other stakeholders on prices and reimbursement levels, including as part of cost containment measures. Political, economic and regulatory developments may further complicate pricing negotiations, and pricing negotiations may continue after reimbursement has been obtained. Reference pricing used by various EU member states and parallel distribution (arbitrage between low-priced and high-priced member states) can further reduce prices. Any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for drug products may not allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements.
 
 In the United States, President Biden signed into the law the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) in August 2022. Among other things, the IRA has multiple provisions that may impact the prices of drug products that are both sold into the Medicare program and throughout the U.S. Starting in 2023, a manufacturer of drugs or biological products covered by Medicare Parts B or D must pay a rebate to the federal government if their drug product’s price increases faster than the rate of inflation. This calculation is made on a drug product by drug product basis and the amount of the rebate owed to the federal government is directly dependent on the volume of a drug product that is paid for by Medicare Parts B or D. Additionally, starting for payment year 2026, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) will negotiate drug prices annually for a select number of single source Part D drugs without generic or biosimilar competition. CMS will also negotiate drug prices for a select number of Part B drugs starting for payment year 2028. If a drug product is selected by CMS for negotiation, it is expected that the revenue generated from such drug will decrease. CMS has begun to implement these new authorities but their impact on the biopharmaceutical industry in the United States remains uncertain. 
 
Other U.S. health care laws and regulations
 
If our product candidates are approved in the United States, we will have to comply with various U.S. federal and state laws, rules and regulations pertaining to health care fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback laws and physician self-referral laws, rules and regulations. Violations of the fraud and abuse laws are punishable by criminal and civil sanctions, including, in some instances, exclusion from participation in federal and state health care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. These laws include:
 

• | the federal anti-kickback statute prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal health care program such as Medicare and Medicaid;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal False Claims Act imposes civil penalties, and provides for civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities for knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, imposes criminal and civil liability for executing a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program or making false statements relating to health care matters;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH Act, and its implementing regulations, also imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal transparency requirements under the Physician Payments Sunshine Act require manufacturers of FDA-approved drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies covered by Medicare, Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program to report, on an annual basis, to CMS, information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians, teaching hospitals, and certain advanced non-physician health care practitioners and physician ownership and investment interests; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving health care items or services reimbursed by nongovernmental third-party payors, including private insurers.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines, or the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, in addition to requiring drug manufacturers to report information related to payments to physicians and other health care providers or marketing expenditures to the extent that those laws impose requirements that are more stringent than the Physician Payments Sunshine Act. State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.

Health care reform in the United States and potential changes to health care laws
 
The FDA’s and other regulatory authorities’ policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent, limit or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates. If we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may lose any marketing approval that we otherwise may have obtained and we may not achieve or sustain profitability, which would adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.
 
As previously mentioned, a primary trend in the U.S. health care industry and elsewhere is cost containment. Government authorities and other third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medical products and services, implementing reductions in Medicare and other health care funding and applying new payment methodologies. For example, in March 2010, the Affordable Care Act was enacted, which, among other things, increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by most manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program; introduced a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected; extended the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to utilization of prescriptions of individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care plans; imposed mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries as a condition for manufacturers’ outpatient drugs coverage under Medicare Part D; and established a Center for Medicare Innovation at the CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending.
  In addition to the IRA’s drug price negotiation provisions summarized above, President Biden’s Executive Order 14087, issued in October 2022, called for the CMS innovation center to prepare and submit a report to the White House on potential payment and delivery modes that would complement to IRA, lower drug costs, and promote access to innovative drugs. As of mid-January 2023 the report had not been released but it is expected to further inform the current Administration’s priorities and activities in this area. 
 

We expect that future changes or additions to the Affordable Care Act, the Medicare and Medicaid programs, and changes stemming from other health care reform measures, especially with regard to health care access, financing or other legislation in individual states, could have a material adverse effect on the health care industry in the United States.
 
There also has been heightened governmental scrutiny in recent years over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for pharmaceutical and biologic products. For example, the 2021 Consolidated Appropriations Act signed into law on December 27, 2020 incorporated extensive health care provisions and amendments to existing laws, including a requirement that all manufacturers of drug products covered under Medicare Part B report the product’s average sales price to CMS beginning on January 1, 2022, subject to enforcement via civil money penalties.

At the state level, legislatures are increasingly passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. In December 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court held unanimously that federal law does not preempt the states’ ability to regulate pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs, and other members of the health care and pharmaceutical supply chain, an important decision that appears to be leading to further and more aggressive efforts by states in this area.
  In mid-2022, the Federal Trade Commission also launched sweeping investigations into the practices of the PBM industry that could lead to additional federal and state legislative or regulatory proposals targeting such entities’ operations, pharmacy networks, or financial arrangements. Significant efforts to change the PBM industry as it currently exists in the U.S. may affect the entire pharmaceutical supply chain and the business of other stakeholders, including biopharmaceutical developers like us. 
 
We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative or executive action, either in the United States or abroad. We expect that additional state and federal health care reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for health care products and services.
 
Corporate Information
 
On December 17, 2014, Pieris, Pieris GmbH and the former stockholders of Pieris GmbH entered into an acquisition agreement, or the Acquisition Agreement. Pursuant to the Acquisition Agreement, the stockholders of Pieris GmbH contributed all of their equity interests in Pieris GmbH to Pieris in exchange for shares of Pieris common stock, which resulted in Pieris GmbH becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of Pieris, which we refer to as the Acquisition.
 
Upon the closing of the Acquisition on December 17, 2014, Pieris ceased to be a “shell company” under applicable rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC. As of December 31, 2019, we no longer qualify as an “emerging growth company” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, as amended, or the JOBS Act. As such, we are no longer eligible to take advantage of certain reduced disclosure and other requirements that are otherwise applicable to public companies, including without limitation, (i) providing an auditor’s attestation report on our system of internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and (ii) complying with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor’s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements, known as the auditor discussion and analysis.
 
Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act establishes a class of company called a “smaller reporting company,” which effective September 10, 2018, was amended to include companies with a public float of less than $250 million as of the last business day of their most recently completed second fiscal quarter or, if such public float is less than $700 million, had annual revenues of less than $100 million during the most recently completed fiscal year for which audited financial statements are available. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we qualify as a smaller reporting company.
 
As a smaller reporting company, we are eligible to and have taken advantage of certain extended accounting standards and exemptions from various reporting requirements that are not available to public reporting companies that do not qualify for those classifications. These exemptions include, but are not limited to, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic and annual reports, exemption from the requirement to provide a compensation discussion and analysis describing compensation practices and procedures, and reduced financial statement disclosure in our registration statements, which must include two years of audited financial statements rather than the three years of audited financial statements that are required for other public reporting companies. Smaller reporting companies are also eligible to provide such reduced financial statement disclosure in annual reports on Form 10-K.
 
For as long as we continue to be a smaller reporting company, we expect that we will take advantage of the reduced disclosure obligations available to us as a result of this classification. We will remain a smaller reporting company until we have a public float of $250 million or more as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, and we could retain our smaller reporting company status indefinitely depending on the size of our public float.
 
Employees
 
We consider our relationship with our employees to be good. In order to successfully develop our drug candidates, we must be able to attract and retain highly skilled personnel. We anticipate hiring additional employees for research and development, clinical and regulatory affairs, and general and administrative activities over the next few years.
Headcount Data
 
As of December 31, 2022, we had 127 full-time employees and 17 permanent part-time employees. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. Our corporate headquarters is located in Boston, MA and our R&D facility is located in Hallbergmoos, Germany. As such, 20, or 13.9%, of our employees were located in the United States and 124, or 86.1%, of our employees were located in Germany. We also utilize the services of consultants, clinical research organizations and other third parties on a regular basis from locations across the world.
