ITEM 1.         BUSINESS



We are workers’ compensation cost containment specialists providing a range of services principally to California employers and claims administrators. The Company was incorporated under the laws of the state of Utah in April 1970, under the name Clear Air, Inc. The Company changed its name to Pacific Health Care Organization, Inc., in January 2001. In February 2001, the Company acquired Medex in a share for share exchange. Medex is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. Medex is in the business of managing and administering both Health Care Organizations (“HCOs”) and Medical Provider Networks (“MPNs”) in the state of California. Medex also offers Workers’ Compensation carve-out services, Medicare set-asides and expert witness testimony. In February 2012, we incorporated MMM in the state of Nevada, as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. MMM is responsible for overseeing and managing medical case management services. In March 2011, we incorporated MMC in the state of Nevada, as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. MMC oversees and manages the Company’s utilization review, medical bill review services, and lien representation services. Following is our corporate structure as of December 31, 2022.







Business of the Company



We offer an integrated and layered array of complimentary business solutions that enable our customers to better manage their employee workers’ compensation-related healthcare administration costs. We are constantly looking for ways to expand the suite of services we can provide our customers, either through strategic acquisitions or organic development.



Our business objective is to deliver value to our customers by reducing their workers’ compensation-related medical claims expense in a manner that will assure that injured employees receive high quality healthcare that allows them to recover from injury and return to gainful employment without undue delay. According to studies conducted by auditing bodies on behalf of the California Division of Workers’ Compensation, (“DWC”) the two most significant cost drivers for workers’ compensation are claims frequency and longer than average treatment duration. Our services focus on ensuring timely medical treatment to reduce the claim duration and medical treatment costs.



Our services include providing customers access to our HCOs and MPNs. We also provide medical case management, medical bill review, utilization review, workers’ compensation carve-outs and Medicare set-aside services. Complementary to these services, we also provide lien representation and expert witness testimony. We offer our services as a bundled solution, as standalone services, or as add-on services.



Our core services focus on reducing medical treatment costs by enabling our customers to have control and oversight of the medical treatment of their injured employees to ensure treatment is timely and appropriate. This control is primarily obtained by participation in one of our medical provider networks. We hold several government-issued licenses to operate medical provider networks. Through Medex, we hold two of the total of four licenses issued by the state of California to establish and manage HCOs within the state of California. We also hold approvals issued by the state of California to act as an MPN and currently administer 27 MPNs. Our HCO and MPN programs provide our customers with provider networks within which the customer has some ability to direct the administration of the claim. This is designed to decrease the incidence of fraudulent claims and disability awards and ensure injured employees receive the necessary back-to-work rehabilitation and training they need. Our medical bill and utilization review services provide oversight of medical billing and treatment requests, and our medical case management keeps workers’ compensation claims progressing to a resolution and assures treatment plans are aligned from a medical perspective.

Our customers include self-administered employers, insurers, third party administrators, municipalities, and others. Our principal customers are companies with operations located in the state of California where the cost of workers’ compensation insurance is a critical problem for employers, though we process medical bill reviews, utilization reviews and provide medical case management in several other states. Our provider networks, which are located only in California, are composed of providers experienced in treating worker injuries.



Our business generally has a long sales cycle, typically eight months or more. Once we have established a customer relationship and enrolled employees of our employer customers, we anticipate our revenue to adjust with the growth or retraction of our customers’ employee headcount. Throughout the year, we also expect to add new customers while others terminate for a variety of reasons. The reasons for termination vary but include when a customer switches to an insurance carrier or third party administrator that uses a different Workers’ Compensation administration vendor, or when our contract ends with state and local governments.



Health Care Organizations



An HCO is a network of health care providers specializing in the treatment of workplace injuries and in back-to-work rehabilitation for our customers’ injured employees. HCOs provide injured employees with a network of health care providers in the event of a workers’ compensation injury, while providing their employer (our customer) control over medical treatment and costs. In most cases, our HCOs give the employer up to 180 days of medical control in an HCO within which the employer can direct the administration of the claim. The injured employee may change providers once during this period but may not go to an out-of-network provider. The increased length of time during which the employer has control over administration of the claim is designed to decrease the incidence of fraudulent claims and disability awards. The right for the employer to control treatment within a network is based upon the notion that if the employer has the ability to direct care, it will facilitate timely and appropriate medical care and reduce the total cost of the claim.



Our two HCO licenses (respectively referred to as “Medex HCO” and “Medex 2 HCO”) allow us to provide comprehensive medical provider networks throughout California. Our HCO networks are composed of medical providers experienced in treating worker injuries. We have contracted with approximately 5,500 and 6,700 individual medical providers and clinics for Medex HCO and Medex 2 HCO, respectively, as well as hospitals, and rehabilitation centers. Our customers select one of the Medex HCO networks to enroll their employees in based on the medical groups in the network. During initial enrollment and during the period of re-enrollment, our customers’ employees have the option to opt-out of the HCO by predesignating their primary care physician to manage a workplace injury. If the employee opted out and is later injured on the job, their primary care physician would be authorized to oversee their medical care. Otherwise, the employer would be able to select the provider to oversee their medical care.



We continually review and update our networks with provider additions and removals based on feedback from internal operations, our customers and their claims administrators. All our network providers’ credentials are reviewed and vetted by Medex.



Our HCO networks are required to be recertified every three years. The Medex HCO has been recertified through March 15, 2025 and the Medex 2 HCO through October 9, 2024. HCO guidelines impose certain medical oversight, reporting, information delivery and usage fees on HCOs. These requirements increase the administrative costs and obligations on HCOs compared to MPNs, although the obligations and cost differentials between the two types of organizations have been narrowing over the past few years.



Medical Provider Networks



Like an HCO, an MPN is a network of health care providers, but health care providers participating in MPNs are not required to have the same level of medical expertise in treating workplace injuries. Under an MPN program the employer dictates which provider the injured employee will see for the initial visit. After the initial visit the employee has discretion to choose which provider in the network will continue treatment of the claim. However, the employee’s choice of provider is limited to those within the MPN for the life of the claim and the employee cannot opt-out of the MPN, which is a benefit to our customers. While the injured employee is limited to treatment by providers within the MPN, the California MPN laws and regulations allow the injured employee to dispute treatment decisions, provide for second and third medical opinions, and then permit case review by an independent medical reviewer whose decision can result in the employer losing control over medical treatment of the employee.

Unlike our HCOs, our MPNs do not require our customers to pay annual enrollment fees, nor do they require our customers to comply with annual enrollment notice delivery requirements. As a result, there are fewer administrative costs to customers associated with an MPN program. This allows our MPNs to market their services at a lower cost to employers than our HCOs. For this reason, many customers may opt to use the MPN even though it provides customers fewer rights to control medical treatment of employee injury claims.



We have received approval for and currently administer 27 MPNs. Customers can choose between two of our off-the-shelf MPNs, which serve as stand-alone networks or the foundation for the customer to customize their own MPN, in which they can add or remove specific providers or clinics. Each MPN must be reapproved every four years for each customer based on the date the MPN was approved by the California Division of Workers’ Compensation.



HCO and MPN Hybrid Offering



As a licensed HCO and approved MPN, in addition to offering HCO and MPN programs, we are also able to offer our customers a combination of the HCO and MPN programs. Under this program, a customer can enroll its employees in our HCO program, and then prior to the expiration of the 180-day treatment period under the HCO program, the customer (the employer) can then enroll their injured employees into our MPN program to keep the medical care within their network of providers. This allows our customers to take advantage of both programs, which is what our HCO customers typically do. To our knowledge, Medex is currently the only entity in California offering this hybrid program.



Medical Case Management



Medical case management oversees the injured employees’ medical treatment to ensure that it progresses to a resolution and assures treatment plans are aligned from a medical perspective. Medical case management is a collaborative process that assesses, evaluates, coordinates, implements and monitors medical treatment plans and the options and services required to get the injured employee back to work. Medical case managers act as liaisons between the injured employee, claims adjuster, medical providers, and attorneys to achieve optimal results for the injured employee and their employer.



Our medical case management services are performed by nurses who are credentialed by the state and have expertise in various clinical areas and backgrounds in workers’ compensation matters. This combination allows our nurses the opportunity to facilitate medical treatment while understanding the nuances of workers’ compensation up to and including litigation. By utilizing these services our customers can ensure that the injured employee receives quality medical treatment in a timely and appropriate manner to help the employee return to work and close the workers’ compensation claim.



Medical Bill Review



Medical bills are one of the biggest expenses that an employer’s workers’ compensation insurance company must pay for. To curtail these expenses, our customers utilize our medical bill review services to review medical bills for services rendered to an injured employee. We provide professional analysis of medical provider services and equipment billing to ascertain proper reimbursement. Our review of medical bills includes coding review and re-bundling, confirming that the services are customary and reasonable, fee schedule compliance, out-of-network bill review, pharmacy review, and preferred provider organization repricing arrangements. While some states have adopted fee schedules, which regulate the maximum allowable fees payable under workers’ compensation for procedures performed by a variety of health treatment providers, many procedures are not covered by fee schedules and are still subject to review and negotiation.



Medical bill review services can result in significant claims savings. Our medical bill services are primarily within the state of California, but we process medical bill review in several other states. Out of state medical bill reviews typically are the result of an injured California employee moving to a different state, but who still requires medical care under an open workers’ compensation claim.



Utilization Review



Utilization review is required by law in all states for workers’ compensation claims. Utilization review evaluates the medical necessity of proposed treatment by comparing medical treatment requests against accepted medical guidelines. Its purpose is to serve as a safeguard against payor liability for medical costs that are not medically appropriate or approved by the relevant medical and legal authorities. Reviews of medical treatment requests are conducted at the appropriate qualification level for the request by a nurse, peer-to-peer provider, a specialist or a medical director and within the timelines set by the relevant laws and regulations.

Our utilization review services provide an electronic intake of medical treatment requests, collection and review of the submitted documentation required for processing, and submission to the appropriately qualified reviewer for approval, modification, denial, or request for more information for the requested treatment. Once a determination is made, we process the request and notify all the stakeholders in the injured employee’s claim within the regulated timeframe.



Medicare Set-aside



Medicare set-aside services for workers’ compensation claims is a financial agreement that allocates a portion of a workers’ compensation settlement to pay for future medical services related to the work-place injury, illness, or disease. The purpose of the set-aside arrangement is to provide funds to the injured party to pay for future medical expenses that would not be covered by Medicare. This program affords our customers an effective way to overcome complications after settlement and avoids unnecessary costs attached to the claim.
Workers’ Compensation Carve-outs



Certain employers can opt out of the standard workers’ compensation regulatory dispute resolution scheme through carve-out agreements that comply with state statutory and regulatory requirements. More specifically, carve-out agreements permit employers and employees to establish alternative dispute resolution arrangements to resolve disputes in the context of workers’ compensation. These carve-out agreements are made between employers and the collective bargaining units representing the employer’s covered employees.



Utilizing our knowledge of the friction in the California workers’ compensation system, and the objectives of employers and the unions, we assist in guiding the negotiation of legal agreements for the implementation of workers’ compensation carve-outs for California customers and provide services that reflect the parties’ agreement with regard to alternative dispute resolution arrangements. Under such carve-out agreements certain customers can access our HCOs, MPNs and medical case management program.



Lien Representation



When a worker is injured in the scope of employment the employer is required to provide workers’ compensation benefits, including medical treatment. If the medical treatment is not paid because the services were not authorized, or if the provider disputes the amount of reimbursement, the provider may file a lien against the workers’ compensation claim, which must be resolved by the employer. In these cases, we provide our customers lien representation services that include negotiation through litigation and petitions for reconsideration.
Expert Witness Testimony



As an ancillary service to our HCO and MPN services, we provide expert witness testimony before the California Workers Compensation Appeals Board. The fees we charge for this service include reimbursement of expert witness fees and travel and lodging expenses for all HCO customers except for one, whose fees are included in their monthly global fee.
Marketing, Customers and Pricing



We provide services to virtually any size employer in the state of California as well as insurers, third party administrators, self-administered employers, municipalities, and other industries. We also provide some customers utilization review and/or utilization management, medical case management, and medical bill review services outside the state of California, typically to employees who have suffered a workplace injury in California and then relocated to another state.



Our marketing and sales efforts focus primarily on customer referrals, conference presentations and responding to requests for proposals. We service both local and national accounts, however, with an emphasis on California focused markets. Our sales and marketing activities are conducted by account managers with the assistance of our executive team members. We do not market our services outside the state of California.



During fiscal 2022, three major customers accounted for 44% of sales, approximately 24%, 10%, and 10%, respectively. By comparison, during fiscal 2021 our three largest customers accounted for 43% of sales, approximately 24%, 11%, and 8%, respectively.

Our services can be integrated to allow for partial or full bundling of services and sharing of information that create efficiencies to further reduce the costs of claims. For example, our bundled services have allowed some customers to achieve up to a 70% reduction in the cost of injury claim resolution while maintaining superior treatment for their injured employees. The cost to our customers for our bundled services is generally the same as if the services were purchased individually.



Competition



We were one of the first commercial enterprises capable of offering HCO services and MPN services in California. Now there are many companies who compete in this market. Many of these competitors are larger than us and may have greater financial, research and marketing experience and resources than we do, and they may therefore represent substantial long-term competition. As of December 31, 2022, in California there were four certified health care organization licenses issued to three companies. We own two of the four licenses; the other two licenses are divided between two other companies. While we are aware of only one of the HCOs being active, we consider our current, direct HCO competition limited to these two licensee businesses. On the other hand, there are minimal requirements for establishing MPNs and therefore, as of December 31, 2022, there were approximately 2,486 active MPNs in the state of California according to the DWC MPN website. Of these, we have received approval for and administer 27 MPNs.



We compete on both quality and price of services. We maintain quality of service by virtue of the training, skill, and experience of our professional staff and outside consultants. We compete on price through our integration of robust information technology systems we license from various vendors. We focus our business primarily on those employers and payors who use our HCO and/or MPN services. We anticipate that this focus will keep most of this business stable and renewable. However, periodically we expect that large customers may establish the in-house capability of performing the services we offer, as this has occurred in the past. Further, if we are unable to compete effectively either because of a degradation in quality-of-service delivery resulting from, for example, a reduction in the skill and experience of our personnel or our inability to effectively manage our information technology systems, it may be difficult for us to retain current customers or add new customers. A loss of customers, from whatever source, could be materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.



We rely on our well-trained and knowledgeable in-house professionals to develop service offerings that target the needs of our customers, all of whom seek efficient and effective resolution of workplace injuries and workers’ compensation claims. For example, we contract directly with medical providers based on quality determinations rather than the provision of discounted medical services. We believe this provides us a competitive advantage because we can market a direct relationship with providers who have demonstrated expertise in treating work related injuries and writing credible medical reports. These qualities contribute to quicker resolution of workplace injuries and workers’ compensation claims. We believe these qualities also provide more competitive value than relying on third party relationships or discounts alone.



We offer both HCO and MPN programs to potential customers, as well as an HCO/MPN combination model, which we believe also gives us a competitive advantage, because of the way the network was created. While some of our competitors offer either HCO or MPN services, to our knowledge, none of our competitors offer this type of HCO/MPN combination model, nor, in our opinion, do they have the expertise to administer one.



Governmental Regulation



Managed care programs for workers’ compensation are subject to various laws and regulations. The nature and degree of applicable regulation varies by state and by the specific services provided. Notably, services such as our HCOs, MPNs, and utilization review services that provide or arrange for the provision of healthcare services are subject to numerous, complex regulatory requirements that govern many aspects of our conduct and operations. These laws and regulations impose evolving administrative and legal burdens, expense, and risks to our business, but also provide a regulated environment in which our expertise and experience help us provide valuable services for our customers based on proven strategies that work within the existing system.



The provision of workers’ compensation managed care in the state of California is governed by legislation and secondary regulations. We are required to be licensed or receive regulatory approval to operate our HCO and MPN networks. Medex has recertified the “Medex HCO” through March 15, 2025 and the “Medex 2 HCO” through October 9, 2024. Our MPN networks are required to be reapproved every four years based upon when the MPN went into effect for each customer.

MMC is required to be accredited by the independent, nonprofit accreditation entity, Utilization Review Accreditation Commission (“URAC”), in California to perform utilization review and is subject to a routine investigation by the state of California every five years. MMC has received full Utilization Management Accreditation for Workers’ Compensation as a Utilization Review Organization (“URO”) from URAC. The full accreditation requires us to have and follow specific policies and procedures for our utilization review services and demonstrates our commitment to quality and adherence to nationally recognized guidelines. Our URAC accreditation must be reaccredited every three years in order to conduct utilization review services in California. Our next reaccreditation is scheduled to occur by January 1, 2024. The costs to be accredited by URAC for Workers’ Compensation Utilization Management for three years is $36,000. URAC accreditation also allows us to provide utilization review services nationally as it is widely accepted as an alternative credential to state specific licenses and certificates.



The services we provide have developed largely in response to legislation or other governmental action. In many jurisdictions, such as California, licensing laws and regulations generally grant broad discretion to supervisory authorities to adopt and amend regulations and to supervise regulated activities. Changes in the legislation, or rules and regulations regulating workers’ compensation may create greater or lesser demand for the services we offer or require us to develop new or modified services to meet the needs of the marketplace and compete effectively. Such changes could also impact our costs for providing services, potentially to levels that make our services unattractive or unaffordable to existing or potential customers. We could also be materially and adversely affected if the state of California were to elect to reduce the extent of medical cost containment strategies available to insurance companies and other payors or adopt other strategies for cost containment that would not support demand for our services. In order to proactively address such possibilities, we have engaged a California-based lobbyist with expertise in workers’ compensation. When proposed legislation in California that might affect our business is identified, we are notified at the discussion stage and are often included as stakeholders for preliminary discussions. We are not currently aware of any such proposed legislation and do not anticipate any in the foreseeable future.



Healthcare reform remains a topic of considerable discussion at both the federal and state level. Due to uncertainties regarding the ultimate features of future reform initiatives and the timing of their enactment, we cannot predict which, if any, reforms will be adopted, when they may be adopted, or what impact they may have on our business or within the industry in which we participate. However, because workers’ compensation is primarily a disability program, not the focus of recent healthcare reform discussions, we do not anticipate that healthcare reform would significantly impact workers’ compensation.



Employees



Including the employees of our subsidiaries, as of March 31, 2023, we have a total of 31 full-time employees. We also use the services of several consultants. Over the next twelve months, we anticipate hiring additional employees only if business revenues increase and our operating requirements warrant such hiring.
