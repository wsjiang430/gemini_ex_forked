Overview
Richmond Mutual Bancorporation, Inc., a Maryland corporation, which is sometimes referred to in this document as “Richmond Mutual Bancorporation-Maryland,” was formed in February 2019 to serve as a new stock holding company for First Bank Richmond upon completion of the reorganization of First Bank Richmond from the mutual to stock holding company form of organization. The reorganization was completed on July 1, 2019. Prior to completion of the reorganization, First Bank Richmond was a wholly owned subsidiary of Richmond Mutual Bancorporation, Inc., a Delaware stock corporation, which is sometimes referred to in this document as “Richmond Mutual Bancorporation-Delaware,” and Richmond Mutual Bancorporation-Delaware was a wholly owned subsidiary of First Mutual of Richmond, Inc., a Delaware non-stock mutual holding company (the “MHC”). On July 1, 2019, upon the completion of the reorganization, Richmond Mutual Bancorporation-Delaware and the MHC ceased to exist, and First Bank Richmond became a wholly owned subsidiary of Richmond Mutual Bancorporation-Maryland. In certain circumstances, where appropriate, the terms “Richmond Mutual Bancorporation,” “the Company,” “we, “us” and “our” refer collectively to (i) Richmond Mutual Bancorporation-Delaware and First Bank Richmond with respect to discussions in this document involving matters occurring prior to completion of the reorganization and (ii) Richmond Mutual Bancorporation-Maryland and First Bank Richmond with respect to discussions in this document involving matters to occur post-reorganization, in each case unless the context indicates another meaning.
On February 6, 2019, the Board of Directors of the MHC, the parent mutual holding company of Richmond Mutual Bancorporation-Delaware, adopted a Plan of Reorganization and Stock Offering (the “Plan”). The Plan was approved by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve Board”) and by the Indiana Department of Financial Institutions (the “IDFI”), as well as the voting members of the MHC at a special meeting of members held on June 19, 2019. Pursuant to the Plan, upon completion of the transaction, the MHC would convert from a mutual holding company to the stock holding company corporate structure, the MHC and Richmond Mutual Bancorporation-Delaware would cease to exist, and First Bank Richmond would become a wholly owned subsidiary Richmond Mutual Bancorporation-Maryland. The transaction was completed on July 1, 2019. In connection with the related stock offering, which was also completed on July 1, 2019, Richmond Mutual Bancorporation-Maryland sold 13,026,625 shares of common stock at $10.00 per share, for gross offering proceeds of approximately $130.3 million in its subscription offering and contributed 500,000 shares and $1.25 million to a newly formed charitable foundation, the First Bank Richmond, Inc. Community Foundation (the “Foundation”).
Richmond Mutual Bancorporation-Maryland is regulated by the Federal Reserve Board. Our corporate office is located at 31 North 9th Street, Richmond, Indiana, and our telephone number is (765) 962-2581.
First Bank Richmond is an Indiana state-chartered commercial bank headquartered in Richmond, Indiana. The bank was originally established in 1887 as an Indiana state-chartered mutual savings and loan association and in 1935 converted to a federal mutual savings and loan association, operating under the name First Federal Savings and Loan Association of Richmond. In 1993, the bank converted to a state-chartered mutual savings bank and changed its name to First Bank Richmond, S.B. In 1998, the bank, in connection with its non-stock mutual holding company reorganization, converted to a national bank charter operating as First Bank Richmond, National Association. In July 2007, Richmond Mutual Bancorporation-Delaware, the bank’s then current holding company, acquired Mutual Federal Savings Bank headquartered in Sidney, Ohio. Mutual Federal Savings Bank was operated independently as a separately chartered, wholly owned subsidiary of Richmond Mutual Bancorporation-Delaware until 2016 when it was combined with the bank through an internal merger transaction that consolidated both banks into a single, more efficient commercial bank charter. In 2017, the bank converted to an Indiana state-chartered commercial bank and changed its name to First Bank Richmond. The former Mutual Federal Savings Bank continues to operate in Ohio under the name Mutual Federal, a division of First Bank Richmond.
First Bank Richmond provides full banking services through its seven full- and one limited-service offices located in Cambridge City (1), Centerville (1), Richmond (5) and Shelbyville (1), Indiana, its five full-service offices located in Piqua (2), Sidney (2) and Troy (1), Ohio, and its loan production office in Columbus, Ohio. Administrative, trust and wealth management services are conducted through First Bank Richmond’s Corporate Office/Financial Center located in Richmond, Indiana. As an Indiana-chartered commercial bank, First Bank Richmond is subject to regulation by the IDFI and the FDIC.
Our principal business consists of attracting deposits from the general public, as well as brokered deposits, and investing those funds primarily in loans secured by commercial and multi-family real estate, first mortgages on owner-occupied, one- to four-family residences, a variety of consumer loans, direct financing leases and commercial and industrial loans. We also obtain funds by utilizing Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) advances. Funds not invested in loans generally are invested in investment securities, including mortgage-backed and mortgage-related securities and agency and municipal bonds.
First Bank Richmond generates commercial, mortgage and consumer loans and leases and receives deposits from customers located primarily in Wayne and Shelby Counties, in Indiana and Shelby, Miami and Franklin (no deposits) Counties, in Ohio. We sometimes refer to these counties as our primary market area. First Bank Richmond’s loans are generally secured by specific items of collateral including real property, consumer assets and business assets. Our leasing operation consists of direct investments in equipment that we lease (referred to as direct finance leases) to small businesses located throughout the United States. Our lease portfolio consists of various kinds of equipment, generally technology-related, such as computer systems, medical equipment and general manufacturing, industrial, construction and transportation equipment. We seek leasing transactions where we believe the equipment leased is integral to the lessee's business. We also provide trust and wealth management services, including serving as executor and trustee under wills and deeds and as guardian and custodian of employee benefits, and manage private investment accounts for individuals and institutions. Total wealth management assets under management and administration were $138.8 million at December 31, 2022.
Our results of operations are primarily dependent on net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between interest income, which is the income that is earned on loans and investments, and interest expense, which is the interest that is paid on deposits and borrowings. Other significant sources of pre-tax income are service charges (mostly from service charges on deposit accounts and loan servicing fees), and fees from sale of residential mortgage loans originated for sale in the secondary market. We also recognize income from the sale of investment securities.
First Insurance Management, Inc., a Nevada corporation, was formed in 2022 as a pooled captive insurance company subsidiary of the Company. The purpose of this company is to provide additional property and casualty insurance coverage to the Company and its subsidiaries and reinsurance to 16 other third party insurance captives for which insurance may not be currently available or economically feasible in today's insurance marketplace. 
FB Richmond Holdings, Inc., a Nevada corporation, was formed in 2020 as a subsidiary of First Bank Richmond. FB Richmond Holdings holds substantially all of the Bank’s investment portfolio. As of December 31, 2022, the market value of securities held was $290.6 million.
FB Richmond Properties, Inc., a Delaware corporation, was formed in 2020 as a subsidiary of FB Richmond Holdings, Inc. FB Richmond Properties holds certain residential mortgages and commercial real estate loans. As of December 31, 2022, FB Richmond Properties held approximately $101.8 million in residential mortgages and commercial real estate loans.
At December 31, 2022, on a consolidated basis, we had $1.3 billion in assets, $961.7 million in loans and leases, net of allowance, $1.0 billion in deposits and $133.0 million in stockholders’ equity. At December 31, 2022, First Bank Richmond’s total risk-based capital ratio was 14.3%, exceeding the 10.0% requirement for a well-capitalized institution. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we reported net income of $13.0 million, compared to net income of $11.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021.

Lending Activities
We offer a full range of lending products, including multi-family and commercial real estate loans (including owner and nonowner-occupied real estate loans), commercial and industrial loans (including equipment loans and working capital lines of credit), construction and development loans, residential real estate loans, including home equity loans and lines of credit, and consumer loans. We also engage in lease financing which consists of direct financing leases and is used by our commercial customers to finance purchases of equipment. We offer consumer loans, predominantly as an accommodation to our customers, secured by personal assets such as automobiles or recreational vehicles. Some consumer loans are unsecured, such as small installment loans and certain lines of credit. Lending activities originate from the relationships and efforts of our bankers.
Loan Approval Procedures and Authority. Pursuant to Indiana law, the aggregate amount of loans that First Bank Richmond is permitted to make to any one borrower, or a group of related borrowers, is generally limited to 15% of First Bank Richmond’s unimpaired capital and surplus. An additional amount may be loaned, up to 10% of unimpaired capital and surplus, if the loan is secured by readily marketable collateral, which generally does not include real estate. At December 31, 2022, based on the 15% limitation, First Bank Richmond’s loans-to-one-borrower limit was approximately $24.7 million. As of December 31, 2022, First Bank Richmond was in compliance with the loans-to-one-borrower limitations. At December 31, 2022, our largest lending relationship with one borrower was for $17.3 million consisting of four commercial real estate loans secured by properties in the Columbus, Ohio area. All of these loans were performing in accordance with their repayment terms at December 31, 2022.
Our lending is subject to written underwriting standards and origination procedures set forth in First Bank Richmond’s loan policy. Decisions on loan applications are made on the basis of detailed information submitted by the prospective borrower, credit histories that we obtain, and property valuations (consistent with our appraisal policy) prepared by outside independent licensed appraisers approved by our board of directors as well as internal evaluations, where permitted by regulations. The loan information is primarily designed to determine the borrower’s ability to repay the requested loan, and the more significant items are verified through use of credit reports, bank statements and tax returns. Loans containing a policy exception have the exception noted in the credit file accompanied by a statement as to the reason for granting the exception. Exceptions must be approved in accordance with First Bank Richmond’s loan policy. All loan approval amounts are based on the aggregate debt, including total commitments outstanding and the proposed loan to the individual borrower and any related entity.
First Bank Richmond’s board of directors has the responsibility for approving, on an annual basis, specific lending authority for individual officers, combinations of officers, or loan committees.
Loan Maturity and Repricing. The following tables set forth certain information at December 31, 2022 regarding the dollar amount of loans maturing in our portfolio based on their contractual terms to maturity, but does not include scheduled payments or potential prepayments. Loans with scheduled maturities are reported in the maturity category in which the loan is due. Loans that have adjustable rates are shown as amortizing to final maturity rather than when the interest rates are next subject to change. Loan balances do not include undisbursed loan proceeds, unearned discounts, unearned income and allowance for loan and lease losses.

Residential Mortgage Lending. We make one- to four-family residential real estate loans and home equity loans and lines of credit secured by the borrower’s primary residence. In addition, we may periodically purchase residential loans, which we refer to as brokered mortgages, primarily during periods of reduced loan demand in our primary market areas and at times to support our Community Reinvestment Act lending activities, although we have not purchased any brokered mortgage loans in the last eight years. Any such purchases are made generally consistent with our underwriting standards for residential mortgage loans. At December 31, 2022, $157.1 million, or 16.1%, of our total loan and lease portfolio was secured by residential real estate, consisting of $141.4 million of one- to four-family residential real estate loans, $4.7 million of home equity loans, and $11.0 million of home equity lines of credit.
We originate both fixed-rate and adjustable-rate one- to four-family residential real estate loans. At December 31, 2022, 57.4% of our one- to four-family residential real estate loans were fixed-rate loans and 42.6% of such loans were adjustable-rate loans. Most of our loans are underwritten using generally-accepted secondary market underwriting guidelines. We typically sell most of the conforming, fixed-rate one- to four-family loans we originate into the secondary market to Fannie Mae and, to a lesser extent, the FHLB of Indianapolis. Loans that are sold into the secondary market to Fannie Mae or the FHLB of Indianapolis are sold with the servicing retained to maintain the client relationship and to generate non-interest income. The sale of mortgage loans provides a source of non-interest income through the gain on sale, reduces our interest rate risk, provides a stream of servicing income, enhances liquidity and enables us to originate more loans at our current capital level than if we held the loans in our loan portfolio. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we originated $41.3 million 
one- to four-family fixed-rate mortgage loans and $24.0 million one- to four-family adjustable-rate mortgage (“ARM”) loans, and sold $28.1 million of these loans without recourse to Fannie Mae and the FHLB of Indianapolis. See “- Originations, Sales and Purchases of Loans.”
We also, from time to time, make a limited amount of Federal Housing Administration (“FHA”) loans, U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (“VA”) loans and U.S. Department of Agriculture (“USDA”) loans, all of which we originate for sale on a servicing-released, non-recourse basis in accordance with FHA, VA and USDA guidelines. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we did not originate or sell any FHA, VA or USDA loans, compared to $624,000 of FHA, VA and USDA loans originated and sold during the year ended December 31, 2021.
Substantially all of the one- to four-family residential mortgage loans we retain in our portfolio consist of fixed-rate loans that do not satisfy acreage limits, income, credit, conforming loan limits (i.e., jumbo mortgages) or various other requirements imposed by Fannie Mae or are adjustable-rate loans. Some of these loans are also originated to meet the needs of borrowers who cannot otherwise satisfy Fannie Mae credit requirements because of personal and financial reasons (i.e., bankruptcy, length of time employed, etc.), and other aspects which do not conform to Fannie Mae’s guidelines. Such borrowers may have higher debt-to-income ratios, or the loans are secured by unique properties in rural markets for which there are no sales of comparable properties to support the value according to secondary market requirements. We may require additional collateral or lower loan-to-value ratios to reduce the risk of these loans. We believe that these loans satisfy the needs of borrowers in our market area. As a result, subject to market conditions, we intend to continue to originate these types of loans. We also retain jumbo loans which exceed the conforming loan limits and therefore are not eligible to be purchased by Fannie Mae. At December 31, 2022, $46.6 million or 31.9% of our one- to four-family loan portfolio consisted of jumbo loans.
We generally underwrite our one- to four-family loans based on the applicant’s employment and credit history and the appraised value of the subject property. We generally lend up to 89% of the lesser of the appraised value or purchase price for one- to four-family first mortgage loans and non-owner occupied first mortgage loans. For first mortgage loans with a loan-to-value ratio in excess of 89%, we may require private mortgage insurance or other credit enhancement to help mitigate the risk. Fixed-rate loans secured by one- to four-family residences may have contractual maturities of up to 30 years. All of these loans are fully amortizing, with payments due monthly. Properties securing our one- to four-family loans are typically appraised by independent fee appraisers who are selected in accordance with criteria approved by the Loan Committee. For loans that are less than $250,000, we may use an automated valuation model, in lieu of an appraisal. We require title insurance policies on all first mortgage real estate loans originated over $100,000. Homeowners, liability, fire and, if required, flood insurance policies are also required for one-to four-family loans. Our real estate loans generally contain a “due on sale” clause allowing us to declare the unpaid principal balance due and payable upon the sale of the security property.
ARM loans are offered with annual adjustments and life-time rate caps that vary based on the product, generally with a maximum annual rate change of 2.0% and a maximum overall rate change of 6.0%. We generally use the rate on one-year Treasury Bills to re-price our ARM loans. As a consequence of using caps, the interest rates on ARM loans may not be as rate sensitive as our cost of funds. Furthermore, because loan indexes may not respond perfectly to changes in market interest rates, upward adjustments on loans may occur more slowly than increases in our cost of interest-bearing liabilities, especially during periods of rapidly increasing interest rates. Because of these characteristics, future yields on ARM loans may not be sufficient to offset increases in our cost of funds.
ARM loans generally pose different credit risks than fixed-rate loans, primarily because as interest rates rise, the borrower’s payment increases, which increases the potential for default. We continue to offer our fully amortizing ARM loans with a fixed interest rate for the first one, three, five or seven years, followed by a periodic adjustable interest rate for the remaining term.
The average balance of our one- to four-family residential loans secured by first mortgages was approximately $125,000 at December 31, 2022.
We originate fixed-rate home equity loans and fixed- and variable-rate lines of credit secured either by a first or second lien on the borrower’s primary residence. Our home equity loans are fixed rate fully amortizing loans with terms of up to 15 years and are generally originated in amounts, together with the amount of the existing first mortgage, of up to 89% of the appraised value of the subject property. Home equity loans originated with a loan to value ratio in excess of 80% are subject to a higher origination fee and higher interest rate than home equity loans with loan to value ratios of 80% or less. If the home equity loan is for home improvements, the improvements to be made to the property may be considered when calculating the loan to value ratio. If the loan to value ratio on the property is sufficient, regardless of the improvements to be made, the proceeds may be disbursed directly to the borrower. When the appraised value is dependent on the improvements to meet the 
loan to value requirement, the proceeds are held by us until we receive reasonable assurance that the improvements have been completed. The loan officers, at their discretion, may use a limited appraisal or a recertification of value on these types of loans. At December 31, 2022, home equity loans totaled $4.7 million, or 0.5% of our total loan and lease portfolio.
Home equity lines of credit may be either fixed- or adjustable-rate and are typically originated in amounts, together with the amount of the existing first mortgage, of up to 89% of the appraised value of the subject property. Home equity lines of credit originated with a loan to value ratio in excess of 80% are subject to a higher interest rate than home equity lines of credit with loan to value ratios of 80% or less. Home equity lines of credit with an adjustable rate of interest adjust quarterly and are based on the Wall Street Journal Prime rate, plus a margin. Our fixed rate lines have a five-year draw period and our adjustable-rate lines have a 10-year draw period, during which time the funds may be paid down and redrawn up to the committed amount. Once the draw period has lapsed, the borrower either pays off the loan balance, or a new loan is negotiated. We charge an annual fee on each home equity line of credit and require a monthly payment of 0.9% of the outstanding balance drawn during the period, plus interest. At December 31, 2022, home equity lines of credit totaled $11.0 million, or 1.1% of our total loan and lease portfolio, with adjustable-rate home equity lines of credit totaling $7.9 million and fixed rate home equity lines making up the remaining balance. At December 31, 2022, unfunded commitments on home equity lines of credit totaled $16.8 million.
We do not engage in originating interest only, negative amortization, option adjustable rate or subprime loans and have no established program to originate or purchase these loans. Subprime loans are defined as loans that at the time of loan origination had a FICO credit score of less than 660. Of the $157.1 million in one- to four- family loans, including home equity loans and lines of credit, in our portfolio as of December 31, 2022, $12.3 million, or 7.8%, were to borrowers with a credit score under 660.
Multi-family and Commercial Real Estate Lending. We originate commercial real estate loans, including loans secured by multi-family residential properties, office buildings, hotels, industrial properties, retail buildings, medical and professional buildings, restaurants and various other commercial properties located principally in our primary market area. As of December 31, 2022, $423.0 million or 43.4% of our total loan and lease portfolio was secured by commercial and multi-family real estate, of which $154.5 million, or 15.8% of our total loan and lease portfolio, was secured by property located in the Columbus, Ohio market. Multi-family loans totaled $124.9 million of the $423.0 million commercial and multi-family real estate loan portfolio, or 12.8% of our total loan and lease portfolio, at December 31, 2022. Of the remaining $298.1 million of this portfolio, approximately $140.0 million was secured by income producing, or non-owner-occupied commercial real estate. We also purchase and participate, from time to time, in multi-family and commercial real estate loans from other financial institutions, which amounts are included in our multi-family and commercial real estate loan portfolios. Such loans are independently underwritten according to our policies. At December 31, 2022, our purchased multi-family and commercial real estate loan participations totaled $40.9 million, or 9.7% of our total multi-family and commercial real estate loan portfolios. 
Multi-family and commercial real estate loans generally are priced at a higher rate of interest than one- to four-family residential loans. Typically, these loans have higher loan balances, are more difficult to evaluate and monitor, and involve a greater degree of risk than one- to four-family residential loans. Often payments on loans secured by commercial or multi-family properties are dependent on the successful operation and management of the property; therefore, repayment of these loans may be affected by adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy. We generally require and obtain loan guarantees from financially capable parties based upon the review of personal financial statements. If the borrower is a corporation, we generally require and obtain personal guarantees from the corporate principals based upon a review of their personal financial statements and individual credit reports. In addition, the borrower’s and guarantor’s financial information on such loans is monitored on an ongoing basis by requiring periodic financial statements.
Our commercial and multi-family real estate loans generally have initial terms of 10 to 20 years and amortization terms of up to 25 years, with a balloon payment at the end of the initial term and may be fixed-rate or adjustable-rate loans. Our adjustable-rate multi-family and commercial real estate loans are generally tied to a margin above the prime rate or the applicable treasury rate. The maximum loan-to-value ratio of our multi-family and commercial real estate loans is generally 80% of the lower of cost or appraised value of the property securing the loan. At December 31, 2022, 17.4% of our multi-family and commercial real estate loans were fixed-rate loans and 82.6% were adjustable-rate loans.
We consider a number of factors in originating multi-family and commercial real estate loans. We evaluate the qualifications and financial condition of the borrower, including project-level and global cash flows, credit history and management expertise, as well as the value and condition of the property securing the loan. When evaluating the qualifications of the borrower, we consider the financial resources of the borrower, the borrower’s experience in owning or managing similar property and the borrower’s payment history with us and other financial institutions. In evaluating the property securing the loan, the factors we consider include the net operating income of the mortgaged property before debt service and depreciation, the ratio of the loan amount to the appraised value of the mortgaged property and the debt service coverage ratio (the ratio of 
net operating income to debt service). We generally require a debt service ratio of at least 1.10x. All multi-family and commercial real estate loans in excess of $500,000 are appraised by outside independent appraisers. We require property and casualty insurance and also require flood insurance if the property is determined to be in a flood zone area.
In addition, we generally require a Phase I Environmental Audit as a condition of making all multi-family and commercial real estate loans in excess of $1.0 million, which audit is performed by a qualified environmental consulting firm. The Phase I Environmental Audit includes appropriate inquiry into previous ownership and uses of the real estate to satisfactorily comply with the “Innocent Landowner Defense Amendment” to the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA). The results and recommendations of the audit must be acceptable to us prior to loan closing. For loans less than $1.0 million but greater than $150,000, a full Phase I Environmental Audit is not required, although an environmental investigation is typically performed by qualified bank personnel or a third party to determine if a full Phase I Environmental Audit should be done.
At December 31, 2022, the average loan size of our outstanding multi-family and commercial real estate loans was $1.1 million, and the largest of such loans was a $11.8 million loan secured by a first mortgage on a parking garage and apartment building located in the Columbus, Ohio metropolitan area. This loan was performing in accordance with its repayment terms at December 31, 2022. We had 44 other commercial and multi-family real estate loans with an outstanding balance in excess of $3.0 million at December 31, 2022, all of which were performing in accordance with their repayment terms at December 31, 2022. Our largest lending relationship with one borrower at December 31, 2022 was for $26.4 million consisting of seven commercial real estate loans secured by six separate hotels, three in the Dayton, Ohio area, one in the Columbus, Ohio area and two in the Cincinnati, Ohio area, all with a common guarantor. All of these loans were performing in accordance with their repayment terms at December 31, 2022.
Multi-family and commercial real estate loans entail greater credit risks compared to one- to four-family residential real estate loans because they typically involve larger loan balances concentrated with single borrowers or groups of related borrowers. In addition, the repayment of loans secured by income-producing properties typically depends on the successful operation of the property, as repayment of the loan generally is dependent, in large part, on sufficient income from the property to cover operating expenses and debt service. Changes in economic conditions that are not in the control of the borrower or lender could affect the value of the collateral for the loan or the future cash flow of the property. Additionally, any decline in real estate values may be more pronounced for multi-family and commercial real estate than residential properties. If we foreclose on a commercial or multi-family real estate loan, the marketing and liquidation period to convert the real estate asset to cash can be a lengthy process with substantial holding costs. In addition, vacancies, deferred maintenance, repairs and market stigma can result in prospective buyers expecting sale price concessions to offset their real or perceived economic losses for the time it takes them to return the property to profitability. Depending on the individual circumstances, initial charge-offs and subsequent losses on multi-family and commercial real estate loans can be unpredictable and substantial.

Commercial and Industrial Lending. We make secured and unsecured commercial and industrial loans, including commercial lines of credit, working capital loans, term loans, equipment financing, acquisition, expansion and development loans, letters of credit and other loan products, principally in our primary market area. These loans are made based primarily on historical and projected cash flows of the borrower and secondarily on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower. We take as collateral a lien on general business assets including, among other things, available real estate, accounts receivable, inventory and equipment and generally obtain a personal guaranty of the borrower or principal. Our operating lines of credit typically are limited to a percentage of the value of the assets securing the line. Lines of credit and term loans typically are reviewed annually. As of December 31, 2022, we had $100.4 million of commercial and industrial loans, representing 10.3% of our total loan and lease portfolio, including $6.3 million of unsecured commercial and industrial loans (which includes Paycheck Protection Program ("PPP") loans discussed below).
At December 31, 2022, we had $944,000 of loans originated under the PPP, a specialized low-interest loan program funded by the U.S. Treasury Department and administered by the Small Business Administration (“SBA”). The Bank, as a qualified SBA lender, was authorized to originate PPP loans. PPP loans have an interest rate of 1.0%, a two- year or five-year loan term to maturity, and principal and interest payments deferred until the lender receives the applicable forgiven amount or ten months after the end of the borrower’s loan forgiveness covered period. The SBA guarantees 100% of the PPP loans made to eligible borrowers. The entire principal amount of the borrower’s PPP loan, including any accrued interest, is eligible to be reduced by the loan forgiveness amount under the PPP so long as employee and compensation levels of the business are maintained and the loan proceeds are used for other qualifying expenses. The PPP expired on May 31, 2021.
The terms of our commercial and industrial loans, excluding PPP loans, vary by purpose and by type of underlying collateral. We typically make equipment loans for a term of five years or less at fixed or adjustable rates, with the loan fully amortized over the term. Terms greater than five years may be appropriate in some circumstances, based upon the useful life of the underlying asset being financed or if some form of credit enhancement, such as an SBA guarantee, is obtained. Loans to support working capital typically have terms not exceeding one year and are usually secured by accounts receivable, inventory and personal guarantees of the principals of the business. The interest rates charged on loans vary with the degree of risk and loan amount and are further subject to competitive pressures, money market rates, the availability of funds and government regulations. For loans secured by accounts receivable and inventory, principal is typically repaid as the assets securing the loan are converted into cash (monitored on a monthly or more frequent basis as determined necessary in the underwriting process), and for loans secured with other types of collateral, principal is typically due at maturity.
In general, commercial and industrial loans may involve increased credit risk and, therefore, typically yield a higher return. The increased risk in commercial and industrial loans derives from the expectation that such loans generally are serviced principally from the operations of the business, and those operations may not be successful. Any interruption or discontinuance 
of operating cash flows from the business, which may be influenced by events not under the control of the borrower such as economic events and changes in governmental regulations, could materially affect the ability of the borrower to repay the loan. In addition, the collateral securing commercial and industrial loans generally includes moveable property such as equipment and inventory, which may decline in value more rapidly than we anticipate, exposing us to increased credit risk. As a result of these additional complexities, variables and risks, commercial and industrial loans require extensive underwriting and servicing.
At December 31, 2022, the average loan size of our outstanding commercial and industrial loans was $240,000, and our largest outstanding commercial and industrial loan was a capital improvement loan totaling $7.1 million to an equipment holding and leasing company located in Bremen, Ohio secured by a first lien on equipment. This loan was performing in accordance with its repayment terms at December 31, 2022. We had 20 other commercial and industrial loans with an outstanding balance in excess of $1.0 million at December 31, 2022, all but one of which were performing in accordance with their repayment terms at that date.
Construction and Development Lending. We originate loans to finance the construction of commercial real estate projects, such as multi-family housing, industrial, office and retail centers. We also originate residential construction loans to borrowers and builders secured by single-family residences. On a much smaller scale, we may originate loans for the acquisition and development of residential or commercial land into buildable lots. At December 31, 2022, our construction and development loan portfolio totaled $139.9 million, or 14.4% of our total loan and lease portfolio, consisting of $127.0 million in commercial construction loans and $12.9 million in residential construction loans. At December 31, 2022, we had unfunded construction loan commitments totaling $128.2 million and $17.7 million in commercial and residential construction loans, respectively.
Our commercial construction loans are typically made to builders/developers that have an established record of successful project completion and loan repayment. We conduct periodic inspections, either directly or through an agent, prior to approval of periodic draws on these loans based on the percentage of completion. Underwriting guidelines for our commercial construction loans are similar to those described above for our commercial real estate lending. General liability, builder’s risk hazard insurance, title insurance, and flood insurance (as applicable, for properties located or to be built in a designated flood hazard area) are also required on all construction and development loans.
Our commercial construction loans have terms that typically range from one to two years depending on factors such as the type and size of the development and the financial strength of the borrower/guarantor. Commercial construction loans are typically structured with an interest only period during the construction phase. Commercial construction loans are underwritten to either mature, or transition to a traditional amortizing loan, at the completion of the construction phase. The loan-to-value ratio on our commercial construction loans, as established by independent appraisal, typically will not exceed 80% of the appraised value on a completed basis or the cost of completion, whichever is less. These loans generally include an interest reserve of 1% to 5% of the loan commitment amount. The average outstanding loan size in our commercial construction loan portfolio was approximately $2.3 million at December 31, 2022.
Commercial construction loans on property built for speculative purposes that has not sold in a period of eighteen months after completion will require re-margining at no more than 89% of current appraised value and monthly amortization based on a 25-year payout. At December 31, 2022, $20.8 million, or 16.4%, of our total commercial construction loan portfolio consisted of speculative construction loans.
We finance the construction of pre-sold owner occupied, one- to four-family residential properties in our market areas to builders and prospective homeowners. Our residential construction loans are originated primarily on a construction/permanent basis with such loans converting to an amortizing loan following the completion of the construction phase. Our residential construction loans generally provide for the payment of interest only during the construction phase, which is typically up to nine months. We do not make speculative construction loans to a builder for homes that are not pre-sold. The average outstanding residential construction loan balance was approximately $267,000 at December 31, 2022.
Residential construction loans are made with a maximum loan-to-value ratio of the lower of 80% of the cost or appraised value at completion. Commitments to fund residential construction loans generally are made subject to an appraisal of the property by an independent licensed appraiser. Loan proceeds are disbursed after inspection by a third-party inspector based on the percentage of completion method.
On a more limited basis, we also make land loans to developers, builders and individuals to finance the commercial development of improved lots or unimproved land. In making land loans, we follow underwriting policies and disbursement and monitoring procedures similar to those for commercial construction loans. These land loans also involve additional risks because the loan amount is based on the projected value of the lots after development. We make these loans for up to 65% of 
the estimated value of raw land and up to 75% of the estimated value of developed land, with a term of up to two years with interest only payments, payable monthly.
Construction loans generally involve greater credit risk than long-term financing on improved, owner occupied real estate. In the event a loan is made on property that is not yet approved for the planned development or improvements, there is a risk that necessary approvals will not be granted or will be delayed. Risk of loss on a construction loan also depends upon the accuracy of the initial estimate of the value of the property at completion of construction compared to the estimated cost (including interest) of construction and other assumptions. If the estimate of construction cost is inaccurate, we may be required to advance additional funds beyond the amount originally committed in order to protect the value of the property. Moreover, if the estimated value of the completed project is inaccurate, the borrower may hold a property with a value that is insufficient to assure full repayment of the construction loan upon the sale of the property. Construction loans also carry the risk that construction will not be completed on time in accordance with specifications and projected costs. In addition, repayment of these loans can be dependent on the sale or rental of the property to third parties, and the ultimate sale or rental of the property may not occur as anticipated. Other risks may include the fraudulent diversion of construction funds, the filing of mechanics liens by contractors, subcontractors or suppliers, or the contractor’s failure to complete the construction of the project.
We seek to address the forgoing risks associated with construction and development lending by developing and adhering to underwriting policies, disbursement procedures and monitoring practices. Specifically, we (i) seek to diversify loans in our market areas, (ii) evaluate and document the creditworthiness of the borrower and the viability of the proposed project, (iii) obtain an appraisal of the property by an independent licensed appraiser, (iv) limit loan-to-value ratios to specified levels, (v) control disbursements on construction loans on the basis of on-site inspections by third party inspectors, and (vi) monitor economic conditions in each market. No assurances, however, can be given that these practices will be successful in mitigating the risks of construction and development lending.
At December 31, 2022, our largest construction and land development loan had an outstanding balance of $10.9 million and was secured by an apartment building located in Columbus, Ohio. At December 31, 2022, this loan was performing according to its repayment terms. We had 15 other construction and development loans with an outstanding balance in excess of $3.0 million at December 31, 2022, all of which were performing in accordance with their repayment terms at that date except for one $4.9 million loan that is subject to litigation between the developer and other parties.
Lease Financing. We conduct our leasing operations through First Federal Leasing, a division of First Bank Richmond. Our lease financing operation consists of direct financing leases which are used by commercial customers to finance purchases such as medical, computer and manufacturing equipment, audio/visual equipment, industrial assets, construction and transportation equipment, and a wide variety of other commercial equipment. We rely solely on brokers and other third-party originators to generate our lease transactions. The nature of our business requires the use of brokers and third-party originators as it focuses on transactions generally ranging between $2,500 and $200,000 (with an average size of $45,000) with terms of 24 to 72 months, with a weighted average term of 41.7 months as of December 31, 2022. Our risk management profile centers on internally rated “A” quality credits. At December 31, 2022, our direct finance leasing portfolio totaled $133.5 million, or 13.7% of our total loan and lease portfolio, with lease contracts located throughout the United States.
At lease inception, we record an asset (net investment) representing the aggregate future minimum lease payments and deferred indirect costs less unearned income. Income is recognized over the life of the lease to approximate a level rate of return on the net investment.
To generate deal flow, we actively work with over 100 brokers and third-party originators across the country, some of which are one person shops and others more established companies, with most of the volume coming from fewer than 25 referral sources. We have operated with this model since we commenced leasing operations in 1989 and have developed procedures to minimize fraud and concentration risk. The leases are processed by us through our lease origination software, which allows brokers to populate the fields with customer information and attach credit documentation, streamlining the data collection process. There is no automated approval process. Each lease application is reviewed by a credit administrator and then sent to a credit underwriter for review and approval. We have procedures in place to check and underwrite all the data we receive from the brokers and third-party originators, including ensuring that the potential lessee is operating from the location given and tracking the performance of each vendor.
The credit decisions for these transactions are based upon an assessment of the overall financial capacity of the applicant and generally require that the applicant have a minimum FICO score of 675. A determination is made as to the applicant’s ability to repay in accordance with the proposed terms as well as an overall assessment of the risks involved. In addition to an evaluation of the applicant’s financial condition, a determination is made of the probable adequacy of the primary 
and secondary sources of repayment, such as personal guarantees, to be relied upon in the transaction. Credit agency reports of the applicant’s credit history supplement the analysis of the applicant’s creditworthiness.
We generally file a UCC-1 financing statement on all of our lease transaction to perfect our interest in the equipment, except in the case of (i) titled equipment, where we would require the title in lieu of the UCC financing statement, (ii) transactions under $5,000 or (iii) for equipment with very little value, such as computer software. Perfection gives us a claim to the collateral that is superior to someone that obtains a lien through the judicial process subsequent to the perfection of a security interest.  The failure to perfect a security interest does not render the security interest unenforceable against the borrower. However, failure to perfect a security interest risks avoidance of the security interest in bankruptcy or subordination to the claims of third parties.
At December 31, 2022, approximately $41.7 million or 31.2% of the aggregate dollar amount of our lease portfolio was concentrated in four states: California at 9.4%; New York at 9.3%; Florida at 6.3% and Arkansas at 6.2%. Our largest leasing relationship at that date was with the State of Arkansas which consisted of more than 3,000 leases totaling approximately $7.6 million in lease receivables, all of which were performing in accordance with the lease terms. Our second largest leasing relationship was with a drilled pile foundation company located in Florida consisting of four contracts totaling approximately $1.6 million in lease receivables, all of which were performing in accordance with the lease terms.
Consumer Lending. We offer a variety of secured and unsecured consumer loans to individuals who reside or work in our market area, including new and used automobile loans, motorcycle loans, boat loans, recreational vehicle loans, mobile home loans and loans secured by certificates of deposit. Most of our consumer loans are made as an accommodation to our existing customers. At December 31, 2022, our consumer loan portfolio totaled $21.0 million, or 2.2% of our total loan and lease portfolio, including $1.2 million of unsecured consumer loans.
Consumer loans generally have shorter terms to maturity, which reduces our exposure to changes in interest rates. In addition, management believes that offering consumer loan products helps to expand and create stronger ties to our existing customer base by increasing the number of customer relationships and providing cross-marketing opportunities.
Originations, Sales and Purchases of Loans
Our loan originations are generated by our loan personnel operating at our office locations. While we originate both fixed-rate and adjustable-rate loans, our ability to generate each type of loan depends upon relative borrower demand and the pricing levels as set in the local marketplace by competing banks, thrifts, credit unions, and mortgage banking companies. Our volume of real estate loan originations is influenced significantly by market interest rates, and, accordingly, the volume of our real estate loan originations can vary from period to period. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we originated $232.1 million of fixed rate loans and leases and $254.2 million of adjustable-rate loans, compared to $315.1 million of fixed rate loans and leases and $218.7 million of adjustable-rate loans during the year ended December 31, 2021.

As reflected in the tables above, loan and lease originations decreased $47.4 million or 8.9%, to $486.3 million during 2022 compared to $533.7 million during 2021, primarily due to decreases in residential mortgage loans as a result of a slowdown in the refinancing and sales of housing in our area due to rising market interest rates, multifamily and commercial real estate loans also due to increasing interest rates, and commercial and industrial loans as a result of the expiration of the PPP in May 2021. Construction and development loan originations increased year over year in line with management’s strategy to expand this portfolio.
We consider our balance sheet as well as market conditions on an ongoing basis in making decisions as to whether to hold residential loans we originate for investment or to sell these loans to investors, choosing the strategy that is most advantageous to us from a profitability and risk management standpoint. We sell the majority of the fixed-rate conforming and eligible jumbo one- to four-family residential real estate loans that we originate, generally on a servicing-retained basis, while retaining some non-eligible fixed-rate and adjustable-rate one- to four-family residential real estate loans in order to manage the duration and time to repricing of our loan portfolio. All FHA, VA and USDA loans we originate are sold on a servicing-released, non-recourse basis in accordance with FHA, VA and USDA guidelines. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we sold $28.1 million and $76.2 million of one- to four-family residential real estate loans, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2022, we did not originate or sell any FHA, VA or USDA loans, compared to $624,000 of FHA, VA and USDA loans originated and sold during the year ended December 31, 2021.
We recognize, at the time of sale, the cash gain or loss on the sale of the loans based on the difference between the net cash proceeds received and the carrying value of the loans sold. Subject to market and economic conditions, management intends to continue this sales activity in future periods to generate gain on sale income.
From time to time, we may purchase loan participations secured by properties within and outside of our primary lending market area in which we are not the lead lender. In these circumstances, we follow our customary loan underwriting and approval policies. At December 31, 2022, we had 50 loans totaling $69.4 million in which we were not the lead lender. All of these participation loans were performing in accordance with their original repayment terms at December 31, 2022. We also have sold portions of loans we originate that exceeded our loans-to-one borrower legal lending limit or for risk diversification. Historically, we have not purchased whole loans. Pursuant to our growth strategy, however, we may purchase whole loans in the future.
Delinquencies and Non-Performing Assets
Loans and leases are reviewed on a regular basis. Management determines that a loan or lease is impaired or nonperforming when it is probable at least a portion of the loan or lease will not be collected in accordance with the original terms due to a deterioration in the financial condition of the borrower or the value of the underlying collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. When a loan or lease is determined to be impaired, the measurement of the loan or lease in the allowance for loan and lease losses is based on present value of expected future cash flows, except that all collateral-dependent loans are measured for impairment based on the fair value of the collateral. Nonaccrual loans and leases are loans and leases for which collectability is questionable and, therefore, interest on such loans will no longer be recognized on an accrual basis. All loans 
and leases that become 90 days or more delinquent are placed on nonaccrual status unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection.
When we acquire real estate as a result of foreclosure, the real estate is classified as foreclosed assets or Other Real Estate Owned. Foreclosed assets are recorded at the lower of carrying amount or fair value, less estimated costs to sell. Soon after acquisition, we order a new appraisal, or evaluation when acceptable, to determine the current market value of the property. Any excess of the recorded value of the loan over the market value of the property is charged against the allowance for loan and lease losses, or, if the existing allowance is inadequate, charged to expense, in either case during the applicable period of such determination. After acquisition, all costs incurred in maintaining the property are expensed.
We generally cease accruing interest on our loans and leases when contractual payments of principal or interest have become 90 days past due or management has serious doubts about further collectability of principal or interest, even though the loan or lease is currently performing. A loan or lease may remain on accrual status if it is in the process of collection and is either guaranteed or well secured. When a loan or lease is placed on nonaccrual status, unpaid interest credited to income is reversed. Interest received on nonaccrual loans and leases generally is applied against principal or interest and is recognized on a cash basis. Generally, loans and leases are restored to accrual status when the obligation is brought current, has performed in accordance with the contractual terms for a reasonable period of time and the ultimate collectability of the total contractual principal and interest is no longer in doubt.
Nonperforming loans and leases totaled $9.1 million or 0.94% of total loans and leases at December 31, 2022 and $8.1 million or 0.95% of total loans and leases at December 31, 2021. The increase in nonperforming loans was primarily attributable to a $1.3 million increase in commercial and industrial loans, primarily due to one loan of $1.3 million secured by business assets and a second mortgage, past due more than 90 days and still accruing. At December 31, 2022, our largest nonperforming loan was a $4.9 million nonaccrual commercial construction and development loan that is subject to litigation between the developer and other parties.
Loans are accounted for as troubled debt restructurings when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulties that lead to a restructuring of the loan, and First Bank Richmond grants a concession to the borrower that it would not otherwise consider. These concessions include a modification of terms, such as a reduction of the stated interest rate or loan balance, a reduction of accrued interest, an extension of the maturity date at an interest rate lower than current market rate for a new loan with similar risk, or some combination thereof to facilitate payment. Troubled debt restructurings are considered impaired loans. No additional loan commitments were outstanding to our troubled debt restructured borrowers at December 31, 2022.
Loans on nonaccrual status at the date of modification are initially classified as non-accrual troubled debt restructurings. At December 31, 2022, we had $428,000 in nonaccrual troubled debt restructurings, none of which were in the process of foreclosure at December 31, 2022. Our policy provides that troubled debt restructured loans are returned to accrual status after a period of satisfactory and reasonable future payment performance under the terms of the restructuring. Satisfactory payment performance is generally no less than six consecutive months of timely payments. At December 31, 2022, we had no loans or leases classified as accruing troubled debt restructurings. 
Foreclosed assets consist of property acquired through formal foreclosure, in-substance foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure, and are recorded at the lower of recorded investment or fair value less estimated costs to sell. Write-downs from recorded investment to fair value, which are required at the time of foreclosure, are charged to the allowance for loan and lease losses. After transfer, adjustments to the carrying value of the properties that result from subsequent declines in value are charged to operations in the period in which the declines occur. We had $57,000 in foreclosed assets at December 31, 2022.
The table below sets forth the amounts and categories of our non-performing assets at the dates indicated.

Classified Assets. Our regulators require that we classify loans and other assets, such as debt and equity securities considered to be of lesser quality, as “substandard,” “doubtful” or “loss.” An asset is considered “substandard” if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. “Substandard” assets include those characterized by the “distinct possibility” that the insured institution will sustain “some loss” if the deficiencies are not corrected. Assets classified as “doubtful” have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified “substandard,” with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make “collection or liquidation in full,” on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, “highly questionable and improbable.” Assets classified as “loss” are those considered “uncollectible” and of such little value that their continuance as assets without the establishment of a specific loss reserve is not warranted.
When an insured institution classifies problem assets as either substandard or doubtful, it may establish general allowances for loan and lease losses in an amount deemed prudent by management and approved by the board of directors. General allowances represent loss allowances that have been established to recognize the inherent risk associated with lending activities, but which, unlike specific allowances, have not been allocated to particular problem assets. When an insured institution classifies problem assets as “loss,” it is required either to establish a specific allowance for losses equal to 100% of that portion of the asset so classified or to charge off such amount. Our determination as to the classification of our assets and the amount of our valuation allowances is subject to review by our regulators, which may order the establishment of additional general or specific loss allowances.
In accordance with our loan policy, we regularly review the problem loans in our portfolio to determine whether any loans require classification in accordance with applicable regulations. Loans are listed on the “watch list” initially because of emerging financial weaknesses even though the loan is currently performing as agreed, or if the loan possesses weaknesses although currently performing. If a loan deteriorates in asset quality, the classification is changed to “special mention,” “substandard,” “doubtful” or “loss” depending on the circumstances and the evaluation. Generally, loans 90 days or more past due are placed on nonaccrual status and classified “substandard.” Management reviews the status of each impaired loan on our watch list on a quarterly basis.
On the basis of this review of our assets, our classified assets at the dates indicated were as follows:

 | At December 31,
 | 2022 | | 2021
 | (In thousands) 
Special mention | $ | 4,034 | | | $ | 12,222

Loss | — | | | — | 
Total classified assets | $ | 16,773 | | | $ | 20,717

Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses
The allowance for loan and lease losses is maintained at a level which, in management’s judgment, is adequate to absorb probable credit losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio. The amount of the allowance is based on management’s evaluation of the collectability of the loan and lease portfolio, including the nature of the portfolio, credit concentrations, trends in historical loss experience, specific impaired loans, and economic conditions. Allowances for impaired loans are generally determined based on collateral values or the present value of estimated cash flows. Because of uncertainties associated with regional economic conditions, collateral values, and future cash flows on impaired loans, it is reasonably possible that management’s estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio and the related allowance may change materially in the near-term. The allowance is increased by a provision for loan and lease losses, which is charged to expense and reduced by full and partial charge-offs, net of recoveries. Changes in the allowance relating to impaired loans and leases are charged or credited to the provision for loan and lease losses. Management’s periodic evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance is based on various factors, including, but not limited to, management’s ongoing review and grading of loans and leases, facts and issues related to specific loans and leases, historical loan and lease loss and delinquency experience, trends in past due and non-accrual loans and leases, existing risk characteristics of specific loans or loan pools, the fair value of underlying collateral, current economic conditions and other qualitative and quantitative factors which could affect potential credit losses.
As an integral part of their examination process, the IDFI and the FDIC will periodically review our allowance for loan and lease losses, and as a result of such reviews, we may have to adjust our allowance for loan and lease losses. However, regulatory agencies are not directly involved in the process for establishing the allowance for loan and lease losses as the process is our responsibility and any increase or decrease in the allowance is the responsibility of management.

The increase in our allowance for loan and lease losses at December 31, 2022 as compared to December 31, 2021 primarily was driven by a $129.0 million increase in our loan portfolio. The growth in the balance of loans and leases primarily occurred in the construction and development and commercial mortgage categories, which is in line with management's strategy to expand these portfolios. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis-Financial Condition at December 31, 2022 Compared 
to December 31, 2021” contained in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K for additional information regarding changes in our loans, leases, and related allowances.
Allocation of Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses. The following table sets forth the allowance for loan and lease losses allocated by category, the total balances by category, and the percent of loans and leases in each category to total loans and leases at the dates indicated. The allowance for loan and lease losses allocated to each category is not necessarily indicative of future losses in any particular category and does not restrict the use of the allowance to absorb losses in other categories. At the dates indicated, we had no unallocated allowance for loan and lease losses.

Although we believe that we use the best information available to establish the allowance for loan and lease losses, future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary and results of operations could be adversely affected if circumstances differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the determinations. Because future events affecting borrowers and collateral cannot be predicted with certainty, the existing allowance for loan and lease losses may not be adequate and management may determine that increases in the allowance are necessary if the quality of any portion of our loan or lease portfolio deteriorates as a result. Any material increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
For additional information regarding our allowance for loan and lease losses, see "Note 5: Loans, Leases and Allowance" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
Investment Activities
General. First Bank Richmond has the legal authority to invest in various types of liquid assets, including U.S. Treasury obligations, securities of various government-sponsored enterprises and municipal governments, deposits at the Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis, certificates of deposit of federally insured institutions, investment grade corporate bonds and investment grade marketable equity securities. We also are required to maintain an investment in Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis stock.
The objectives of our investment policy are to provide and maintain liquidity to meet deposit withdrawal and loan funding needs, to help mitigate interest rate and market risk, to diversify our assets, and to maximize the rate of return on 
invested funds within the context of our interest rate and credit risk objectives. Various factors are considered when making decisions regarding our investment portfolio, including the marketability, maturity and tax consequences of the proposed investment. The maturity structure of investments will be affected by various market conditions, including the current and anticipated slope of the yield curve, the level of interest rates, the trend of new deposit inflows, and the anticipated demand for funds via deposit withdrawals and loan originations and purchases. Our investment securities are usually classified as available-for-sale; however, the purchasing officer has the option, at the time of purchase, to designate individual securities as held-to-maturity, available-for-sale, or trading. 
In April 2020, First Bank Richmond created a wholly-owned subsidiary, FB Richmond Holdings, Inc. (“FB Richmond Holdings”) to hold a majority of its investment portfolio and take advantage of certain tax benefits. FB Richmond Holdings, a Nevada corporation, holds, services, manages and invests that portion of First Bank Richmond’s investment portfolio as may be transferred from time to time by First Bank Richmond to FB Richmond Holdings. FB Richmond Holdings’ investment policy, for the most part, mirrors that of First Bank Richmond’s investment policy. FB Richmond Holdings has hired a third-party investment advisor to manage its securities portfolio, subject to the oversight of its Board of Directors. The President and Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of the Company serve on the board of directors of FB Richmond Holdings. At December 31, 2022, we had, on a consolidated basis, $284.9 million of securities, at fair value, classified as available-for-sale, $6.7 million of securities, at cost, classified as held-to-maturity, and no securities classified as trading. At that date, FB Richmond Holding managed $290.6 million of our total investment portfolio.
We may from time to time invest in “special situation” investments in order to earn profits or to hedge against interest rate risk. These investments may include interest rate swaps and/or interest rate caps. These investments are handled on a case-by-case basis requiring the advice and counsel of the Asset/Liability Committee. The President and/or Chief Financial Officer can act on his own authority for investments under $400,000. However, once this authority is utilized, it must be reauthorized at the next Asset/Liability Committee meeting. While we have the authority under applicable law to invest in derivative securities, we had no investments in derivative securities at December 31, 2022.
We held common stock of the FHLB of Indianapolis in connection with our borrowing activities totaling $9.9 million at December 31, 2022. For the year ended December 31, 2022, First Bank Richmond received a total of $399,000 in dividends from the FHLB. Our required investment in the stock of the FHLB is based on a predetermined formula, carried at cost and evaluated for impairment. We may be required to purchase additional FHLB stock if we increase borrowings in the future.
Portfolio Maturities and Yields. The following table sets forth the weighted average yields of investment securities at various ranges of maturities, excluding Federal Reserve Bank and FHLB stock, at December 31, 2022. Weighted average yields on tax-exempt securities are presented on a tax-equivalent basis using a federal tax rate of approximately 21.0%. Certain mortgage-backed securities have adjustable interest rates and will reprice annually within the various maturity ranges. These repricing schedules are not reflected in the table below. Weighted average yield calculations on investment securities available for sale do not give effect to changes in fair value that are reflected as a component of equity.

Sources of Funds
General. Deposits have traditionally been our primary source of funds for use in lending and investment activities. We also use borrowings, primarily FHLB advances, to supplement cash flow needs, lengthen the maturities of liabilities for interest rate risk purposes and to manage the cost of funds. In addition, we receive funds from scheduled loan payments, loan and mortgage-backed securities prepayments, maturities and calls of available-for-sale securities, retained earnings and income on earning assets. While scheduled loan payments and income on earning assets are relatively stable sources of funds, deposit inflows and outflows can vary widely and are influenced by prevailing interest rates, market conditions and levels of competition.
Deposits. We offer deposit accounts to consumers and businesses having a wide range of interest rates and terms. Our deposits consist of savings deposit accounts, money market accounts, NOW and demand accounts and certificates of deposit. We solicit deposits in our market areas as well as online through our website. We also participate in reciprocal deposit services for our customers through the Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Service (“CDARS”) and Insured Cash Sweep (“ICS”) networks. We primarily rely on competitive pricing policies, marketing and customer service to attract and retain these deposits. We also accept brokered deposits from deposit brokers. At December 31, 2022, our brokered deposits totaled $257.9 million, or 25.7% of total deposits, with an average interest rate of 1.78% and a 12-month weighted-average maturity, compared to $121.8 million, or 13.5% of total deposits, with an average interest rate of 0.62% and a 27-month weighted-average maturity at December 31, 2021. Our reliance on brokered deposits may increase our overall cost of funds.
At December 31, 2022, our core deposits, which are deposits other than certificates of deposit of $250,000 or more and brokered deposits, totaled $702.9 million, representing 69.9% of total deposits, compared to $716.4 million, representing 79.6% of total deposits, at December 31, 2021.
Our largest banking office based on deposits is our main office in Richmond, Indiana, which had total deposits of $539.7 million or 53.7% of our total deposits at December 31, 2022. Approximately 76.5% ($769.5 million) of our total deposits were held in our Wayne County, Indiana offices as of December 31, 2022, with 88.3% ($679.7 million) of those deposits held in our five Richmond, Indiana offices. Overall, $810.4 million or 80.6% of our total deposits were held in Indiana branches and $194.8 million or 19.4% were held in Ohio branches as of December 31, 2022.
The Federal Reserve Board generally requires all depository institutions to maintain noninterest-bearing reserves at specified levels against their transaction accounts, primarily checking, NOW and Super NOW checking accounts. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic the Federal Reserve reduced the reserve requirement ratio to zero percent effective on March 26, 2020.

As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, approximately $219.7 million and $225.3 million, respectively, of our deposit portfolio was uninsured. The uninsured amounts are estimated based on the methodologies and assumptions used for First Bank Richmond's regulatory reporting requirements. The following table sets forth the portion of our time deposits that are in excess of the FDIC insurance limit, by remaining time until maturity, as of December 31, 2022 (dollars in thousands).

For additional information regarding our deposits, see "Note 9: Deposits" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
Borrowed Funds. We utilize borrowings as a source of funds, especially when they are less costly than deposits and can be invested at a positive interest rate spread, when we desire additional capacity to fund loan demand or when they meet our asset/liability management goals. Our borrowings historically have consisted of advances from the FHLB of Indianapolis. We may obtain advances from the FHLB of Indianapolis upon the security of the capital stock we own in the FHLB and certain of our mortgage loans and investment securities. Such advances may be made pursuant to several different credit programs, each of which has its own interest rate and range of maturities. To the extent such borrowings have different terms to repricing than our deposits, they can change our interest rate risk profile. At December 31, 2022, we had $180.0 million in FHLB advances outstanding. Based on current collateral levels, at December 31, 2022 we could borrow an additional $57.7 million from the FHLB of Indianapolis at prevailing interest rates.
We also have an available line of credit with the FHLB of Indianapolis totaling $10.0 million.
The following table presents the maturity of term borrowings, which consist entirely of FHLB advances, along with associated weighted average rates as of December 31, 2022.

Trust and Financial Services
We provide a variety of fee-based financial services, including trust and estate administration, investment management services, retirement plan administration and private banking services, in our market areas. Trust services are provided to both individual and corporate customers, including personal trust and agency accounts, and employee benefit plans. We also manage private investment accounts for individuals and institutions. Total wealth management assets under management and administration were $138.8 million at December 31, 2022. These activities provide an additional source of fee income to First Bank Richmond and in 2022 constituted 12.8% of our total non-interest income.
Subsidiary and Other Activities
At December 31, 2022, Richmond Mutual Bancorporation had two subsidiaries, First Bank Richmond and First Insurance Management, Inc. First Bank Richmond is our wholly owned banking subsidiary. First Insurance Management, Inc. was formed in 2022 as a pooled captive insurance company subsidiary of the Company, incorporated in the State of Nevada, for the purpose of providing additional insurance coverage for the Company and its subsidiaries related to the operations of the Company for which insurance may not be economically feasible. As of December 31, 2022, First Insurance Management provided us with various liability and property damage policies for the Company and its related subsidiaries. First Insurance Management is regulated by the State of Nevada Division of Insurance.
At December 31, 2022, First Bank Richmond had an active investment subsidiary, FB Richmond Holdings, which is a Nevada corporation that holds substantially all of First Bank Richmond's investment portfolio. As of December 31, 2022, the market value of securities managed was $290.5 million. FB Richmond Holdings has one active subsidiary, FB Richmond Properties, Inc., which is a Delaware corporation holding approximately $101.8 million in loans.
Competition
We face significant competition within our market both in making loans and leases and attracting deposits. Our market area has a high concentration of financial institutions, including large money center and regional banks, community banks and credit unions. Our competition for loans and deposits comes principally from commercial banks, savings institutions, mortgage banking firms, equipment financing companies, consumer finance companies and credit unions. We face additional competition for deposits from short-term money market funds, brokerage firms, mutual funds and insurance companies. We also compete with financial technology, or fintech companies. Recent technology advances and other changes have allowed parties to effect financial transactions that previously required the involvement of banks. For example, consumers can maintain funds in brokerage accounts or mutual funds that would have historically been held as bank deposits. Consumers can also complete transactions such as paying bills and transferring funds directly without the assistance of banks.
Based on the most recent data provided by the FDIC, there are approximately 11 and 19 other commercial banks and savings banks operating in our Indiana and Ohio market areas, respectively. Additionally, there are approximately 14 and seven credit unions operating in these same respective market areas. As of June 30, 2022 (the most recent branch deposit data provided by the FDIC), First Bank Richmond’s share of bank deposits in Wayne and Shelby Counties, in Indiana, was 
approximately 22.1% and 1.3%, respectively, and in Shelby and Miami Counties, in Ohio, was approximately 8.7% and 4.2%, respectively. We do not accept deposits at our loan production office located in Columbus, Ohio.
How We Are Regulated 
General. First Bank Richmond is an Indiana-chartered commercial bank. Its deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. First Bank Richmond is subject to extensive regulation by the IDFI, as its chartering agency, and by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, as its deposit insurer and primary federal regulator. First Bank Richmond is required to file reports with, and is periodically examined by, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the IDFI concerning its activities and financial condition and must obtain regulatory approvals before entering into certain transactions, including, but not limited to, mergers with or acquisitions of other financial institutions. In addition, First Bank Richmond is a member of and owns stock in the FHLB of Indianapolis, which is one of the 11 regional banks in the Federal Home Loan Bank System.
As a bank holding company, Richmond Mutual Bancorporation is subject to examination and supervision by the Federal Reserve Board. Richmond Mutual Bancorporation is also subject to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission under the federal securities laws.
Set forth below is a description of certain laws and regulations that are applicable to First Bank Richmond and Richmond Mutual Bancorporation. This description of statutes and regulations is not intended to be a complete description of such statutes and regulations and their effects on First Bank Richmond and Richmond Mutual Bancorporation. Any change in these laws or regulations, whether by Congress or the applicable regulatory agencies, could have a material adverse impact on Richmond Mutual Bancorporation, First Bank Richmond and their operations.
Indiana Banking Regulation. First Bank Richmond, as an Indiana commercial bank, is regulated and supervised by the Indiana Department of Financial Institutions, or the IDFI. The IDFI is required to regularly examine each state-chartered bank. The approval of the IDFI is required to establish or close branches, to merge with another bank, to issue stock and to undertake many other activities. Any Indiana bank that does not operate according to the regulations, policies and directives of the IDFI may be sanctioned.
The powers that Indiana-chartered banks can exercise under these laws include, but are not limited to, the following:
Lending Activities. An Indiana-chartered commercial bank may make a wide variety of mortgage loans including fixed-rate loans, adjustable-rate loans, variable-rate loans, participation loans, graduated payment loans, construction and development loans, condominium and co-operative loans, second mortgage loans and other types of loans that may be made according to applicable regulations. Commercial loans may be made to corporations and other commercial enterprises with or without security. Consumer and personal loans may also be made with or without security.
Investment Activities. In general, First Bank Richmond may invest in certain types of debt securities, certain types of corporate equity securities, and certain other assets. However, these investment authorities are constrained by federal law. See “- Federal Banking Regulation — Investment Activities” for such federal restrictions.
Loans to One Borrower Limitations. Under Indiana law, First Bank Richmond’s total loans or extensions of credit to a single borrower or group of related borrowers cannot exceed, with specified exceptions, 15% of its capital stock, surplus fund and undivided profits. First Bank Richmond may lend additional amounts up to 10% if the loans or extensions of credit are fully secured by readily-marketable collateral. At December 31, 2022, First Bank Richmond complied with these loans-to-one-borrower limitations. At December 31, 2022, First Bank Richmond’s largest aggregate amount of loans to one borrower was $17.3 million.
Dividends. Under Indiana law, First Bank Richmond is permitted to declare and pay dividends out of its undivided profits. The prior approval of the IDFI is required if the total of all dividends declared in a calendar year would exceed the total of its net income for that year combined with its retained net income for the preceding two years. See “- Federal Banking Regulation — Capital Requirements” and “- Holding Company Regulation” for restrictions on dividends under federal law.
Assessments. As an Indiana state-chartered commercial bank, First Bank Richmond is required to pay to the IDFI a general assessment fee in connection with the regulation and supervision of First Bank Richmond. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, as discussed below, charges all insured depository institutions deposit insurance assessments.
Regulatory Enforcement Authority. Any Indiana bank that does not operate according to the regulations, policies and directives of the IDFI may be subject to sanctions for non-compliance, including seizure of the property and business of the bank and suspension or revocation of its charter. The IDFI may, under certain circumstances, suspend or remove officers or directors who have violated the law, conducted the bank’s business in a manner which is unsafe, unsound or contrary to the depositors' interests or been negligent in the performance of their duties. In addition, upon finding that a bank has engaged in an unfair or deceptive act or practice, the IDFI may issue an order to cease and desist and impose a fine on the bank. Indiana consumer protection and civil rights statutes applicable to First Bank Richmond permit private individual and class action lawsuits and provide for the rescission of consumer transactions, including loans, and the recovery of statutory and punitive damages and attorney’s fees in the case of certain violations of those statutes.
Federal Banking Regulation
Capital Requirements. Federal regulations require FDIC-insured depository institutions, including state-chartered banks, to meet several minimum capital standards: a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio, a Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio, a total capital to risk-based assets and a Tier 1 capital to total assets leverage ratio.
The capital standards require the maintenance of common equity Tier 1 capital, Tier 1 capital and total capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 4.5%, 6% and 8%, respectively. The regulations also establish a minimum required leverage ratio of at least 4% of Tier 1 capital. In addition to establishing the minimum regulatory capital requirements, the regulations limit capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments to management if the institution does not hold a “capital conservation buffer” consisting of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets more than 2.5% above the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements.
At December 31, 2022, First Bank Richmond’s capital exceeded all applicable requirements. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis-Capital Resources” contained in Part II, Item 7 and “Note 17: Regulatory Capital” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statement contained in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
The Financial Accounting Standards Board has adopted a new accounting standard for US GAAP that will be effective for us beginning in 2023. This standard, referred to as Current Expected Credit Loss, or CECL, requires FDIC-insured institutions and their holding companies (banking organizations) to recognize credit losses expected over the life of certain financial assets. CECL covers a broader range of assets than the current method of recognizing credit losses and generally results in earlier recognition of credit losses. Upon adoption of CECL, a banking organization must record a one-time adjustment to its credit loss allowances as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption equal to the difference, if any, between the amount of credit loss allowances under the current methodology and the amount required under CECL. For a banking organization, implementation of CECL is generally likely to reduce retained earnings, and to affect other items, in a manner that reduces its regulatory capital. The federal banking regulators, including the Federal Reserve Board and the FDIC, have adopted a rule that gives a banking organization the option to phase in over a three-year period the day-one adverse effects of CECL on its regulatory capital.
Under the federal prompt corrective action rules, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation is required to take supervisory actions against undercapitalized institutions under its jurisdiction, the severity of which depends upon the institution's level of capital. An institution that has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10% or more, a Tier 1 risk-based ratio of 8.0% or more, a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 6.5% or more and a leverage ratio of 5.0% or more is considered "well capitalized," provided that it is not subject to an agreement, order or directive issued by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation requiring it to meet and maintain a specific capital level. Institutions that are not well capitalized are subject to certain restrictions on brokered deposits and interest rates on deposits. At December 31, 2022, First Bank Richmond met the criteria to be considered "well capitalized."
Standards for Safety and Soundness. Federal law requires each federal banking agency to prescribe certain standards for all insured depository institutions. These standards relate to, among other things, internal controls, information systems and audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate risk exposure, asset growth, compensation and other operational and managerial standards as the agency deems appropriate. Interagency guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards that the federal banking agencies use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired. If the appropriate federal banking agency determines that an institution fails to meet any standard prescribed by the guidelines, the agency may require the institution to submit to the agency an acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the standard. Failure to implement such a plan can result in further enforcement action, including the issuance of a cease-and-desist order or the imposition of civil money penalties.
Commercial Real Estate Lending Concentrations. The federal banking agencies have issued guidance on sound risk management practices for concentrations in commercial real estate lending. The particular focus is on exposure to commercial real estate loans that are dependent on the cash flow from the real estate held as collateral and that are likely to be sensitive to conditions in the commercial real estate market (as opposed to real estate collateral held as a secondary source of repayment or as an abundance of caution). The purpose of the guidance is not to limit a bank’s commercial real estate lending but to guide banks in developing risk management practices and capital levels commensurate with the level and nature of real estate concentrations. The guidance directs the FDIC and other bank regulatory agencies to focus their supervisory resources on institutions that may have significant commercial real estate loan concentration risk. A bank that has experienced rapid growth in commercial real estate lending, has notable exposure to a specific type of commercial real estate loan, or is approaching or exceeding the following supervisory criteria may be identified for further supervisory analysis with respect to real estate concentration risk:
a.Total reported loans for construction, land development and other land represent 100% or more of the bank’s total regulatory capital; or
b.Total commercial real estate loans (as defined in the guidance) represent 300% or more of the bank’s total regulatory capital and the outstanding balance of the bank’s commercial real estate loan portfolio has increased 50% or more during the prior 36 months.
The guidance provides that the strength of an institution’s lending and risk management practices with respect to such concentrations will be taken into account in supervisory guidance on evaluation of capital adequacy. As of December 31, 2022, the Bank’s aggregate recorded loan balances for construction, land development and land loans were 84.9% of total regulatory capital. In addition, at December 31, 2022, the Bank’s loans secured by commercial real estate (as defined in the guidance) represented 338.5% of total regulatory capital.
Investment Activities. All state-chartered Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation-insured banks, including commercial banks, are generally limited in their investment activities to principal and equity investments of the type and in the amount authorized for national banks, notwithstanding state law, subject to certain exceptions.
In addition, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation is authorized to permit such a state bank to engage in state-authorized activities or investments not permissible for national banks (other than non-subsidiary equity investments) if it meets all applicable capital requirements and it is determined that such activities or investments do not pose a significant risk to the Deposit Insurance Fund.
Interstate Banking and Branching. Federal law permits well capitalized and well managed bank holding companies to acquire banks in any state, subject to Federal Reserve Board approval, certain concentration limits and other specified conditions. Interstate mergers of banks are also authorized, subject to regulatory approval and other specified conditions. In addition, banks may establish de novo branches on an interstate basis provided that the branch location is permissible under the law of the host state for banks chartered by that state.
Transaction with Affiliates and Regulation W of the Federal Reserve Regulations. Transactions between banks and their affiliates are governed by federal law. An affiliate of a bank is any company or entity that controls, is controlled by or is under common control with the bank. In a holding company context, the parent bank holding company and any companies which are controlled by such parent holding company are affiliates of the bank (although subsidiaries of the bank itself, except financial subsidiaries, are generally not considered affiliates). Generally, Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act and the Federal Reserve Board’s Regulation W limit the extent to which the bank or its subsidiaries may engage in “covered transactions” with any one affiliate to an amount equal to 10.0% of such institution’s capital stock and surplus, and with all such transactions with all affiliates to an amount equal to 20.0% of such institution’s capital stock and surplus. Section 23B applies to “covered transactions” as well as to certain other transactions and requires that all such transactions be on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable, to the institution or subsidiary as those provided to a non-affiliate. The term “covered transaction” includes the making of loans to, purchase of assets from, and issuance of a guarantee to an affiliate, and other similar transactions. Section 23B transactions also include the provision of services and the sale of assets by a bank to an affiliate. In addition, loans or other extensions of credit by the financial institution to the affiliate are required to be collateralized according to the requirements set forth in Section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act.
Sections 22(h) and (g) of the Federal Reserve Act place restrictions on loans to a bank’s insiders, i.e., executive officers, directors and principal shareholders. Section 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act requires that loans to directors, executive officers and principal shareholders be made on terms substantially the same as offered in comparable transactions to other persons and also requires prior board approval for certain loans. In addition, the aggregate amount of 
extensions of credit by a financial institution to insiders cannot exceed the institution’s unimpaired capital and surplus. Section 22(g) of the Federal Reserve Act places additional restrictions on loans to executive officers.
Enforcement. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has extensive enforcement authority over insured state-chartered banks that are not members of the Federal Reserve System (referred to as non-member banks), including First Bank Richmond. The enforcement authority includes, among other things, the ability to assess civil money penalties, issue cease and desist orders and remove directors and officers. In general, these enforcement actions may be initiated in response to violations of laws and regulations, breaches of fiduciary duty and unsafe or unsound practices. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation is required, with certain exceptions, to appoint a receiver or conservator for an insured state non-member bank if that bank was “critically undercapitalized” on average during the calendar quarter beginning 270 days after the date on which the institution became “critically undercapitalized.” It may also appoint itself as conservator or receiver for an insured state non-member bank under specified circumstances, including, among others: (1) insolvency; (2) substantial dissipation of assets or earnings through violations of law or unsafe or unsound practices; (3) existence of an unsafe or unsound condition to transact business; (4) insufficient capital; or (5) the incurrence of losses that will deplete substantially all of the institution’s capital with no reasonable prospect of replenishment without federal assistance.
Insurance of Deposit Accounts. First Bank Richmond is a member of the Deposit Insurance Fund, which is administered by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Deposit accounts in First Bank Richmond are insured up to a maximum of $250,000 for each separately insured depositor.
The FDIC assesses deposit insurance premiums on all FDIC-insured institutions quarterly based on annualized rates. Under these rules, assessment rates for an institution with total assets of less than $10 billion are determined by weighted average CAMELS composite ratings and certain financial ratios, and range from 1.5 to 30.0 basis points, subject to certain adjustments. 
Extraordinary growth in insured deposits during the first and second quarters of 2020 caused the Deposit Insurance Fund reserve ratio to decline below the statutory minimum of 1.35 percent as of June 30, 2020. In September 2020, the FDIC Board of Directors adopted a Restoration Plan to restore the reserve ratio to at least 1.35 percent within eight years, absent extraordinary circumstances, as required by the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. The Restoration Plan maintained the assessment rate schedules in place at the time and required the FDIC to update its analysis and projections for the deposit insurance fund balance and reserve ratio at least semiannually.
In the semiannual update for the Restoration Plan in June 2022, the FDIC projected that the reserve ratio was at risk of not reaching the statutory minimum of 1.35 percent by September 30, 2028, the statutory deadline to restore the reserve ratio. Based on this update, the FDIC Board approved an Amended Restoration Plan, and concurrently proposed an increase in initial base deposit insurance assessment rate schedules by 2 basis points, applicable to all insured depository institutions. In October 2022, the FDIC Board finalized the increase with an effective date of January 1, 2023, applicable to the first quarterly assessment period of 2023. The revised assessment rate schedules are intended to increase the likelihood that the reserve ratio of the DIF reaches the statutory minimum level of 1.35 percent by September 30, 2028. 
For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, First Bank Richmond paid $414,000 in FDIC premiums. Assessment rates are applied to an institution's assessment base, which is its average consolidated total assets minus its average tangible equity during the assessment period.
The FDIC has authority to increase insurance assessments, and in a banking industry emergency the FDIC may also impose a special assessment. Any significant increases in insurance assessment may have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and results of operations of Richmond Mutual Bancorporation and First Bank Richmond. Management cannot predict what assessment rates will be in the future.
Insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that an institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC. We do not currently know of any practice, condition, or violation that may lead to termination of First Bank Richmond’s deposit insurance.
Community Reinvestment Act. Under the Community Reinvestment Act, or CRA, as implemented by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, a state non-member bank, such as First Bank Richmond, has a continuing and affirmative obligation, consistent with its safe and sound operation, to help meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. The CRA does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions, nor does it limit an institution’s discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are 
best suited to its particular community, consistent with the CRA. The CRA requires the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, in connection with its examination of a state non-member bank, to assess the institution’s record of meeting the credit needs of its community and to take such record into account in its evaluation of certain applications by such institution, including applications to acquire branches and other financial institutions. The CRA requires the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to provide a written evaluation of an institution’s CRA performance utilizing a four-tiered descriptive rating system. First Bank Richmond’s latest Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation CRA rating was “Satisfactory.”
Consumer Protection and Fair Lending Regulations. Indiana chartered banks are subject to a variety of federal and Indiana statutes and regulations that are intended to protect consumers and prohibit discrimination in the granting of credit. These statutes and regulations provide for a range of sanctions for non-compliance with their terms, including imposition of administrative fines and remedial orders, and referral to the Attorney General for prosecution of a civil action for actual and punitive damages and injunctive relief. Certain of these statutes, including Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, which prohibits unfair and deceptive acts and practices against consumers, authorize private individual and class action lawsuits and the award of actual, statutory and punitive damages and attorneys’ fees for certain types of violations. The Dodd-Frank Act prohibits unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices against consumers, which can be enforced by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and state Attorneys General.
USA Patriot Act. First Bank Richmond is subject to the USA PATRIOT Act, which gives federal agencies additional powers to address terrorist threats through enhanced domestic security measures, expanded surveillance powers, increased information sharing, and broadened anti-money laundering requirements. The USA PATRIOT Act includes measures intended to encourage information sharing among bank regulatory agencies and law enforcement bodies, and imposes affirmative obligations on a broad range of financial institutions, including banks, thrifts, brokers, dealers, credit unions, money transfer agents, and parties registered under the Commodity Exchange Act.
Other Regulations. Interest and other charges collected or contracted for by First Bank Richmond are subject to state usury laws and federal laws concerning interest rates. First Bank Richmond’s operations are also subject to state and federal laws applicable to credit and other transactions, such as the:
•Truth in Lending Act, which requires lenders to disclose the terms and conditions of consumer credit;
•Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, which requires lenders to disclose the nature and costs of the real estate settlement process and prohibits specific practices, such as kickbacks, and places limitations upon the use of escrow accounts;
•Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, requiring financial institutions to provide information to enable the public and public officials to determine whether a financial institution is fulfilling its obligation to help meet the housing needs of the community it serves;
•Equal Credit Opportunity Act, prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, creed or other prohibited factors in extending credit;
•Fair Credit Reporting Act, governing the use and provision of information to credit reporting agencies; and
•Rules and regulations of the various federal and state agencies charged with the responsibility of implementing such federal and state laws.
The deposit operations of First Bank Richmond also are subject to, among others, the:
•Truth in Savings Act, which requires financial institutions to disclose the terms and conditions of their deposit accounts;
•Expedited Funds Availability Act, which requires banks to make funds deposited in transaction accounts available to their customers within specified time frames;
•Right to Financial Privacy Act, which imposes a duty to maintain confidentiality of consumer financial records and prescribes procedures for complying with administrative subpoenas of financial records;
•Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act (also known as “Check 21”), which gives “substitute checks,” such as digital check images and copies made from that image, the same legal standing as the original paper check;
•Electronic Funds Transfer Act and Regulation E promulgated thereunder, which govern automatic deposits to and withdrawals from deposit accounts and customers’ rights and liabilities arising from the use of automated teller machines and other electronic banking services; and
•Indiana banking laws and regulations governing deposit powers and other matters.
Federal Home Loan Bank System. First Bank Richmond is a member of the FHLB of Indianapolis, one of the 11 regional FHLBs which provide a central credit facility primarily for member institutions. Member institutions are required to acquire and hold shares of capital stock in the FHLB. This stock has no quoted market value and is carried at cost. First Bank Richmond reviews the cost basis of the FHLB stock for ultimate recoverability regularly. At December 31, 2022, no impairment of the value of the stock has been recognized. As of December 31, 2022, the Bank had $180.0 million of FHLB advances and $10.0 million available on its line of credit with the FHLB.
Federal Reserve System. The Federal Reserve requires all depository institutions to maintain reserves at specified levels against their transaction accounts, primarily checking accounts. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Federal Reserve reduced the reserve requirement ratio to zero percent effective on March 26, 2020, to support lending to households and businesses. At December 31, 2022, the Bank was in compliance with the reserve requirements. 
The Bank is authorized to borrow from the Federal Reserve Bank "discount window." An eligible institution need not exhaust other sources of funds before going to the discount window, nor are there restrictions on the purposes for which the institution can use primary credit. At December 31, 2022, the Bank had no outstanding borrowings from the discount window.
Acquisitions. An acquisition of Richmond Mutual Bancorporation or First Bank Richmond, an acquisition of control of either, or an acquisition by either of another bank holding company or depository institution or control of such a company or institution would generally be subject to prior approval by applicable federal and state banking regulators, as would certain acquisitions by Richmond Mutual Bancorporation or First Bank Richmond of other types of entities.  "Control" is defined in various ways for this purpose, including but not limited to control of 10% of outstanding voting stock of an entity. See “– Holding Company Regulation” below.
Holding Company Regulation. Richmond Mutual Bancorporation is a bank holding company within the meaning of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended. As such, Richmond Mutual Bancorporation is registered with the Federal Reserve Board and is subject to regulations, examinations, supervision and reporting requirements applicable to bank holding companies. In addition, the Federal Reserve Board has enforcement authority over Richmond Mutual Bancorporation and its non-bank subsidiaries. Among other things, this authority permits the Federal Reserve Board to restrict or prohibit activities that are determined to be a serious risk to the subsidiary bank.
A bank holding company is generally prohibited from engaging in non-banking activities, or acquiring direct or indirect control of more than 5% of the voting securities of any company engaged in non-banking activities.
The Federal Reserve Board is required to establish for all bank and savings and loan holding companies, minimum consolidated capital requirements that are as stringent as those required for the insured depository subsidiaries. Consolidated regulatory capital requirements identical to those applicable to the subsidiary banks apply to bank holding companies with less than $3.0 billion of consolidated assets.
A bank holding company is generally required to give the Federal Reserve Board prior written notice of any purchase or redemption of then outstanding equity securities if the gross consideration for the purchase or redemption, when combined with the net consideration paid for all such purchases or redemptions during the preceding 12 months, is equal to 10% or more of the company’s consolidated net worth. The Federal Reserve Board may disapprove such a purchase or redemption if it determines that the proposal would constitute an unsafe and unsound practice, or would violate any law, regulation, Federal Reserve Board order or directive, or any condition imposed by, or written agreement with, the Federal Reserve Board. There is an exception to this approval requirement for well-capitalized bank holding companies that meet certain other conditions.
The Federal Reserve Board has issued a policy statement regarding capital distributions, including dividends, by bank holding companies. In general, the policies provide that dividends should be paid only out of current earnings and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention by the bank holding company appears consistent with the organization’s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. The policies also require that a bank holding company serve as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary banks (referred to as the source of strength doctrine) by standing ready to use available resources to provide adequate capital funds to those banks during periods of financial stress or adversity and by maintaining the financial flexibility and capital-raising capacity to obtain additional resources for assisting its subsidiary banks where necessary. 
However, the ability of a bank holding company to pay dividends may be restricted if a subsidiary bank becomes undercapitalized. These regulatory policies could affect the ability of Richmond Mutual Bancorporation to pay dividends or otherwise engage in capital distributions.
Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, depository institutions are liable to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation for losses suffered or anticipated by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in connection with the default of a commonly controlled depository institution or any assistance provided by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to such an institution in danger of default.
Federal Securities Laws. Richmond Mutual Bancorporation’s common stock is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Richmond Mutual Bancorporation is subject to the information, proxy solicitation, insider trading restrictions and other requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
Emerging Growth Company Status. The JOBS Act, which was enacted in April 2012, has made numerous changes to the federal securities laws to facilitate access to capital markets. Under the JOBS Act, a company with total annual gross revenues of less than $1.07 billion during its most recently completed fiscal year qualifies as an “emerging growth company.” Richmond Mutual Bancorporation qualifies as and has elected to be an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act.
An “emerging growth company” may choose not to hold non-binding advisory stockholder votes on annual executive compensation (more frequently referred to as “say-on-pay” votes) or on executive compensation payable in connection with a merger (more frequently referred to as “say-on-golden parachute” votes). An emerging growth company also is not subject to the requirement that its auditors attest to the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting and can provide scaled disclosure regarding executive compensation. Richmond Mutual Bancorporation is also not subject to the auditor attestation requirement or additional executive compensation disclosure so long as it remains a “smaller reporting company” under Securities and Exchange Commission regulations. Finally, an emerging growth company may elect to comply with new or amended accounting pronouncements in the same manner as a private company. Such an election is irrevocable during the period a company is an emerging growth company. Richmond Mutual Bancorporation has elected to comply with new or amended accounting pronouncements in the same manner as a private company.
A company loses emerging growth company status on the earlier of: (i) the last day of the fiscal year of the company during which it had total annual gross revenues of $1.0 billion or more; (ii) the last day of the fiscal year of the issuer following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of common equity securities of the company pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933; (iii) the date on which such company has, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt; or (iv) the date on which such company is deemed to be a “large accelerated filer” under Securities and Exchange Commission regulations.
Taxation
The following discussion of federal and state taxation is intended only to summarize material income tax matters and is not a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to Richmond Mutual Bancorporation and First Bank Richmond.
Federal Taxation. Richmond Mutual Bancorporation and First Bank Richmond are subject to federal income taxation in the same general manner as other corporations, with some exceptions discussed below. Our federal and state tax returns have not been audited for the past five years.
Method of Accounting. For federal income tax purposes, we currently report our income and expenses on the accrual method of accounting and use a tax year ending December 31 for filing its federal income tax returns. Richmond Mutual Bancorporation and First Bank Richmond will file a consolidated federal income tax return.
Capital Loss Carryovers. A corporation cannot recognize capital losses in excess of capital gains generated. Generally, a financial institution may carry back capital losses to the preceding three taxable years and forward to the succeeding five taxable years. Any capital loss carryback or carryover is treated as a short-term capital loss for the year to which it is carried. As such, it is grouped with any other capital losses for the year to which it is carried and is used to offset any capital gains. Any loss remaining after the five-year carryover period is not deductible. At December 31, 2022, we had no capital loss carryovers.
Corporate Dividends. Richmond Mutual Bancorporation may generally exclude from its income 100% of dividends received from First Bank Richmond as a member of the same affiliated group of corporations.
State Taxation. First Bank Richmond is subject to Indiana’s financial institutions tax, which is imposed at a flat rate as of December 31, 2022, of 5.0% on “adjusted gross income” apportioned to Indiana. “Adjusted gross income,” for purposes of the financial institutions tax, begins with taxable income as defined by Section 63 of the Internal Revenue Code and incorporates federal tax law to the extent that it affects the computation of taxable income. Federal taxable income is then adjusted by several Indiana modifications including only considering members of the combined group which have Indiana nexus. The Indiana legislature started reducing the financial institutions tax from 8.5% to 6.0% in 0.5% increments over a seven-year period that commenced in 2014. The full rate reduction to 4.9% will be phased in fully by 2023. First Bank Richmond is not currently under audit with respect to its Indiana tax returns.
First Bank Richmond is also subject to Ohio taxation in the same general manner as other financial institutions. In particular, Richmond Mutual Bancorporation and First Bank Richmond will be subject to the Ohio corporation franchise tax, which is an excise tax imposed on corporations for the privilege of doing business in Ohio, owning capital or property in Ohio, holding a charter or certificate of compliance authorizing the corporation to do business in Ohio, or otherwise having nexus with Ohio during a calendar year. For Ohio franchise tax purposes, financial institutions are currently taxed at a rate equal to 0.8% of apportioned net capital.
Other applicable state taxes include generally applicable sales and use taxes plus real and personal property taxes.
As a Maryland business corporation, Richmond Mutual Bancorporation is required to file an annual report with and pay franchise taxes to the State of Maryland.
Employees and Human Capital
As of December 31, 2022, we had 181 full-time equivalent employees. Our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining group. Management believes that we have a good working relationship with our employees.
To facilitate talent attraction and retention, we strive to make First Bank Richmond an inclusive, safe and healthy workplace, with opportunities for our employees to grow and develop in their careers, supported by strong compensation, benefits, health and welfare programs. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 73% of our workforce was female and 27% male, and our average tenure was 10.6 years. As part of our compensation philosophy, we believe that we must offer and maintain market competitive total rewards programs for our employees in order to attract and retain superior talent.

We provide our employees and their families with access to a variety of flexible and convenient health and welfare programs, including benefits that support their physical and mental health by providing tools and resources to help them improve or maintain their health status. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented significant operating environment changes that we determined were in the best interest of our employees, as well as the communities in which we operate, and which comply with government regulations. This includes giving some employees the ability to work from home, while implementing additional safety measures for employees continuing critical on-site work.
A core tenet of our talent system is to both develop talent from within and supplement with external hires. This approach has yielded loyalty and commitment in our employee base which in turn grows our business, our products, and our customers, while adding new employees and external ideas supports a continuous improvement mindset. We believe that our 10.6 year average tenure reflects the engagement of our employees in this core talent system tenet.
