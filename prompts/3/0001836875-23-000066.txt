Item 1.    Business
Unless the context otherwise requires, references in this section to “we,” “us” and “our” and to “Nuvve” and the “Company” are to Nuvve Corporation and its subsidiaries for periods prior to the Business Combination ( as described under "Corporate Information" below) and Nuvve Holding Corp. and its subsidiaries, including Nuvve Corporation, for periods after the Business Combination.
Nuvve Holding Corp., a Delaware corporation, has developed a proprietary vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology, including its Grid Integrated Vehicle (“GIVe™”) cloud-based software platform, that enables it to link multiple electric vehicle (“EV”) batteries into a virtual power plant to provide bi-directional energy to the electrical grid in a qualified and secure manner. 
Combining our innovative V2G technology and an ecosystem of electrification partners, we dynamically manage power among electric vehicle (EV) batteries and the grid to deliver new value to EV owners, accelerate the adoption of EVs, and support the world’s transition to clean energy. With products designed to transform EVs into mobile energy storage assets and networking battery capacity to support shifting energy needs, we are working toward making the grid more resilient, enhancing sustainable transportation, and supporting energy equity in an electrified world. Since our founding in 2010, we have successfully deployed V2G projects on five continents and we offer electrification solutions for fleets of all types. 
Overview of Our Technology
Our platform dynamically manages power to and from EVs and the grid at scale. Our intelligent vehicle-to-grid technology allows EV owners to efficiently meet the energy demands of individual vehicles and entire fleets. With our V2G technology, the grid becomes more resilient through the benefits of greater networked battery capacity.
Our Grid Integrated Vehicle (“GIVe”) software platform enables us to aggregate multiple EV batteries into a virtual power plant (“VPP”) to provide bidirectional services to the electrical grid in a qualified and secure manner. VPPs can generate revenue by selling excess power to utility companies, utilizing the stored power to perform grid services, or reduce building energy peak consumption. With our technology, we are capable of providing many levels of vehicle-grid integration (“VGI”) and V2G services such as time of use optimization (“TOU”), demand response, demand charge management and wholesale energy market participation, thereby providing revenues from grid services as well as utility bill savings behind the meter.
Our longest running commercial operation is in Denmark, where we have provided V2G services for more than five years with daily bidding on energy markets. Specifically, this operation aggregates a coalition of EV batteries to provide a primary frequency containment reserve (“FCR”) service to the local transmission system operator. The frequency of the current transmitted on an electrical grid is affected by the demand placed on the grid. By acting as a reserve to store or release energy into the grid in order to offset variations in demand, the FCR service provided by our GIVe platform assists the local system operator in the critical task of frequency regulation. 
Over the five-plus years of this deployment, we have accumulated many hours of valuable learning on fleet operation and energy market behavior. This Denmark-based fleet is driven primarily during the day and is parked at night and on weekends, allowing it on average about 17 hours of available market participation per day. While FCR values in Denmark fluctuate year over year, we have been able to generate approximately US$3,000 per car per year in market revenue on average.
The V2G services revenue gives our customers a lower total cost of EVs ownership through benefits such as reduced charger costs, low or free energy costs to drive, fleet management tools, and yearly maintenance. This Denmark deployment showcases our ability to adapt our V2G software to match requirements for market participation and interconnection to the grid — vehicles in this commercial V2G operation are each connected to 10kW bidirectional DC chargers that are controlled by our V2G GIVe platform. As each vehicle is plugged in, our software automatically takes control of each vehicle’s charging and discharging. We aggregate multiple EVs into a VPP. The total available capacity from a coalition of aggregated EVs is bid onto the frequency-controlled reserve market. It is the design of our V2G platform that enables us to aggregate EVs into a VPP to provide services to the grid bidirectionally. This design incorporates (1) aggregation capabilities for available vehicles, charging stations and stationary batteries; (2) the ability to receive signals from and thereby know the needs of the grid at generation, transmission, distribution and behind-the-meter regions; and (3) real-time optimization that matches available coalition capacity onto grid needs on a second-by-second basis, all while ensuring the desired EV battery charge level at drive time.
Electric vehicles are inherently unreliable grid resources because their primary transportation function can cause them to be plugged in or unplugged at any time with varying states of charge. Our platform transforms these unreliable resources into reliable, dispatchable and monetizable assets; this helps stabilize the grid, enables increased renewables penetration, reduces the total cost of EV ownership and encourages EV adoption. From the user perspective, the V2G operation is seamless as our V2G platform reduces the cost of ownership and ensures EVs are sufficiently charged to meet their primary transportation functions. Vehicle operators can use our fleet management app and set driving needs for any given day to fulfill their driving duties.
Market Opportunity and the Our Solution
The EV industry has grown rapidly since we were founded in 2010. According to the Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF) Electric Vehicle Outlook 2022, an estimated 720 million EVs will be on the road by 2040. In addition, countries around the world are expected to become increasingly focused on meeting climate goals, in part, by reducing the environmental effects of internal combustion engine vehicles, which account for approximately 45% of global CO2 emissions (source: ourworldindata.org). 
As EV adoption grows, the associated charging infrastructure needed to support EVs has also seen a growth trend over the last few years. According to a September 2021 report from Schroders, the number of public charging points has grown from just over 600,000 at the end of 2018 to reach over 1.3 million by the end of 2020. The same report projects the annual run-rate of investment in charging points will be $80 billion over the next 20 years.
Additional factors propelling this shift to electrification include proposed fossil fuel bans or restrictions, transit electrification mandates, utility incentive programs and declining battery costs. 
However, as EV adoption grows, demand for electricity as a transportation fuel may lead to congestion and overloading on transmission and local distribution grids. A significant investment is predicted to be needed to upgrade the electric grid to support this influx.
Simultaneously, higher penetration of renewable energy sources (such as solar and wind generation) inherently increases grid volatility. We believe that this combination of factors further drives the need for intelligent VGI and V2G capabilities to effectively regulate grid voltage and frequency on a real time basis and address other common challenges such as massive morning and afternoon grid ramping.
With V2G services capturing available grid value streams such as frequency regulation, adaptive power, smart charging, smart charging/discharging, and peak-shaving services as part of the solution, the EV fleet owner/operator can symbiotically assist in improving and assuring grid stabilization while earning revenues. These revenues can be shared with the ratepayer to save in transportation energy costs and thereby effectively lower the cost of EV ownership. V2G services can also help mitigate intermittency issues associated with renewables by (1) continuously injecting or absorbing energy to and from the grid every few seconds to help to regulate frequency; and (2) orderly and intelligently dispatching energy over a larger time period to mitigate the enormous needs for capacity ramping. Perhaps most importantly, EVs represent one of the most appropriate solutions to act as dispatchable distributed energy resources during renewable-rich mid-day periods by absorbing excess energy which might otherwise be curtailed or create transmission network congestion problems.
We understand that the widespread adoption of electric mobility and renewable generation resources like solar and wind will require that EVs be utilized as bidirectional distributed energy resources to help stabilize the grid and be compensated for providing valuable grid services. Further, we believe that commercial fleet EVs represent the best initial addressable market for V2G because for commercial fleets, the shift from internal combustion vehicles to EV can bring numerous advantages:
1.Lower “fuel” costs and more sustainable, efficient and convenient infrastructure.
2.Lower maintenance costs for EVs compared to internal combustion engine vehicles.
3.Reduced maintenance downtime for EVs compared to internal combustion engine vehicles.
4.EV charging does not present all of the same environmental risks of liquid refueling, as it does not involve the storage and release of hydrocarbons at the refueling site.
5.The specific use cases for EVs by fleet operators, which often involve multiple shorter trips, can alleviate the range anxiety that has been a limiting factor in EV adoption to date.
Additionally, we believe that commercial fleet EVs are the best initial target market for V2G because the additional revenue potential would offset the higher up-front cost of EVs and further lower the total cost of ownership compared to traditional gasoline and diesel internal combustion engine vehicles.
We also believe that significant value can be derived from aggregating EVs into a VPP to provide grid services that can be monetized in the energy and power capacity markets. Our GIVe software platform was created to harness capacity from “loads” at the edge of the distribution grid (i.e., coalitions of aggregated EVs and small stationary batteries) in a qualified, controlled and secure manner to provide many of the grid services offered by conventional generation sources (i.e., coal and natural gas plants). Our current addressable energy and capacity markets for targeted grid services (frequency regulation, demand charge management, demand response, energy optimization, distribution grid services and energy arbitrage) are estimated to be of considerable value — each ranging from $3 billion to $250 billion per year.
Since 2010, we have been optimizing our energy software as a service (SaaS) model into a product that is adaptable (evolving with energy markets worldwide), adjustable (micro-service based to enable quick iteration) and scalable (compatible with widely adopted standards for EVs and charging stations). The result is a flexible, recurring revenue model where fleet customers can share in the value generated from their vehicles by our GIVe software platform. Today, we continue to advance our software platform’s ability to conduct forecasting, bidding, dispatching and reporting functionalities — so that the needs of the driver, the grid and the EV battery are continually met.
Our Strategy
Our strategy incorporates a diversified set of segments, geographies and partners, including light duty fleets, heavy duty fleets, automotive original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”), charge point operators, and strategic partnerships located in Europe, Asia (including Japan) and North America.
•Light duty fleet customers are typically organizations that operate vehicle fleets for delivery and logistics, as shared transit for sales, service and other functions requiring a motorpool and for ridesharing services. We believe these customers choose to electrify their fleets for economic reasons, as the comparative total cost of ownership favors electrification. Our GIVe software platform can help them lower operating costs and achieve sustainability goals. We offer networked charging stations, infrastructure, software, professional services, support, monitoring and parts and labor warranties required to run electric vehicle fleets, as well as low or free energy costs. The light duty fleet segment is accessed via direct sales force and world-wide channel partners.
•Heavy duty fleet customers are typically organizations that operate vehicle fleets in the school bus, shuttle bus, delivery truck, refuse truck, and transit bus segments. We believe these customers choose to electrify their fleets for economic reasons, as the comparative total cost of ownership favors electrification. Our GIVe software platform can help them lower operating costs and achieve sustainability goals. We offer networked charging stations, infrastructure, software, professional services, support, monitoring and parts and labor warranties required to run electric vehicle fleets, as well as low or free energy costs. The heavy duty fleet segment is accessed via direct sales force and world-wide channel partners.
•Automotive OEM customers are typically organizations that develop and manufacture electric vehicles targeted for sale to their customers. We believes automotive OEM customers recognize that our GIVe software platform can help their customers lower operating costs and achieve sustainability goals, thereby helping to increase electric vehicle sales. We integrate our technology into the automotive OEM’s EV platforms in order to make their vehicles compatible with the GIVe software platform. The automotive OEM segment is accessed via world-wide channel partners.
•Charge point operator customers are typically organizations that own, operate and provide EV charging equipment and networked EV charging services. We believe charge point operator customers recognize that our GIVe software platform can help their customers lower operating costs and achieve sustainability goals, thereby helping to increase the relative attractiveness of their charging network within this highly competitive segment. We integrate our technology into charge point operator platforms in order to make their charging station network compatible with the GIVe software platform. The charge point operator segment is accessed via world-wide channel partners.
•Strategic partnerships are typically joint ventures formed with strategic partners to help commercialize our technology and services within a given territory. We believe strategic partnerships are an important way to accelerate the adoption of our GIVe software platform world-wide. One such strategic partnership is Dreev, a business venture formed in 2019 between us (who provided our technology and know-how) and our strategic partner Électricité de France (“EDF”) (who provided capital and a subsidiary partner ecosystem) to address the territory within France, United Kingdom, Belgium, Italy and Germany. We agreed to assign to Dreev our rights to the V2G technology in these territories. We presently hold a 13% interest in Dreev. The parties have certain put and call option rights under the agreements for the business venture, including a call option for each party upon a change in control of the other party. While we anticipate that we will maintain or increase our stake in the business venture, there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so.
We currently view the North American school bus segment to be one of our highest priorities world-wide. We anticipate the electrification of school buses to experience significant growth in the next two to five years, as there are over 600,000 school buses on the road today in the US and Canada. Approximately 95% of them are diesel with an average age of over 11 years. Leading school bus OEMs are thereby ramping up their electric bus production capacity in response to an increasing interest from school districts and fleet operators across the US and Canada. The electric school bus segment thereby represents a key growth opportunity for us to sell V2G capable charging stations and establish long-term recurring revenue streams from grid services. 
Following announcements during 2020 with leading OEMs in the North American electric school bus segment, we formed Levo Mobility LLC ("Levo"), a Delaware limited liability company, with Stonepeak Rocket Holdings LP ("Stonepeak"), a Delaware limited partnership, and Evolve Transition Infrastructure LP ("Evolve"), a Delaware limited partnership, to further develop our offerings to bring turnkey V2G solutions with finance packages to customers, including equipment financing, V2G services, infrastructure and maintenance operations. Levo is our consolidated subsidiary.
Levo is a sustainable infrastructure company focused on rapidly advancing the electrification of transportation by funding V2G-enabled EV fleet deployments. Levo utilizes our V2G technology and committed capital from Stonepeak and Evolve to offer Fleet-as-a-Service for school buses, last-mile delivery, ride hailing and ride sharing, municipal services, and more to eliminate the primary barriers to EV fleet adoption including large upfront capital investments and lack of expertise in securing and managing EVs and associated charging infrastructure.
Levo's turnkey solution simplifies and streamlines electrification, can lower the total cost of EV operation for fleet owners, and support the grid when the EVs are not in use. For a fixed monthly payment with no upfront cost, Levo will provide the EVs, such as electric school buses, charging infrastructure powered by our V2G platform, EV and charging station maintenance, energy management, and technical advice.
Levo will initially focus on electrifying school buses, providing associated charging infrastructure, and delivering V2G services to enable safer and healthier transportation for children while supporting carbon dioxide emission reduction, renewable energy integration, and improved grid resiliency.
We also operate a small number of company-owned charging stations serving as demonstration projects funded by government grants. In previous years, a substantial portion of our revenues have been derived from these grant funded projects, and we expect growth in company-owned stations and the related government grant funding to continue. We anticipate that such projects will constitute a declining percentage of our business as our commercial operations expand.
We expect to generate revenue primarily from the provision of services to the grid via our GIVe software platform and sales of V2G-enabled charging stations. In the case of light duty fleet and heavy duty fleet customers, we also may receive a mobility fee, which is a recurring fixed payment made by fleet customers per fleet vehicle. In addition, we may generate non-recurring engineering services revenue derived from the integration of our technology with automotive OEMs and charge point operators. In the case of recurring grid services revenue generated via automotive OEM and charge point operator customer integrations, we may share the recurring grid services revenue with the customer. Presently, grid services revenue comprises a small portion of our revenue, but we expect this portion to grow.
By employing a capital-light business model, we are able to strategically allocate our capital into research and development, marketing and sales and public policy. We continue to invest in expanding our GIVe software platform and V2G service capabilities and in the other areas described below, as well as in the service and maintenance of our company-owned stations and those stations with service and maintenance plans.
•The development and advancement of our GIVe software platform’s capabilities is critical to fulfilling our product vision for a platform that is adaptable, adjustable and scalable.
•We believe it is important to continue developing our global sales channels and grow our direct sales capabilities in order to support customer acquisition. This includes expanding our network of global partners who sell, install and maintain our solutions. We have and will continue to focus on category awareness and consistent branding.
•We continue to invest in our long-running efforts in policy and utility relationships. We advocate for policies that advance electric mobility and ensure a healthy industry with a focus on reduction in the barriers to bi-directional/V2G-capable infrastructure deployment, including interconnection processes and advocating for EVs and charging stations to be considered as distributed energy resources able to participate in wholesale energy markets.
Today, we believe we are the “first-mover” in the V2G space with clear competitive advantages, as described in “Competition” below.
We expect significant market opportunities for our V2G solutions as fleet EVs begin to arrive in more meaningful volume in coming years. We believe that our patent portfolio and significant experience in successfully deploying V2G technology and services presents a significant advantage.
Our growth strategies for scaling our V2G technology and services are as follows:
•Accelerate new services and product offerings. We intend to maintain our first-mover advantage via continued efficient investment in engineering and product development.
•Invest in marketing and sales. We intend to continue attracting new customers and pursue a “portfolio effect” model which enables both V2G and uni-directional (V1G) assets to be efficiently combined in order to boost overall value.
•Pursue strategic acquisitions. We will explore potential high-quality acquisition opportunities.
Government Regulation and Incentives
State, regional and local regulations for installation of EV charging stations and the provision of grid services vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and may include permitting requirements, inspection requirements, licensing of contractors and certifications, as examples. Compliance with such regulations may cause installation delays.
Public Utility Commissions
To operate our systems, we or our customer obtains interconnection permission from the applicable local primary electric utility. Depending on local law requirements, permission is provided by the local utility directly to us and/or our customers. In some cases, permissions are issued on the basis of a standard process that has been pre-approved by the local public utility commission or other regulatory body with jurisdiction over metering policies. However, in other cases, regulatory approvals from the local public utility commission or other regulatory body are required.
NEMA
The National Electrical Manufacturers Association (“NEMA”) is the association of electrical equipment and medical imaging manufacturers. NEMA provides a forum for the development of technical standards that are in the best interests of the industry and users, advocacy of industry policies on legislative and regulatory matters, and collection, analysis, and dissemination of industry data. All charging station products used or sold by us comply with the NEMA standards that are applicable to such products.
Waste Handling and Disposal
We are subject to laws and regulations regarding the handling and disposal of hazardous substances and solid wastes, including electronic wastes and batteries. These laws generally regulate the generation, storage, treatment, transportation, and disposal of solid and hazardous waste, and may impose strict, joint and several liability for the investigation and remediation of areas where hazardous substances may have been released or disposed. For instance, Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), also known as the Superfund law, in the United States and comparable state laws impose liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons that contributed to the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. These persons include current and prior owners or operators of the site where the release occurred as well as companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances found at the site. Under CERCLA, these persons may be subject to joint and several strict liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies. CERCLA also authorizes the EPA and, in some instances, third parties to act in response to threats to the public health or the environmental and to seek to recover from the responsible classes of persons the costs they incur. We may handle hazardous substances within the meaning of CERCLA, or similar state statutes, in the course of ordinary operations and, as a result, may be jointly and severally liable under CERCLA for all or part of the costs required to clean up sites at which these hazardous substances have been released into the environment.
We may also generate solid wastes, which may include hazardous wastes that are subject to the requirements of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”), and comparable state statutes. While RCRA regulates both solid and hazardous wastes, it imposes strict requirements on the generation, storage, treatment, transportation and disposal of hazardous wastes. Certain components of products used or sold by us are excluded from RCRA’s hazardous waste regulations, provided certain requirements are met. However, if these components do not meet all of the established requirements for the exclusion, or if the requirements for the exclusion change, we may be required to treat such products as hazardous waste, which are subject to more rigorous and costly disposal requirements. Any such changes in the laws and regulations, or our ability to qualify the materials it uses for exclusions under such laws and regulations, could adversely affect our operating expenses.
Similar laws exist in other jurisdictions where we operate. Additionally, in the European Union (“EU”), we are subject to the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (“WEEE”) Directive. The WEEE Directive provides for the creation of collection scheme where consumers return WEEE to merchants, such as us. If we fail to properly manage such WEEE, we may be subject to fines, sanctions, or other actions that may adversely affect our financial operations.
OSHA
We are subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, as amended (“OSHA”). OSHA establishes certain employer responsibilities, including maintenance of a workplace free of recognized hazards likely to cause death or serious injury, compliance with standards promulgated by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and various record keeping, 
disclosure and procedural requirements. Various standards, including standards for notices of hazards, safety in excavation and demolition work and the handling of asbestos, may apply to our operations. We comply with OSHA regulations.
CAFE Standards
The regulations mandated by the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (“CAFE”) standards set the average new vehicle fuel economy, as weighted by sales, that a manufacturer’s fleet must achieve. Although we are not a car manufacturer and are thus not directly subject to the CAFE standards, we believe such standards may have a material effect on our business. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 raised the fuel economy standards of America’s cars, light trucks, and sport utility vehicles to a combined average of at least 35 miles per gallon (“mpg”) in 2020 — a 10 mpg increase over 2007 levels — and required standards to be met at maximum feasible levels through 2030. Building on the success of the first phase of the National Program, the second phase of fuel economy and global warming pollution standards for light duty vehicles covers model years 2017 – 2025. These standards were finalized by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (“NHTSA”) in August 2012. These standards would have required a reduction in average carbon dioxide emissions of new passenger cars and light trucks to 163 grams per mile (g/mi) in model year 2025. Manufacturers may choose to comply with these standards by manufacturing more EVs which would mean that more charging stations of the type we use and sell will be needed.
However, in April 2020, EPA and NHTSA finalized the Safer Affordable Fuel-Efficient Vehicles Rule (the “SAFE Rule”), which reformulated the required reductions, establishing average carbon dioxide emissions of new passenger cars and light trucks of 240 g/mi in model year 2026. Several states and groups have announced intentions to sue the United States government over this reformulation, so the final CAFE standards cannot currently be predicted with any certainty. However, to the extent fuel-efficiency standards are decreased, this may result in less demand for EVs and, in turn, less demand for our V2G technology and services.
Research and Development
We have invested a significant amount of time and expense into research and development of our GIVe software platform and V2G technology and services. Our ability to maintain our leadership position depends in part on our ongoing research and development activities. Our engineering team is responsible for the design, development, manufacturing and testing of our V2G technology and services. We focus our efforts on developing our V2G technology and services to expand the capabilities of our software platform and V2G services.
Our research and development is principally conducted at our headquarters in San Diego, California. As of December 31, 2022, we had 19 full-time employees and four contract workers engaged in its research and development activities.
Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, copyright, unfair competition and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual restrictions, to establish, maintain and protect our proprietary rights. Our success depends in part upon our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our products, technology and know-how, to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others, and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights.
As of December 31, 2022, we had four United States patents issued, four United States pending non-provisional patent applications and one United States pending provisional patent applications. Additionally, we had nine issued foreign patents (in Europe, India, Japan, China and Korea) and three foreign patent applications currently pending in various foreign jurisdictions. In addition, as of December 31, 2022, there was one pending Patent Cooperation Treaty application. These patents relate to various bi-directional (V2G) and uni-directional (V1G) EV charging functionalities, aggregation and grid services.
We own these patents, including the four issued United States patents, which were acquired from the University of Delaware pursuant to an IP acquisition agreement, dated November 7, 2017. Under the agreement, we agreed to make certain milestone payments to the University of Delaware in the aggregate amount of up to $7,500,000 based on the achievement of certain substantial commercialization targets. The IP acquisition agreement terminates upon the later of the date all the milestone payments described above are made and the expiration date of the patents transferred to us. If the University of Delaware terminates the agreement upon a material breach by us of certain limited provisions of the IP assignment agreement (which do not include the milestone payment provisions) that is not cured within 45 days after notice from the university, we will be required to assign the patents back to the university. The patents acquired from the University of Delaware, which cover the technology underlying our GIVe platform, as well as our implementation inside the charging stations and the EVs, are a key part of our patent portfolio and are critical to the operation of our business and our competitive position.
The following is an abstract of each of the four issued United States Patents:

Patent | Primary Claims 
US No. 8,116,915 | A method and apparatus for managing system energy flow. The apparatus includes an energy storage unit to store energy to be used by a system and a power conversion unit configured to be coupled between the energy storage unit and a utility grid. The apparatus also includes a controller to selectively control the power conversion unit to transfer energy between the utility grid and the energy storage unit based at least in part on an anticipated use of the system. 
US No. 8,509,976 | Methods, systems, and apparatus for interfacing an electric vehicle with an electric power grid. An exemplary apparatus may include a station communication port for interfacing with electric vehicle station equipment (“EVSE”), a vehicle communication port for interfacing with a vehicle management system (“VMS”), and a processor coupled to the station communication port and the vehicle communication port to establish communication with the EVSE via the station communication port, receive EVSE attributes from the EVSE, and issue commands to the VMS to manage power flow between the electric vehicle and the EVSE based on the EVSE attributes. An electric vehicle may interface with the grid by establishing communication with the EVSE, receiving the EVSE attributes, and managing power flow between the EVE and the grid based on the EVSE attributes.


US No. 9,043,038 | Methods, systems, and apparatus for aggregating electric power flow between an electric grid and electric vehicles. An apparatus for aggregating power flow may include a memory and a processor coupled to the memory to receive electric vehicle equipment (“EVE”) attributes from a plurality of EVEs, aggregate EVE attributes, predict total available capacity based on the EVE attributes, and dispatch at least a portion of the total available capacity to the grid. Power flow may be aggregated by receiving EVE operational parameters from each EVE, aggregating the received EVE operational parameters, predicting total available capacity based on the aggregated EVE operational parameters, and dispatching at least a portion of the total available capacity to the grid.
US No. 9,754,300 | Methods, systems, and apparatus transferring power between the grid and an electric vehicle. The apparatus may include at least one vehicle communication port for interfacing with EVE and a processor coupled to the at least one vehicle communication port to establish communication with the EVE, receive EVE attributes from the EVE, and transmit EVSE attributes to the EVE. Power may be transferred between the grid and the electric vehicle by maintaining EVSE attributes, establishing communication with the EVE, and transmitting the EVSE maintained attributes to the EVE. 

The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In the United States, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing a non-provisional patent application. In the United States, a patent’s term may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over another patent or as a result of delays in patent prosecution by the patentee, and a patent’s term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the United States Patent and Trademark Office in granting a patent. The average remaining life of our patents was approximately 9.8 years as of December 31, 2022. 
We intend to continue to regularly assess opportunities for seeking patent protection for those aspects of our technology, designs and methodologies that we believe provide a meaningful competitive advantage. However, because patent filings can be time-consuming and expensive, our ability to do so may be limited until such time as we are able to generate cash flow from operations or otherwise raise sufficient capital to continue to invest in our intellectual property. For example, maintaining patents in the United States and other countries requires the payment of maintenance fees which, if we are unable to pay, may result in loss of our patent rights. If we are unable to do so, our ability to protect our intellectual property or prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights may be impaired.
Sales
We currently have an in-house field sales force that maintain business relationships with customers and develops new sales opportunities through lead generation and marketing. We can also sell EV charging hardware and V2G software services through reseller partners, which then sell these products and services to their customers.
Marketing is performed by our in-house staff. To promote and sell our services to customers, we also utilize marketing and communication channels including press releases, email marketing, website (www.nuvve.com), and social media. The information on our websites is not, and will not be deemed, a part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, or incorporated into any other filings we make with the SEC.
We anticipate continuing to expand revenues by selling EV charging equipment to current as well as new customers, which include school bus operators, school districts, universities, stadiums, infrastructure investors via special purpose vehicles, municipal locations, and other fleet operators. In addition to transportation hubs and workplace locations, we anticipate expanding sales channels to wholesale distributors, utilities, and automotive OEMs.
Our revenues have and will be primarily derived from the sale of V2G-capable charging stations and recurring revenues from grid services provided by the GIVe software platform, as more fully described in “Our Strategy” above. Historically, a significant portion of our revenue has been derived from government grant funded projects to demonstrate our V2G technology and services.
Customers
For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had customers whose revenue individually represented 10% or more of our total revenue. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, one customer accounted for 32.1% and 12.4% of our total revenue, respectively. 
During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, our top five customers accounted for approximately 54.7% and 44.0%, respectively, of our total revenue. 
Our customer concentration has historically varied based on the receipt of large orders, a trend that we expect to continue in the near term.
Manufacturing and Suppliers
We do not manufacture electric vehicle charging stations. We integrate our technology into V2G-capable charging stations made by dedicated manufacturing partners located throughout the world. However, our principal supplier of bidirectional DC Chargers is Rhombus Energy Solutions, and identifying a suitable alternative supplier could be an extensive process.
We have not experienced any direct disruptions in our supply chain as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, certain of our charging station manufacturing partners experienced longer lead times in the acquisition of critical components, leading to delays in completing certain integration projects. 
Competition
We provide a globally-available, commercial V2G technology platform that enables EV batteries to store and resell unused energy back to the local electric grid. While we believe our GIVe platform is the most advanced V2G platform on the market and that it is the only one qualified by multiple grid system operators around the world to provide grid services, we operate within the highly competitive EV charging equipment and service market. We primarily compete with less advanced charge point operator EV charge management platforms providing fleet charging services without bi-directional capabilities, such as ChargePoint, Mobility House, EnelX, Shell-NewMotion, Blink and Ovo Energy. There are also additional entrants into the connected EV charging station equipment market, such as General Electric, SemaCharge, EVConnect, Fermata, and Greenlots. We expect this market to become increasingly competitive as new entrants enter the growing market. Our products and services compete on the basis of product capability (such as V2G capability), performance and features, total cost of ownership, sales capabilities, financial stability, brand recognition, product reliability and size of installed base.
Our V2G platform and the revenue it generates allows us to provide our customers with a lower total cost of EV ownership through benefits such as reduced charger costs, low or free energy costs to drive, fleet management tools, and yearly maintenance. We believe our competitors have historically struggled with gaining the technology and know-how necessary to establish a functional V2G software platform capable of aggregating EVs into a VPP and providing services to the grid bidirectionally, although they could build this capability in the future. While Tesla does offer EV charging services, these do 
not include V2G and we do not believe Tesla vehicles are capable of bi-directional power flow. There are many other large and small EV charger companies that offer non-networked or “basic” chargers that have limited customer leverage, but could provide a low-cost solution for basic charger needs in commercial and home locations. Because our competitors’ platforms are less advanced in providing V2G services, we believe we face limited direct competition.
We believe that we have competitive advantages over our competitors, such as our intellectual property portfolio (we own key patents for V2G); qualification by transmission system operators (we are already qualified by multiple operators, making it easier for us to expand into other areas); experience (over a decade of experience of market participation and stakeholder interaction); and data ownership (we have accumulated vast amounts of data, which is the key for rapid and future developments). However, many of our existing and potential competitors have substantially greater financial, marketing, sales, distribution, manufacturing and technological resources than we do. We may be unable to compete effectively against our competitors, either because they have greater resources or name recognition than we do, because their products and services are superior or more cost efficient than ours, or because they make technical advances to which we are unable to respond.
Human Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2022, we had 56 regular full-time employees, 19 of whom were engaged in research and development activities, and seven contract workers, four of whom were engaged in research and development activities. None of our employees are represented by a labor union, and we believe we maintain good relations with our employees.
Compensation and Benefits 
We believe that our future success largely depends upon our continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled employees. Companies in the energy technology industry both large and small compete for a limited number of qualified applicants to fill specialized positions. To attract qualified applicants, we offer a total rewards package consisting of base salary and cash target bonus, a comprehensive benefit package and equity compensation. Bonus opportunity and equity compensation increase as a percentage of total compensation based on level of responsibility. Actual bonus payout is based on performance.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
Much of our success is rooted in the diversity of our teams and our commitment to inclusion. We value diversity at all levels. We believe that our business benefits from the different perspectives a diverse workforce brings, and we pride ourselves on having a strong, inclusive and positive culture based on our shared mission and values. Advancing diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) is an essential part of our continual growth and evolution. DEI is an ongoing, deliberative practice of questioning and improvement. We are committed to building and sustaining a culture that integrates DEI principles into our hiring practices and operations. We foster an environment where people can be themselves, learn and grow. Through our culture committee, which is comprised of a diverse group of employees representing different genders and ethnicities, we are committed to cultivating an environment that is welcoming and supportive. We are partnered with the Department of Defense SkillBridge Program which provides retiring and transitioning Service Members the opportunity to participate in industry training programs while transitioning out of their military careers. We are working to increase our diversity by enhancing our recruitment and hiring strategies including internships, learning and development and outreach to individuals from underrepresented groups. 
Health, Wellness and Safety
We believe that the safety and health of our employees and their families is essential to our business. Our culture is driven by a desire to do what is right, and we strive to support the well-being of our employees. We prioritize the safety and well-being of our employees as they face both mental and physical challenges. We offer an Employee Assistance Program (EAP) which is a confidential service designed to help employees with a variety of personal concerns including but not limited to emotional health, wellness and daily living, parenting, childcare, education, legal and financial situations. We have implemented several programs to ensure the safety of all of our employees including an Illness and Injury Prevention, Industrial Ergonomics, Fleet Management and Driver Safety, Electrical Safety, Heat Illness Prevention, Emergency Action and Crisis Incident Management.
Environmental, Social and Governance
All employees are responsible for upholding our core values, including to communicate, collaborate, innovate and be respectful, as well as for adhering to our Code of Ethics and Business Conduct, including our policies on bribery, corruption, conflicts of interest and our whistleblower program. We encourage employees to come to us with observations and complaints, ensuring we understand the severity and frequency of an event in order to escalate and assess accordingly. We strive to ensure accountability, objectivity, and compliance with our Code of Ethics. If a complaint is financial in nature, the Audit Committee Chair is notified concurrently, which triggers an investigation, action and report.
Applying Nasdaq’s listing standards for independence, five of our seven directors are independent.
We are committed to protecting the environment and attempt to mitigate any negative impact of our operations. We are proud to develop solutions for a scalable and sustainable green society. V2G technology has demonstrated the potential for energy systems to balance energy demand for electric transportation and energy storage. Our technology increases grid resiliency and reduces the need for costly grid upgrades to integrate electric vehicles. V2G technology creates energy equity increasing capacity for grid benefits for everyone.
Corporate History
We are a Delaware corporation. Our principal executive offices are located at 2488 Historic Decatur Rd., Suite 200, San Diego, California, and our telephone number is (619) 456-5161.
We were formed on November 10, 2020 under the name “NB Merger Corp.” as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Newborn Acquisition Corp. (“Newborn”) for the purpose of effecting a business combination (the “Business Combination”) with Newborn and Nuvve Corporation (“Nuvve Corp.”). On March 19, 2021, we consummated the Business Combination in accordance with the terms of that certain Merger Agreement, dated as of November 11, 2020 and amended as of February 20, 2021, between us, Newborn, Nuvve Corp., Nuvve Merger Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of ours (“Merger Sub”), and Ted Smith, an individual, as the representative of the stockholders of Nuvve Corp. (the “Merger Agreement”). Prior to the Business Combination, Newborn was a publicly traded special purpose acquisition corporation, we were a wholly owned subsidiary of Newborn, and Nuvve Corp. was a private operating company. On the closing date of the Business Combination, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, (i) Newborn reincorporated to Delaware through the merger of Newborn with and into our company, with our company surviving as the publicly traded entity (the “Reincorporation Merger”), and (ii) immediately after the Reincorporation Merger, we acquired Nuvve through the merger of Merger Sub with and into Nuvve Corp., with Nuvve Corp. surviving as the wholly-owned subsidiary of ours (the “Acquisition Merger”). As a result, we became a publicly traded holding company with Nuvve Corp. as our operating subsidiary. In connection with the closing of the Business Combination, we changed our name to “Nuvve Holding Corp.”
Nuvve Corp. was incorporated in Delaware on October 15, 2010 under the name “Nuvve Corporation.” Nuvve was formed for the purpose of providing, directly and through business ventures with its partners, its V2G technology platform that enables EV batteries to store and resell unused energy back to the local electric grid and provide other grid services. Newborn was incorporated in the Cayman Islands on April 12, 2019 under the name “Newborn Acquisition Corp.” Newborn was formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization, or similar business combination with one or more businesses.
