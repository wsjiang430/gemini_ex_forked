 Market Opportunity and Industry Background 
 We believe the addressable market opportunity of our current products is approximately $14 billion today and expected to scale to $20 billion in the next five years, with emerging markets representing additional meaningful upside to that. For a description of our total addressable market, see “—Total Addressable Market.” Our solutions are a key enabler of existing end markets, such as the $29 billion special effects and $217 billion video game markets, according to Expert Market Research and Mordor Intelligence, respectively. According to Bloomberg Intelligence, the Metaverse and next-generation gaming have the potential to become $856 billion and $457 billion markets by 2025, respectively. 
 Motion capture is the process of digitally recording the movement of a person. It is used in a variety of entertainment segments, including film, video games, live performances, education, and fashion. In filmmaking and game development, it refers to capturing and digitizing physical actions of actors for the development of animations

  or visual effects. Well-known movies with substantial animation and visual effects content, such as the Avengers from Marvel Studios, utilize motion capture technology extensively. This same technology is used in the health and sports market to capture movement and kinematics of the human body to provide actionable insights on performance, readiness, and recovery. 
 Historically, traditional optical camera-based systems were the only motion capture method used by film studios until the advancement of our Xsens™ inertial sensor systems in recent years. While providing a good level of accuracy and performance, these traditional optical systems are relatively inflexible, time-consuming to use, expensive and require a significant investment in infrastructure. Traditional optical systems require a large number of cameras to track predetermined points (markers) on the subject’s body segments, aligned with specific locations on the body. Putting on the markers one-by-one can be time consuming and cumbersome. The positions of the markers are estimated using multiple two-dimensional images of the moving body parts in a predetermined volume of a physical measured facility. It is largely based on computer vision techniques for pattern recognition and often requires high computational resources. Optical systems suffer from occlusion (line of sight) problems whenever a required light path is blocked by another person or an object in the scene. Interference from other light sources or reflections may also be a problem which can result in so-called ghost markers, in addition to markers getting dislodged or falling off subjects and performers. 
 Inertial sensor systems, such as our Xsens product offerings, represent a newer method of performing motion capture without the use of optical cameras, allowing greater flexibility and portability. Inertial sensor tracking is made possible by advances in miniaturization and micromachined sensor technologies, particularly in silicon-based accelerometers, gyroscopes, and magnetometers. Sensor fusion algorithms combine the data from all three sensor technologies to determine the relative movement of each body part to physical space. Our software integrates the data from all the sensors on the body to recreate a person’s body and movement in a biomechanical model in virtual space. With improved quality and lower costs, inertial sensing has enabled increased adoption and development of new markets and applications, and we believe that inertial sensor systems have been gaining share from traditional camera-based optical systems based on their advantages of greater flexibility, higher portability, ease-of-use, and lower cost. 
 We believe the market for movement digitization, which is dynamic and rapidly growing, will support the growth of various technological approaches. While we believe that inertial technologies are key to the future of movement digitization and will continue to be among the fastest growing segments of the motion capture market, there may be other approaches that emerge that effectively serve certain use cases in the expanding landscape. For example, advances in artificial intelligence could make it possible to perform gross estimations of human body movement using a single mobile camera with pose estimation AI algorithms, which would be effective for certain use cases. Such “optical plus AI” approaches would be complementary to widely used inertial systems, which we believe will continue to increasingly dominate certain use cases and expand into others. We believe the fusion of inertial sensor technology and “optical plus AI” approaches represent an additional solution that could unlock incremental use cases and opportunities in movement digitization, and we are actively building on our existing technology to develop solutions that could fulfill this extension of our product portfolio.

 Prevalent motion capture use cases today include: 
 

• | Entertainment. Motion capture is primarily used in professional applications today, with customers including movie studios, video game developers, live entertainment, and education platforms. Movie studios utilize motion capture to bring popular superheroes, villains and other digital characters to life. Video game producers utilize motion capture to integrate real human movement into fight sequences and action sports that recreate a true-to-life experience for gamers, with the expansion of recording motion of a single individual to recording the movement of entire teams. Live entertainers in the music industry utilize motion capture to reach fans around the world by performing virtual concerts and performances.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Health and Sports. Many different disciplines use motion analysis systems to capture movement and kinematics of the human body. Increasingly, researchers endeavor to better appreciate the relationship between the human motor control system and gait dynamics. The most common fields that utilize motion capture are biomechanics, ergonomics, and sport science studies. In addition to motion capture, cloud- based platforms enable users, including athletes, teams, leagues, sports medicine professionals, and orthopedic clinics to make informed decisions based on combined tools, information, and analytics to optimize performance, prevent injury, and accelerate recovery. These systems absorb and process data from a large variety of biomechanical and biometric devices, inertial sensors, and motion capture systems. In addition to the health and sports markets, factories and warehouses in the corporate sector are active users of these systems to measure ergonomics in facilities and workplaces for repetitive motion injury avoidance and workers compensation purposes.

• | Automation and Mobility. These markets have long utilized inertial sensors to calculate the position and orientation of vehicles and robotics. Historically these inertial sensors were large, expensive analog devices that were only adopted by the high-end aviation and aerospace industries. With the miniaturization of these inertial devices (accelerometers, gyroscopes, and magnetometers), higher-volume applications such as drones, warehouse robotics, and autonomous vehicles have adopted these sensors. The same core inertial sensors used in motion capture applications are encapsulated in industrial-grade housings to service these markets. In order to enhance location services, geo-spatial and optical mapping technologies have been integrated with these inertial sensor modules.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Emerging high-growth market opportunities include: 
 

• | Next-generation entertainment, gaming, and live streaming. With the mass expansion and adoption of streaming platforms in recent years, there has been an increased need for content which includes motion capture, creating a new class of independent creators that generate their own motion capture-based content that they publish directly to their audiences. Virtual streamers, or vTubers, have emerged on popular gaming, entertainment and social media platforms as real-time virtual characters to interact with their audiences. New interactive platforms, such as Twitch, not only create new use cases for motion capture, but also present monetization opportunities for digital asset marketplaces, in-stream advertising, and audience interaction-based revenue.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Metaverse applications. The Metaverse represents an evolution in the way consumers interact with technology in more virtual environments, combining physical and digital worlds. The potential applications within the Metaverse are wide-ranging, including enhanced business and educational collaborations, music, social media, entertainment, industrial functions and digital economies, among others. Despite being early in the evolution, venture capital, growth equity, private equity and the corporate sector have already taken notice with over $120 billion of investment in the Metaverse in 2022, with the potential to generate upwards of $5 trillion of value by 2030 across enterprise and consumer uses, according to McKinsey. In addition, major brands such as Zara, Walmart, Ferrari, Coca-Cola, and Nike have established a presence in the Metaverse.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Digital avatars, or virtual representations of individuals, are the central actors in the Metaverse. We believe that the enablement of avatars to move like their real-life “twins” (either on a real-time controlled basis or on a pre-programmed basis) will be a natural and inevitable evolution in the increasing sophistication of Metaverse functionality, mirroring existing trends in live streaming. While there are a number of active platforms, different virtual environments, various game developers, and different standards with protocols less defined given the early stages of the Metaverse (and inherent uncertainty around which platforms will be winners and losers), we believe that providers of enabling technology such as Movella, which are agnostic to the ultimate winners and losers in the Metaverse, are well-positioned to capture value across the Metaverse ecosystem given our ability to sell to and partner with the full range of ecosystem players. 
 

• | Motion IP for content creators. A new frontier of monetizable IP for content creators is now being enabled by motion capture through capturing the movements of professional athletes and performers. Biomechanical models of professional athletes and their signature moves can be immortalized in the digital world to be integrated into virtual games, events or other purposes in the future for royalties or other compensation in the same way that music and other IP are monetized. This represents a potential new use case and revenue stream for sports leagues, athletes, performers and other owners of motion IP. This in turn has the potential to spawn a new ecosystem of supporting businesses, activities, and business models including motion IP marketplaces, brokers, and hosting providers.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Digital health. Motion capture and inertial sensors are widely used today in many professional sports and health applications. These applications typically require an expert who both understands the human body and the technology used to capture the motion on-site. Over time, with the development and broader adoption of digital health and advanced artificial intelligence, consumer-grade inertial sensors can be marketed directly to consumers for at-home biomechanical evaluations and rehabilitations.

Total Addressable Market 
 We define our total addressable market (“TAM”) as the addressable market opportunity for our current products in the following target markets: entertainment motion capture (including film, gaming, and education), health and sports motion capture and analytics, sports data services, and automation and mobility sensors. We estimated our TAM based on a combination of market data from third-party sources, including YOLE: Digitizing Movement Market Analysis (April 2022) (“YOLE”) and Data Bridge Market Research: Global Sports Management Software Market (2022) (“Data Bridge”), as well as our internal estimates. Our internal estimates for the TAM for movement analytics reports within the health analytics market were derived based on the number of physiotherapists, practices, and hospitals worldwide, and the amount of other potential locations within the health sector. The internal estimates for movement analytics for the sports market were based on unit volume calculated from public reporting from competitor companies, assuming a set percentage of users of these products are interested in motion capture for sports.
 We calculated our estimate of the TAM for our movement analytics products by utilizing the unit volume forecasts sourced from World Congress Physiotherapists (2019) (“WCPT”), Cybermetrics Lab, public reports from competitors, and our own customer relationship management data for our target markets, and applying our assumptions as to the rate at which these markets would incorporate the types of products we sell, multiplied by the estimated average selling prices for our products. Our assumptions as to the rate at which these markets will incorporate the types of products we sell reflect our internal estimates of the ability of our products to address each of these markets. Our estimated average selling prices also take into account our internal assumptions as to average selling price trends for the corresponding applications in each of these markets.

Competition 
 The movement digitization market is a highly fragmented space with competitors that provide solutions in three main areas: 
 

• | Inertial motion capture. We compete with other inertial motion capture companies such as Noitom Limited and Noraxon USA, Inc. These competitors, which are generally smaller in scale, typically operate in the entertainment and health and sports end markets, and their business strategies tend to be focused on narrow use cases in specific end-markets. We believe we are differentiated by our broader scope and full-stack solution with superior sensor fusion technology and AI/data science capabilities, and we compete favorably based on our product quality, functionality, and performance.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Optical motion capture. We compete with traditional optical camera-based motion capture companies such as NaturalPoint, Inc. dba OptiTrack, Qualisys AB, and Vicon Motion Systems Limited. These competitors typically operate in the entertainment and health and sports end markets. Although these companies have strong motion capture and visualization capabilities, we believe they tend to lack AI, cloud and analytics expertise and do not utilize sensors and the associated sensor fusion technology that Movella’s products incorporate. Traditional optical solutions tend to be more expensive to buy and operate and less portable and less flexible than inertial sensor-based solutions and have been losing market share to inertial sensor-based solutions.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Inertial sensor modules. We compete with other inertial sensor module providers such as Analog Devices, Inc., Honeywell International Inc., and SBG Systems in the automation and mobility segment. While some of these competitors have greater scale and resources than we do, these competitors tend to focus on investing in and developing their existing sensor technology, rather than expanding to other critical technologies and capabilities such as motion capture, analytics and AI. In addition, we believe they generally cannot provide accurate biometric motion capture data and lack the AI, cloud, and analytics expertise that can be used to generate actionable insights, which we believe provides us with a competitive advantage.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Movella’s key competitive advantage is our ability to provide a full-stack solution that incorporates sensor fusion. The foundation of our full-stack solution is our proprietary sensor modules, which when paired with our patented sensor fusion technology and visualization software, allow us to track the movement of sensors in a 3D space with centimeter-level accuracy. Sensor fusion is a core technology that drives our products, as raw data provided by sensors is processed by our proprietary visualization software that can be used to generate meaningful insights. 
 Based on these competitive advantages, we believe we compete effectively based our ability to deliver functionality, features, ease of use, portability, and cost-effectiveness relative to competitive offerings. 
 

* | We believe these customers reflect those with which we are currently actively engaged in terms of our innovation and strategic opportunities across our target markets.

Our ability to compete successfully depends, in part, on factors that are outside of our control, including industry and general economic trends. The markets for many of our products are highly competitive, and we expect competition to increase in the future. Some of our competitors have significantly greater financial, technical, and marketing resources than we do, and may be able to respond more rapidly to new or emerging technologies. They may also be able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion, and sale of their products. Increased competition could result in price reductions, fewer customer orders, reduced margins, and loss of market share. Our failure to compete successfully could seriously harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry—If we are unable to compete effectively with existing or new competitors, the associated loss of competitive position could result in price reductions, fewer customer orders, reduced margins, and loss of market share.” 
Movella Organization

 Through our research and development efforts, we intend to continually expand our portfolio of patents and to enhance our IP position. As of December 31, 2022, we had 92 employees involved in research and development. Our engineering design teams are located in The Netherlands, Taiwan and India. 
 Supply Chain and Manufacturing 
 Our supply chain and manufacturing strategy is to outsource substantially all of our manufacturing and distribution activities regionally, beginning with Europe and Asia. The only exception is for in-house calibration of sensor modules in our Enschede, Netherlands office for knowledge and contingency reasons. This strategy allows us to have an asset-light model where the only major capital investment is for testing robots for our in-house calibration. We are experiencing a transition toward increased online ordering, including utilization of resellers and distributors platforms, as well as our internal web shop for end customers. We have established regional distribution centers, beginning with Europe and Asia, to support direct delivery from our factory to distribution centers and from distribution centers to our resellers, distributors, and customers. 
 For our sensor modules, we work with a contract manufacturer for surface-mount devices and box build manufacturing. We conduct calibration of modules, final assembly and testing of systems, and distribution to our customers in-house to better control the quality and performance of sensor modules and system products. For our higher volume product families, we partner with a contract manufacturer for build and testing capabilities. 
Intellectual Property 
 Our success depends in part upon our ability to protect our IP. To accomplish this, we rely on a combination of IP rights, including patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets and know-how, as well as customary contractual protections with our customers, suppliers, employees, and consultants that contribute to our material IP. 
 IP portfolio provides and protects the technology that powers our solutions. The combination of this IP enables us to offer a full-stack of movement digitization solutions, spanning increasing levels of integration, that consists of the sensors IP, sensors, motion capture, and cloud-based analytics. As of December 31, 2022, Legacy Movella had 161 issued patents and 15 pending patent applications covering all levels of the full stack. 
 Facilities 
 Our corporate headquarters are located in Henderson, Nevada. We have sales, marketing, and administrative offices in Los Angeles and San Jose, California, an engineering facility in Taipei, Taiwan, and sales and engineering offices in Shanghai, China and Bangalore, India. Our largest facilities are in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, consisting of approximately 9,200 square feet housing sales and engineering teams, and Enschede, The Netherlands, consisting of approximately 42,000 square feet for research and development, engineering, sales and marketing, operations, and administrative teams. 
 We believe that our existing facilities are sufficient for our current needs. We intend to add new facilities and expand our existing facilities as we continue to add employees and grow our business. We believe that new spaces will be available at reasonable terms in the future in order to meet our needs.

Our global training and development program focuses on harassment-free workplace and diversity topics, as well as ethics and compliance. 
 Our company-wide compensation structure is intended to align incentives with the success of Movella. This includes our executives, whose incentives are generally the same as the rest of our employees. We believe that this fosters harmony within the company, as all teams are working together towards the same goals. For more details regarding our executive compensation, see Item 11 of this Report. 
 Our ongoing focus on workplace safety and compliance to applicable regulations has enabled us to preserve business continuity while ensuring a safe work environment during the COVID-19 pandemic, including work-from-home arrangements for a substantial portion of our workforce and reduced capacity for those that have returned to 
 
15 


  the office, adhering to local health authority guidelines. We also comply with applicable laws and regulations regarding workplace safety and are subject to audits by entities such as the Occupational Safety and Health Administration in the United States. 
 Permissions to Operate Business in the PRC and Hong Kong 
 Under the current effective PRC laws, our PRC subsidiaries are required to obtain or complete the following primary permissions, filings or procedures for their operations: (i) business license for each of our PRC subsidiaries, (ii) foreign investment reporting; (iii) tax registration; (iv) foreign exchange registration; and (v) customs filings. Our PRC subsidiaries have received all requisite permission as listed above, and none of those permissions has been denied as of the date hereof. 
 Under the current effective Hong Kong laws, our Hong Kong subsidiaries are required to obtain or complete the following primary permissions, filings or procedures for their operations: (i) Certificate of Incorporation for each of our Hong Kong subsidiaries, and (ii) Business Registration Certificate for each of our Hong Kong subsidiaries. Our Hong Kong Subsidiaries have received all requisite permissions as listed above, and none of those permissions has been denied as of the date hereof. 
 Government Regulation 
 Our business activities are worldwide and subject to various federal, state, local and foreign regulations, and our products are governed by a number of rules and regulations. To date, our compliance with these regulations has not had a material impact on our results of operations. New legislation or regulation, the application of laws from jurisdictions whose laws do not currently apply to our business, or the application of existing laws and regulations to the technology industry generally could result in significant additional compliance costs and responsibilities for our business. 
 As our products and services, including those for the health and sports market, are not intended to be used for medical purposes, including the diagnosis or treatment of injury or disease, we do not believe they fall within the FDA clearance requirements for medical devices. While we believe we are currently in material compliance with applicable laws and regulations, we intend to continue to monitor our products and services, including those under development, and how our products and services, and future products and services, may be utilized by our customers, and intend to comply with regulations, including FDA clearance requirements, if and to the extent they become applicable to us. 
 Trade Controls 
 Our business activities are subject to various restrictions under U.S. export and similar laws and regulations, as well as various economic and trade sanctions administered by the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”). Further, various countries regulate the import of certain technology and have enacted or could enact laws that could limit our ability to provide customers with our products in those countries. 
 Economic sanction laws in the U.S. and other jurisdictions prohibit or otherwise restrict us and our officers, directors, and employees from engaging in transactions in, or relating to, certain countries, territories, individuals, and entities. In the U.S., OFAC, the U.S. Department of State, and the U.S. Department of Commerce administer and enforce laws, executive orders, and regulations establishing U.S. economic and trade sanctions. Such sanctions prohibit, among other things, transactions with, and the provision of services to, certain countries, territories, individuals, and entities. These persons and entities include specially designated nationals and other persons and entities targeted by OFAC sanctions programs. The lists of OFAC-restricted countries, territories, individuals, and entities, including the List of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons, as such list may be amended from time to time, can be found on the OFAC website at www.treas.gov/ofac. In addition, certain programs administered by OFAC prohibit dealing with individuals or entities in certain countries regardless of whether such individuals or entities appear on the lists maintained by OFAC. These types of sanctions and similar laws and regulations in non-U.S. jurisdictions may significantly restrict our business activities in certain countries or territories. The economic sanctions and related laws of different jurisdictions in which we conduct business also may conflict with one another, such that compliance with all applicable laws may be difficult. Failure to comply with OFAC or other relevant sanctions could have serious legal and reputational consequences, including civil and criminal penalties. 
 
16 


 Anti-Corruption 
 We are also subject to various domestic and international anti-corruption laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, as well as other similar anti-bribery and anti-kickback laws and regulations. These laws and regulations generally prohibit companies, their employees, and their intermediaries from authorizing, offering, providing, and/or accepting improper payments or other benefits for improper purposes. Although we take precautions to prevent violations of these laws, we may be exposed to violating these laws due to our international presence. 
 Privacy 
 We are or may become subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States and abroad regarding privacy, data protection, and data security. These laws and regulations are continuously evolving and developing. The scope and interpretation of the laws that are or may be applicable to us may be uncertain and conflicting. 
 In particular, there are numerous local, state, national and international laws, directives and regulations that apply to the collection, use, retention, protection, disclosure, transfer and other processing of personal data, including biometric information. Data privacy laws and regulations, including but not limited to the GDPR (EU 2016/679), effective May 2018 and the GDPR as it forms part of the laws of England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, the California Consumer Privacy Act, as amended, effective January 2020, and the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020, which became effective January 1, 2023, pose increasingly complex compliance challenges, which may increase compliance costs, and any failure to comply with data privacy laws and regulations could result in significant penalties or other legal liabilities. 
 We strive to comply with all applicable laws and regulations relating to privacy, data security, and data protection. However, governments are continuing to focus on privacy and data security, and it is possible that new privacy or data security laws will be passed, or existing laws will be amended in a way that is material to our business. Any significant change to applicable laws, regulations, or industry practices could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices and compliance procedures in a manner adverse to our business. Any inability to adequately address data privacy or data protection, or other information security-related concerns, even if unfounded, or to successfully negotiate privacy, data protection or information security-related contractual terms with customers, or to comply with applicable laws, regulations and policies relating to privacy, data protection and information security, could result in additional cost and liability to us, harm our reputation and brand, and could negatively impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 United States and International Data Security and Data Privacy Laws 
 We are or in the future may be subject to diverse laws and regulations relating to data privacy and security, including, in the United States, HIPAA, in the EU, the EU GDPR and, post-Brexit, in the UK, the UK GDPR. Some countries, such as Brazil and Japan, have enacted or amended omnibus laws, and others, such as China and Russia, have also passed laws that require personal data relating to their citizens to be maintained in the country under certain circumstances and impose additional data transfer restrictions. Complying with these numerous, complex and often changing regulations is expensive and difficult, and failure to comply with any privacy laws or data security laws or any security incident or breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized use or disclosure of personal data (including sensitive or confidential patient or consumer information), whether by us or a third-party, could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition and results of operations, including but not limited to: material fines and penalties; damages; litigation; consent orders; extensive audits and inspections; bans on all or some processing of personal data carried out by noncompliant actors; and injunctive relief. The EU GDPR and UK GDPR also confer a private right of action on data subjects and consumer associations to lodge complaints with supervisory authorities, seek judicial remedies, and obtain compensation for damages resulting from violations of the EU GDPR/UK GDPR. 
 HIPAA, as well as a number of other federal and state privacy-related laws, extensively regulate the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health information, known as “protected health information” or “PHI.” HIPAA applies to health plans, healthcare providers who engage in certain standard healthcare transactions 
 
17 


  electronically, such as electronic billing, and healthcare clearinghouses, all of which are referred to as “covered entities” under HIPAA. HIPAA also directly regulates “business associates,” which are certain types of entities that act as service providers to covered entities and receive or have access to PHI as part of providing the relevant services to the covered entity customer. Business Associates are responsible for complying with certain provisions of HIPAA and can be subject to direct enforcement for violations of HIPAA. State imposed health information privacy and security laws typically apply based on licensure, for example, licensed providers or licensed entities are limited in their ability to use and share health information. 
 Additionally, many states have enacted legislation protecting the privacy and/or security of “personal information” such as identifiable financial or health information, social security number and credit card information. These laws overlap in certain circumstances and can apply simultaneously with federal privacy and security requirements and regulated entities must comply with all of them. The CCPA that went into effect January 1, 2020 and was subsequently updated by the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”), is one of the most restrictive state privacy laws, protecting a wide variety of personal information and granting significant rights to California residents with respect to their personal information. In dealing with health information for the development of its technology or for commercial purposes, we will be affected by HIPAA and state-imposed health information privacy and security laws because these laws regulate the ability of our potential customers to share health information with us and may in certain circumstances impose additional direct obligations on us. Additionally, we must also identify and comply with all applicable state laws for the protection of other types of personal information (e.g., consumer, employee, B2B information) that the company collects. In addition to the CCPA, many other states have proposed or already enacted similar data privacy and security laws, including Massachusetts’ Standards for the Protection of Personal Information (MA 201 C.M.R. §§ 17.00 et seq.) and the newly enacted Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act. 
 In the EU, increasingly stringent data protection and privacy rules that have and will continue to have substantial impact on the use of personal and patient data across the healthcare industry became stronger in May 2018. The EU GDPR applies across the EU (as well as the EEA) and includes, among other things, a requirement for prompt notice of data breaches to data subjects and supervisory authorities in certain circumstances and significant fines for non-compliance. The EU GDPR fine framework can be up to 20 million euros, or up to 4% of the company’s total global turnover of the preceding fiscal year, whichever is higher. The EU GDPR sets out a number of requirements that must be complied with when handling the personal data of individuals (i.e., data subjects) in the EU including: providing expanded disclosures about how their personal data will be used; higher standards for organizations to demonstrate that they have obtained valid consent or have another legal basis in place to justify their data processing activities; the obligation to appoint data protection officers in certain circumstances; new rights for individuals to be “forgotten” and rights to data portability, as well as enhanced current rights (e.g., access requests); the principal of accountability and demonstrating compliance through policies, procedures, training and audit; and the new mandatory data breach regime. In particular, medical or health data, genetic data and biometric data where the latter is used to uniquely identify an individual are all classified as “special category” data under the EU GDPR and are afforded greater protection and require additional compliance obligations. Noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines, penalties, or orders to stop noncompliant activities. We are subject to the EU GDPR since we offer products or services to individuals in the EU or otherwise enter into contracts with EU entities that handle the collection and processing of data of individuals within the EU. 
 We could also be subject to evolving EU laws on data export, for transfers of data outside the EU to itself or third parties. The GDPR only permits transfers of data outside the EU to jurisdictions that ensure an adequate level of data protection. The United States has not been deemed to offer an adequate level of protection, so in order for us to transfer personal data from the EU to the United States, we must identify a legal basis for data transfer (e.g., the European Union Commission approved Standard Contractual Clauses) and any supplementary measures taken, or to be taken, to provide an adequate level of protection for the data. On July 16, 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union or the CJEU, issued a landmark opinion in the case Maximilian Schrems vs. Facebook (Case C-311/18), called Schrems II. This decision (a) calls into question commonly relied upon data transfer mechanisms as between the EU member states and the United States (such as the Standard Contractual Clauses) and (b) invalidates the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield, an adequacy decision on which many companies had relied as an acceptable mechanism for transferring such data from the EU to the United States. The CJEU is the highest court in Europe and the Schrems II decision heightens the burden on data exporters and data importers to assess United States national security laws on their business and future actions of EU data protection authorities are difficult to predict.

 Further, the UK’s decision to leave the EU, often referred to as Brexit, has created uncertainty with regard to data protection regulation in the UK. At the current time, pursuant to the UK Data Protection Act 2018 (“DPA 2018”) (which enacted the EU GDPR into UK law) and DPPEC Regulations which amended the DPA 2018 to create the UK GDPR regime (“UK GDPR”) that materially mirrors and complements the EU GDPR, legal obligations and risk factors in the UK are similar to those in the EU. However, the UK has seen various developments in 2022 (including a new Information Commissioner regulator, new proposals from government as to possible changes to data laws in the UK and consultation regarding the same) which point to possible divergence in some respects from the EU position. Such changes may present us with additional compliance burdens, costs and risk factors, It is possible that additional issues may also arise from a data privacy perspective between the EU and the UK. 
 Cybersecurity 
 We have designed and implemented and continue to maintain a security program consisting of policies, procedures, and technology intended to maintain the privacy, security and integrity of our information, systems, and networks. Among other things, the program includes controls designed to limit and monitor access to authorized systems, networks, and data, prevent inappropriate access or modification, and monitor for threats or vulnerability. See “Risk Facotrs—General Risks—Our business and reputation may be impacted by information technology system failures, delays and network disruptions.” 
 Legal Proceedings 
 We are not currently subject to any material litigation and no material litigation is currently threatened against us which, in the opinion of our management, is likely to materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations. From time to time we may become involved in legal proceedings incident to our business or related to those of the businesses we acquire, including relating to intellectual property matters, product liability claims, employee claims, tort or contract claims, federal regulatory investigations, securities class action litigation, and other legal proceedings or investigations, which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations, and divert the attention of our management from the operation of our business. For example, in February 2020, Tactical Air Support (“TAS”) filed a lawsuit in the California State Court in Los Angeles against our wholly-owned subisidary, Movella Technologies N.A. Inc. (formerly Xsens North America, Inc.), alleging tort and contract-based causes of action arising from TAS purchases of allegedly defective Xsens North America inertial measurement unit devices (“IMUs”). TAS never deployed IMUs in its military aircraft. In response, Xsens North America removed the case to the California Federal District Court in Los Angeles based upon the party’s diversity of citizenship. Xsens North America filed a motion to dismiss each of TAS’ alleged non-contract-based claims and its prayers for damages in excess of the approximately $40,000 TAS paid for the IMUs. The motion to dismiss alleged non-contract-based claims was granted on September 3, 2020. On December 22, 2022, the parties entered into a settlement agreement including mutual releases and the lawsuit was dismissed. We agreed to pay a settlement amount of $0.3 million which has been accrued on the December 31, 2022 consolidated balance sheet of Legacy Movella. Although Movella does not believe that any currently known legal matters will have a material impact to its financial statements, there can be no assurance regarding the ultimate outcome of any litigation matter. See Note 17 to the Notes to our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 in Amendment No. 1 to our Current Report on Form 8-K, initially filed on February 13, 2023, which we will be filing shortly after the filing of this Report. Legal or similar proceedings are subject to many uncertainties and outcomes and the outcome, costs, and other impacts and consequences of such matters are not predictable with assurance. Regardless of the outcome, the results of any current or future litigation can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs, diversion of management resources, and other factors.
