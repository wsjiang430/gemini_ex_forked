ITEM 1.  BUSINESS.
General Development



REGO Payment Architectures, Inc. (the “Company,” “REGO,” “we”, or “us”) was incorporated in Delaware on February 11, 2008 under the name Chimera International Group, Inc.  On April 4, 2008, we amended our certificate of incorporation and changed our name to Moggle, Inc.  On August 22, 2011, we filed a Certificate of Ownership with the Secretary of State of Delaware, pursuant to which the Company’s newly formed wholly owned subsidiary, Virtual Piggy Incorporated was merged into and with the Company (the “Merger”). In connection with the Merger and in accordance with Section 253 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, the name of the Company was changed from “Moggle, Inc.” to “Virtual Piggy, Inc.”  On February 28, 2017, we amended our certificate of incorporation and changed our name to REGO Payment Architectures, Inc. Our principal offices are located at 325 Sentry Parkway, Suite 200, Blue Bell, PA 19422 and our telephone number is (267) 465-7530.



As of the date of this report, we have not generated significant revenues.  Our initial business plan was to develop an online game platform to allow game companies to create, monetize and distribute massive multiplayer online games (MMOG). The Company technology was the monetization component of this overall software platform (our “Platform”). During 2010, we analyzed the market potential for an expanded Company solution and decided to concentrate our efforts on the delivery of a full-featured Company solution that was not restricted to online gaming. The expanded Company solution was designed to provide a complete online solution for families and parents to teach their children about financial management and spending on gaming, retail, music and entertainment. In late 2013, we rebranded our Company product under the name “Oink®”.  In March 2016, we discontinued our prior Oink product offering.



Our focus currently is monetizing the Mazoola® Digital Wallet Platform in the Financial Technology (“FinTech”) industry through white label, licensing and partnership agreements.  We have successfully launched the Mazoola® App and are focused on improving and monetizing the existing Platform and App that will act as the foundation for the strategic alignment with the FinTech industry.  The FinTech industry is composed primarily of startup companies that use software to provide financial services more efficiently and less costly than traditional financial service companies.  With our Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) and GDPRkidsTM Trustmark compliant technology as an added feature, we believe we may have better market success.

Overview



REGO Payment Architectures, Inc. is a provider of consumer software that delivers a mobile payment platform - Mazoola® - a family focused mobile banking solution. Headquartered in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, the Company maintains a portfolio of trade secrets and four US patent awards. REGO offers an all-digital financial payments platform to enable minors, particularly under 13 years old, to transact, complete chores and learn in a secure online environment guided by parental permission, oversight, and control, while remaining COPPA and GDPR compliant.



COPPA applies not only to websites and mobile apps. It can apply to a growing list of connected devices that is included in the Internet of Things. Some of these include toys and products that could collect personal information, such as voice recordings or geolocation information. Non-compliance with COPPA has meant substantial fines for many violators.



Management believes that by building on its COPPA compliance advantage, the future of REGO Payment Architectures, Inc. will be based on the foundational architecture of its software platform (the “Platform”) that will allow its use across multiple financial markets where secure controlled payments are needed. The Company intends to license in each alternative field of use the ability for its partners, distributors and/or value-added resellers to private label each of the alternative markets. These partners will deploy, customize and support each implementation under their own label, but with acknowledgement of the Company’s proprietary intellectual assets as the base technology. Management believes this approach will enable the Company to reduce marketing expenses while broadening its reach.



Further, California passed the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”) on June 28, 2018. CCPA gives consumers (defined as natural citizens who are California residents) four rights relative to their personal information as follows:




● | the right to know, through a general privacy policy and with more specifics available upon request, what personal information a business has collected about them, where it was sourced from, what it is being used for, whether it is being disclosed or sold, and to whom it is being disclosed or sold;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the right to “opt out” of allowing a business to sell their personal information to third parties (or, for consumers who are under 16 years old, the right not to have their personal information sold absent their, or their parent’s, opt-in);
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the right to have a business delete their personal information, with some exceptions; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the right to receive equal service and pricing from a business, even if they exercise their privacy rights under the CCPA.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




In November 2020, California went even further by passing the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”) of 2020. The CPRA is the strongest consumer privacy law ever enacted in the United States and achieves broad general parity with the most comprehensive laws in other jurisdictions including Europe (GDPR), Japan, Israel, New Zealand, and Canada. Protection of children is a key component of the CPRA with significant expansion to enforcement also included. CPRA empowers the Attorney General, California’s 62 different district attorneys, and a brand-new California Privacy Protection Agency to enforce it, with those powers coming into force on July 1, 2023. Additional states such as Virginia, Connecticut, Colorado, and Nevada are exploring joining California in implementing similar comprehensive privacy legislation.



With respect to the evolving CCPA, the Company has designed its Platform and app to be in compliance.



Additionally, the European Parliament and Council agreed upon the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) in April 2016, to replace the Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC. This is the primary law regulating how companies protect European Union (“EU”) citizens’ personal data. GDPR became effective on May 25, 2018. Companies that fail to achieve GDPR compliance are subject to severe fines and penalties.

GDPR requirements apply to each member state of the European Union, aiming to create more consistent protection of consumer and personal data across EU nations. Some of the key privacy and data protection requirements of the GDPR include:




● | Requiring the consent of subjects for data processing
--+------------------------------------------------------


● | Anonymizing collected data to protect privacy
--+----------------------------------------------


● | Providing data breach notifications
--+------------------------------------


● | Safely handling the transfer of data across borders
--+----------------------------------------------------


● | Requiring certain companies to appoint a data protection officer to oversee GDPR compliance
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




In short, the handling of EU citizens’ data is mandated by GDPR using a baseline set of standards for companies that are designed to better safeguard the processing and movement of personal data. The Company has designed its Platform and app to be in compliance with GDPR and has received the GDPRkidsTM Trustmark from PRIVO.



Revenues generated from the Platform will come from multiple sources depending on the level of service and facilities requested. There will be levels of subscription revenue paid monthly, service fees, transaction fees and in some cases, revenue sharing and licensing with banking and distribution partners.



Industry Background



In 2022, it was estimated that approximately 25% of the world’s population, estimated at 8 billion, or approximately 2 billion people were under age 15. This is primarily Generation Z (“Gen Z”) and Generation Alpha (“Gen Alpha”).



Gen Z are those born between 1997 and 2010 and are characterized by growing up in a highly sophisticated media and computer environment with greater internet savvy than any previous generation. They have been coined with the names “True Gen,” the “iGeneration,” “Homelanders,” “Generation Connected,” and “Dot Com Kids.” Gen Z has an estimated spending power of $323 billion per year, while it is estimated that Gen Z influences $600 billion in family spending per year.



They use the mobile internet more than any other generation on a daily basis as a communication tool and a method to stay connected with the people and things that are important to them. Studies have shown that Gen Z spends over 8 hours per week online on average, 4.5 hours per day on their mobile phones and 3.5 hours per day on their laptops. They are online for 10 or more hours per day with the use of smartphones, tablets, laptops, desktops and TV’s. Gen Z are 2 times more likely to shop online than Millennials. Additionally, 62 percent of Gen Z have reported worrying about the use of their personal information by companies.



Gen Alpha are those born since the year 2010. They are the children of the Millennials and are sometimes referred to as mini-Millennials. They will be the first generation entirely born and shaped in the 21st century. They have become known as “Digital Natives.” They are the most materially endowed and technologically literate generation on Earth. While not much information has been observed as of yet, Gen Alpha has been projected to be the best-educated, the most technologically immersed, the wealthiest and the generation most likely to spend some or all of their childhood in living arrangements without both of their biological parents. Millennials tend to provide mini versions of what they have themselves to Gen Alpha. Thus, Gen Alpha is more likely to seek out the best brands and best products and have the ability to differentiate knockoff brands. This is the next generation to watch as they have already begun to spend and influence spending.



Because there is no direct financial solution for these generations, they still use either cash or their parent’s funding source (credit card) and hence there is still a lack of quantification of the dollar size of the children’s “spending” market, which is separate from the dollars spent on children. Marketers and regulators have taken note of the change and made a shift to a more “digital” approach to their overall strategy.  Additionally, children’s access to increasingly available technology has fueled concerns about security, safety and compliance with government regulations. As children march toward adulthood, parents are providing the means for children to have products (money), and technology and providing them the increasingly easy opportunity to do so.

With Gen Z and Gen Alpha in mind, the Company is focusing on the FinTech industry.  There are several fields affected by FinTech including banking, insurance, loans, personal finance, electronic payments, venture capital and wealth management. The brands that appear in the FinTech industry include Apple, Goldman Sachs, PWC, JP Morgan, Samsung, Amazon and Paypal to name a few.



The key metrics to the FinTech industry are as follows:


● | The U.S. Fintech market has achieved a $4 trillion market size in 2022 and projects a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 11% over the next 5 years.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | In the U.S., the leading FinTech segment is digital payment, valued at over $1.2 trillion in 2021.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | 60% of credit unions and 49% of banks believe partnerships with FinTech companies are important.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | By 2025, the U.S. will account for more than 62% of the global FinTech transaction value.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The worth of the global financial sector is expected to be $28.5 trillion by 2025 with a 6% CAGR.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | 75% of global consumers have used at least one fintech service to pay online or using a mobile application.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | 70% of U.S. customers say that mobile banking will represent the future.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | In 2022, the market's leading segment was digital payments, with a total transaction value of $1.8 trillion.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | In the U.S., the number digital payment users is projected to be 307 million by 2026.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




FinTech companies are not restricted to the same degree by regulatory compliance nor antiquated systems with which the established financial services companies contend, although governments at all levels are increasing their interest in the industry.  These companies can concentrate on single purpose solutions, which are designed to enhance the user’s experience. In 2022, nearly two-thirds (65.3 percent) of the U.S. population used a digital banking services. Additionally, in 2022, 97% of millennials indicated that they use mobile banking.



The innovations taking place in FinTech can be summarized in four categories:


1. | Peer-to-Peer (“P2P”) value exchanges – Growth of applications has been stimulated by the popularity and use of social networks.
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Applications with machine intelligence – Automation becoming a necessity in the do-it-yourself environment.
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | Data-driven services – The ability to access data and data analytics is leading to more individualized products and lower pricing of financial services.
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4. | Less definition between physical and virtual worlds – People are using financial services more in the virtual arena than in visiting physical locations.
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




Digital-only banking is growing. These banks offer virtual global payments, P2P transfers and opportunities to buy and exchange Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.



Blockchain, a distributed ledger technology, is also having a substantial impact on global finance. The two fastest-growing segments of FinTech are blockchain and regulatory technology (“regtech”). It is anticipated that blockchain technology will increase the global economy by $1.76 trillion by 2030. The largest economic impact will be tracking and tracing products and services estimated at $962 billion. Payments and financial services will be impacted by an approximate $433 billion. The sectors benefiting the most will be public administration, education and healthcare. The countries that will benefit the most are anticipated to be China ($440 billion) and the US ($407 billion).



The global P2P market size was valued at $1.9 trillion in 2020 and is projected to grow to $9 trillion by 2030. In 2022, the largest P2P money transfer service has an estimated transaction volume of $1.4 trillion with 435 million users. There is evidence to support the primary uses of P2P money transfers is the exchange of money between family and friends.

Artificial intelligence (“AI”) is projected to reduce bank operating costs by 22% by the year 2030. This could mean savings of approximately $1 trillion. AI in the banking industry is well positioned to combat cybercrimes and financial fraud. Customer service in financial institutions is now being conducted by AI chatbots and other smart systems. Chatbot interactions are expected to save operational costs in the banking industry $7.3 billion globally by 2023. By 2025, Robo-advisors are expected to manage $16 trillion in assets. In the next 10 years, AI is anticipated to handle 95% of all customer interactions.



Mobile payments were approximately $2 trillion in 2021. The people using contactless payments in 2021 numbered 1.5 billion. In 2022, there were approximately 3.4 billion mobile wallet users with this number expected to exceed 5.2 billion in 2026. As of 2022, mobile payments are used by more than 2 billion people globally, growing by millions each year and mobile transactions comprised 89% of all banking transactions. App store spending was $167 billion worldwide in 2022.



With this as a backdrop, REGO Payment Architectures, Inc. has identified an emerging need to market a financial platform that provides this generation with an alternative solution to traditional banking and solves current limitations on their ability to safely transact using mobile payment solutions for both brick & mortar retail outlets and online shopping. Mazoola ® is that platform and along with providing the solution it teaches financial responsibility.



The Company’s Relationship to the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act



Though the Company does not target or collect the personal information of the under 13 age group, and rather targets parents and families as a whole, the products must still be compliant with COPPA. The new products will meet the requirements imposed by COPPA, including the recent amendments.  The Company has gone further than dealing with the federal rules by mapping all state-by-state statutes and regulations that deviate from the federal laws and thus have a complete inter-state commerce view of the regulations that assure compliance for all participants in the system.



To be compliant the Company has renewed its COPPA certification and has received the GDPRkidsTM Trustmark from PRIVO. PRIVO is an online privacy compliance company and with the certification and Trustmark the Company has joined Privo’s Kids Privacy Assured Program, which helps companies navigate the online privacy landscape from COPPA and GDPR to the numerous student digital privacy laws, in addition to offering compliant technology solutions that include youth registration, age verification, parental consent and account management.



Other Consumer Privacy Protection Legislation



The Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) has been very active, since as far back as 2003, in penalizing companies for non-compliance with privacy promises, with COPPA at the core of the settlements. Possible penalties under COPPA provide for civil penalties of $42,350 per violation, however, the FTC considers many factors when levying penalties. Among these are the ability of the company to stay in business after the penalty is imposed. Google and YouTube paid a record $170 million in 2019 to settle civil penalties brought by the FTC. Musical.ly (TikTok) agreed to a settlement of $5.7 million in February 2019. TechCrunch’s Verizon-owned parent, Oath, created from the merging of AOL and Yahoo, has agreed to pay approximately $5 million for violating COPPA in December 2018. The New York Attorney General has targeted Viacom, Mattel, JumpStart and Hasbro for investigations related to COPPA compliance issues. In July 2021, Kuuhuub, Inc. was fined $3 million for violating COPPA. Epic Games, Inc., the creator of the popular video game Fortnite, was recently fined in December 2022 $275 million for COPPA violations.



A number of foreign governments also have either adopted or are considering data privacy and security regulations. For example, the EU has adopted GDPR, as was previously discussed.  The Company’s initial target is the U.S. However, the Company has been performing research on compliance issues in European countries and is expanding its focus into the European market. With the GDPR Trustmark the Company is positioned to rapidly adapt to these new markets.



In 2022 there were 511 GDPR fines that totaled over €835 million. Among the top violators in 2022 were Meta/Facebook twice (totaling €670 million) and Clearview AI, Inc. several times (totaling €68 million).

The Opportunity



Gen Z and Gen Alpha are the core target users of our mobile payment app, Mazoola®



As consumers, Gen Z and Gen Alpha have deep pockets, but lack direct access to funds.



Their spending power is significant and growing. Gen Z has a combined buying power of $323 billion in direct spending. Over 70% of Gen Z say they influence family decisions around furniture, household goods, food and beverages purchases.  They are 2 times more likely to shop on mobile devices than Millennials.



Social and digital learning is key to Gen Z.



85% of Gen Z uses social media to learn about new products.



Gen Z’s financial future and global impact has yet to be written.



While 60% of Gen Z say ‘a lot of money’ is a sign of success and 72% of Gen Z want to start a business one day, the details of how to make smart choices about money are not being shared. In 2022, 20 states had enacted legislation or adopted resolutions regarding financial literacy and financial education issues. Gen Z is primed for deep engagement around future-focused payments solutions, but the conversation and learning and introduction of new financial technologies for this generation must occur within an experience that complements their values, interests and goals.  To this end, the financial literacy facilities built within our Platform target both the parent and the child.  These built-in guidelines will prepare children for the financial responsibilities they will have in the future and prepare them for the emerging digital economy.



Our Solution



Our goal, moving forward is to enable both incumbent and new FinTech participants, as well as key verticals with a large base of ‘family accounts,’ to provide their consumers with safe and empowering youth money management and financial literacy content and tools via the mobile payment platform.



While some of the REGO Platform can be easily duplicated/commoditized, such as the app skin, APIs to retailers, APIs to financial infrastructure and cloud storage, we believe that defending our market position rests on three factors:


1. | The ability to define data control settings from parent to child.
---+------------------------------------------------------------------


Our approach to this opportunity uses a master account to dictate purchase rules to sub-accounts via a hierarchical architecture. This approach adheres to data flow and privacy policy requirements specifically outlined for COPPA compliance. We believe other approaches based on machine learning, or other artificial intelligence methodologies are potentially viable alternatives but are likely too costly, do not meet current compliance timelines, and may defy the core of COPPA’s “opt-in” parameters. There is considerable room for next-generation automation techniques to be layered on REGO’s hierarchical approach. Given its current stability and scalability metrics, the REGO Platform strongly features these advances in its technical development roadmap without compromising any of its current data control performance.




2. | The ability to (mis) attribute the child’s transaction and personal identification.
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


REGO has solved this issue by masking user data and maintaining separate identity and financial data flows. As a result, REGO can verify the age of the internet user through the transaction lifecycle on its Platform. Authenticating and validating the identity of the actual user on the internet maintains one of the more difficult cybersecurity challenges. Current approaches are mainly not for commercial use; however, there is investment in commercial innovation in this area. REGO’s data control features and its (mis)attribution approach is inextricably linked and a key to its scalability and extensibility.

-


3. | The ability to disseminate transactional data on minors while remaining COPPA and GDPR compliant.
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




The highest value data will be that which shows the most nuanced detail afforded under current regulations. Without extreme data control features, such as in the REGO Platform, any lesser data precision will be less valuable. 



These three factors are all supported by REGO’s patented technology.



REGO addresses hard industry problems such as:


● | COPPA compliant technology with a key component being its ability to verify the age of an internet user
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | A master and sub-account architecture with the ability to administer user-specific controls
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | An advanced rules engine to provide strict automated compliance of the parental rules for each child
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Near real-time buying behavior database on minors - anonymized geolocation, age range and purchases
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




Currently, we are targeting established brands with large family-focused account bases — including banks, telecommunication companies, faith-based organizations, media distributors, mobile device Original Equipment Manufacturers (“OEMs”), and merchants.



We are seeking partners that will leverage our Platform to:

Buy vs. Build: Partners can license or revenue share for their specific market or field of use a safe, compliant system, instead of building one on their own.



Safety & Security: Partners can safely engage a younger consumer segment and their families with a new family friendly peer-to-peer-payment approach.  Vendors will be explicitly protected from non-compliant transactions and the underlying technology protects the privacy of the user.
Youth Financial Literacy: Partners can expand their brand story around empowerment and education of youth financial literacy while engaging their ‘future customers’ with Gen Z, a digital native population of post-millennial youth.



The REGO Mazoola® app and associated digital wallet technology is designed to enable our partners to engage families with Gen Z and Gen Alpha youths through the leading money management, transactional and financial literacy platform that enables young people to make smart decisions about the things they value in life — including their money, their time, their ideas and their connections.  The Mazoola® app enables a new way for individual users to own and monetize their purchasing behavior that is currently unavailable to them.



In addition, we are analyzing specific components of our technology for individual monetization as well as exploring opportunities in the Business to Business (“B2B”) realm.



Other markets for potential licensed applications are:

Government social services payments where control over how benefits allowances are used is required.  This is particularly necessary in some European countries where social benefits are not being used as intended by the government or where benefits are subject to fraud.



Closed network consumer to business (C2B) and business to business (B2B).  An example is school lunch programs where the consumer can make direct mobile payments to the provider’s point of sale (POS) terminal without the need to traverse the traditional merchant payment system.  This reduces the cost per transaction for the vendor and provides instant non-repudiated settlement.  Many school lunch programs are now provided by large catering companies.  This is particularly valuable as credit card fees, transaction fees and service fees can exceed 3% in overhead costs per transaction dependent on the negotiated rate.  Removing this overhead can have a significant positive financial impact on profitability.  It also allows the closed network to own its own behavioral use data thus obviating the need to pay a third party for the same data.

Our Intellectual Property



Intellectual property is important to our business. The Company has four issued patents with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”), entitled “Parent Match,” “System and Method for Verifying the Age of an Internet User,” “System and Method for Virtual Piggy Bank Wish-List” and “System and Method for Virtual Piggy Bank.” The Company has filed for one provisional U.S. patent application, as well as twelve non-provisional U.S. patent applications, one of which is pending, four of which have been allowed, and seven of which have been abandoned. Additionally, the Company has been granted two patents, entitled “Virtual Piggy Bank” and “Parent Match,” in each of Germany, Canada, and Australia.  The Company also has patents pending in the Republic of Korea under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (“PCT”).  Costs associated with the registration and legal defense of the patents have been capitalized and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated lives of the patents.



The following are the names and brief descriptions of our patents:

Despite certain precautions taken by us, it may be possible for third parties to obtain and use our intellectual property without authorization. This risk may be increased due to the lack of patent and/or copyright protection.  If any of our proprietary rights are misappropriated or we are forced to defend our intellectual property rights, we will have to incur substantial costs. Such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources, including diverting the time and effort of our senior management, and could disrupt our business, as well as have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. Management will from time to time determine whether applying for and pursuing patent and copyright protection is appropriate for us. We have no guarantee that any applications will be granted or, if awarded, whether they will offer us any meaningful protection from other companies in our business, or that we will have the financial resources to oppose any actual or threatened infringement by any third party.  Furthermore, any patent or copyrights that we may be granted may be held by a court to infringe on the intellectual property rights of others and subject us to the payment of damage awards.



In addition, we cannot be certain that our technology will not infringe upon patents, copyrights or other intellectual property rights held by third parties. While we know of no basis for any claims of this type, the existence of and ownership of intellectual property can be difficult to verify, and we have not made an exhaustive search of all patent filings. We may become subject to legal proceedings and claims from time to time relating to the intellectual property of others in the ordinary course of our business. If we are found to have violated the intellectual property rights of others, we may be enjoined from using such intellectual property, and we may incur licensing fees or be forced to develop alternative technology or obtain other licenses. In addition, we may incur substantial expenses in defending against these third-party infringement claims and be diverted from devoting time to our business and operational issues, regardless of the merits of any such claim.



Research and Development



During 2022 and 2021, our research and product development expenses were approximately $2.1 million and $2.8 million, all of which were borne by us.



Our Revenue Model



Our ability to generate and grow revenue is affected by consumer spending patterns, merchants and consumer adoption of digital payment methods.  We are relying on the growth of mobile devices and the applications that will be used by merchants and consumers on those devices, and the transition from cash and checks to digital forms of payment, including cryptocurrencies. Our strategy to drive revenue in our business includes the following:

● | Utilize our COPPA compliant platform to capitalize on mobile device applications
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | License or enter into revenue sharing agreements around our technology for use with compatible technologies focusing on digital forms of payment
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Utilize the blockchain component of the platform in conjunction with cryptocurrencies
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




As of the date of this report, we have not generated significant revenue. Our previous revenues were generated by taking a small percentage of every transaction from an online merchant. Until now this was our only revenue source. As we proceed through 2023, we expect to seek additional revenue streams as follows:


● | Private labeling licenses for: FinTech companies, telecommunication vendors, distributors, and value-added resellers (VAR)
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | User subscription fees based on premium services
--+-------------------------------------------------


● | Transaction and processing fees for both closed and open network transactions
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Special services fees for ad hoc special requests
--+--------------------------------------------------


● | Data analytics sales – using algorithms to analyze use data for sale to data brokers (meta data)
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Advertising revenue – for context-based push messaging to subscribers
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Shared transaction revenue or rebates from banking partners
--+------------------------------------------------------------




On March 8, 2023, we entered into a Partner Acceleration Program Agreement with Q2 Software, Inc. (“Q2”). Pursuant to this agreement, we will integrate our certified COPPA-compliant white label Family Wallet Banking-as-a-Platform into to Q2’s digital banking platform. The agreement will make our family wallet available to Q2’s network of 450 financial institution customers to allow end-user customers of subscribing financial institutions to utilize our family wallet.

Our Plan of Operation



We launched our Mazoola® app in 2021. In 2022, the following enhancements were made:


 
● | Added support for complex families
--+-----------------------------------


● | Redesigned UI from the ground up
--+---------------------------------


● | Moved to React Native for a unified codebase for iOS and Android
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


● | Simplified Peer-to-Peer
--+------------------------


● | Improved Fraud Prevention
--+--------------------------


● | Switched to Mastercard's Finicity for connecting bank accounts
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


● | Added Biometric Authentication
--+-------------------------------


● | Migrated ChoreCheck Users to Mazoola
--+-------------------------------------


● | Capture Device Info to Simplify Support
--+----------------------------------------


● | Created POC of Stock Investing Feature
--+---------------------------------------




In addition to expanding the existing payment solution to a growing US and global customer base, management believes there is robust demand for:




1. | A digital ecosystem for children embedded within a marketplace of service offerings, delivered via in-house technology and through third party integrations (“super app”). The inherent fenced design and systems architecture of the Mazoola® digital wallet aligns well with the overall purpose and approach of a “super app”— to offer a wide array of services within a controlled environment on mobile operating systems, such as iOS and Android.
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Expanded in-application service modules such as investments, charitable giving, and financial literacy, as well as, the inclusion of new marketplaces, health centers, and logistic/inventory management systems.
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | Predictive analytic products and services based on REGO’s anonymized data collection techniques.
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4. | A two-sided platform of the REGO offering, MazoolaPay, which is currently in later stage development. This provides a way for retailers to offer families a compliant payment offering when engaging in e-commerce transactions.

Sales and Marketing Strategy



In 2023, we are working with small and large banks, credit unions and other channel providers for the adoption of our unique wallet for their family clients. Additionally, we are also focusing on onboarding established brands with large family-focused account bases that would enable us to co-brand our platform and reach the Gen Z and Gen Alpha population through the FinTech industry. The Company maintains its view that these channels are most likely to provide rapid adoption of its technology across a broader industry segment.
Seasonality



Our new model should not be subject to seasonality.



Competition



The global payments industry is highly competitive. There is a continuous introduction of new entrants into the market and the development of new technologies and product offerings in the global payments industry, which is already highly competitive.  It is continuously changing, highly innovative, and increasingly subject to regulatory scrutiny and oversight. We compete against a wide range of businesses. Most of our current and potential competitors may be larger than we are, have larger customer bases, greater brand recognition, longer operating histories, a dominant or more secure position, or broader geographic scope than we do, or offer products and services that we do not offer. Although payment services such as Zelle, Venmo, PayPal, Amex Bluebird, FamZoo and Visa Buxx can be viewed as our competitors, we do not believe that these provide the type of family friendly solution that not only teaches young people about saving, spending, and giving, while being compliant with COPPA and other laws that users of all ages need to be aware of, including but not limited to privacy, data collection, and security. We will compete against many companies that are larger than we are in a wide range of businesses, including banks, credit card providers, technology and ecommerce companies and traditional retailers.  We will compete against various forms of payment methods including cash and checks, credit and debit cards, automated clearing house, mobile payments and other online payment services.



To compete effectively, we will focus a majority of our 2023 resources on product distribution and licensing and technology and product development.

Government Regulation



The industry which we serve is subject to regulation by the FTC, laws such as COPPA, and other laws relating to collection, use, retention, and security. Complying with these varying U.S. and international requirements, such as GDPR, could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business. In addition, we have and post on our websites our own privacy policies and practices concerning the collection, use and disclosure of user data.  Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with our posted privacy policies or with any regulatory requirements or orders or other federal, state or international privacy or consumer protection-related laws and regulations could result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others, subject us to significant penalties and negative publicity and adversely affect us. In addition, we are subject to the possibility of security breaches, which themselves may result in a violation of these laws.



The Company has added preventative measures to reduce the risk of non-compliance and security breaches.  However, as the Company utilizes third party infrastructure, the risk of security breaches cannot be guaranteed but the Company has performed reasonable efforts to mitigate risk.



Human Capital Resources



As of December 31, 2022, we had 4 employees, who were working in the areas of marketing, programming and product development, web development, finance and administration.  None of our employees are represented by a union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We believe that our relations with our employees are good.

We outsource our marketing efforts and most of our product development costs. Our relationship with all of these vendors is good.
