Item 1. Business
General
NexPoint Real Estate Finance, Inc. (the “Company”, “we”, “our”) is a commercial mortgage REIT incorporated in Maryland on June 7, 2019 that has elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). The Company is focused on originating, structuring and investing in first-lien mortgage loans, mezzanine loans, preferred equity, convertible notes, multifamily properties and common stock investments, as well as multifamily commercial mortgage-backed securities securitizations (“CMBS securitizations”), multifamily structured credit risk notes (“MSCR Notes”) and mortgage-backed securities, or our target assets. Substantially all of the Company’s business is conducted through NexPoint Real Estate Finance Operating Partnership, L.P. (the “OP”), the Company’s operating partnership. As of December 31, 2022, the Company held approximately 83.36% of the common limited partnership units in the OP (“OP Units”) which represents 100% of the Class A OP Units, and the OP owned all of the common limited partnership units (“SubOP Units”) of its three subsidiary partnerships (collectively, the “Subsidiary OPs”) (see Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements). At the 2021 annual meeting of the Company, the Company's stockholders approved the potential issuance of 13,758,905.9 shares of the Company’s common stock to related parties in connection with the redemption of their OP Units or SubOP Units that may be redeemed for OP Units. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has issued 8,748,735 shares of the Company’s common stock to the redeeming unitholders. 
The OP also directly owns all of the membership interests of a limited liability company (the “Mezz LLC”) through which it owns a portfolio of mezzanine loans, as further discussed below. NexPoint Real Estate Finance OP GP, LLC (the “OP GP”) is the sole general partner of the OP. In addition to OP Units, the Company holds all 2,000,000 of the issued and outstanding 8.50% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units (liquidation preference $25.00 per unit) in our OP (the “Series A Preferred Units”). The Series A Preferred Units have economic terms that are substantially the same as the terms of our 8.50% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock (the “Series A Preferred Stock”). The Series A Preferred Units rank, as to distributions and upon liquidation, senior to OP Units.
The Company commenced operations on February 11, 2020 upon the closing of its initial public offering of shares of its common stock (the “IPO”). Prior to the closing of the IPO, the Company engaged in a series of transactions through which it acquired an initial portfolio consisting of senior pooled mortgage loans backed by single family rental (“SFR”) properties (the “SFR Loans”), the junior most bonds of multifamily CMBS securitizations (the “CMBS B-Pieces”), mezzanine loan and preferred equity investments in real estate companies and properties in other structured real estate investments within the multifamily, SFR and self-storage asset classes (the “Initial Portfolio”). The Initial Portfolio was acquired from affiliates (the “Contribution Group”) of our Sponsor, pursuant to a contribution agreement with the Contribution Group through which the Contribution Group contributed their interest in the Initial Portfolio to special purpose entities (“SPEs”) owned by the Subsidiary OPs, in exchange for SubOP Units (the “Formation Transaction”). Subsequent to the Formation Transaction, the Company has continued to invest in asset types and real estate sectors within the Initial Portfolio and expanded to include additional asset types and real estate sectors.
The Company is externally managed through a management agreement dated February 6, 2020 and amended as of July 17, 2020 and November 3, 2021, for an initial three-year term that expired on February 6, 2023 and successive one-year terms thereafter unless earlier terminated (as amended, the “Management Agreement”), by and between the Company and the Manager. The Manager conducts substantially all of the Company’s operations and provides asset management services for its real estate investments. The Company expects it will only have accounting employees while the Management Agreement is in effect. All of the Company’s investment decisions are made by the Manager, subject to general oversight by the Manager’s investment committee and the Company’s board of directors (the “Board”). The Manager is wholly owned by our Sponsor.
The Company’s primary investment objective is to generate attractive, risk-adjusted returns for stockholders over the long term. We intend to achieve this objective primarily by originating, structuring and investing in our target assets. We concentrate on investments in real estate sectors where our senior management team has operating expertise, including in the multifamily, SFR, self-storage, life science, hospitality and office sectors predominantly in the top 50 metropolitan statistical areas (“MSAs”). In addition, we target lending or investing in properties that are stabilized or have a “light transitional” business plan, meaning a property that requires limited deferred funding to support leasing or ramp-up of operations and for which most capital expenditures are for value-add improvements. Through active portfolio management we seek to take advantage of market opportunities to achieve a superior portfolio risk-mix that delivers attractive total returns.

(5)The master repurchase agreement with Mizuho does not have a stated maturity date. The transactions in place have a one-month to two-month tenor and are expected to roll accordingly.
Notes Offering
On January 25, 2022, the Company issued $35.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.75% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2026 (the “5.75% Notes”) at a price equal to 100.9% of par value, including accrued interest, for proceeds of approximately $35.1 million after original issue discount and underwriting fees. The proceeds of the issuance were used to purchase a preferred equity investment. During 2022, the Company purchased $5.0 million in aggregate principal amount of its 5.75% Notes which were cancelled upon settlement. As of December 31, 2022, there was $165.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the 5.75% Notes outstanding.
OP Unit Redemption
At the 2021 annual meeting of the Company, the Company's stockholders approved the potential issuance of 13,758,905.9 shares of the Company's common stock to related parties in connection with the redemption of their OP Units or SubOP Units that may be redeemed for OP Units. During 2022, the Company issued 7,269,603 shares of the Company’s common stock to redeeming unitholders. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had issued 8,748,735 shares of the Company’s common stock to redeeming unitholders.
At-the-Market-Program
On March 15, 2022, the Company, the OP and the Manager entered into separate equity distribution agreements (the “2022 Equity Distribution Agreements”) with each of Raymond James & Associates, Inc. ("Raymond James"), Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc., Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated and Virtu Americas LLC (collectively, the “Sales Agents”), pursuant to which the Company could issue and sell from time to time shares of the Company's common stock and Series A Preferred Stock having an aggregate sales price of up to $100.0 million (the “2022 ATM Program”). The 2022 Equity Distribution Agreements provide for the issuance and sale of common stock or Series A Preferred Stock by the Company through a Sales Agent acting as a Sales Agent or directly to the Sales Agent acting as principal for its own account at a price agreed upon at the time of sale. As of December 31, 2022, pursuant to the 2022 Equity Distribution Agreements, the Company had sold 531,728 shares of its common stock and zero shares of Series A Preferred Stock for total gross sales of $12.6 million. For additional information about the 2022 ATM Program, see Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements.
Share Repurchase Program
On March 9, 2020, the Board authorized a share repurchase program (the “Share Repurchase Program”) through which the Company could repurchase an indeterminate number of shares of our common stock at an aggregate market value of up to $10.0 million in shares of its common stock, par value $0.01 per share, during a two-year period that expired on March 9, 2022. On September 28, 2020, the Board authorized the expansion of the Share Repurchase Program to include the Company’s Series A Preferred Stock with the same period and repurchase limit. The Company could utilize various methods to affect the repurchases, and the timing and extent of the repurchases will depend upon several factors, including market and business conditions, regulatory requirements and other corporate considerations, including whether the Company’s common stock is trading at a significant discount to net asset value ("NAV") per share. Repurchases under this program could be discontinued at any time. From inception through expiration, the Company  repurchased 327,422 shares of its common stock, par value $0.01 per share, at a total cost of approximately $4.8 million, or $14.61 per share. These repurchased shares of common stock are classified as treasury stock and reduce the number of shares of the Company’s common stock outstanding and, accordingly, are considered in the weighted-average number of shares outstanding during the period in which the repurchases were made. On March 3, 2021, the Company cancelled 40,435 shares of common stock, reducing the total classified as treasury stock to 286,987.
NexPoint Storage Partners, Inc.
On December 8, 2022 and in connection with a restructuring of NexPoint Storage Partners, Inc. (“NSP”), the Company, through a subsidiary (“REIT Sub”), together with NexPoint Diversified Real Estate Trust, Highland Income Fund and NexPoint Real Estate Strategies Fund (collectively, the “Co-Guarantors”), as guarantors, entered into a Sponsor Guaranty Agreement in favor of Extra Space Storage, LP ("Extra Space") pursuant to which REIT Sub and the Co-
Table of Contents

Guarantors guaranteed obligations of NSP with respect to NSP’s newly created Series D Preferred Stock and two promissory notes in an aggregate principal amount of approximately $64.2 million issued to Extra Space. The guaranties by REIT Sub and the Co-Guarantors are capped at $97.6 million, which cap amount will be reduced as the guaranteed obligations of NSP are paid. Each of REIT Sub and the Co-Guarantors generally guaranteed the foregoing obligations of NSP up to the cap amount on a pro rata basis with respect to its percentage ownership of NSP’s common stock. The maximum liability of REIT Sub under the guaranties is approximately $83.8 million. As of December 31, 2022, the Company owns approximately 25.8% of the total outstanding shares of common stock of NSP.
Bridge Loan Financing
On July 28, 2022, the Company entered into a $38.7 million bridge facility (the “July 2022 Bridge Facility”) with Raymond James Bank, N.A. and immediately drew $38.7 million. The proceeds from the July 2022 Bridge Facility were used to financing the acquisition of the FREMF 2022-KF140 securitization. On July 29, 2022, the July Bridge Facility was repaid in full and is no longer outstanding.
Freddie Mac Credit Facility
During 2022, the Company made payments under a Credit Facility (defined below) assumed by the Company as part of the Formation Transaction in the amount of $97.7 million. The Credit Facility is guaranteed by certain members of the Contribution Group and the OP and secured by senior pooled mortgage loans backed by SFR properties (the “Underlying Loans”). The guarantors are subject to minimum net worth liquidity covenants. The Company’s borrowings under the Credit Facility will mature on July 12, 2029; however, if an Underlying Loan matures or is paid off prior to July 12, 2029, the Company will be required to repay the portion of the Credit Facility that is allocated to that loan. No additional borrowings can be made under the Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2022, the outstanding balance on the Credit Facility was $628.6 million.
Convertible Promissory Note
On October 18, 2022, the Company, through a subsidiary, borrowed $6.5 million from NFRO REIT Sub, LLC (the “Holder”) and issued $6.5 million aggregate amount of a 7.50% note to the Holder maturing on October 18, 2027. Beginning on January 1, 2023 through June 30, 2027, the Holder may elect to convert all or any part of the outstanding principal and accrued but unpaid interest due, and all other amounts due and payable to the Holder thereunder or in connection therewith, into equity interests of an affiliate of the borrower.
Our Portfolio
Our portfolio consists of SFR Loans, CMBS B-Pieces, CMBS I/O Strips, mezzanine loans, preferred equity investments, common stock investments, multifamily properties, MSCR Notes and mortgage-backed securities with a combined unpaid principal balance of $2.0 billion at December 31, 2022 and assumes the assets and liabilities of the ten Freddie Mac K-Series securitization entities (the “CMBS Entities”) are not consolidated. For more information about the CMBS Entities, see Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements.
Our portfolio, based on total unpaid principal balance as of December 31, 2022, excluding the consolidation of the CMBS B-Pieces, as described further below, is approximately 42.6% SFR Loans, approximately 36.0% multifamily CMBS B-Pieces, approximately 2.9% CMBS I/O Strips, approximately 10.1% mezzanine loans, approximately 5.7% preferred equity investments, approximately 0.6% MSCR Notes, and approximately 2.1% mortgage backed securities. Total liabilities, excluding the consolidation of the CMBS B-Pieces, with respect to each of the aforementioned investment structures in our portfolio are approximately $628.6 million, approximately $283.9 million, approximately $26.4 million, approximately $59.3 million, approximately $0.0 million, approximately $0.0 million and approximately $0.0 million, respectively. Our CMBS B-Piece investments as a percentage of total assets, excluding the consolidation of the CMBS B-Pieces, reflects the assets that we actually own. However, in accordance with the applicable accounting standards, we consolidate all of the assets and liabilities of the trusts that issued the CMBS B-Pieces that we own which we are deemed to control.
Our portfolio, based on total unpaid principal balance as of December 31, 2022, including the consolidation of the CMBS B-Pieces, is approximately 8.9% SFR Loans, approximately 86.7% multifamily CMBS B-Pieces, approximately 0.6% CMBS I/O Strips, approximately 2.1% mezzanine loans, approximately 1.2% preferred equity investments, approximately 0.1% MSCR Notes, and approximately 0.4% mortgage-backed securities. Total liabilities, including the consolidation of the CMBS B-Pieces, with respect to each of the aforementioned investment structures in our portfolio are

approximately $628.6 million, approximately $6.2 billion, approximately $26.4 million, approximately $59.3 million, approximately $0.0 million, approximately $0.0 million and approximately $0.0 million, respectively.
Our portfolio, based on net equity as of December 31, 2022, is approximately 14.8% SFR Loans, approximately 28.0% multifamily CMBS B-Pieces, approximately 3.1% CMBS I/O Strips, approximately 15.9% mezzanine loans, approximately 13.7% preferred equity investments, approximately 11.8% common stock investments, approximately 9.5% multifamily property real estate, approximately 0.7% MSCR Notes, and approximately 2.5% mortgage-backed securities. Net equity represents the carrying value less our leverage on the asset.
As a whole, we believe our portfolio of investments have a relatively low risk profile: 92.9% of the underlying properties in our portfolio are stabilized and have a weighted average occupancy of 89.5%; the portfolio-wide weighted average debt service coverage ratio (“DSCR”) is 1.78; the weighted average loan to value (“LTV”) of our investments is 68.6%; and the weighted average maturity is 5.9 years as of December 31, 2022. These metrics do not reflect our common stock investments in NSP and the Private REIT or our multifamily properties, shown as real estate investment, net on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, at December 31, 2022.

Our primary investment objective is to generate attractive, risk-adjusted returns for stockholders over the long term. We intend to achieve this objective primarily by originating, structuring and investing in our target assets. We target lending or investing in properties that are stabilized or have a light transitional business plan with positive DSCRs and high-quality sponsors. 
Through active portfolio management we seek to take advantage of market opportunities to achieve a superior portfolio risk-mix that delivers attractive total returns. Our Manager regularly monitors and stress-tests each investment and the portfolio as a whole under various scenarios, enabling us to make informed and proactive investment decisions.
Target Investments
We invest primarily in first-lien mortgage loans, mezzanine loans, preferred equity, convertible notes, multifamily properties and common stock investments, as well as multifamily CMBS securitizations (including CMBS B-Pieces and CMBS I/O Strips), MSCR Notes and mortgage-backed securities, with a focus on lending or investing in properties that are stabilized or have a light transitional business plan primarily in the multifamily, SFR, self-storage, hospitality and office real estate sectors predominantly in the top 50 MSAs. These investment types are discussed below:
•First-Lien Mortgage Loans: We make investments in senior loans that are secured by first priority mortgage liens on real estate properties. The loans may vary in duration, bear interest at a fixed or floating rate and amortize, typically with a balloon payment of principal at maturity. These investments may include whole loans or pari passu participations within such senior loans.
•Mezzanine Loans: We originate or acquire mezzanine loans. These loans are subordinate to the first-lien mortgage loan on a property, but senior to the equity of the borrower. These loans are not secured by the underlying real estate, but generally can be converted into preferred equity of the mortgage borrower or owner of a mortgage borrower, as applicable.
•Preferred Equity: We make investments that are subordinate to any mortgage or mezzanine loan, but senior to the common equity of the borrower. Preferred equity investments typically receive a preferred return from the issuer’s cash flow rather than interest payments and often have the right for such preferred return to accrue if there is insufficient cash flow for current payment. These investments are not secured by the underlying real estate, but upon the occurrence of a default, the preferred equity provider typically has the right to effect a change of control with respect to the ownership of the property.
•CMBS B-Pieces: We make investments in the junior-most bonds comprising some or all of the BB-rated, B-rated and unrated tranches of CMBS securitization pools. In the CMBS structure, underlying commercial real estate loans are typically aggregated into a pool with the pool issuing and selling different tranches of bonds and securities to different investors. Under the pooling and servicing agreements that govern these securitization pools, the loans are administered by a trustee and servicers, who act on behalf of all CMBS investors, distribute the underlying cash 
Table of Contents

flows to the different classes of securities in accordance with their seniority. Historically, a single investor acquires all of the below-investment grade securities that comprise each CMBS B-Piece. CMBS B-Pieces have been a successful and sought-after securitization program offering a wide-range of residential and multifamily products. As of December 31, 2022, there have been 510 Freddie Mac K-deal issuances for a combined $522.1 billion and 24,997 loans originated and securitized since 2009.
•CMBS I/O Strips: We make investments in CMBS I/O Strips, which are interest only and inverse interest only CMBS securitization that represent the right to the interest component of the cash flow from a pool of mortgage loans of CMBS structured pass-through certificates.
•MSCR Notes: We make investments in MSCR Notes, which are unguaranteed securities designed to transfer to investors a portion of the credit risk associated with eligible multifamily mortgages linked to a reference pool. MSCR Notes offer capital markets investors provide an innovative way to add U.S. multifamily housing market exposure while benefiting from Freddie Mac’s industry leading underwriting and credit risk management standards.
•Mortgage Backed Securities: We make investments in mortgage-backed securities. Each mortgage-backed security consists of a bundle of home loans and other real estate debt bought from issuers. We receive periodic payments similar to bond coupon payments.
•Convertible Notes: We originate or acquire convertible notes. These notes are subordinate to any first mortgage and can be converted into common equity of the borrower.
•Common Stock: We acquire common stock in the real estate sector, including through convertible notes that can provide a stable source of income through dividends, opportunities for capital appreciation, and a level of diversification to our Portfolio. 
•Multifamily Property: We make investments in multifamily properties with a value-add component in large cities and suburban submarkets of large cities primarily in the Southeastern and Southwestern United States.
Our Financing Strategy
While we do not have any formal restrictions or policy with respect to our debt-to-equity leverage ratio, we currently expect that our leverage will not exceed a ratio of 3-to-l. We believe this leverage ratio is prudent given that leverage typically exists at the asset level. The amount of leverage we may employ for particular assets depends upon the availability of particular types of financing and our Manager’s assessment of the credit, liquidity, price volatility and other risks of those assets and financing counterparties. Our decision to use leverage to finance our assets is at the discretion of our Manager, subject to review by our Board, and is not subject to the approval of our stockholders. We generally intend to match leverage term and structure to that of the underlying investment financed. For additional information on sources of and trends regarding our liquidity, see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources.”

Our Structure
The following chart shows our ownership structure as of the date hereof:
Our Manager
We are externally managed by our Manager through the Management Agreement dated February 6, 2020 and amended as of July 17, 2020 and November 3, 2021, for an initial three-year term that expired on February 6, 2023 and successive one-year terms thereafter unless earlier terminated. Our Manager conducts substantially all of our operations and provides asset management services for our real estate investments. We expect we will only have accounting employees while the Management Agreement is in effect. All of our investment decisions are made by our Manager, subject to general oversight by our Manager’s investment committee and the Board. Our Manager is wholly owned by our Sponsor. The members of our Manager’s investment committee are James Dondero, Matt McGraner, Matthew Goetz, and Brian Mitts.
Our Management Agreement
We pay our Manager an annual management fee. We do not pay any incentive fees to our Manager. We also reimburse our Manager for expenses it incurs on our behalf. 
Pursuant to the Management Agreement, subject to the overall supervision of our Board, our Manager manages our day-to-day operations, and provides investment management services to us. Under the terms of this agreement, our Manager will, among other things:
•identify, evaluate and negotiate the structure of our investments (including performing due diligence);
•find, present and recommend investment opportunities consistent with our investment policies and objectives;
•structure the terms and conditions of our investments;
Table of Contents

•review and analyze financial information for each investment in our overall portfolio;
•close, monitor and administer our investments; and
•identify debt and equity capital needs and procure the necessary capital.
As consideration for the Manager’s services, we pay our Manager an annual management fee of 1.5% of Equity (as defined below), paid monthly, in cash or shares of our common stock at the election of our Manager (the “Annual Fee”).
“Equity” means (a) the sum of (1) total stockholders’ equity immediately prior to the closing of the IPO, plus (2) the net proceeds received by us from all issuances of our equity securities in and after the IPO, plus (3) our cumulative Earnings Available for Distribution (“EAD”) from and after the IPO to the end of the most recently completed calendar quarter, (b) less (1) any distributions to holders of our common stock from and after the IPO to the end of the most recently completed calendar quarter and (2) all amounts that we have paid to repurchase for cash the shares of our equity securities from and after the IPO to the end of the most recently completed calendar quarter. In our calculation of Equity, we will adjust our calculation of EAD to remove the compensation expense relating to awards granted under one or more of our long-term incentive plans that is added back in our calculation of EAD. Additionally, for the avoidance of doubt, Equity does not include the assets contributed to us in the Formation Transaction. 
“EAD” means the net income (loss) attributable to our common stockholders computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles it the United States (“GAAP”), including realized gains and losses not otherwise included in net income (loss), excluding any unrealized gains or losses or other similar non-cash items that are included in net income (loss) for the applicable reporting period, regardless of whether such items are included in other comprehensive income (loss), or in net income (loss) and adding back amortization of stock-based compensation. Net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders may also be adjusted for the effects of certain adjustments made in accordance with GAAP and transactions that may not be indicative of our current operations, in each case after discussions between the Manager and the independent directors of our Board and approved by a majority of the independent directors of our Board.
Incentive compensation may be payable to our executive officers and certain other employees of our Manager or its affiliates pursuant to a long-term incentive plan adopted by us and approved by our stockholders. As discussed above, compensation expense is not considered when determining EAD, in that we add back compensation expense to net income in the calculation of EAD. However, compensation expense is considered when determining Equity, in that we will adjust our calculation of EAD to remove the compensation expense that is added back in our calculation of EAD. 
We are required to pay directly or reimburse our Manager for all of the documented “operating expenses” (all out-of-pocket expenses of our Manager in performing services for us, including but not limited to the expenses incurred by our Manager in connection with any provision by our Manager of legal, accounting, financial and due diligence services performed by our Manager that outside professionals or outside consultants would otherwise perform, compensation expenses under any long-term incentive plan adopted by us and approved by our stockholders and our pro rata share of rent, telephone, utilities, office furniture, equipment, machinery and other office, internal and overhead expenses of our Manager required for our operations) and “offering expenses” (any and all expenses (other than underwriters’ discounts) paid or to be paid by us in connection with an offering of our securities, including, without limitation, our legal, accounting, printing, mailing and filing fees and other documented offering expenses) paid or incurred by our Manager or its affiliates in connection with the services it provides to us pursuant to the Management Agreement. However, our Manager is responsible, and we will not reimburse our Manager or its affiliates, for the salaries or benefits to be paid to personnel of our Manager or its affiliates who serve as our officers, except that 50% of the salary of our VP of Finance is allocated to us and we may grant equity awards to our officers under a long-term incentive plan adopted by us and approved by our stockholders. Direct payment of operating expenses by us, which includes compensation expense relating to equity awards granted under our long-term incentive plan, together with reimbursement of operating expenses to our Manager, plus the Annual Fee, may not exceed 2.5% of equity book value for any calendar year or portion thereof, provided, however, that this limitation will not apply to offering expenses, legal, accounting, financial, due diligence and other service fees incurred in connection with extraordinary litigation and mergers and acquisitions and other events outside the ordinary course of our business or any out-of-pocket acquisition or due diligence expenses incurred in connection with the acquisition or disposition of certain real estate-related investments. To the extent total corporate general and administrative (“G&A”) expenses would otherwise exceed 2.5% of equity book value, our Manager will waive all or a portion of the Annual Fee to keep our total corporate G&A expenses at or below 2.5% of equity book value.
The Management Agreement has an initial three-year term that expired on February 6, 2023 and successive one-year terms thereafter unless earlier terminated. We have the right to terminate the Management Agreement on 30 days’ written notice upon the occurrence of a cause event (as defined in the Management Agreement). The Management Agreement can 
Table of Contents

be terminated by us or our Manager without cause upon the expiration of the then-current term with at least 180 days’ written notice to the other party prior to the expiration of such term. Our Manager may also terminate the agreement with 30 days’ written notice if we have materially breached the agreement and such breach has continued for 30 days before we are given such notice. In addition, the Management Agreement will automatically terminate in the event of an Advisers Act Assignment (as defined in the Management Agreement) unless we provide written consent. A termination fee will be payable to our Manager by us upon termination of the Management Agreement for any reason, including non-renewal, other than a termination by us upon the occurrence of a cause event or due to an Advisers Act Assignment. The termination fee will be equal to three times the average Annual Fee earned by our Manager during the two-year period immediately preceding the most recently completed calendar quarter prior to the effective termination date.
Under the terms of the Management Agreement, our Manager will indemnify and hold harmless us, our subsidiaries and our OP from all claims, liabilities, damages, losses, costs and expenses, including amounts paid in satisfaction of judgments, in compromises and settlements, as fines and penalties and legal or other costs and expenses of investigating or defending against any claim or alleged claim, of any nature whatsoever, known or unknown, liquidated or unliquidated, that are incurred by reason of our Manager’s bad faith, fraud, willful misfeasance, intentional misconduct, gross negligence or reckless disregard of its duties; provided, however, that our Manager will not be held responsible for any action of our Board in following or declining to follow any written advice or written recommendation given by our Manager. However, the aggregate maximum amount that our Manager may be liable to us pursuant to the Management Agreement will, to the extent not prohibited by law, never exceed the amount of the Annual Fees received by our Manager under the Management Agreement prior to the date that the acts or omissions giving rise to a claim for indemnification or liability have occurred. In addition, our Manager will not be liable for special, exemplary, punitive, indirect, or consequential loss, or damage of any kind whatsoever, including without limitation lost profits. The limitations described in the preceding two sentences will not apply, however, to the extent such damages are determined in a final binding non-appealable court or arbitration proceeding to result from the bad faith, fraud, willful misfeasance, intentional misconduct, gross negligence or reckless disregard of our Manager’s duties.
Competition
Our profitability depends, in large part, on our ability to acquire our target assets at attractive prices. We are subject to significant competition in acquiring our target assets. In particular, we will compete with a variety of institutional investors, including other REITs, specialty finance companies, public and private funds, commercial and investment banks, hedge funds, mortgage bankers, commercial finance and insurance companies, governmental bodies and other financial institutions. We may also compete with our Sponsor and its affiliates for investment opportunities. There are significant potential conflicts of interest that could affect our investment returns. In addition, there are several REITs with similar investment objectives and others may be organized in the future. These other REITs will increase competition for the available supply of our target assets and other real estate related assets suitable for investment. Some of our anticipated competitors have greater financial resources, access to lower costs of capital and access to funding sources that may not be available to us, such as funding from the U.S. government, if we are not eligible to participate in programs established by the U.S. government. In addition, some of our competitors are not subject to the operating constraints associated with REIT tax compliance or maintenance of an exclusion or exemption from the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the “Investment Company Act”). Furthermore, some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments, or pay higher prices, than we can. Current market conditions may attract more competitors, which may increase the competition for our target assets. An increase in the competition for such assets may increase the price of such assets, which may limit our ability to generate attractive risk-adjusted current income and capital appreciation for our stockholders, thereby adversely affecting the market price of our common stock.
In the face of this competition, we expect to have access to our Sponsor’s professionals and their industry experience, which we believe will provide us with a competitive advantage and help us assess investment risks and determine appropriate pricing for potential investments. We expect that these relationships will enable us to compete more efficiently and effectively for attractive investment opportunities. Although we believe we are well positioned to compete effectively, there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve our business goals or expectations due to the extensive competition in our market sector. We operate in a competitive market for investment opportunities and future competition may limit our ability to acquire desirable investments in our target assets and could also affect the pricing of our securities.

Operating and Regulatory Structure
REIT Qualification
We have elected to be treated as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes, beginning with our taxable year ended December 31, 2020. We believe that we have been organized in conformity with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT under the Code, and that our intended manner of operation will enable us to meet the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT. However, we cannot assure you that we will qualify and remain qualified as a REIT. To qualify as a REIT, we must meet on a continuing basis, through our organization and actual investment and operating results, various requirements under the Code relating to, among other things, the sources of our gross income, the composition and values of our assets, our distribution levels and the diversity of ownership of shares of our stock. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year and do not qualify for certain statutory relief provisions, we will be subject to U.S. federal income tax at corporate rates and may be precluded from qualifying as a REIT for the subsequent four taxable years following the year during which we failed to qualify as a REIT. Even if we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we may be subject to some U.S. federal, state and local taxes on our income or property or REIT “prohibited transactions” taxes with respect to certain of our activities. Any distributions paid by us generally will not be eligible for taxation at the preferred U.S. federal income tax rates that apply to certain distributions received by individuals from taxable corporations.
Investment Company Act Exclusion
We, as well as our subsidiaries, intend to conduct our operations so that we are not required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the Investment Company Act defines an investment company as any issuer that is or holds itself out as being engaged primarily, or proposes to engage primarily, in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities. Section 3(a)(1)(C) of the Investment Company Act defines an investment company as any issuer that is engaged or proposes to engage in the business of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding or trading in securities and owns or proposes to acquire investment securities having a value exceeding 40% of the value of the issuer’s total assets (exclusive of U.S. Government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis, which we refer to as the 40% test. Excluded from the term “investment securities,” among other things, are U.S. Government securities and securities issued by majority-owned subsidiaries that are not themselves investment companies and are not relying on the exclusion from the definition of investment company set forth in Section 3(c)(1) or Section 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act.
We are organized as a holding company and conduct our business primarily through our OP and through subsidiaries of our OP. We anticipate that our OP will always be at least a majority-owned subsidiary. We intend to conduct our operations so that neither we nor our OP will hold investment securities in excess of the limit imposed by the 40% test. The securities issued by any wholly owned or majority-owned subsidiaries that we may form in the future that are excluded from the definition of “investment company” based on Section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act, together with any other investment securities we may own, may not have a value in excess of 40% of the value of our total assets (exclusive of U.S. government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis. We will monitor our holdings to ensure continuing and ongoing compliance with this test. In addition, we believe that neither we nor our OP are considered an investment company under Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the Investment Company Act because neither of us engage primarily, propose to engage primarily, or hold ourselves out as being engaged primarily in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities. Rather, we and our OP are primarily engaged in the non-investment company businesses of our subsidiaries.
We anticipate that certain of our subsidiaries will meet the requirements of the exclusion set forth in Section 3(c)(5)(C) of the Investment Company Act, which excludes entities primarily engaged in the business of “purchasing or otherwise acquiring mortgages and other liens on and interests in real estate.” To meet this exclusion, the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) staff has taken the position that at least 55% of a subsidiary’s assets must constitute qualifying assets (as interpreted by the SEC staff under the Investment Company Act) and at least another 25% of assets (subject to reduction to the extent the subsidiary invested more than 55% of its total assets in qualifying assets) must constitute real estate-related assets under the Investment Company Act (and no more than 20% comprised of miscellaneous assets). In general, we also expect, with regard to our subsidiaries relying on Section 3(c)(5)(C), to rely on other guidance published by the SEC staff and on our analyses of guidance published with respect to other types of assets to determine which assets are qualifying assets and real estate-related assets. Maintaining the Section 3(c)(5)(C) exclusion, however, will limit our ability to make certain investments.

Emerging Growth Company and Smaller Reporting Company Status
Section 107 of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the “JOBS Act”) provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), for complying with new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies. In other words, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of this extended transition period. As a result of this election, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates for such new or revised standards. We may elect to comply with public company effective dates at any time, and such election would be irrevocable pursuant to Section 107(b) of the JOBS Act.
We are also a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Regulation S-K under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and may elect to take advantage of certain of the scaled disclosures available to smaller reporting companies. We may be a smaller reporting company even after we are no longer an “emerging growth company.”
Human Capital Disclosure
We are externally managed by our Manager pursuant to the Management Agreement between us and our Manager. All of our executive officers are employees of our Manager or its affiliates. As of December 31, 2022, we had one employee whose salary is 50% allocated to us for reimbursement to our Manager. This employee is an accounting employee. We endeavor to maintain workplaces that are free from discrimination or harassment on the basis of color, race, sex, national origin, ethnicity, religion, age, disability, sexual orientation, gender identification or expression or any other status protected by applicable law. The basis for recruitment, hiring, development, training, compensation and advancement is an employee's qualifications performance, skills and experience. Our employee is fairly compensated, without regard to gender, race and ethnicity, and routinely recognized for outstanding performance.
