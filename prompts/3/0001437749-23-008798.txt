General 
 
MCX Technologies Corporation (“we,” “us,” “our,” or the “Company”) intends to acquire or develop a technologies that would become the Company’s new operating platform which may include innovations directed toward the internet’s evolution into the Web 3. During 2021 and into the first quarter of 2022, through our subsidiary The Collective Experience LLC we generated revenue by delivering digital transformation solutions to customer centric organizations through integrated marketing, data science, and commerce. We have ceased operations under TCE and we are now transitioning the focus of the Company toward new technologies.
 
We were incorporated in the State of California on December 14, 2001, as a customer experience (“CX”) management solutions company dedicated to helping organizations improve customer experiences, increase customer loyalty, reduce cost and increase revenue. The Company operated as The Innes Group, Inc., d/b/a MCorp Consulting until filing a Certificate of Amendment to the Articles of Incorporation renaming the Company Touchpoint Metrics, Inc., effective October 18, 2011. On June 11, 2015, our shareholders passed a resolution to change the name of the Company to McorpCX, Inc., and on June 29, 2020, in connection with the sale of McorpCX, LLC, as described below, our shareholders passed a resolution to change the name of the Company to MCX Technologies Corporation.
 
The Company formed a wholly owned subsidiary, McorpCX, LLC (“McorpCX LLC”) as a limited liability company in the state of Delaware on December 14, 2017. On August 16, 2018, the Company entered into a contribution agreement with its wholly owned subsidiary McorpCX LLC, pursuant to which the Company transferred to McorpCX LLC all of the Company’s assets and liabilities related to the Company’s customer experience consulting business, excluding the underlying technology and databases related thereto which remained with the Company.
 
Effective August 3, 2020, the Company sold all of its membership interests in McorpCX, LLC to mfifty, LLC, a California limited liability company controlled by Michael Hinshaw, the President of McorpCX LLC (the “Purchaser”). Since the Company’s professional and related consulting services business, which constituted substantially all of the Company’s operations at the time of the sale of McorpCX LLC, was conducted through McorpCX LLC, the sale of McorpCX LLC represented a strategic shift that we had a major effect on the Company’s operations and financial results.
 
As consideration for the sale of McorpCX LLC, the Company received a total of $352,000 in cash consisting of $100,000 received upon the signing of the purchase agreement and $252,000 received at the closing of the transaction along with a $756,000 promissory note. The promissory note has an initial annual interest rate of 0.99% (to be recalculated at the end of each twelve-month period subsequent to the date of the note based on the annual Applicable Federal Rate for mid-term loans on the first business day following each such twelve month period) accruing daily on the outstanding balance of the note, and monthly principal payments are payable to the Company over a term of four or more years. Monthly principal payments to the Company were initially $7,292 per month for the first twelve months following the date of the note, and then during each subsequent twelve-month period are based on the annual revenues of McorpCX, LLC.  The note is secured by the Purchaser's ownership interest in McorpCX LLC. On June 11, 2021, the note was amended whereby the obligor would pay $100,000 principal payment on or before July 1, 2021 and the remaining principal and interest would be paid in installments of $20,000 per month due on the first day of each month.
 
On November 12, 2020, the Company formed a wholly owned subsidiary, The Collective Experience, LLC (the “Collective Experience” or “TCE”) as a Delaware limited liability company. The Company is currently providing all of its digital transformation and marketing management consulting services, which was the Company’s sole revenue generating operations, through the Collective Experience.
 
In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus (“COVID-19”) was reported in Wuhan, China and has since extensively impacted the global health and economic environment. The outbreak in the United States, as well as the response to COVID-19 by federal, state and local governments could have a continued material adverse impact on economic and market conditions in the United States, which may negatively affect our business and operations. Although the administration of vaccines throughout the United States contributed to the lifting of most restrictive measures, there remains ongoing uncertainty about the impact of COVID-19 variations on infection levels. The re-emergence of significant increases in infection rates could result in governments re-imposing restrictive measures that could reduce or impair economic activity. Consequently, the COVID-19 pandemic and the government responses to the outbreak presents continued uncertainty and risk with respect to the Company and its performance and financial results.
 
 



As of the date of issuance of these consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company has not, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, had any significant additional financial losses or seen a negative impact on its liquidity, but the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may materially impact the Company's future financial condition, liquidity, or results of operations remains uncertain.

Products and Services
 
Our only source of revenue was derived from providing digital transformation services through our subsidiary, The Collective Experience LLC, that included brand strategy, data science, pricing science, customer experience management consulting and implementation in support of these strategies. As of April 1, 2022, TCE ceased signing new client engagements since we are no longer pursuing that segment in order to focus on alternative technologies.
Professional Services 
 
We provided professional and related consulting services through the Collective Experience including strategy, pricing science, data science, digital transformation, customer experience management consulting, implementation, and go-to-market execution in support of these strategies. These services were intended to help primarily large and medium sized organizations systematically and predictably plan, design and deliver better customer experiences, drive revenue, maximize their return on investment, improve their operational efficiency, and increase customers' adoption of their products and services. As noted above, as of April 1, 2022, TCE ceased signing new client engagements since we are no longer pursuing that segment in order to focus on alternative technologies.
Our Strategy

The Company’s management is now in the process of developing or acquiring new technologies to enable it to focus on developing and/or implementing Web 3 platforms or other technologies.
Competition 
 
There are numerous technology companies seeking ways to enter the Web 3 technologies business and various technologies are subject to rapidly changing technological developments, shifting organizational priorities and requirements, frequent introductions of new products and services, and increased marketing and sales activities of other industry participants.
 
Many competitors exist in the overlapping areas of Web 3 and traditional digital marketing, data analytics, digital transformation, cyber-currency and decentralized finance software services and consulting. Many of our current and potential competitors have a significantly larger market presence, greater name recognition, access to more potential customers and substantially greater financial, technical, sales and marketing, management, support, and other resources than we have. As a result, many of our competitors can respond more quickly than we can to new or changing opportunities and technologies, and may devote greater resources to the marketing, promotion and sale of their products than our resources will afford.

We believe it is highly likely that existing and new competitors will rapidly acquire significant market share, which would negatively impact our ability to effectively market, compete and sell our products and services we are currently developing into the markets in which such competitors operate.

As of December 31, 2022, there were no active customers under TCE or MCX and we only had one customer active during the year ended December 31, 2022.
 
Intellectual Property

As of December 31, 2022, we do not own any trademarks or service marks, patents or other intellectual property assets.
 
Insurance 
 
We maintain general liability, commercial auto, and insurance policies and separate insurance coverage for its directors and officers.
 
Employees 
 
At the end of 2022 we had no full-time or part-time employees and one independent contractor. We have never experienced any employment-related work stoppages and our independent contractors are represented by a labor union or collective bargaining agreements. We intend to hire more employees and independent contractors on an as-needed basis.
Offices 
 
We have one business addresses. Our headquarters is located at 176 South Capital Blvd. Boise, ID 83702.
