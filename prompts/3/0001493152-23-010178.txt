ITEM 1 - BUSINESS
Overview
 
The Company is a dynamic operator of professional networks with a focus on diversity. We use the term “diversity” (or “diverse”) to describe communities, or “affinities,” that are distinctly based on a wide array of criteria, which may change from time-to-time, including ethnic, national, cultural, racial, religious or gender classification. We serve a variety of such communities, including Women, Hispanic-Americans, African-Americans, Asian-Americans, persons with disabilities, Military Professionals, and Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Queer (LGBTQ+). Our goal is (i) to assist our registered users and members in their efforts to connect with like-minded individuals and identify career opportunities within the network and (ii) connect members with prospective employers while helping the employers address their workforce diversity needs. We believe that the combination of our solutions allows us to approach recruiting and professional networking in a unique way and thus create enhanced value for our members and clients.
Environmental, Social and Governance
 
As a global developer and operator of online and in-person networks that provides access to networking, training, educational and employment opportunities for diverse individuals, Professional Diversity Network, Inc., is striving to be at the forefront of fostering supportive and inclusive cultures. We are committed to creating permanent, systemic changes that address social inequalities in our communities by providing avenues for employers and under-represented people to engage.
 
We are proud of our continued leadership in social stewardship. Our mission is to utilize the collective strength of our subsidiaries, members, partners and unique proprietary platform to increase diversity recruiting, networking and professional development for women, minorities, veterans, LGBTQ+ and persons with disabilities.
 
Through an online employee recruitment platform that leverages our affinity groups, we provide our employer clients a means to identify and acquire diverse talent and assist them with their efforts to diversify their talent pool and comply with the Equal Employment Opportunity Office of Federal Contract Compliance Program.
 
Inclusion and Diversity
 
We believe in maintaining a supportive and inclusive culture that values everyone’s talents, life experiences and backgrounds.

Our Strategy
 
We provide services for employers who want to hire diverse talent, to individuals seeking to network on a professional level and to job seekers who desire to improve their professional situation.
 
Our diversity recruitment business provides additional value for our other business segments by providing our registered users and members with access to employment opportunities at leading companies. We have focused our efforts on placing talent in IT, Finance, and similarly related fields. The core diversity recruitment business also includes executive placement services for leading companies seeking to hire diverse talent. This business line addresses a need for employers who want to secure leading diverse talent in management, senior management and executive capacities.
 
Our strategy encompasses the following key elements:
 

● | Grow and diversify our member and client base; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Improve branding and brand awareness; 
● | Utilize social media to effectively engage with the community; 
● | Maximize revenue through synergies among the segments; 
● | Launch new products and services; 
● | Streamline infrastructure to capture efficiency; and 
● | Continue to expand in diversity recruitment by growing our core offerings of recruitment advertising, Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) compliance offerings and our new diversity placement services. 

 
We remain interested in pursuing acquisition and/or development opportunities that would increase returns of capital to our shareholders, such as the recent purchase of a significant equity stake in RemoteMore USA, Inc. The timing, size, success and associated potential future capital commitments related to such opportunities are unknown at this time. Accordingly, a material acceleration of our growth strategy could require us to obtain additional capital through debt and/or equity financings. There can be no assurance that adequate debt and equity financing will be available on satisfactory terms.
 
Industry Overview
 
The diversity recruitment market is highly fragmented and is characterized by the following trends:
 

● | Regulatory Environment Favorable to Promoting Diversity in the Workplace. In August 2011, President Obama signed Executive Order 13583 to establish a coordinated government-wide initiative to promote diversity and inclusion in the federal workforce. This Executive Order requires companies considering contracting with the federal government to be prepared to demonstrate the diversity of their workforce. Certain companies that have federal contracts are subject to this Executive Order. In the public sector, the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) mandated that each of the eight U.S. financial agencies, including the Department of the Treasury, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and twelve Federal Reserve banks create Offices of Minority and Women Inclusion (“OMWI”) to be responsible for all agency matters relating to diversity in management, employment and business activities. The OMWI monitor diversity within their ranks, as well as within the pool of contractors who provide goods and services to the government.

● | Growing Ethnic Diversity of the U.S. Population and Labor Force. Diversity recruitment is increasingly becoming a common, if not standard, business practice by major employers. Multicultural groups are the fastest growing segment of the U.S. population. Hispanics, African-Americans, Asian-Americans, and all other multicultural groups were estimated by the U.S. Census Bureau to make up 42.2% of the U.S. population in 2020. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, 2020 National Projections, the multicultural population is expected to increase 89% between 2016 and 2060. In sheer numbers, Hispanic-Americans are expected to experience the most growth among diversity groups, growing from 18% of the total population in 2014 to 28% by 2060. African-American population is expected to increase from 13% in 2014 to 15% in 2060, and Asian-American population from 6% in 2014 to 9% in 2060. According to the Current Population Survey conducted by the Bureau of Census for the Bureau of Labor Statistics, of the 2022 annual average of approximately 158 million employees nationwide, approximately 47% were women and approximately 38% were Hispanic, African American or Asian American. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Demographic Trend Toward Women’s Career Advancement. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the number of women in the labor force in 2021 was approximately 75.7 million and is expected to increase to 77.2 million by 2024. Women accounted for 51.5% of all workers employed in management, professional, and related occupations in 2022, somewhat more than their share of total employment (46.8%). The share of women in specific occupations within this large category varied. For example, 21.5% of software developers, 29.2% of chief executives, and 38.5% of lawyers were women, all increases from 2021, whereas 87.9% of registered nurses, 79.7% of elementary and middle school teachers, and 58.8% of accountants and auditors were women. 
● | Rising Spending Power of Diverse Population. PDN segments are focused on providing professional enhancement tools to diverse Americans including women. We believe diverse professionals are underserved and represent a very strong opportunity to enhance our shareholders’ value. The Selig Center for Economic Growth, estimates the nation’s total buying power (defined as total income after taxes) reached $13.9 trillion in 2016 and grew to $17.5 trillion by 2020 with minority groups making the fastest gains. For example, between 2010 and 2020, Asian-American buying power grew by 111% to $1.3 trillion; the buying power for those of Hispanic ethnicity grew by 87% to $1.9 trillion, Native American buying power grew by 67% to $140 billion, and African American buying power grew by 61% to $1.6 trillion. 
● | Increasing Socialization of the Internet. The Internet has revolutionized how information is created and communicated - a wealth of information is readily accessible by browsing the Internet anonymously. However, we believe the social aspect of the Internet is emerging as an increasingly powerful influence on our lives. While an individual’s interpersonal connections traditionally have not been visible to others, social and professional networking websites enable members to share, and thereby unlock, the value of their connections by making them visible. Today, personal connections and other information, such as online social and professional networking websites, are increasingly becoming a powerful tool for a growing population of users to connect with one another. 

Our Solutions
 
We currently operate in three business segments comprised of: (i) Professional Diversity Network (“PDN Network”), which includes online professional networking communities with career resources tailored to the needs of various diverse cultural groups; (ii) National Association of Professional Women (“NAPW Network”), a women-only professional networking organization, and (iii) RemoteMore USA (“RemoteMore”) which provides companies with talented engineers to provide solutions to their software needs. In 2018, we started transacting new NAPW Network memberships under the International Association of Women (“IAW”) brand in the USA.
 
In 2022, our PDN Network, NAPW Network and RemoteMore business units represented approximately 61%, 7% and 32% of our gross revenues, respectively.

For financial information about our operating segments please see Note 15 of our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report.
 
PDN Network
 
Recruitment Solutions. The PDN Network consists of several online professional job seeker communities dedicated to serving diverse professionals in the United States and employers seeking to hire diverse talent. We use the word “professional” to describe any person interested in the Company’s websites or career fairs presumably for the purpose of career advancement or related benefits offered by the Company, whether or not such person is employed and regardless of the level of education or skills possessed by such person. Leveraging the power of our affinity job seeker groups, these professionals harness the Company’s relationships with employers and recruiters to help advance their careers. We operate these recruitment affinity groups within the following sectors: Women, Hispanic-Americans, African-Americans, Asian-Americans, persons with disabilities, Military Professionals, Lesbians, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Queer (LGBTQ+), and Students and Graduates seeking to transition from education to career. In addition, the Company also manages the job seeker websites and career fairs for prominent diverse membership-based organizations including but not limited to NAACP, National Urban League, and Kappa Alpha Psi. Employers and recruiters benefit from the Company’s relationship with these organizations and allows them to access to a large pool of diverse jobs seekers in a centralized manner.
 
Our PDN Network has registered users for our recruitment services. We use the term “registered user” to describe a consumer who has affirmatively visited one of our properties, opted into an affinity group and provided us with demographic or contact information enabling us to match them with employers and/or jobs, and to sell them ancillary products and services. We expect that continued registered user growth of the PDN Network will enable us to further develop our list of online professional diversity networking and career placement solutions. We currently provide access to our PDN Network websites to registered users at no cost. The Company is always exploring various partnerships with other service providers to increase their offerings to both job seekers and employers. Our goal is to use an asset light approach to provide quality products and services, to increase our value to those we serve and drive additional capital without significant capital investments. For example, we announced our partnership with Web Scribble, the leading provider of career technology for professional and trade associations. Leveraging our existing assets through relationships with other technology firms allows us to grow our relationships with employers without investing in sophisticated, proprietary resources.
 
We offer employers of all sizes seeking to diversify their employment ranks, and to third-party recruiters (i) real-time solutions that deliver diverse talent, (ii) advertising and promotion of their job opportunities to our networks of diverse professionals and (iii) assistance with posting their job opportunities to career agencies in a manner compliant with the regulations and requirements of the Equal Employment Opportunity OFCCP, including those of state and local governments. Our recruitment advertising solutions promote hiring and retention success by providing job seekers with information that we believe allows them to look beyond a corporate brand, deeper into employers’ core values. We use sophisticated technology to deliver recruitment advertising using internet banner ads and email marketing targeted by geography and occupation, based upon data from our audiences’ profiles and job searches on our websites. As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 320 enterprise companies and 1500 total customers utilizing our products and services.
 
Career Fairs. Through our events business, a part of our PDN Network business segment, we produce premier face-to-face and virtual recruiting events we call Professional Diversity Career Fairs. The Company’s diversity events help employers connect with a new marketplace of diverse professionals. We believe our events are the only events of their type endorsed by leading organizations such as the NAACP, National Urban League, Phi Beta Sigma and others. Participating employers range from Fortune 500 companies to federal, state and local agencies and from smaller employers to non-profit organizations, all of which seek a proactive approach to diversity recruiting. We also produce virtual and in-person career fairs as part of high-profile national events such as the NAACP National Convention, the Urban League National Conference and historically black sorority and fraternity conferences. Since 2017, we host and produce virtual career fairs serving veterans, women and STEM professionals.
 
In January 2023, the Company’s newly formed wholly-owned subsidiary, Expo Experts Events, LLC, pursuant to an asset purchase agreement with Expo Experts, LLC (“Expo Experts”), an Ohio limited liability company, has purchased the assets and operations of Expo Experts. Expo Experts specializes in producing premier face-to-face and virtual recruiting events for Engineering, Technology and Security Clearance positions, designed to attract diverse candidates who may also have STEM-based background. We believe that this acquisition compliments our current career fair business.
 
PDNRecruits. We use matching and targeting technology to match members with our clients open jobs on a renewing month-to-month license basis, designed to provide the Company with increasing residual income as we add new clients and sell additional licenses. The PDNRecruits product is a significant step towards increasing online sales in a scalable and residual manner.

PDN Diversity Placement. As part of our robust suite of recruitment offerings for employers, the Company offers a contingent hiring solution. It is a pay-per-hire offering that charges a percentage of the first year’s annual salary plus bonus for candidates we source and they hire. We believe our superior brand positioning, large network of diverse talent and our vast employer relationships position us well for continued growth in this segment.
 
NAPW Network
 
The NAPW Network is a professional networking organization for women. We use the terms “member” or “membership” to describe a consumer who has viewed our marketing material, opted into membership with the NAPW Network, provided demographic information and engaged in an onboarding call with a membership coordinator. Paid memberships provide greater access to networking opportunities and other membership perks, including access to upgraded packages. Members of the NAPW Network enjoy a wealth of resources dedicated to developing their professional networks, furthering their education and skills and promoting their businesses and career accomplishments.
 
We provide NAPW Network members with opportunities to network and develop valuable business relationships with other professionals through NAPW’s website, as well as at events hosted at local chapters across the United States. In March 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, all events shifted to a virtual format hosted on electronic platforms, such as Zoom. In October 2021, NAPW launched a Global virtual chapter to expand its audience outside of the United States. PDN Network products and services are being deployed to provide enhanced value to the NAPW membership experience, which we believe will be an important component in increasing both the number of new memberships and renewals of existing memberships.
 
IAW Leadership Lab. In 2020, IAW launched the Leadership Lab platform as an enhancement to the NAPW eCoaching platform. IAW also offers virtual networking roundtable events throughout the month where members who are established experts in their field provide participants insight and tips on how to overcome career and business challenges. Hosted by NAPW’s President, our unique platform connects our members with professional life and career coaches from within the NAPW membership base. Through these events, members gain insight, guidance and inspiration to help them maximize their personal and professional potential. Topics include the Power of Intentionality - Turning Good Intentions Into Actions, The Power of Authentic Communication, and Confident Steps To Create a Thriving Life. The on-line events also include the opportunity for members to network with other participants in the live chat room. Members are also able to access a recording of these events in the NAPW website.
 
Professional Identity Management. Through the NAPW Network website, NAPW Network members are able to create, manage and share their professional identity online and promote themselves and their businesses. NAPW Network members can also promote their career achievements and their businesses through placement on the NAPW Network website’s home page, in proprietary press releases, in the online Member Marketplace and in monthly newsletter publications. In addition, the PDN Network provides members with direct access to employers seeking to hire professional women at a high level of connectivity and efficiency. 
 
Access to Knowledge. In addition to networking and promotional opportunities, NAPW Network also provides to its members the ability to further develop their skills and expand their knowledge base through monthly newsletters, online and in-person seminars, webinars and certification courses.
 
Upgraded Memberships and Ancillary Products. Upgraded packages include additional promotional and publicity tools, as well as free access for the member to National Summits and continuing education programs and the press release package, which provides members with the opportunity to work with professional writers to publish personalized press releases and thereby secure valuable online presence.
 
Partner Discounts. We also offer to NAPW Network members exclusive discounts on third-party products and services.

Our PDN sales resources for recruitment and recruitment advertising products and services include a sales force with 7 sales professionals, third-party strategic partners who deliver employers with demand for our products, and technology, which facilitates e-commerce transactions. We market directly to employers and third-party recruiters. Our sales team uses a combination of telephone, email and face-to-face marketing, including personal visits to companies or their recruitment agencies, as well as appearances at industry and trade group events where diversity recruitment recruiters are in attendance. We have also formed strategic alliances with parties who are able to help extend our organic reach. In addition, we are developing purely online marketing channels to bring recruiters to us in bulk and use products based on a matching and targeting technology to facilitate sales. We have specialty units within our sales force dedicated to serving: (i) federal, state and local governments and companies and contractors who serve these governmental entities, (ii) small and medium sized businesses as defined by companies with less than 2,500 employees, and (iii) large enterprises with greater than 2,500 employees.
 
We sell NAPW/IAW Network membership subscriptions offline through our NAPW/IAW Network sales force, which currently includes 2 sales professionals, all of who sell initial membership services. We also support online membership subscriptions through online sales via our website. We developed a secure, work-from-home technology along with a training and supervision platform aimed at reducing the overhead costs, increasing per-representative profitability, and offering our sales professionals flexible working arrangements. All sales representatives are capable of selling upgraded memberships and ancillary products.
 
RemoteMore contracts with companies that are in need of customized software development and pairs them with developers from a database of developers. Services vary from simple software solutions to detailed programming where teams of developers work together.
 
Customer Support and Compliance 
 
In addition to our sales professionals, we also employ support teams to provide customer support, compliance and enhance member experience. Our customer support teams work together to improve engagement with our members and to ensure a high degree of member satisfaction and retention. Our customer support teams also work with our Development and Executive teams to identify new lead-generation, sales and membership product opportunities, and to test those, as well as new approaches to our current sales. Our compliance team focuses on ensuring the integrity of the NAPW Network sales process. The team works closely with customer support and sales management to ensure that sales are conducted in an ethical manner and to identify sales representatives who would benefit from enhanced training.

Our Strengths
 
We believe the following elements give us a competitive advantage to accomplish our mission:
 

● | Dedicated Focus on Diverse Professionals. Our focus on providing career opportunities for diverse professionals differentiates us from other online job seeker websites, such as Indeed or ZipRecruiter. We provide a platform that allows employers to recruit and attract from a targeted pool of diverse candidates rather than a pool of general market candidates. It provides employers unique advantages in terms of costs savings and time, and allows employers to advance their corporate DEI strategy. Additionally, our strategic partnerships with diversity based membership organizations such as TechLatino.org, Kappa Alpha Psi, etc., provide our clients enhanced access to specialized talent using the PDN platform. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Online and Offline Diversity Career Fair Services. The Company has a comprehensive and coordinated method of connecting diverse job seekers with companies seeking to hire diverse employees using virtual and brick and mortar career fairs. The fairs allow us to connect with local employers, recruiters, and job seekers in specific cities across the U.S. Our career fair services allow the Company to diversity its offerings and complement its online job board services 
● | Platform That Harnesses the Power of Web Socialization. We believe that our membership base will continue to grow and that our platform will be an increasingly powerful tool that enables our members to leverage their connections and shared information for the collective benefit of all of the participants on our platform. We believe that we are the first online professional network to focus on the diversity recruitment sector. 
● | Relationships with Strategic Partners. We consider our partner alliances to be a key value to our clients because they enable us to expand our job distribution and outreach efforts. We continue to expand our relationships with key strategic partners that we believe are valuable to our core clients. Websites for the PDN Network are hosted by a third party, who provides hosting and customization for the Company’s job boards. and also provides sales resources to help promote our PDN Network and our partners’ products. Our websites have backup and contingency plans in place in the event that an unexpected circumstance occurs. 
● | Relationships with Professional Entities & Organizations. Our team has experience working with multicultural professional organizations. We partner with a number of leading minority professional organizations, including, but not limited to:

We believe that the following elements give us a competitive advantage with respect to the NAPW Network:
 

● | Exclusive Focus on Professional Women. As a result of NAPW Network’s exclusive focus on professional women, we believe that through NAPW Network we provide a secure and less intimidating environment within which our members can successfully network and establish new and lasting business relationships. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Attractive Industry Demographic Trends. Favorable demographic trends regarding women’s participation in the labor force will further the growth in NAPW Network’s membership base and we have first-mover advantage with respect to generalized professional networking for women. 
● | Large and Diverse National Membership Base. The membership base of the NAPW Network is diverse in terms of ethnicity, age, income, experience, industry and occupation. It includes members from small and large corporations, as well as entrepreneurs and business owners. We believe the diversity of the NAPW Network membership base is a key component of its value. 
● | Comprehensive Product and Service Offerings to Deliver Value to Members. We believe that our comprehensive product offerings provide women valuable tools to help them advance their careers and expand their businesses. Through networking opportunities online and at local chapter events in their communities, regional events and the NAPW Network national networking conference, discounts provided on seminars, webinars and educational certification courses, and opportunities to promote themselves and their businesses, NAPW members are provided the opportunities and tools for their professional development. 
● | Member Acquisition and Recurring Cash Flow. We believe that NAPW Network’s direct marketing lead generation efforts, which utilize a combination of digital strategies, are among the most efficient in the industry as measured by our internal response and click-through rates. Additionally, in addition to an evolving eCommerce model, the company has been actively growing a member-to-member acquisition model as we strive to move to an organic growth model. We have implemented web-based technologies to assist our members recruit colleagues and friends to the organization. Further, NAPW Network memberships renew annually, providing a valuable recurring stream of cash flow. 

Operations: Geography
 
Our headquarters is located in Chicago, Illinois, and houses our key executives, as well as many of our sales, customer support, marketing and IT personnel. 
 
Intellectual Property
 
To protect our intellectual property rights, we rely on a combination of federal, state and common law rights, as well as contractual restrictions. We rely on trade secret, copyright and trademark rights to protect our intellectual property. We pursue the registration of our domain names and trademarks in the United States. Our registered trademarks in the United States include the “iHispano” mark with stylized logo, the “Black Career Network” mark with stylized logo, the “Professional Diversity Network” mark with our tagline “the power of millions for the benefit of one,” the name “National Association of Professional Women” and “NAPW,” and the name “International Association of Women” and “IAW”, as well as others. We also own the copyrights to certain articles in NAPW publications. We strive to exert control over access to our intellectual property and customized technology by entering into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors and confidentiality agreements with third-parties in the ordinary course of our business.

Our efforts to protect our proprietary rights may not be successful. Any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could adversely impact our business or our ability to compete. In addition, protecting our intellectual property rights is costly and time-consuming. Any unauthorized disclosure or use of our intellectual property could make it more expensive to do business and adversely affect our operating results.
 
Competition
 
We face significant competition in all aspects of our business. Specifically, with respect to our members and our recruitment consumer advertising and marketing solutions, we compete with existing general market online professional networking websites, such as LinkedIn, Indeed, Zip Recruiter, and Monster Worldwide, Inc., as well as ethnic minority focused social networking websites, such as Diversityjobs.com, Workplacediversity.com, and other companies such as Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Twitter that are developing or could develop competing solutions. We also generally compete with online and offline enterprises, including newspapers, television and direct mail marketers that generate revenue from recruiters, advertisers and marketers, and professional organizations. With respect to our hiring solutions, we also compete with traditional online recruiting companies such as Career Builder, talent management companies such as Taleo, and traditional recruiting firms.
 
Larger, more well-established companies may focus on professional networking and could directly compete with us. Other companies might also launch new competing services that we do not offer. Nevertheless, we believe that our focus on diverse online professional networking communities and the number of registered users or members, as the case may be, overall and within each affinity group that we serve, are competitive strengths in our market.
 
Government Regulation
 
We are subject to a number of federal, state and foreign laws and regulations that affect companies conducting business on the Internet. These laws are still evolving and could be amended or interpreted in ways that could be detrimental to our business. In the United States and abroad, laws relating to the liability of providers of online services for activities of their users and other third-parties are currently being tested by a number of claims, including actions based on invasion of privacy and other torts, unfair competition, copyright and trademark infringement and other theories based on the nature and content of the materials searched, the advertisements posted or the content provided by users. Any court ruling or other governmental action that imposes liability on providers of online services for the activities of their users and other third parties could materially harm our business. In addition, rising concerns about the use of social networking technologies for illegal conduct, such as the unauthorized dissemination of national security information, money laundering or supporting terrorist activities may in the future produce legislation or other governmental action that could require changes to our products or services, restrict or impose additional costs upon the conduct of our business or cause users to abandon material aspects of our service.
 
In the area of information security and data protection, many states have passed laws requiring notification to users when there is a security incident, or security breach for personal data, or requiring the adoption of minimum information security standards that are often unclear and difficult to implement. The costs of compliance with these laws are significant and may increase in the future. Further, we may be subject to significant liabilities if we fail to comply with these laws.
 
We are also subject to federal, state and foreign laws regarding privacy and protection of member data. We post on our websites our privacy policy and terms of use. Compliance with privacy-related laws may be costly. However, any failure by us to comply with our privacy policy or privacy-related laws could result in proceedings against us by governmental authorities or private parties, which could be detrimental to our business. Further, any failure by us to protect our members’ privacy and data could result in a loss of member confidence in us and ultimately in a loss of members and customers, which could adversely affect our business.
 
Because our services are accessible worldwide, certain foreign jurisdictions may claim that we are required to comply with their laws, including in jurisdictions where we have no local entity, employees or infrastructure.

Our direct marketing operations with respect to the NAPW Network are subject to various federal and state “do not call” list requirements. The Federal Trade Commission has created a national “do not call” registry. Under these federal regulations, consumers may have their phone numbers added to the national “do not call” registry. Generally, we are prohibited from calling anyone on that registry. Telemarketers are required to pay a fee to access the registry and are required to compare their call lists against the nations “do not call” registry at least once every 31 days. The rule provides for fines of up to $16,000 per violation and other possible penalties. These rules may be construed to limit our ability to market our products and services to new customers. Further, we may incur penalties if we do not conduct our telemarketing activities in compliance with these rules.
 
Seasonality
 
Our quarterly operating results are affected by the seasonality of employers’ businesses and hiring practices.
 
Employees
