ITEM 1. | Business
--------+---------

Our Company 
 We were founded in 2016, and are an innovative, high-growth, branded, health and wellness (“H&W”) focused frozen food company. We develop, market, and manufacture delicious and convenient comfort foods designed to be high in protein, low in sugar, and made from gluten- and grain-free ingredients that are intended to be sold in the H&W segment of the frozen food category. We offer delicious and nutritious options across breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacking occasions, which are available in approximately 15,000 stores nationwide, and directly from our website at www.realgoodfoods.com. 
 Our brand commitment, “Real Food You Feel Good About Eating,” represents our strong belief that, by eating our food, consumers can enjoy more of their favorite foods and, by doing so, live better lives as part of a healthier lifestyle. Our branded products are sold to consumers through an increasing number of locations in retail channels, primarily in natural and conventional grocery, drug, club, and mass merchandise stores, including Walmart, Kroger, and Costco. 
 On November 9, 2021, we completed our initial public offering (“IPO”) of 5,333,333 shares of Class A common stock at a price to the public of $12.00 per share. In connection with the IPO, we issued 836,522 shares of Class A common stock to Fidelity Investment Funds, related to convertible promissory notes issued to the Company in May 2021, in the amount of $35.0 million. Our Class A common stock trades on the Nasdaq Global Market (“Nasdaq”) under the symbol “RGF.” 
 Our Industry and Competition 
 We operate in multiple large subcategories within the U.S. frozen food category, although we believe we compete with other conventional brands within the frozen food category. We operate in a highly competitive market with numerous brands and products competing for market share and limited shelf space from retail customers. We compete with conventional packaged food companies such as Conagra Brands, Inc., Kraft Heinz Company, Nestle S.A., and Tyson Foods, Inc. We also compete with H&W brands such as Amy’s Kitchen, Atkins, Dr. Praeger’s, EVOL, Quest Nutrition, Saffron Road, and Tattooed Chef. 
 We believe the nutritional content and quality of our products position us to compete directly within the $210 billion U.S. H&W industry, which includes natural, specialty, and wellness food products. Since our inception, we have focused on creating H&W products for the frozen food aisle, where we believe H&W brands are underrepresented compared to other categories. Our strategic advantages are rooted in our mission-focused approach, craveable products, large and engaged consumer community, innovative product-development process, self-manufacturing capabilities, product positioning within our category, and management expertise. 
 Our Products 
 Historically, we have sold substantially all of our products under our “Realgood Foods Co.” brand. We also sell a limited number of private label products to select retail customers. Our branded products are sold to consumers through an increasing number of locations within retail channels, primarily in natural and conventional grocery, drug, club, and mass merchandise stores, including Walmart, Kroger, and Costco. 
 We produce and sell, entrées, bowls, breakfast sandwiches, enchiladas, other H&W products and snacks within the frozen food category. Our craveable products are offered in ready-to-heat and ready-to-cook formats for

  consumers to prepare. Our breakfast sandwiches and entrées are our core products and have been the chief drivers of our growth. All of our products are designed to be free of gluten-containing ingredients and added sugar, and to be higher in protein and lower in carbohydrates than their conventional equivalents. We are focused on making our products delicious, while ensuring they are balanced in macronutrients. 
 The manufacture of our products requires a specialized process and purpose-built equipment to help ensure they have the macronutrient composition we strive to achieve while maintaining taste. The vast majority of our products are manufactured within the United States. We operate what we believe to be a best in class manufacturing facilities in the City of Industry California (the “City of Industry Facility”), and in Bolingbrook Illinois (the “Bolingbrook Facility”), where we produced over 80% of our goods sold during 2022. These facilities meet United States Department of Agriculture (“USDA”) standards and currently contain several flexible production lines which are U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) and USDA registered. In addition, the products we manufacture at these facilities are certified by the Gluten-Free Certification Organization (“GFCO”) to be labeled for sale as “gluten free” (a gluten threshold of 10ppm or less), in accordance with the standards set by the GFCO. 
 Entrées 
 Bowls 
 Our entrée bowls are designed to have the satisfying taste of comfort food. For example, instead of using traditional wheat flour pasta, our lasagna bowl is made with layers of our chicken and parmesan pasta base, marinara sauce that we make with simple ingredients, and ricotta and mozzarella cheese. Our lasagna bowls contain 11 grams of carbohydrates and 32 grams of protein per serving, compared to a similar dish produced by one of our competitors, which has 40 grams of carbohydrates and 16 grams of protein per serving. We also produce over half a dozen other bowls, all of which are microwavable and convenient to prepare. 
Enchiladas 
 Our enchiladas provide a macronutrient balanced, delicious sampling of Mexican food. Instead of carbohydrate-loaded wheat flour tortillas, we use thin, round slices of our innovative chicken and cheese “tortilla.” We roll freshly seasoned and cooked shredded chicken, pork, cheese, or beef into our “tortillas” and top them with our tomatillo verde sauce or roasted chili poblano red sauce. Our sauces are made using fresh produce. The result is a delicious enchilada with fewer than four grams of carbohydrates and 20 grams of protein per serving. 
Stuffed Chicken 
 Our bacon wrapped stuffed chicken is our modern take on a classic dish. We wrap our cheese-stuffed chicken with thick-cut bacon in lieu of the wheat-flour breading used by certain of our competitors, which can comprise up to one-third of their final product. Our product design results in a high-protein meal that is grain-free and gluten-free, and contains three grams of carbohydrates and 32 grams of protein. A conventional version of this dish has 16 grams of carbohydrates and 20 grams of protein per serving. 
 Our fully cooked stuffed chicken offers a convenient, and nutritious entrée for any occasion. Wrapped in chicken breast, and stuffed with flavors like cordon bleu, spinach artichoke and broccoli & cheese. Our stuffed chicken is 100% grain free and gluten free, and has 80%-90% less carbs than our competitors with one to two times more protein. 
 Asian Chicken 
 Our Asian chicken entrees use lightly breaded chicken made from nutritious ingredients and are 100% grain-free and gluten-free, and are low carb with only one gram of sugar, packed with 25g of protein per serving. We offer three varieties: Orange Chicken, General Tso’s Chicken and Sweet and Sour Chicken. 
 
2 


 Breaded Chicken 
 We offer nutritious Chicken Nuggets and Strips which are 100% grain and gluten free, with only 3g-4g net carbs and with 23g protein per serving. Our breaded chicken lineup consists of four offerings: original lightly breaded nuggets, lightly breaded strips, buffalo nuggets and buffalo strips. 
 All our breaded chicken products use real food ingredients such as chickpea flour and egg whites to make its crispy breading. 
 Breakfast Sandwiches 
 Our breakfast sandwiches have a delicious bun made with grain-free, gluten-free, and protein-rich ingredients, including cheese, almond flour, and eggs. We use this innovative bun to sandwich eggs, cheddar cheese, and a sausage, bacon, or turkey patty. Our breakfast sandwiches are designed to look and taste like traditional breakfast sandwiches but without wheat flour, grain, or other carbohydrate-dense ingredients. Each breakfast sandwich provides 18 to 20 grams of protein and four grams of carbohydrates per serving, compared to a similar breakfast sandwich produced by one of our conventional counterparts, which has 29 grams of carbohydrates and 13 grams of protein per serving. 
Snacks and Pizza 
 We participate in the snacks and appetizers subcategory with our bite-sized, breading-free chicken nuggets stuffed with cheese. We also offer frozen pizza, which is a large segment with consumers continually trying new items and discovering new brands. We use this category to funnel new consumers into our franchise. 
Other Frozen Food Items 
 We provide macronutrient balanced foods for all eating occasions and times of day and offer products in multiple subcategories within the frozen food category. Certain of these products are offered on a limited time basis, such as our no-added sugar, extra-creamy ice cream, offered through our E-commerce platform. We consider products such as these to be our non-core products. 
 Our Manufacturing and Packaging Process 
 Our products are manufactured at our City of Industry and Bolingbrook Facilities, and through our co-manufacturing partner located in Missouri. During 2022, more than 80% of our products were self-manufactured. 
 Our facilities each contain several flexible production lines that are FDA and USDA registered. In addition, the products we manufacture at our facilities are certified by the GFCO to be labeled for sale as “gluten free” (threshold of 10ppm gluten or less), in accordance with the standards set by the GFCO, when bearing the GFCO certification mark. 
 Packing configurations available to us are significant and flexible. Configurations include shrink wrap, horizontal wrapping, vertical weighing and bagging, and cartoning. 
 Quality Control 
 We utilize a food safety and quality management program, which employs manufacturing procedures, expert technical knowledge of food safety science, employee training, ongoing process innovation, and both internal and independent auditing. 
 
3 


 We and our co-manufacturing partner each have a food safety plan (“FSP”) that focuses on preventing food safety risks and is designed to be compliant with the requirements set forth under the Food Safety Modernization Act (“FSMA”). In addition, each facility has at least one preventive controls qualified individual who has successfully completed training in the development and application of risk-based preventive controls at least equivalent to that received under a standardized curriculum recognized by the USDA and FDA. 
 Each of our and our co-manufacturer’s facilities complies with the Global Food Safety Initiative. All facilities manufacturing our products are certified against a standard recognized by Safe Quality Food Institute. These standards are integrated food safety and quality management protocols designed specifically for the food sector and offer a comprehensive methodology to manage food safety and quality. Certification provides an independent and external validation that a product, process, or service is designed to comply with applicable regulations and standards. 
 In addition to third-party inspections of our manufacturing partners, we have instituted audits to address topics including allergen control; ingredient, packaging and product specifications, and sanitation. Under FSMA, our facilities and our co-manufacturer’s facilities are required to have an FSP, a hazard analysis critical control plant plan, or a hazard analysis critical control points plan that identifies critical pathways for contaminants and mandates control measures that must be used to prevent, eliminate, or reduce relevant food-borne hazards. 
 Our Mission 
 We are a mission-focused company. Our mission is to make our craveable, nutritious comfort foods accessible to everyone across the United States and, eventually, throughout the world. Our mission is important to us because we believe an increasing number of consumers are seeking to make healthier food choices yet face limited options when it comes to the convenience of products found in the frozen food aisle. These consumers include the portion of the U.S. population seeking to reduce sugar in their diets, the portion of the U.S. population seeking to reduce their carbohydrate intake, the 13% of the U.S. adult population suffering from the health effects of diabetes, and the 42% of the adult U.S. population suffering from obesity. We believe our products provide alternatives for these consumers, and also have broad appeal due to our uncompromising approach to developing products suited to a wide range of consumer tastes and diet preferences. 
Segment Reporting and Geographical Information 
 For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we were managed as a single operating segment. Our Chief Executive Officer, who is the Chief Operating Decision Maker, reviews financial information on an aggregate basis for purposes of allocating resources and assessing financial performance, as well as for making strategic operational decisions and managing the organization. All of our sales occur primarily within the United States, and all of our assets are maintained in the United States. 
Sales and Marketing 
 Sales 
 Our sales team is led by our Senior Vice President, Head of Sales. In addition to our sales team, we use an extensive network of brokers to service our customers. The vast majority of our net revenue is derived from products shipped directly to our retailer customers’ warehouses, with no involvement with distributors. 
Marketing 
 Our marketing department is led by our Chief Marketing Officer. We currently manage all of our marketing activities in-house and do not rely on agencies or third parties for such activities, which we believe enhances the consistency and strength of our brand messaging. Our marketing team is made up of community managers, who

  engage with thousands of consumers every week to build relationships, educate them on our products, talk about our mission, and promote healthy lifestyles. We primarily engage with our community directly through social media, SMS text, and our website, and indirectly through influencers. 
 Our Culture and Human Capital 
 “Keeping it REAL” 
 We believe there is a better, more nutritious way to enjoy our favorite foods, and we are committed to producing Real Food You Feel Good About Eating. We believe that our company culture has been and will continue to be a key contributor to the fulfillment of this commitment. Our culture enables us to foster the creativity, teamwork, focus, and innovation we need to support our growth. Our employees drive our mission and share core values that both stem from and define our culture, which plays an invaluable role in our execution at all levels within our organization, and contributes to our success and the continued growth of our business. Our shared core values focus on trust and respect for each other, our customers, consumers, business partners, stockholders, and other constituents; relentless product innovation and continuous improvement; and a culture of transparency, accountability, and ownership, and collectively serve as the driving force behind how we work together, engage with our constituents and the communities in which we operate, and lay the groundwork for our future growth and success. We call this “Keeping it REAL.” 
 Our board of directors adopted a written code of business conduct and ethics, as well as other governance policies and practices, which serve as a guide for our directors, officers, employees, and representatives in our daily interactions with our customers, consumers, business partners, stockholders, and other constituents. We provide periodic training and educational materials to our directors and employees on these governance principles, which will help instill a commitment to ethical behavior and legal compliance. 
 Our Team 
 We value having talented people at every level of our business. As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 130 full-time employees on our payroll. None of our employees is represented by a labor union. We have never experienced a labor-related work stoppage, and believe our relationship with our employees to be very good. 
 We contract with several professional employer organizations (“PEOs”) that administer our human resources, payroll, and employee benefits functions for substantially all of our warehouse and production employees. Our PEOs recruit and select these contract employees to fulfill our hiring needs, and each of these employees is an employee of record of the relevant PEO. In addition to our full-time employees, as of December 31, 2022, we had approximately 495 contract employees hired through our PEOs. 
 Our ability to execute our growth plan and achieve our strategic objectives depends in part upon our ability to attract, train, and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees (including contract personnel hired through PEOs), who can manage our business, oversee our manufacturing operations, and establish credibility with our customers, co-manufacturers, suppliers, and other business partners. 
 In an effort to attract and retain employees, we provide competitive employee wages that are consistent with employee positions, skill levels, experience, knowledge, and geographic location. We also offer our employees competitive time off, health, and welfare benefits, Company-paid holidays, recognition programs, and career-development opportunities. In addition, we focus on our employees’ growth by creating experiences that align with our strategic priorities, and promote performance and opportunities for development. We strive to create a workplace that reflects our values, and one that adheres to a responsible employer philosophy, which includes, among other things, commitments to create job opportunities, ensure safety and well-being, and promote diversity, equity and inclusion.

 The health and safety of our employees is our highest priority. For instance, during the COVID-19 pandemic, we remained operational as an “essential business” while focusing on safeguarding the well-being of our employees. During that time, in an effort to protect the health and safety of our employees, we limited the number of employees on-site relative to our typical personnel capacity, adopted remote work and flexible scheduling policies, and implemented enhanced safety measures and protocols at our facilities, most of which are still in place today. 
 Facilities 
 We do not own any of the buildings we occupy. Our principal executive office is located in Cherry Hill, New Jersey, where we lease approximately 5,800 square feet of office space under a lease agreement that expires in October 2026, subject to an option to extend the term of the lease for a successive five-year period. We primarily use this location for general office and administrative purposes. 
 In addition, we lease our City of Industry Facility pursuant to a transfer agreement entered into on January 4, 2021. In connection with the lease, we took possession of certain equipment and inventory located on the premises. In addition, on February 16, 2021, we entered into a purchase agreement with PMC Financial Services Group, LLC (“PMC”) pursuant to which we purchased certain equipment and inventory required to operate our City of Industry Facility. These agreements collectively reflect our acquisition of the co-manufacturing business belonging to one of our former co-manufacturers, which closed on March 31, 2021. Our City of Industry Facility lease expires on June 30, 2024, with an option to extend the lease for a successive five-year period. 
 On October 4, 2021, we entered into a lease agreement for our Bolingbrook Facility, which is an 81,406 square foot industrial facility in Bolingbrook Illinois which we use for food manufacturing and assembly, warehousing, and distribution. This lease commenced on January 1, 2022 and will expire on April 1, 2029, with two options to extend the lease for successive five-year periods. This facility became fully operational during the second half of 2022. 
 In addition to our principal executive office and food manufacturing facilities, we lease a 19,500 square foot industrial building in La Verne, California, which we use as a warehouse for packaging and distributing our products, as well as for office and administrative purposes. This lease expires on March 31, 2026, with an option to extend the lease for a successive five-year period. 
 We believe that these facilities are sufficient to meet our current needs. We intend to expand our facilities or add new facilities as we grow, and we believe that suitable additional space will be available as needed to accommodate expansion of our operations. 
 Trademarks and Other Intellectual Property 
 To establish and protect our proprietary rights, we rely on a combination of copyright, trademark, trade dress, and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality agreements and other contractual restrictions. We do not own any registered patents. 
 Our intellectual property is a strategically important component of our business. In particular, we believe that our trademarks are valuable assets that reinforce the distinctiveness of our brand to consumers, are critical to maintaining and improving our competitive position, and are an important aspect of building brand equity. As such, we consider “Real Good Food Company” and our “Realgood Foods Co.” logo trademarks to be among our most valuable intellectual property assets. We also believe that having distinctive marks that are readily identifiable on our products is an important factor in continuing to build our brand and distinguish our products. Accordingly, our products are marketed and sold uniformly using the term “Realgood.” We have registered trademarks identifying our most popular products, including Realgood Enchiladas, Realgood Stuffed Chicken, Realgood Entrée Bowls, and Realgood Breakfast Sandwiches, among others. We expect to continue to invest in our trademark portfolio as we introduce new products and seek to build and protect our brand. 
 
6 


 As of December 31, 2022, we held 16 U.S. trademark registrations, one pending U.S. trademark application, two foreign trademark registrations and one pending foreign trademark registration. Further, we have a registered domain name, www.realgoodfoods.com. The information contained on or accessed through our website does not constitute part of this report. 
 Information Systems and Data Security 
 We operate using legacy systems for finance and accounting, supply chain, inventory control, sales transactions, replenishment and other functions. Our long-term strategy includes implementing a comprehensive Enterprise Resource Planning (“ERP”) system supported by a third-party provider, which will integrate and streamline these functions and allow for our continued growth. In the interim we supplement an ERP system with a Warehouse Management System, which allows us to improve tracking and management of ingredients and streamline manufacturing. 
 The regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is demanding, with the frequent imposition of new and changing requirements across our business. Various federal, state, and foreign legislative and regulatory bodies may expand current laws or regulations, enact new laws or regulations, or issue revised rules or guidance regarding privacy, data protection, information security, and consumer protection. We must comply with increasingly complex and rigorous laws and regulations regarding privacy and the collection, storage, use, processing, transfer, transmission, disclosure, and protection of personal and other data, which require us, among other things, to maintain reasonable and appropriate data security measures and to provide timely notice to individuals and regulators in the event that such personal information is compromised. 
 Our team of professionals works to identify and mitigate risks, implement best practices, and continue to evaluate ways to improve our information security. These steps include data encryption in transit and at rest, network security, limiting and authorizing access controls, and multi-factor authentication for access to systems with data. We also employ regular system monitoring, logging, and alerting to retain and analyze the security state of our corporate and production infrastructure. In addition, we take appropriate steps to help ensure that appropriate security measures are maintained by the third-party vendors we use, including by conducting security reviews. 
 Government Regulation 
 The food industry is highly regulated. We, our co-manufacturers, and our suppliers are subject to extensive laws and regulations in the United States by federal, state, and local government authorities, or by federal, state, and local government authorities in other jurisdictions where they are located. These laws and regulations apply to many aspects of our business, including the manufacture, packaging, labeling, distribution, advertising, sale, quality, and safety of our products, as well as the health and safety of our employees and the protection of the environment. 
 Our business is subject to extensive regulation by the FDA, USDA, and the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”), and other federal, state, and local authorities in the United States, and any other jurisdictions in which we may manufacture or sell our products. Specifically in the U.S., the FDA and USDA comprise a comprehensive regulatory program that governs the manufacturing, nutritional value, composition and ingredients, packaging, labeling, and safety of food. Under this program, the FDA requires that facilities that manufacture food products comply with a range of requirements, including hazard analysis and preventative controls regulations, good manufacturing practices (“GMPs”), and supplier verification requirements. Our processing facilities, including those of our co-manufacturers, are subject to periodic inspection by foreign, federal, state, and local authorities. 
 We are also subject to labor and employment laws, laws governing advertising, privacy laws, safety regulations, and other laws, including consumer protection regulations that regulate retailers or govern the promotion and sale of merchandise. Our operations, and those of our co-manufacturers and suppliers, are also subject to various laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and worker health and safety matters.

 Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to comply with existing laws and regulations, we operate in a highly regulated environment with constantly evolving legal and regulatory frameworks. Consequently, we are subject to heightened risk of legal claims, government investigations, or other regulatory enforcement actions.
