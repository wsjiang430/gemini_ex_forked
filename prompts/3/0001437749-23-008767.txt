ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

Overview
 
The Reserve Petroleum Company (the “Company,” “we,” “our” or “us”) is engaged principally in managing its owned mineral properties and the exploration for and the development of oil and natural gas properties. Other business segments are not significant factors in our operations. The Company is a corporation organized under the laws of the State of Delaware in 1931.
Oil and Natural Gas Properties
 
For a summary of certain data relating to the Company’s oil and gas properties, including production, undeveloped acreage, producing and dry wells drilled and recent activity, see Item 2, “Properties.” For a discussion and analysis of current and prior years’ revenue and related costs of oil and gas operations and a discussion of liquidity and capital resource requirements, see Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
Owned Mineral Property Management
 
The Company owns non-producing mineral interests in 256,534 gross acres equivalent to 88,214 net acres. These mineral interests are in ten different states in the north and south-central United States. A total of 81,080 (92%) net acres are in the states of Arkansas, Kansas, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas and Wyoming, the areas of concentration for the Company in our exploration and development programs.

The Company has several options relating to the exploration and/or development of our owned mineral interests. Management continually reviews various industry reports and other sources for activity (leasing, drilling, significant discoveries, etc.) in areas where the Company has mineral ownership. Based on our analysis of any activity and assessment of the potential risk relative to the area, management may negotiate a lease or farmout agreement and accept a royalty interest, or we may choose to participate as a working interest owner and pay our proportionate share of any exploration or development drilling costs.
 
A substantial amount of the Company’s oil and gas revenue has resulted from our owned mineral property management. In 2022, $5,060,545 (34%) of oil and gas sales was from royalty interests versus $3,444,030 (38%) in 2021. As a result of our mineral ownership, the Company had royalty interests in 5 gross (0.07 net) wells, which were drilled and completed as producing wells in 2022. This resulted in an average royalty interest of 1.4% for these 5 new wells. The Company has very little control over the timing or extent of the operations conducted on our royalty interest properties. See the following paragraphs for a discussion of mineral interests in which the Company chooses to participate as a working interest owner.
 
Development Program
 
Development drilling by the Company is usually initiated in one of three ways:
 

● | by participating as a working interest owner with a third-party operator in the development of non-producing mineral interests, which it owns;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | by participating with a joint interest operator in drilling additional wells on our producing leaseholds; or
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | if our exploration program, discussed below, results in a successful exploratory well, by participating in the drilling of additional wells on the exploratory prospect.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In 2022, the Company participated in the drilling of 15 development wells with 14 (1.76 net) completed as producers and 1 (0.06 net) in progress at the end of 2022.
 
Exploration Program
 
The Company’s exploration program is normally conducted by purchasing interests in prospects developed by independent third parties; participating in third party exploration of Company-owned non-producing minerals; developing our own exploratory prospects; or a combination of the above.
 
The Company normally acquires interests in exploratory prospects from someone in the industry with whom management has conducted business in the past and/or if management has confidence in the quality of the geological and geophysical information presented for evaluation to Company personnel. If evaluation indicates the prospect is within our risk limits, we may negotiate to acquire an interest in the prospect and participate in a non-operating capacity.
 
The Company develops exploratory drilling prospects by identification of an area of interest, development of geological and geophysical information and purchase of leaseholds in the area. The Company may then attempt to sell an interest in the prospect to one or more companies in the petroleum industry with one of the purchasing companies functioning as operator. In 2022, we participated in the drilling of 11 exploratory wells with 3 wells (0.47 net) completed as producers, 3 wells (0.35 net) completed as dry holes and 5 wells (0.88 net) in progress at the end of 2022.
 
For a summation of exploratory and development wells drilled in 2022 or planned for in 2023, see Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” subheading “Exploration Costs.”
 
Investment Program
 
The Company’s primary investment objective is to achieve moderate growth and earnings to protect assets against inflation and provide cash flow from investing activities that supplement cash flow from operations. The Company’s diversification of investments is designed to provide a level of protection against the ongoing volatility and political unpredictability of the energy sector. Company investments are focused on quality investments that include, but are not limited to, carefully vetted marketable securities, real estate and other assets, energy sector investments, and start-up ventures. Investments are diversified among asset classes and within broad industry categories to help minimize risk. Low cost, passive investment solutions are used where available and prudent. Generally, there is a correlation between portfolio returns and the amount of portfolio risk we are willing to assume. The Company understands investing requires a longer-term perspective. We are willing to accept some portfolio risk and tolerate fluctuations in market value and rates of return to achieve objectives, but we maintain a moderate approach to protect against significant losses.

Water Well Drilling
 
The Company’s wholly owned consolidated subsidiary, Trinity Water Services, LLC, an Oklahoma limited liability company, has a water well drilling joint venture agreement (“JVA”) with TWS South, LLC, a Texas limited liability company (Collectively, “TWS”).
Consolidated Entities
 
The Company consolidates Variable Interest Entities (“VIEs”) when the Company is deemed to be the primary beneficiary. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is generally the party that both: (1) has the power to make decisions that most significantly affect the economic performance of the VIE and (2) has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that in either case could potentially be significant to the VIE. If the Company is not deemed to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE, the Company accounts for the investment or other variable interests in a VIE in accordance with applicable GAAP. Grand Woods Development, LLC (“Grand Woods”) and TWS are accounted for as consolidated VIEs. See Note 7 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information on VIEs.
Customers
 
In 2022, the Company had one customer whose total purchases were greater than 10% of revenues from oil and gas sales. Redland Resources, LLC’s purchases were $2,006,132 or 14% of total oil and gas sales. The Company sells most of its oil and gas under short-term sales contracts that are based on the spot market price.
Competition
 
The oil and gas industry is highly competitive in all its phases. There are numerous circumstances within the industry and related marketplace that are out of the Company’s control such as cost and availability of alternative fuels, the level of consumer demand, the extent of other domestic production of oil and gas, the price and extent of importation of foreign oil and gas, the cost of and proximity of pipelines and other transportation facilities, the cost and availability of drilling rigs, regulation by state and federal authorities and the cost of complying with applicable environmental regulations.
 
The Company does not operate any of the wells in which we have an interest; rather, we partner with companies that have the resources, staff and experience to operate wells both in the drilling and production phases. The Company uses its strong financial base and its mineral and leasehold acreage ownership, along with its own geologic and economic evaluations, to participate in drilling operations with these companies. This methodology allows us to participate in exploration and development activities we could not undertake on our own due to financial and personnel limits and allows us to maintain low overhead costs.
 
Regulation
 
The Company’s operations are affected in varying degrees by political developments and federal and state laws and regulations. Although released from federal price controls, interstate sales of natural gas are subject to regulation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). Oil and gas operations are affected by environmental laws and other laws relating to the petroleum industry, and both are affected by constantly changing administrative regulations. Rates of production of oil and gas have, for many years, been subject to a variety of conservation laws and regulations, and the petroleum industry is frequently affected by changes in the federal tax laws.
 
Generally, the respective state regulatory agencies supervise various aspects of oil and gas operations within their states and the transportation of oil and gas sold intrastate.
 
Environmental Protection and Climate Change
 
The Company may be, directly and indirectly, subject to the effects of climate change and may, directly or indirectly, be affected by government laws and regulations related to climate change. We cannot predict with any degree of certainty what effect, if any, climate change and government laws and regulations related to climate change will have on the Company and our business, whether directly or indirectly. While we believe that it is difficult to assess the timing and effect of climate change and pending legislation and regulation related to climate change on our business, we believe that those laws and regulations may affect, directly or indirectly, (i) the costs associated with drilling and production operations in which we participate, (ii) the demand for oil and natural gas, (iii) insurance premiums, deductibles and the availability of coverage and (iv) the cost of utilities paid by the Company. In addition, climate change may increase the likelihood of property damage and the disruption of operation of wells in which we participate. As a result, our financial condition could be negatively impacted, but we are unable to determine at this time whether that impact would be material.

Human Capital Resources
 
At December 31, 2022, the Company had six employees including officers, all of whom work in our corporate office. Because we are so small, our compensation philosophy and objectives are to provide compensation that is fair and reasonable for all employees at a competitive level that will allow us to attract and retain qualified personnel necessary to operate the Company at the most efficient level possible. Our objective is to fully comply with all the operational and financial rules and regulations required of any public company, and specifically, those relating to the oil and gas exploration and production (“E&P”) industry. In addition, we try to maintain compensation at a level that is competitive with other companies in this industry. Our philosophy and objectives for compensation of our executive officers are no different from those with respect to our other employees.
 
Compensation levels for all employees, including our executive officers, are reviewed annually by our executive team. This review process includes reviews of salary and wage surveys, primarily for the oil and gas E&P industry, and informal performance evaluations provided by supervisors. Compensation levels for the next fiscal year are determined during this review process and presented to the entire Board of Directors for approval. In addition to competitive salary, the Company offers generous bonuses, company sponsored employee benefits, such as life and health insurance benefits, vacation, sick leave and a qualified 401(k) savings plan.
 
We believe that each employee contributes directly to our Company’s growth and success, and it is our hope that they will take great pride in being a member of our team. Accountability, integrity, and respect are our core values. We work to create an atmosphere where each employee is a valued and important member of the team. We respect the uniqueness of each employee and believe that diversity is maximized in contributions that create strong work groups and ideas.
 
Employees are encouraged to demonstrate an entrepreneurial spirit by taking initiative, solving problems, being accountable for results, acting as team players while developing individual skills and knowledge that will contribute to the growth of our Company. We want to provide opportunity, encouragement, resources, and feedback to help employees achieve their goals.
 
Our business can only continue to be successful if we allow certain ethical standards to guide the way we operate as a Company, relate to our partners, and exhibit personal integrity in the business community. We share a duty to make the Company a better place for all of us as well as our partners and the community. Employees are always expected to maintain the highest standard of professional conduct.
 
All our employees devote a portion of their time to duties with affiliated companies, and we were reimbursed for the affiliates’ share of compensation directly from those companies. See Item 8, Note 14 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information.
