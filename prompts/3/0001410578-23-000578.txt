Item 1. Business
Overview
Knightscope is a leading provider of Autonomous Security Robots (“ASRs”) and blue light emergency communication devices consisting of emergency blue light towers, blue light emergency phone (“E-Phone”) towers, fully integrated, solar-powered cellular emergency phone towers, and emergency call box systems (“Call Box”). Our technologies are Made in the USA and allow public safety professionals to more effectively deter, intervene, capture, and prosecute criminals. Our mission is to make the United States of America the safest country in the world by helping protect the people, places, and things where we live, work, study and visit.
To support this mission, we design, develop, manufacture, market, deploy, and support ASRs, autonomous charging stations, the proprietary Knightscope Security Operations Center (“KSOC”) software user interface, and blue light emergency communication devices.
We are a Delaware corporation, founded in April 2013. Our headquarters is located in Silicon Valley at 1070 Terra Bella Ave, Mountain View, CA 94043 and our telephone number is (650) 679-7626.
Strategy
The Knightscope management team intends to continue its focus on organic growth as well as add to its core solutions portfolio through future, opportunistic acquisitions based on a target’s revenue, free cash flow, technology, talent, and facilities.
On October 14, 2022, we completed the acquisition (the “CASE Acquisition”) of CASE Emergency Systems (“CASE”). CASE is a leader in blue light emergency phones and an innovator in next generation wireless emergency communications technology, providing Knightscope with a strategic entry into a nationwide market. The transaction provides a significant increase in infrastructure that is readily available for use in supporting the core business and brand strength to Knightscope with over 7,000 devices currently deployed across the United States, 9 production and logistics facilities spread throughout California, Texas and New York, and a seasoned team located across 4 states.
With a US installed base of over 7,000 devices, the CASE acquisition is positioned to enhance to Knightscope’s ASR sales strategy by providing direct access to, numerous CASE clients, including major airports, top law enforcement agencies, universities, municipalities, rail, healthcare, parks, and the U.S. Federal Government. This direct client access will compliment and strengthen Knightscope’s growing autonomous security robot business with a comprehensive product portfolio and broadened physical footprint.
Our core technologies are suitable for most environments that require security patrol coverage and designed to be force multipliers that offer security teams improved situational awareness. ASRs conduct real-time on-site data collection and analysis in both indoor and outdoor spaces delivering alerts to security professionals through the KSOC. The KSOC enables clients with appropriate credentials and user permissions to access the data for investigative and evidence collection purposes.
Our blue light emergency communication devices consist of emergency blue light towers, E-Phone towers, fully integrated, solar-powered cellular emergency phone towers, and Call Boxes. Towered devices are tall, highly visible and recognizable apparatuses that provide emergency communications using cellular and satellite communications with solar power for additional safety in remote locations. E-Phones and Call Boxes offer a smaller, yet still highly visible, footprint than the stationary security towers, but with the same reliable communication capabilities.

We sell our ASR and stationary multi-purpose security solutions under an annual subscription, Machine-as-a-Service (“MAAS”) business model, which includes the ASR lease as well as maintenance, service, support, data transfer, KSOC access, charging stations, and unlimited software, firmware and select hardware upgrades.
Our stationary blue light, E-Phone, and Call Box towers are sold as point-of-sale modular systems, including Knightscope’s exclusive, self-diagnostic, alarm monitoring system firmware that provides system owners daily email reports on the operational status of their system, a one-year parts warranty, and optional installation services. Modular upgrades are available for the blue light towers, such as public announcement speaker systems. Knightscope also offers an extended warranty on this series of stationary security towers.
Our current strategy for all products and services is to focus on United States sales and deployments for the foreseeable future before considering global expansion.
Industry background
In the United States, there are more than 8,000 private security firms and over 19,000 law enforcement agencies – a fragmented marketplace relying primarily on human beings for monitoring and patrol activities. We believe that our products offer a better economic proposition for our clients relative to a human guard or a mobile vehicle patrol unit operating 24/7, enabling the estimated 2.5 million law enforcement and security professionals to focus on strategic decision-making and enforcement.

ASRs, Blue Light Towers, and Call Boxes
The K3 ASR and K5 ASR are designed to roam a geo-fenced area autonomously by utilizing numerous sensors and lasers, either on a random basis or based on a particular patrolling algorithm. They can successfully navigate around people, vehicles and objects in dynamic indoor or outdoor environments. To do this, the ASRs employ several autonomous motion and self-driving technologies, including lasers, ultrasonic sensors, inertial measurement unit (“IMU”), and wheel encoders integrated into a navigation software stack enabling autonomy. Each ASR can generate 1 to 2 terabytes of data per week and over 90 terabytes of data per year, which is accessible for review and analysis via the KSOC. Clients can recall, review, and save the data for analysis, forensic or archival purposes. Each ASR can autonomously charge and recharge on a 24-hour basis, 7 days per week without human intervention. Clients may also utilize the patrol scheduler feature on the KSOC to schedule periodic or regular patrols during certain times for alternative patrol routes.
The approximate dimensions of the K5 are as follows: Height: 5 feet, Width: 3 feet, Weight: 398 pounds.
The K5 is designed to be used primarily outdoors in such environments as open air malls, corporate campuses, hospitals, stadiums, retailers, warehouses, logistics facilities, college campuses, airports, train stations and multi-level parking structures. The K5’s advanced anomaly detection features include:

● | 360-degree high-definition night and day video capture positioned at eye-level;

The approximate dimensions of the K3 are as follows: Height: 4 feet, Width: 2 feet, Weight: 340 pounds.
The K3 is tailored for indoor usage, allowing it to autonomously navigate complex dynamic indoor environments such as an indoor mall, office building, manufacturing facility, hospital, stadium plaza, warehouse or school. It has the same suite of advanced anomaly detection capabilities as the K5, but the parking utilization, parking meter and license plate recognition features are turned off.
The ASRs include several communications features. The units can transfer data over both 4G LTE networks and Private LTE as well as future 5G capabilities. Each one has an available intercom that may be used for two-way communication with a security team. In addition, one or multiple units may be used as a live broadcast public address system or to deliver pre-recorded messages based on time, location, detection or randomly.
The ASRs run on rechargeable batteries. They are configured to patrol autonomously for approximately two to three hours, following which, without human intervention, the ASRs find and dock to a charging station, recharging for approximately 20 minutes or more before resuming patrol. The ASRs remain operational during the charging period, providing 24/7 uptime to clients.
The K1 Tower carries all the relevant features from the K3 and K5 but in a large stationary format. The K1 can be used indoors or outdoors and especially at ingress/egress points for both people and vehicles.
The approximate dimensions of the K1 are: Height: 6 feet, Width: 3 feet, Weight: 150 pounds.
The new K1 Hemisphere, soon to be commercially released, with its smaller profile, is a stationary unit designed for both indoor and outdoor use. The K1 Hemisphere provides up to 210 degree eye-level HD Recording, can be wall or pole mounted, and includes several features from the K3 and K5. 
The dimensions of the K1 Hemisphere are: Diameter: 24 inches, Depth: 10 inches, Weight: 30 pounds.
The K1 Blue Light Tower emergency phone is for outdoor use and delivers completely wireless emergency phone operation, 24/7/365, even in harsh weather conditions with voice connectivity, broadcast warning capability, a flashing strobe, and night area illumination to assist responders in locating callers.
The approximate dimensions of the K1 Blue Light Tower are: Height: 12 feet, Width: less than one foot, Weight: 208 pounds.
The K1 Blue Light Emergency Phone is a compact, full-featured emergency calling solution for indoor and outdoor use. It is ideally suited for areas with limited space and offers one-touch connectivity and a high-visibility blue strobe in places tower designs may not fit. The E-Phone enhances public safety by providing robust, reliable, and clear voice-to-voice communication over a cellular network.
The dimensions of the K1 Blue Light Emergency Phone are: Height: 31.5 inches, Width: 10.5 inches, Weight: 52 pounds. The K1 Call Box is our smallest emergency call box system, delivering one-touch connection with a simple housing and interface. Call Boxes are typically mounted to a pole for outdoor use, and can be outfitted with solar charging capabilities. Like all Knightscope emergency communications products, it can provide a completely wireless solution for emergency phone calls, or it can be adapted to work with existing nearby wiring. Designed to work with hands-free ease, a handset, and TTY pad are additional options available on this device.
The dimensions of the K1 Call Box are: Height: 19.6 inches, Width: 15.3 inches, Weight: 47.4 pounds.

KSOC
The KSOC is our intuitive, browser-based interface that, coupled with ASRs, provides security professionals with “smart mobile eyes and ears and voice – on the ground”. Once alerted of an abnormal event, such as a person spotted during a specific time in a particular location, authorized users can view the live stream of data in the KSOC from each of the ASRs in the user’s network, accessing it from a security operations center or a remote laptop.
Products in Development
The Company is in the process of developing the 5th generation of the K5, which is inprocess of being released, as well as the 1st generation K1 Hemisphere. In addition, the K7 multi-terrain ASR is under concept development. The K7 is expected to have the same features as the K5, but to employ four wheels for use on more rugged outdoor terrain such as dirt, sand, and gravel. We expect that the K7 could be utilized at airfields, power utilities, borders, solar farms, wind farms or oil or gas fields. While this technology builds on a great deal of our technology stack, we anticipate that its development will require significant additional time before it can be launched into full-scale production.
KNOC
The Company has built a custom set of tools that enables it to manage and monitor the network of ASRs operating in the field nationwide, which it refers to as the Knightscope Network Operations Center (“KNOC”). These tools allow our team to monitor the health of the ASRs down to the millisecond, with dozens of alerts related to critical indicators and statistics, including charging, software, navigation and temperatures. We also use the KNOC to execute over-the-air software upgrades, patches and other related items. The KNOC is staffed 24/7 by the Company in the U.S.
Additionally, the Company offers “Knightscope+” remote monitoring as an optional service that can be bundled into its MaaS subscriptions, primarily for clients that operate without a fully staffed 24/7 Security Operations Center (“SOC”).
Knightscope+
Knightscope+ is a virtual monitoring and response solution providing an alternative for client sites that do not have the resources to receive and respond to alerts generated by Knightscope’s ASRs. The service enables a full service solution for ASR clients, including but not limited to, alerts, broadcast messaging, and two-way communications. Knightscope+ operators have extensive training and experience related to surveillance and remote monitoring for greater situational awareness.
Clients
Knightscope’s products are designed to supplement the work of law enforcement and security professionals and are suitable for most environments that require patrol coverage. In the United States, there are more than 8,000 private security firms and over 19,000 law enforcement agencies – a fragmented marketplace that we believe offers numerous opportunities for disruption.
Knightscope’s ASRs, Blue Light Towers, and Call Boxes provide our clients with the ability to augment their existing security infrastructure, enabling human security resources to be more strategic in their approach to security. Our ASRs, Blue Light Tower and Call Box solutions have been deployed across a broad range of clients, including but not limited to casinos, corporations, law enforcement, county agencies, universities, and property management companies. In addition, Knightscope continues to partner with strategic resellers for our ASRs, Blue Light Towers, and Call Boxes, such as large security companies and value-added resellers offering safety equipment looking to augment the security solutions offered to their customers with advanced technology.
Sales and Marketing
The Company has been able to successfully sell new contracts through virtual private demonstrations and has embarked on an innovative “Robot Roadshow” beginning in the fourth quarter of 2021 and has now completed over 75 Pod landings across the country. The initiative entails a cross country tour of a physical “Pod” housing numerous ASRs providing a one-on-one hybrid offline/online selling technique with in-person robots and telepresence sales staff. Furthermore, we continue to be dedicated to achieving an Authority-to-

Operate (“ATO”) from the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (“FedRamp”), targeted during 2023. The federal government adopted the Cloud First Policy, which requires all cloud service providers that hold federal data to be FedRamp certified. FedRamp compliance will enable federal agencies to do business with Knightscope.
We regularly advertise in the media through various online and offline channels.
Research and Development
Our research and development efforts focus primarily on the development of robust base technology as well as scaling efforts. In addition, we will continue to enhance our ASRs’, Blue Light Towers’, and Call Boxes’ capabilities and features, and the functionality of the KSOC software platform for use with the ASRs. In 2021, we commenced the FedRamp certification process, which is expected to continue throughout 2023 and will require ongoing support thereafter for the foreseeable future.
Intellectual Property
The Company holds ten patents collectively covering its ASRs, the security data analysis and display features of the KSOC and its parking monitor feature. The Company also has pending patent applications relating to its ASRs, KSOC, parking monitor feature, behavioral autonomous technology and the ASRs’ behavioral autonomous technology relating to visible weapon detection. The Company owns a trademark registration for its name “Knightscope” in the U.S. On August 10, 2021, the Company filed two trademark applications (Serial Numbers: 90875695 for LONG KNIGHTSCOPE. SHORT THE CRIMINALS and 90875697 for $KSCP). The Company relies and expects to continue to rely on a combination of confidentiality agreements with its employees, consultants, and third parties with whom it has relationships, as well as trademark, copyright, patent, trade secret, and domain name protection laws, to protect its proprietary rights.
Manufacturing and Suppliers
Knightscope assembles its ASRs at its Mountain View, California headquarters and Blue Light Towers and Call Boxes in Downey and Irvine, California from components manufactured by more than 100 suppliers. The Company’s top three suppliers, measured by spending, are Fast Radius, based in Illinois, E and M Electric and Machinery Inc., based in Healdsburg, California, and Quigley’s Auto Body, based in Lake Forest, California. The Company is not highly dependent on any one supplier and believes it can source components from other suppliers and has done so when necessary. Current lead times for certain components and systems are consistent with pre-pandemic lead times for a portion of the bill-of-material but for a variety of varying items, supply chain issues continue. With the onset of supply chain constraints, the Company has experienced significant delays on a few key components and increased requirements to pre-pay for certain raw material or larger minimum order requirements by suppliers. The Company has taken certain countermeasures including, but not limited to, adjusting production schedules, renegotiating supply agreements, re-designing systems, using multiple worldwide brokers, and purchasing larger quantities of key parts in advance. Despite our efforts to minimize the impact of supply chain limitations on our operations during 2022, we expect to continue to experience some delays in our ability to build and deploy ASRs, Blue Light Towers, and Call Boxes to our clients during 2023 due to global supply chain constraints, including, but not limited to, the impact of the continuing conflict in the Ukraine.
In order optimize our ability to serve our clients, we have partnered with one of our strategic investors, Konica Minolta, Inc., among others, to train their technicians to service, maintain and support our machines-in-network and assist us with our nationwide scaling efforts. As our fleet of deployed ASRs grows, the Company has engaged additional third-party service providers with broad geographic footprints to support our clients. K1 Blue Light Ephone Towers and Emergency Call Boxes are serviced by our in-house team of service technicians or by our value added resellers of those product lines.
Competition
At the moment, we are not aware of any direct competitors for our ASR products in the advanced physical security technology space that have viable commercial products in the United States, addressing both outdoor and indoor applications, at the same scale as Knightscope. It is a common misconception among some people outside of the security industry that we compete against closed-circuit television (CCTV) providers. They are not, in fact, competitive products because cameras do not provide a physical presence, are typically used for forensics after an event, and do not offer a client the plethora of capabilities available in an ASR/KSOC combination.

We believe that having these two types of systems working together provide a more holistic approach to promoting safety and reducing crime. While traditional human guards provide a closer comparator or competitor in some cases, we believe that utilizing our “Software, Hardware, Humans” approach is much more effective.
We are aware of a start-up, SMP Robotics Services Corp. (“SMP”), which produces an outdoor autonomous security platform that it markets through third-party distributors which has primarily been focused on international markets but appears to be attempting re-entry to the U.S. market. We had previously listed Gamma 2 Robotics and SHARP Electronics as potential competitors in this space. However, according to industry sources, we understand that both Gamma 2 Robotics and SHARP Electronics have ceased operations in the security robot space after failed attempts to enter the market. Cobalt Robotics, a company exclusively focused on indoor applications, may be considered a partial competitor. Additionally, Turing AI has recently begun offering an indoor-only robot and Robotic Assistance Devices, a subsidiary of Artificial Intelligence Technology Solutions, while beginning autonomous robot offerings, has continued to grow its stationary fixed device offerings, similar to other fixed solutions, such as those offered by Verkada.
We compete indirectly with private physical security firms that provide clients with security personnel and other security services. Our ASRs offer clients a significant cost reduction relative to the cost of human security guards. In addition, ASRs offer significantly more capabilities, such as license plate detection, data gathering, thermal imaging and people detection that are delivered consistently, on a 24-hour, 7 day per week basis, without regular human intervention. In certain cases, our technology complements and improves the operations of traditional security firms.
Competitors for our K1 Blue Light E-Phone Towers and Emergency Call Boxes include Code Blue Corporation, Talk-a-Phone, GaiTronics (Hubbell), and Rath. To differentiate its towers and call boxes from the competition, Knightscope has focused on providing its clients with standalone solutions that include the use of solar power, requiring that no power infrastructure be in place in order for the products to work. In addition, our E-Phones are primarily cellular, requiring no communications infrastructure. As a result, the K1 Blue Light E-Phone Towers and Emergency Call Boxes are easy to install and maintain.
Government Regulation
Our operations are subject to numerous governmental laws and regulations, including those governing antitrust and competition, the environment, collection, recycling, treatment and disposal of covered electronic products and components.
In addition, a number of data protection laws impact, or may impact, the manner in which we collect, process and transfer personal data. U.S. laws that have been applied to protect user privacy (including laws regarding unfair and deceptive practices) may be subject to evolving interpretations or applications in light of privacy developments. Compliance with enhanced data protection laws requires additional resources and efforts, and noncompliance with personal data protection regulations could result in increased regulatory enforcement and significant monetary fines and costs.
Backlog and Seasonality
As of March 19, 2023, we had orders representing approximately $5.2 million in sales outstanding, all of which related to services that we expect to deliver within one year. Of the total sales outstanding as of March 19, 2023, $2.7 million represent MaaS agreements for ASR deployments and $2.5 million relates to orders for Blue Light E-phone towers and Call Boxes. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had orders representing approximately $4.7 million and $1.1 million in sales outstanding, respectively.
We have not experienced any significant effects relating to seasonality for our products and services.
Human Capital
As of December 31, 2022, the Company had 111 full-time employees and one part-time employee working primarily out of our combined headquarters and production facility in Mountain View, California and production facilities in Downey and Irvine, California. We are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements.

On January 6, 2023, the Company announced a cost-reduction plan intended to reduce operating costs, improve operating margins, streamline its operations and right-size its combined workforce and continue advancing the Company’s ongoing commitment to profitable growth. The cost-reduction plan included a reduction of the Company’s workforce by approximately 20%. As of March 30, 2023, the Company had 92 full-time employees and one part-time employee.
The Company believes that our future growth and success will depend in part on our ability to attract and retain highly-skilled employees. The executive management team is responsible for developing and executing the Company’s human capital strategy. The human capital strategy includes the attraction, acquisition, engagement, and development of the Company’s employees as resources allow. The CEO regularly updates the Company’s board of directors on key areas of our human capital strategy, including the following:
Diversity and Inclusion: The Company’s management team and board of directors believes in the benefits workforce diversity can provide. Innovation is critical for any technology company – and we believe that it benefits by the creative thinking that happens when people with different perspectives and backgrounds come together. We believe diverse teams can better relate to the many and varied needs of our Clients. We promote a culture where individual differences are valued which also allows us to attract the very best talent further encouraging our people to reach their full potential.
Further, we are committed to making all benefit and employment-related decisions in compliance with established equal employment opportunity statutes and without regard to religion, national origin, age, gender, race, color, ancestry, sexual orientation, disability, marital status, citizenship, pregnancy, medical condition or any other protected class status, as defined by local, state or federal laws.
We believe strongly in building a workforce that is diverse and that can build strong working relationships with our Clients. We support an inclusive culture and motivate our workforce to be themselves while at work. We are committed to providing our employees with a positive and safe work environment that is free of discrimination, harassment, and workplace violence. We encourage our employees to embrace different ideas, strengths, interests, and cultural backgrounds. Professional development and inclusion are important to us.
Health and Safety: Health, safety, and the well-being of our employees is one of our top priorities. We strive to achieve world-class safety levels on an annual basis. Our safety culture focuses on reducing workplace injuries and is supported by effective communication and reporting of workplace injuries. To protect our employees in facilities in which our teams operate, we have employed preventative measures to ensure the health and safety of our employees. We ensure our preventative measures are in compliance with the most recent local governmental regulations and requirements. These preventative measures not only apply to our physical operations, but also to health and safety measures implemented to address the health pandemics.
