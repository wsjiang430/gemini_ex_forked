We provide a link on our website to the following filings as soon as reasonably practicable after they are electronically filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission” or “SEC”): our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and any amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).

We were incorporated November 2001 in Delaware as a holding company, which seeks acquisitions as part of its strategic alternatives. Morgan Group had no operating companies prior to the October 31, 2019 merger with G.research, LLC (“G.research”) (discussed below). Our wholly-owned subsidiary, G.research is a broker-dealer registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) and is a member of Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”). Our primary source of revenue is our institutional research and securities brokerage services including acting as an underwriter.

Morgan Group Merger with G.research and Spin off
 
The Company acquired G.research from Associated Capital Group, Inc. (“AC”), an affiliate of the Company, on October 31, 2019, in exchange for issuing 500,000 shares of the Company’s common stock to AC (the “Merger”). Accordingly, G.research became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. Prior to the transaction, G.research was a wholly-owned subsidiary of Institutional Services Holdings, LLC, which, in turn, was a wholly-owned subsidiary of AC. After the transaction, AC had an 83.3% ownership interest in the Company. As a result of this common ownership, the transaction was treated as a combination between entities under common control that led to a change in the reporting entity. The recognized assets and liabilities were transferred at their carrying amounts at the date of the transaction. For 2019 year comparative information, for the period prior to the Merger, the companies have been combined retrospectively.
 
On March 16, 2020, AC’s Board of Directors approved the spin-off of the Company to AC’s shareholders. Upon execution of the spin-off on August 5, 2020, AC distributed to its shareholders on a pro rata basis the 500,000 shares of Morgan that AC owns.
 
On May 5, 2020, the Morgan Group board approved a reverse stock split of the issued and outstanding shares of their common stock, par value $0.01 per share, in a ratio of 1‑for‑100 that was effective on June 10, 2020.
 
Institutional Services
 
G.research’s revenues derives revenue from institutional services, underwriting fees (primarily for the Company) and selling concessions.
 
G.research generates revenues via direct fees and commissions on securities transactions executed on an agency basis on behalf of clients. Clients include institutional investors (e.g., hedge funds and asset managers) as well as affiliated mutual funds and managed accounts. Institutional research services revenues totaled $1.9 million and $2.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
 
A significant portion of G.research institutional research services are provided to GAMCO Investors Inc., (“GAMCO”) and its affiliates. For each of the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, G.research earned $1.2 million, or approximately 61% and 55%, respectively, of its commission revenue from transactions executed on behalf of funds advised by Gabelli Funds, LLC and clients advised by GAMCO Asset Management Inc. We can provide no assurance that GAMCO and its affiliates will continue to use G.research’s institutional brokerage services to the same extent in the future. G.research continues to pursue expansion of third party and affiliated activities.
 
Underwriting
 
In October 2021, G.research participated in the secondary offering of the Gabelli Dividend & Income Trust Preferred 4.25% Series K as a member of the underwriting syndicate and selling group earning $50,823 and $144,950, respectively. In December 2021, G.research entered into placement agent agreement for the private placement of The Gabelli Equity Trust Inc. earning $500,000 and was included in a receivable in other assets. No underwriting revenue was earned during the year ended December 31, 2022.
Business Strategy
 
Our strategy is to continue to operate and expand our institutional brokerage business through the coverage of additional market sectors and companies. In order to achieve performance and growth in revenues and profitability, we are pursuing a strategy which includes the following key elements:
Attracting and Retaining Experienced Professionals
 
We offer significant variable compensation that provides opportunities to our staff. Our ability to attract and retain highly experienced investment and other professionals with a long-term commitment to us and our clients has been, and will continue to be, a significant factor in our long term growth.

Competition
 
The institutional brokerages services industry is intensely competitive and is expected to remain so. We face competition in all aspects of our business and in each of our investment strategies from other managers, both in the United States (“U.S.”) and globally. We compete with other institutional research firms, insurance companies, brokerage firms, banks, and other financial institutions that offer services that have similar features and investment objectives. Many of these competitors are subsidiaries of large diversified financial companies and may have access to greater resources, including liquidity sources, not available to us. Historically, we have competed primarily on the basis of the superior service. However, we have taken steps to increase our outreach to the investment community, brand name awareness, and marketing efforts. However, no assurance can be given that our efforts to obtain new business will be successful.
Regulation
 
Virtually all aspects of our business are subject to various federal, state, and foreign laws and regulations. These laws and regulations are primarily intended to protect investors, the markets, and customers of broker-dealers. Under such laws and regulations, agencies that regulate broker-dealers have broad powers, including the power to limit, restrict, or prohibit such broker-dealer from carrying on its business in the event that it fails to comply with such laws and regulations. In such an event, the possible sanctions that may be imposed include civil and criminal liability, the suspension of individual employees, injunctions, limitations on engaging in certain lines of business for specified periods of time, revocation of registrations, censures, and fines.
 
Broker-Dealer and Trading and Investment Regulation
 
G.research is registered as broker-dealer with the SEC and is subject to regulation by FINRA and various states. In its capacity as a broker-dealer, G.research is required to maintain certain minimum net capital amounts. These requirements also provide that equity capital may not be withdrawn, advances to affiliates may not be made, or cash dividends paid if certain minimum net capital requirements are not met. G.research’s net capital, as defined, met or exceeded all minimum requirements as of December 31, 2022. As a registered broker-dealer, G.research is also subject to periodic examination by FINRA, the SEC, and the state regulatory authorities.
 
Our trading and investment activities for client accounts are regulated under the Exchange Act, as well as the rules of various U.S. and non-U.S. securities exchanges and self-regulatory organizations, including laws governing trading on inside information, market manipulation and a broad number of technical requirements (e.g., short sale limits, volume limitations, and reporting obligations) and market regulation policies in the U.S. and globally. Violation of any of these laws and regulations could result in restrictions on our activities and damage our reputation.
 
The institutional research and brokerage services industry is likely to continue facing a high level of regulatory scrutiny and become subject to additional rules designed to increase disclosure, tighten controls, and reduce potential conflicts of interest. In addition, the SEC has substantially increased its use of focused inquiries, which request information from broker dealers regarding particular practices or provisions of the securities laws. We participate in some of these inquiries in the normal course of our business. Changes in laws, regulations, and administrative practices by regulatory authorities, and the associated compliance costs, have increased our cost structure and could in the future have a material adverse impact. Although we have installed procedures and utilize the services of experienced administrators, accountants, and lawyers to assist us in adhering to regulatory guidelines and satisfying these requirements, and maintain insurance to protect ourselves in the case of client losses, there can be no assurance that the precautions and procedures that we have instituted and installed, or the insurance that we maintain to protect ourselves in case of client losses, will protect us from all potential liabilities.
 
The Patriot Act
 
The USA Patriot Act of 2001 contains anti-money laundering and financial transparency laws and mandates the implementation of various new regulations applicable to broker-dealers and other financial services companies, including standards for verifying client identification at account opening, and obligations to monitor client transactions and report suspicious activities. Anti-money laundering laws outside of the U.S. contain some similar provisions. Our failure to comply with these requirements could have a material adverse effect on us.

Employees
 
The Company has one executive officer and 4 employees performing day-to-day functions. The Company was a subsidiary of AC and can avail itself of the transition services agreement with AC and GAMCO.
Real Estate Properties
 
The Company does not own any properties.  The Company is currently renting office space located at 401 Theodore Fremd Avenue in Rye, New York from GAMCO.
 
Status as a Smaller Reporting Company
 
Under the Exchange Act, we qualify as a “smaller reporting company,” which is defined as a company with either (a) public float of less than $250 million or (b) less than $100 million in annual revenues and (1) no public float or (2) public float of less than $700 million. As a smaller reporting company, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “smaller reporting companies.” These exemptions include reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and two, instead of three, fiscal years of audited financial statements.
 
We may take advantage of some or all of the reduced regulatory and reporting requirements that will be available to us as long as we qualify as a smaller reporting company, except that we have irrevocably elected not to take advantage of the extension of time to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards available under Section 107(b) of the JOBS Act.
