ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview



We are an intellectual property asset management company. Our principal operations include the acquisition, licensing and enforcement of intellectual property rights that are either owned or controlled by us or one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries. We currently own, control or manage fifteen intellectual property portfolios, which principally consist of patent rights. As part of our intellectual property asset management activities and in the ordinary course of our business, it has been necessary for us or the intellectual property owner who we represent to initiate, and it is likely to continue to be necessary to initiate, patent infringement lawsuits and engage in patent infringement litigation. We anticipate that our primary source of revenue will come from the grant of licenses to use our intellectual property, including primarily licenses granted as part of the settlement of patent infringement lawsuits.



Intellectual property monetization includes the generation of revenue and proceeds from the licensing of patents, patented technologies and other intellectual property rights. Patent litigation is often, and for us has been, a necessary element of intellectual property monetization where a patent owner, or a representative of the patent owner, seeks to protect its patent rights against the unlicensed manufacture, sale, and use of the owner’s patent rights or products which incorporate the owner’s patent rights. In general, we seek to monetize the bundle of rights granted by the patents through structured licensing and when necessary, enforcement of those rights through litigation, although to date all of our patent license revenues have resulted from litigation. To date all of our revenue from the licensing of our patents has resulted from litigation commenced by us.



We intend to develop our business by acquiring intellectual property rights, either in the form of ownership of or an exclusive license to the underlying intellectual property. Our goal is to enter into agreements with inventors of innovative technologies for which there may be a significant market for products which use or incorporate the intellectual property. We seek to purchase all of, or interests in, intellectual property in exchange for cash, securities of our company, the formation or a joint venture or separate subsidiary in which the owner has an equity interest, and/or interests in the monetization of those assets. Our revenue from this aspect of our business can be generated through licensing and, when necessary, which is typically the case, litigation. We engage in due diligence and a principled risk underwriting process to evaluate the merits and potential value of any acquisition, partnership or joint venture. We seek to structure the terms of our acquisitions in a manner that will achieve the highest risk-adjusted returns possible, in the context of our financial condition. In connection with the acquisition of intellectual property portfolios, we have granted the party providing the financing an interest in any recovery we have with respect to the intellectual property purchased with the financing, and we expect that we will have to continue to grant such interests until and unless we have generated sufficient cash from licensing our intellectual property to enable us to acquire additional intellectual property portfolios without outside financing. However, we cannot assure you that we will ever generate sufficient revenues to enable us to purchase additional intellectual property without third-party financing.



We employ a due diligence process before completing the acquisition of an intellectual property interest. We begin with an investment thesis supporting the potential transaction and then proceed to test the thesis through an examination of the critical drivers of the value of the underlying intellectual property asset. Such an examination focuses on areas such as title and inventorship issues, the quality of the drafting and prosecution of the intellectual property assets, legal risks inherent in licensing programs generally, the applicability of the invention to the relevant marketplace and other issues such as the effects of venue and other procedural issues. If we require financing to acquire intellectual property, we will have to satisfy our financing sources, which may be QFL or QF3, that we have the ability to monetize the intellectual property. However, our financial position may affect our ability to conduct adequate due diligence with respect to intellectual property rights or to acquire valuable intellectual property. This due diligence effort is conducted by our chief executive officer, who is our only full-time employee.

It has been necessary to commence litigation in order to obtain a recovery for past infringement of, or to license the use of, our intellectual property rights. Intellectual property litigation is very expensive, with no certainty of any recovery. To the extent possible we seek to engage counsel on a contingent fee or partial contingent fee basis, which significantly reduces our litigation cost, but which also reduces the value of the recovery to us. We do not have the resources to enable us to fund the cost of litigation. To the extent that we cannot secure counsel on a contingent basis and cannot fund litigation ourselves, which, considering our financial position, is likely to be the case, we may enter into an agreement with a third-party, which may be an independent third-party, such as QFL or QF3, to finance the cost of litigation. In view of our limited cash and our working capital deficiency, we are not able to institute any monetization program that may require litigation unless we engage counsel on a fully contingent basis, or we obtain funding from third-party funding sources. In these cases, counsel may be afforded a greater participation in the recovery and the third-party that funds the litigation would be entitled to participate in any recovery.



Reverse Split, Change in Authorized Common Stock



On July 27, 2022, we amended our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to (i) decrease the number of authorized shares of common stock from 10,000,000,000 shares to 30,000,000 shares and (ii) effect a one-for-100 reverse split whereby each share of common stock became and was converted into 0.01 share of such common stock, with fractional shares being rounded up to the next higher whole number of shares. All share and per share information in this Form 10-K has been retroactively restated to reflect the reverse split and change in authorized common stock.

Purchase Agreement



Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, QFL agreed to make available to us a financing facility of: (i) up to $25,000,000 for the acquisition of mutually agreed patent rights that we intend to monetize; (ii) up to $2,000,000 for operating expenses from which we may, at our discretion, draw up to $200,000 per calendar quarter; and (iii) $1,750,000 to fund the cash payment portion of the restructure of our obligations to Intelligent Partners. In return we transferred to QFL the right to receive a portion of net proceeds generated from the monetization of those patents. After QFL has a negotiated rate of return, we and QFL shall share net proceeds equally until QFL shall have achieved its Investment Return (as defined therein). Thereafter, we shall retain 100% of all net proceeds. Except in an Event of Default, as defined therein, all payments by the Company to QFL pursuant to the Purchase Agreement are non-recourse and shall be paid only if and after net proceeds from monetization of the patent rights owned or acquire by the Company are received, or to be received.

Grant of Security Interests



Pursuant to the Security Agreement and Subsidiary Security Agreement, payment of the obligations of the Company under the Purchase Agreement with QFL are secured by (i) the Proceeds (as defined in the Purchase Agreement); (ii) the Patents; (iii) all General Intangibles now or hereafter arising from or related to the foregoing; (iv) Proceeds (including, without limitation, Cash Proceeds and insurance proceeds) and products of the foregoing and (v) the proceeds realized by the relative patent portfolios of the Subsidiary Guarantors. The security interest in proceeds from the CXT and M-RED patents granted to QFL is junior to the security interest held by the affiliates of Intellectual Ventures Management, LLC (collectively “Intellectual Ventures”) granted to secure the obligations of CXT and MRED pursuant to their patent purchase agreements relating to the purchase of intellectual property from Intellectual Ventures.
Registration Rights Agreement



Pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, we filed a registration statement with the SEC covering 500,000 of the 962,463 shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the Warrant. We are also required to file additional Registration Statements (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement) on the date 60 days after the date that we receive written notice from any Investor (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement) that 60% of the Registrable Securities held by all Investors registered under the immediately preceding registration statement have been sold. The Registration Rights Agreement provides for us to pay damages in the event that we do not meet the required deadlines.
Intercreditor Agreement



In connection with the agreements with QFL and the agreements with Intelligent Partners described below, we and our Subsidiaries entered into an intercreditor agreement with QFL and Intelligent Partners which sets forth the priority of QFL in the collateral under the Investment Documents.
Agreements with Intelligent Partners



Securities Purchase Agreement and Related Agreements with United Wireless



We, together with certain of our subsidiaries, and United Wireless, entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement dated October 22, 2015 (the “SPA”) and related Transaction Documents, as defined therein, pursuant to which the Company sold 500,000 shares (the “Shares”) of our common stock, par value $0.00003 per share (the “Common Stock”) at $5.00 per share, or an aggregate of $250,000; we issued our 10% secured convertible promissory notes due September 30, 2020 to United, and granted United an option (the “2015 Purchase Option”) to purchase up to an additional 500,000 shares of Common Stock in three tranches at the prices as set forth therein. The 2015 Purchase Option expired unexercised on September 30, 2020. The Shares are currently owned by Andrew C. Fitton (“Fitton”) and Michael Carper (“Carper”) and United Wireless subsequently transferred its note and assigned all of its remaining rights under the agreements to Intelligent Partners, which is an affiliate of United Wireless and is owned by Fitton and Carper. Our agreements with United Wireless, also included various monetization proceeds agreements, which we refer to as MPAs, pursuant to which we granted to Intelligent Partners, as the assignee of United Wireless, rights to the monetization proceeds from revenue generated from certain of our intellectual property, a security agreement and a registration rights agreement.

At September 30, 2020, promissory notes in the aggregate principal amount of $4,672,810 were outstanding. The notes became due by their terms on September 30, 2020, and we did not make any payment on account of principal of and interest on the notes. As a result, Intelligent Partners had the right to declare a default under the Notes, and, if Intelligent Partners had taken such action, it would have been necessary for us to seek protection under the Bankruptcy Act. Subsequent to September 30, 2020, we engaged in negotiations with Intelligent Partners in parallel with our negotiations with QFL, with a view to restructuring our obligations under the United Wireless agreements, including the Notes, so that we no longer had any obligations under the Notes or the SPA. These negotiations resulted in the Restructure Agreement, described below, which provided for the payment to Intelligent Partners of $1,750,000 from the proceeds from our agreements with QFL. We also made interest payments totaling $117,780 between September 30, 2020 and February 22, 2021, the date we signed the Restructure Agreement with Intelligent Partners. One of QFL’s requirements to provide us with a funding facility was the restructure of our obligations to Intelligent Partners so that we no longer had any debt obligations to Intelligent Partners. Neither QFL nor any other financing source, would provide us with funding while Intelligent Partners had a right to call a default under our notes to Intelligent Partners. As part of the restructure of our agreements with Intelligent Partners, we amended the existing MPAs and granted Intelligent Partners certain rights in the monetization proceeds from any new intellectual property we acquire, as describe below. Under these MPAs, Intelligent Partners participates in the monetization proceeds we receive with respect to new patents after QFL has received its negotiated rate of return.



On or prior to the date of the Restructure Agreement, Intelligent Partners transferred to Fitton and Carper $250,000 of the Notes (the “Transferred Note”), thereby reducing the principal amount of the Notes held by Intelligent Partners to $4,422,810.



On February 22, 2021, we and Intelligent Partners agreed to extinguish the Note and Transferred Note, and terminate or amend and restate the SPA and Transaction Documents, pursuant to a series of agreements including: a Restructure Agreement (the “Restructure Agreement”), a Stock Purchase Agreement (the “Stock Purchase Agreement”), an Option Grant (the “Option Grant”), an Amended and Restated Pledge Agreement (the “Pledge Agreement”), an Amended and Restated Registration Rights Agreement (the “Registration Rights Agreement”), a Board Observation Agreement (the “Board Observation Agreement”), a MPA-NA Security Interest Agreement (the “MPA-NA Security Interest Agreement”), an Amended and Restated Patent Proceeds Security Agreement (the “Patent Proceeds Security Agreement”, an Amended and Restated MPA-CP (the “MPA-CP”), an Amended and Restated MPA-CXT (the “MPA-CXT”), a MPA-MR (the “MPA-MR”), a MPA-AMI (the “MPA-AMI,” and together with the MPA-CP, MPA-CXT and MPA-MR, each a Restructure MPA and together the Restructure MPAs) and a MPA-NA (the “MPA-NA”).




(i) | Pursuant to the Restructure Agreement, we paid Intelligent Partners $1,750,000 at closing, which we received from QFL and which QFL paid directly to Intelligent Partners, and recognized a further non-interest bearing total monetization proceeds obligation (the “TMPO”) of $2,805,000, which shall, from and after the Restructure Date, be reduced on a dollar for dollar basis by (a) payments to Intelligent Partners pursuant to the restructure agreement, the Restructure MPAs and the MPA-NA and (b) any election by the Intelligent Partners to pay the Exercise Price of the Restructure Option, in whole or part, by means of a reduction in the then outstanding TMPO. Further details regarding the TMPO are provided under “TMPO”;
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(ii) | Pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement, we issued to Fitton and Carper, as holders of the Transferred Note, a total of 462,963 shares of common stock at a purchase price of $0.54 per share, which purchase price was paid by the conversion and in full satisfaction of the Transferred Note (the “Conversion Shares”).
-----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(iii) | Pursuant to the Option Grant, we granted Intelligent Partners an option to purchase a total of 500,000 shares of common stock, with an exercise price of $0.54 per share which vests immediately and may be exercised through February 9, 2026.
------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(iv) | Pursuant to the restructured monetization proceeds agreement, Intelligent Partners has a right to receive 60% of the net monetization proceeds from the patents currently owned by the Subsidiary Guarantors. The agreement has no termination provisions, so Intelligent Partners will be entitled to its percentage interest as long as revenue is generated from the intellectual property covered by the agreement.
-----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(v) | Pursuant to the Subsidiary Security Agreement, our obligations under our agreements with Intelligent Partners, including its obligations under the Restructure Agreement and the Restructure MPAs are secured by a security interest in the net proceeds realized from the future monetization of the patents currently owned by the eight subsidiaries named above.
----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(vi) | Pursuant to the MPA-NA-Security Interest Agreement, our obligations under the MPA-NA are secured by a security interest in net proceeds realized from the future monetization of new patents acquired until the TMPO is satisfied, provided Intelligent Partners’ secured interest shall be limited to its entitlement in Net Proceeds under the MPA-NA. After satisfaction of the TMPO the security interest in proceeds from new assets shall terminate.
-----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(vii) | We granted Intelligent Partners, Andrew Fitton and Michael Carper certain registration rights with respect to (i) the 500,000 Shares currently owned by Fitton and Carper, which shares are included in the registration statement that we filed; (ii) the 462,963 Conversion Shares being issued to Fitton and Carper, and (iii) the 500,000 shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the Restructure Option;
------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(viii) | Commencing six months from the closing date, if the shares owned by Intelligent Partners cannot be sold pursuant to a registration statement and cannot be sold pursuant to Rule 144 without the Company being in compliance with the current public information requirements of Rule 144, if the Company is not in compliance with the current public information requirements, the Company is required to pay damages to Intelligent Partners.
-------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(ix) | Pursuant to the Board Observation Rights Agreement, until the TMPO has been satisfied (the “Observation Period”), we granted Intelligent Partners the option and right, exercisable at any time during the Observation Period, to appoint a representative to attend meetings of the Board or any committee thereof, including executive sessions, in an observer capacity.
-----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




Events of Default include (i) a Change of Control of the Company (ii) any uncured default on payment due to Intelligent Partners in an amount totaling in excess of $275,000, which is not the subject of a Dispute or other formal dispute resolution proceeding initiated in good faith pursuant to this Agreement or other Restructure Documents (iii) the filing of a voluntary petition for relief under the United States Bankruptcy Code by Company or any of its material subsidiaries, (iv) the filing of an involuntary petition for relief under the United States Bankruptcy Code against the Company, which is not stayed or dismissed within sixty (60) days of such filing, except for an involuntary petition for relief filed solely by Intelligent Partners, or any Affiliate or member of Intelligent Partners, or (v) acceleration of an obligation in excess of $1 million dollars to another provider of financing following a final determination by arbitration or other judicial proceeding that such obligation is due and owing.



Registration Rights Agreement



Pursuant to a registration rights agreement, we granted Intelligent Partners, Andrew Fitton and Michael Carper certain registration rights with respect to (i) the 500,000 Shares currently owned by Fitton and Carper; (ii) the 462,963 Conversion Shares issued to Fitton and Carper, and (iii) the 500,000 shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the Restructure Option. We filed the registration statement with the SEC covering the 500,000 Shares owned by Fitton and Carper, and the registration statement was declared effective by the SEC.

Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic on our Business



Although we do not manufacture or sell products, the COVID-19 pandemic and the work shutdown imposed in the United States and other countries to limit the spread of the virus had a negative impact on our business. Our revenue is generated almost exclusively from license fees generated from litigation seeking damages for infringement of our intellectual property rights. The work shutdown affected the court system, and during much of 2020 and part of 2021 courts operated on a reduced schedule, and some courts may still have a backlog as a result of the pandemic. As a result, deadlines are likely to be postponed which may give defendants an incentive to delay negotiations or offer a lower amount than they might otherwise accept. In addition, the effect of the COVID-19 and the public response may have adversely affected the financial condition and prospects of defendants and potential defendants, which made it less likely that they would be willing to settle our claim.

Acquired in July 2022 pursuant to an agreement with Hewlett Packard Enterprise Development LP and Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company, the HPE portfolio consists of eight United States Patents across five patent families which relate generally to systems and methods around hardware, software and system security and capabilities (“HPE Portfolio”). We requested and received a capital advance from QFL in the amount of $350,000, which was used to make payment of the purchase price pursuant to the terms of the purchase agreement.



Competition



We encounter and expect to continue to encounter competition in the areas of intellectual property acquisitions for the sake of licensure from both private and publicly traded companies that engage in intellectual property monetization activities. Such competitors and potential competitors include companies seeking to acquire the same intellectual property assets and intellectual property rights that we may seek to acquire. Entities such as Acacia Research Corporation, Document Security Systems, Inc., Intellectual Ventures, Quarterhill Inc., MOSAID Technologies Inc., VirnetX Holding Corporation, Network-1 Security Solutions, Interdigital, Inc., IPValue Management Inc., Pendrell Corporation, Inventergy Global, Inc., Netlist Inc., Parkervision Inc., Walker Innovation, Inc., Daedalus Group LLC, Netlist Inc. and others derive all or a substantial portion of their revenue from intellectual property monetization activities, and we expect more entities to enter the market. Most of our competitors have longer operating histories and significantly greater financial resources and personnel than we have.



We also compete with venture capital firms, strategic corporate buyers and various industry leaders for intellectual property and technology acquisitions and licensing opportunities. Many of these competitors have more financial and human resources than our company. In seeking to obtain intellectual property assets or intellectual property rights, we seek to both demonstrate our understanding of the intellectual property that we are seeking to acquire or license and our ability to monetize their intellectual property rights. Our weak cash position and history of losses, together with our low stock price, may impair our ability to negotiate successfully with the intellectual property owners.



Other companies may develop competing technologies that offer better or less expensive alternatives to intellectual property rights that we may acquire and/or license. Many potential competitors may have significantly greater resources than we do. The development of technological advances or entirely different approaches could render certain of the technologies owned or controlled by our operating subsidiaries obsolete and/or uneconomical.
