Our Mission and Vision
Our mission is to bring our farm to your kitchen. Our vision is to deliver the freshest, locally grown produce over the fewest food miles. We believe that happy plants make happy taste buds and we are committed to reimagining the standards of freshness. We also believe that local is the best kind of business, and we are committed to helping communities thrive for generations to come. We are committed to building empowered local teams. Together, we believe we are capable of extraordinary things.
Company Overview
Local Bounti is a controlled environment agriculture (“CEA”) company that produces sustainably grown produce, focused today on living and loose leaf lettuce. Founded in 2018, and headquartered in Hamilton, Montana, Local Bounti utilizes its patent pending Stack & Flow Technology™ to grow healthy food sustainably and affordably. Our proprietary process is a hybrid, utilizing vertical farming in early plant growth, followed by greenhouse farming for final grow out. We designed our Stack & Flow Technology™ to give our products exactly what they need at every step of their growth cycle. Our goal is to grow in an environmentally sustainable manner that not only increases harvest efficiency and enhances unit economics, but also limits water usage and reduces the carbon footprint of the production and distribution process. Controlling the environmental conditions in both the ‘Stack’ and ‘Flow’ components of our growing system helps to ensure healthy, nutritious, consistent, and delicious products that are non-genetically modified organisms (“non-GMO”). We use 90% less water, 90% less land, and significantly less pesticides and herbicides than traditional outdoor agriculture operations. 
Our first CEA facility in Hamilton, Montana (the “Montana Facility”) commenced construction in 2019 and reached full commercial operation by the second half of 2020. In 2021, we successfully completed the expansion of our Montana Facility, more than doubling our production capacity. Immediately after expansion, this facility was dedicated equally to commercial production and research and development that focused on new products, technology and system design. Today, the majority of the Montana Facility is dedicated to commercial production, but we continue to utilize dedicated space for research and development to improve our existing and future facilities. 
On April 4, 2022, Local Bounti acquired California-based complementary greenhouse farming company Hollandia Produce Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the "Pete's Acquisition"), which operate under the name Pete's ("Pete's"). Through the Pete's acquisition, we significantly increased our growing footprint, now operating three additional greenhouse growing facilities, including two in California and one in Georgia, the latter of which became operational in July 2022. We now have distribution to over 10,000 retail locations across 35 U.S. states and Canadian provinces, primarily through direct relationships with blue-chip retail customers, including Albertsons, Sam's Club, Kroger, Target, Walmart, Whole Foods, and AmazonFresh. Today, our primary products include living butter lettuce – for which we are a leading provider with an approximate 80% share of the CEA market within the Western U.S. – as well as packaged salad and cress.
Local Bounti's founders are Craig M. Hurlbert and Travis M. Joyner, business partners with a track record of building and managing capital-intensive, commodity-based businesses in energy, water, and industrial technology. After initially setting out to invest in a CEA business, Craig and Travis could not find a suitable existing business or technology in which to invest. Instead, they took a clean sheet approach and began to build a business with long-term CEA leadership in mind and a focus on unit economics and sustainability. With this background, we created our high-yield and low-cost Stack & Flow Technology™. Local Bounti plans to install its patent pending Stack & Flow 
Technology™ at its California facilities, combining the best aspects of vertical farming and greenhouse growing technologies to deliver higher yields of diverse leafy greens with superior unit economics. 
Business Summary
Our differentiation is rooted in our focus on unit economics, and is compounded by our modular and locally distributed facility strategy, brand and product diversity, and a strong focus on sustainability.
Our focus on unit economics defines our execution strategy, which underpins our value proposition and enhances value for all stakeholders as depicted in the diagram below.
 
Our hybrid facility design is at the core of our focus on unit economics and serves as a platform intended to grow margins through investment in technology and in the future, plant genetics. In our facility configuration, we grow plants during their early development period "stacked" in a space and energy efficient vertical nursery. This configuration reduces facility square footage and increases returns on invested capital. This vertical nursery produces a stock of young plants to fill growing space in our controlled environment greenhouses, where young plants accelerate growth when exposed to a specified set of conditions involving natural light, temperature, humidity, carbon dioxide, nutrients, pH balance, and other key elements. With this approach, we believe that once Stack & Flow Technology™ is fully commissioned at a facility, the facility will yield 1.5 to 2.0 times more produce than traditional hydroponic greenhouse farms.
Additionally, our greenhouse configuration is organized in a highly modular layout with our control center technology suite we are developing to centralize operational control. Our control center technology suite provides for remote monitoring of our operations to efficiently collect and analyze information to drive yields, reduce risk, and grow product more consistently.
We use flexible, modular facility designs to enable rapid expansion near major population centers. We regularly assess our pipeline of future farm locations to leverage our national distribution footprint. Key considerations include meeting known demand from key existing customers within the network, as well as optimizing freight routes to ensure that transportation is optimized to limit cost while enhancing customer service with consistent delivery schedules. Our approach is to build or acquire geographically distributed production facilities so we can provide our customers with locally and sustainably grown produce delivered at peak freshness on a year-round basis. We plan to use substantial pre-engineered, pre-fabricated and standardized components when building our modular facilities in order to reduce execution risk for facilities where we build from the ground up. For pre-existing facilities like those acquired with the Pete's Acquisition, we plan to update facilities using our Stack & Flow Technology™. We are working to develop key partnerships with agricultural and equipment vendors to ensure efficient construction. As a result, we believe we can build, scale and commission a facility within 15 months of acquiring the underlying land, which we believe is significantly faster than our competitors. This strategy enables us to reduce the distance of our farms to our customers by more than 50% of the distance that is standard in the industry, mitigate supply chain risk, simplify transportation logistics and reduce food spoilage and waste.
Local Bounti products are currently sold at more than 10,000 retail locations across 35 U.S. states and Canadian provinces primarily through direct relationships with blue-chip retail customers, including Albertsons, Sam's Club, Kroger, Target, Walmart, Whole Foods, and AmazonFresh. Our stock keeping unit (“SKU”) assortment at the end of 2022 includes 25 SKUs across living and loose leaf lettuce, organic and conventional, cress and value add product lines. In the future, we seek to co-locate with nationally recognized distributors to leverage their existing 
networks and thereby further decrease the carbon footprint of duplicative distribution, and we are currently evaluating the implementation of this strategy through our existing distribution network.
We expect to continue to target new SKUs that incorporate spinach, kale, and arugula, which continue to grow in popularity in American households. We believe the power of our brands, including Local Bounti and Pete's, and the quality of our products allow customers and consumers to associate Local Bounti produce with freshness and sustainability, and choose our products to enhance their diets while safeguarding the environment. Paired with our geographically distributed production, we believe that our branding and SKU diversity will allow us to capture greater market share with customers and consumers who seek a diversity of leafy green produce and are oriented to locally produced, sustainable food.
Sustainability is at the core of our business focus, and our business directly addresses 12 of the 17 United Nations ("U.N.") Sustainable Development Goals. Our farming practices use 90% less land and water than traditional farming, and our usage of pesticides and herbicides is significantly lower as compared to field grown lettuce. Compared to field-grown loose leaf lettuce, our lettuce and herbs contain 10 to 1,000 times less bacteria than conventional farming, leading to a longer shelf life, which greatly reduces waste for both customers and consumers. Our local production facilities enable lower greenhouse gas emissions associated with transportation and provide greater access to fresh produce. We believe that our production methods also yield significantly greater worker welfare compared to traditional farming methods due to the type of farming inherent with the use of CEA technology (i.e., indoors). This is also central to our commitment to grow our people, which is as critical to us as growing our produce.
Market Overview
According to the U.N., by 2050, the global population is projected to be 9.8 billion with about 68% of the population living in an urban area, which presents challenges around energy, transportation, housing and food availability. In addition, consumer demands are challenging agriculture businesses to produce food in ways that are more safe, transparent, personalized and sustainable.
Expanding Global Agriculture Crisis. The world is facing a rapidly expanding global agriculture crisis. According to a report released by the U.N. and its partners in 2020, we will need significantly more capacity to produce approximately 70% more food to feed the world's population by 2050, but there will not be enough arable land and water for traditional agriculture to meet these needs. According to studies from The University of Sheffield, the world has lost more than 30% of its arable land in just the last 40 years, and approximately 60% of total global cropland has been depleted from irrigation usage. Significant enhancements in food production are also needed in the near term as the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization estimates that a quarter of the world's population is "food insecure," which means it lacks consistent access to enough food for an active, healthy life. According to the international relief agency Mercy Corps, approximately nine million people die annually from hunger while approximately 10% to 30% of agricultural produce spoils before it is sold to consumers.
Increasing focus on healthy eating. Over the past few decades, there has been a growing consumer focus on healthy eating. Individuals are increasingly conscious of their diets and are opting for more fresh vegetables and produce. According to the International Food Information Council's 2019 Food and Health Survey of American Consumers, 75% of respondents claimed they were eating healthier than a decade ago, including limiting sugar intake, eating less carbohydrates and processed foods, eating more fruits and vegetables, and paying more attention to what they are putting into their bodies. As the trend toward fresh food continues, the market for vegetables and herbs in the United States is expected to reach $75 billion by 2025 and grow 15% annually, according to a report published by S2G Ventures.

Demand for fresh and local produce. We believe consumers are increasingly drawn to local and sustainably grown food due to the freshness of the product, the taste, and a sense of supporting the local economy and environment. However, weather and geography limit the ability for traditional agriculture methods to provide most geographies with sufficient locally grown food year-round, or at all. For example, from November through March, approximately 90% of all leafy vegetables grown in the United States are sourced from Yuma County in southwest Arizona, according to the Yuma County Chamber of Commerce, which is hundreds of miles from where much of this food is ultimately consumed.
CEA Overview
CEA is a technology-oriented approach towards plant-based food production and employs enclosed structures to grow plants in a protected environment where optimal growing conditions are maintained. Drivers for growth of CEA include scarcity of resources, such as arable land, water and suitable climate, as well as changing climatic conditions putting increased stress on conventional farming practices. CEA involves increased control over variables which optimizes the plant growing conditions, resulting in higher plant quality and larger production volume while ensuring resource efficiency. These variables include temperature, humidity, carbon dioxide, light, nutrient concentration, and nutrient pH. With a stable control of the plant environment, CEA can provide secure, high quality produce, year-round production of previously seasonal produce and higher production volume compared to conventional farming on the same size land. Moreover, CEA allows for a more efficient use of land and fresh water (up to 90% less water and land than soil-based agriculture), reduced need to use fertilizer or pesticides, reduced carbon emissions as CEA allows operations to be located closer to end-users, reduced food waste, and avoidance of chemical runoff from broad applications of fertilizer and pesticides/ herbicides associated with field-based agriculture.
CEA growers employ various permutations of growing environments and growing methods to meet customer, operational and other metrics that are important determinants of the CEA operation.
Types of growing environments:
Greenhouse: A glass or polycarbonate structure that uses sunlight in crop production. Variables such as temperature, humidity and sunlight need to be considered carefully when growing produce in greenhouses, particularly during the summer months.
Vertical Farming: A crop production that utilizes supplemental lighting such as LED lights and gives the ability to control the environment. This type of controlled environment agriculture often uses a vertical space where plants can be stacked horizontally or in tall towers and may include rooms, warehouses, containers, factories and other converted indoor spaces not usually created for growing crops.
Protected Cropping: A crop production that is grown outdoors with some protection against exogenous elements. The protection may offer value against rain, hail and frost.
Types of growing methods:
Aeroponics: Plants suspended in a closed or semi-closed environment; the exposed roots and lower stem are sprayed with a nutrient-rich water solution.
Aquaponics: Cultivation of plants in a recirculating water medium with aquatic animal wastewater from an adjacent tank of fish, crayfish, prawns or snails. The waste is broken down by bacteria into usable nutrients for the plants.
Hydroponic: Growing plants in a soil-less water or media matrix by bathing roots in a nutrient-rich solution, which can be paired with aquaponics.
The rise of commercially viable CEA. CEA can offer the food industry resiliency and dependability beyond what traditional agriculture can offer. CEA can produce a broad array of product consistently, year- round, and despite weather or other adverse growing conditions. CEA can also be implemented locally, which reduces the supply-chain risk associated with distanced or international suppliers. Recent events, including the COVID-19 pandemic, have forced grocers, restaurants and other food providers to reconsider their supply chain risk and seek reliable and less variable suppliers. We believe that CEA represents an attractive alternative for industry players seeking greater reliability and will lead to further adoption.
On a more global basis, CEA addresses 12 of the 17 total U.N. Sustainable Development Goals, including:

U.N. SustainableDevelopment Goal | CEA Benefit 
2) Zero Hunger | The flexibility of Local Bounti's locations enables access to fresh, local food from many parts of the world

17) Partnerships for the Goals | Local Bounti participates in the UN Global Compact and is a member of the GRI Community and International Fresh Produce Association ("IFPA") 

Large and growing market opportunity for CEA.
According to publicly available research, the U.S. market for fruit and vegetables has an estimated total addressable market of $75 billion. Local Bounti initially focused on the Western half of the United States, where we continue to see the Mountain and West regions as attractive target markets given their historical struggles with food scarcity and the greenfield opportunity for us to be the first large-scale CEA operator in many parts of this region. With the Pete's Acquisition, we now have two existing operational facilities in California and a newly constructed facility in Georgia, allowing us to capture a greater portion of the U.S. TAM. Our location selection analysis suggests that we will be able to build distributed, regional facilities that each serve multiple regional population centers, giving leverage to local production on a regional basis, including as we expand outside of the Western region of the United States. Additionally, we target initial addressable market facility expansion in states with favorable conditions for growth in light industrial production, including favorable state and local processes for facility siting, permitting, construction and 
operation. Additionally, we may target existing greenhouse or CEA operations for acquisitions if they are strategically located and meet our other business criteria, including, for example, the Pete's Acquisition.
Local Bounti Facility Locations
Our Solution
We believe Local Bounti is positioned as a disruptor to loose leaf lettuce, living lettuce and other produce production by changing the way food is grown with our Farm of the Future™, which focuses on driving profitable unit economics and is based on our patent pending Stack & Flow Technology™.

Our approach combines the features that we found most attractive from vertical farming and traditional hydroponic greenhouse growing to grow plants during their early development in our "stack" phase. This reduces facility square footage, drives capital expenditure and operating expenditure efficiency, increases the annual turns of the farm, and ultimately leads to increased returns on invested capital. This vertical nursery produces a stock of young plants to fill growing space in our controlled environment hydroponic greenhouses, where young plant growth is accelerated when exposed to a specified set of conditions, including natural light, temperature, humidity, carbon dioxide, nutrients, pH balance and other key variables.
Environment Control Variables
We believe that we are well-positioned to redefine environmental, social and governance ("ESG") standards for indoor agriculture while delivering the freshest and highest quality produce to local communities with minimal carbon footprint. The key components to Local Bounti's strategy are set forth below.
Unit economics focus with technology-driven approach. Local Bounti utilizes its proprietary Stack & Flow Technology™, which combines the best of vertical and greenhouse growing technologies, enabling superior unit economics and efficiencies across the production cycle. Plants spend early development in a stacked nursery design, reducing facility square footage. When the plants reach targeted maturity, they are transported to hydroponic greenhouses, which are arranged on horizontal planes with natural sunlight and other controlled environmental variables, resulting in optimal growth conditions specified for each type of plant as well as space and energy efficiency. With less land requirement and fewer days in the greenhouse, our technology enables lower capital expenditure, lower operating expenses, higher labor efficiency and higher yield, and retrofit potential that others lack compared to results published by greenhouse farms and other CEA operations.
Modular and distributed production. Local Bounti uses a modular building system, which reduces time and cost of construction. Facilities are designed for automation and efficiency without being capital intensive. Pre-engineered, off-the-shelf construction and in-house developed technologies are used, which help to lower risks of execution for building and commissioning new production facilities (or updating existing facilities). For pre-existing facilities like those acquired with the Pete's Acquisition, we expect to update facilities using our Stack & Flow Technology™. Our approach is to build geographically distributed production so we can provide customers with locally grown, lower pesticide and herbicide produce delivered at peak freshness on a year-round basis. The Montana 
Facility was built in 2019 and reached full commercial operation by the second half of 2020. The Montana Facility underwent an expansion, which was completed in the third quarter of 2021 and was fully commissioned in the fourth quarter of 2021. We regularly assess our pipeline of future farm locations to maximize our national distribution footprint. Key considerations include meeting known demand from key existing customers within the network, as well as optimizing freight routes to ensure that transportation is optimized to limit cost while enhancing customer service with consistent delivery schedules. Our approach is to build or acquire geographically distributed production facilities so we can provide our customers with locally and sustainably grown produce delivered at peak freshness on a year-round basis. Additionally, we are developing a control center technology suite to enable remote monitoring of our operations to efficiently collect and analyze information to drive yields and grow better products.
Branded product with SKU diversity. Local Bounti products are currently sold at more than 10,000 retail locations across 35 U.S. states and Canadian provinces primarily through direct relationships with blue-chip retail customers, including Albertsons, Sam's Club, Kroger, Target, Walmart, Whole Foods, and AmazonFresh. We believe that customers and consumers will associate our brand with high quality, locally grown produce with better taste, freshness, and significantly longer shelf life. Our modular, distributed model and Stack & Flow Technology™ allows for high SKU diversity. At the end of 2022, Local Bounti offered 25 SKUs across living and loose leaf lettuce, organic and conventional, cress and value add product lines, and intends to continue to expand its SKUs to meet customer demand. We believe that SKU diversity in these markets will allow us to capture more in-store real estate and will result in consumer loyalty across multiple regional markets. 
Local Bounti Product Offering
Montana Facility. Our Montana Facility was built in 2019 and reached commercial operations in the second half of 2020. The Montana Facility incorporates our patent pending Stack & Flow Technology™, including five operational greenhouses, a cold storage room for finished goods and a packaging room with processing equipment to transform freshly harvested produce into packaged goods that are ready for retail shelves. By leveraging our flexible modular approach, we completed an increase to the capacity of the Montana Facility by approximately 140% to 12 hydroponic ponds in the third quarter of 2021, which is now operational, and was fully commissioned in the fourth quarter of 2021. In October 2021, we acquired 20 acres of land adjacent to the Montana Facility for a potential research and development facility.
Pete's Facilities. We acquired Pete's in April 2022. Pete's has three operating facilities: the Carpinteria Facility, the Oxnard Facility, and the Georgia Facility.
Carpinteria Facility. Our Carpinteria Facility was originally built in 1976, with many additions happening over 30 years, the latest in the mid-2000s. The Carpinteria Facility incorporates nutrient film technique growing channels across 66 greenhouses totaling 15.2 acres (which does not include an additional 1.5 acres of propagation greenhouses in Carpinteria) and multiple harvesting and packaging rooms and uses proprietary packaging technology that transforms freshly harvested produce into packaged goods ready for retail sale.
Oxnard Facility. Our Oxnard Facility was built in 2011 and 2012. The facility sits on 41.5 acres, including 12.8 acres under glass. The Oxnard Facility uses multiple growing methods, including 77 greenhouses with ponds and 10 greenhouses using growing channels. The facility uses both conventional and organic growing methods and has a 
centralized harvesting and packaging room that transforms freshly harvested produce into packaged goods ready for retail sale.
Georgia Facility. Our Georgia Facility began operations in mid-2022. The facility sits on 30.4 acres of land and initially includes 3 acres under glass with 14 lines of channel growing systems. We will retrofit the Georgia Facility to incorporate our patent pending Stack & Flow Technology™. The facility also includes a cold storage room for finished goods and a packaging room with processing equipment to transform freshly harvested produce into packaged goods that are ready for retail shelves. The Georgia site is laid out for potential future expansion up to 4x the size of the first phase that was recently completed and is currently undergoing expansion to 6 acres and the incorporation of our Stack & Flow Technology™.
Development Pipeline. We regularly assess our pipeline of future farm locations to maximize our national distribution footprint. Key considerations include meeting known demand from key existing customers within the network, as well as optimizing freight routes to ensure that transportation is optimized to limit cost while enhancing customer service with consistent delivery schedules. We are currently building two new facilities. We expect to complete construction of our new facility in Mount Pleasant, Texas, in the fourth quarter of 2023 and our new facility in Pasco, Washington, in the first quarter of 2024. The Texas facility will be comprised of six acres of greenhouse and multiple stack zones. The Pasco facility will be comprised of three acres of greenhouse and multiple stack zones. 
Grown with Fewer Pesticides and Herbicides. Local Bounti produce is grown with significantly less pesticides and herbicides than traditional field-grown produce, is non-GMO, and is certified with Harmonized Good Agricultural Practices under a GFSI benchmarked program.
Cargill Relationship. We have entered into credit agreements with Cargill Financial, as described in Note 7, Debt, of the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Our Competitive Strengths
We believe the following competitive strengths will enable us to capitalize on the expanding opportunity for CEA and locally grown produce.
Ability to drive production yield and lower costs. We designed and purpose-built our Farm of the Future™, which focuses on driving profitable unit economics and is based on our patent pending Stack & Flow Technology™. We are developing a centralized monitoring system which collects, organizes and analyzes data from distributed facilities. Our sophisticated data analytics enable us to continually improve the operations of our facilities and to centrally control key variables such as temperature, humidity, carbon dioxide, light, nutrients and pH balances. We have also implemented additional innovations that shorten growing cycles, improve production yield and lower costs, such as optimizing plant density to increase greenhouse production capacity. Our Montana Facility currently supports a greenhouse crop cycle of 14 to 21 days depending on the SKU. We have further identified a clear roadmap for margin expansion and product diversification with significant visibility into reduced labor cost opportunities and improved profitability. 
Branded products that are strategic for retailers and trusted by consumers. We expect Local Bounti branded products to generate strong customer loyalty by offering affordable, high-quality produce that is locally grown and sustainably sourced. We believe that consumers choose our products because the Local Bounti brand is a promise that the food they eat is sustainably and locally grown, non-GMO, healthy, and at the peak of freshness because it is at the retailer's distribution centers within 24 to 48 hours from harvest. Our produce has weeks of freshness and lasts longer than traditionally grown produce, which leads to substantially less waste and, in turn, cost savings for grocers as well as consumers. In addition to cost savings from reduced spoilage, we are an increasingly important supplier for our retail grocer customers given our diverse and quality product offerings and reliability. Our CEA methods enable year-round crop production and consistent supply regardless of the local climate or weather conditions.
Highly scalable turnkey platform. Local Bounti's patent pending Farm of the Future™ facilities are designed to use pre-engineered, pre-fabricated and standardized components to enable efficient expansion with low execution risk or added costs. Our facilities have been purposely designed for rapid expansion, allowing us to potentially build and commission a facility within 15 months of land acquisition, as compared to 21 to 24 months reported by our most direct competitor. For pre-existing facilities like those acquired with the Pete's Acquisition, we expect to update facilities using our Stack & Flow Technology™, which would then benefit from the same baseline platform.
Experienced management team. We have an experienced and passionate management team with deep industry knowledge and a diverse set of core competencies. Our leadership team has diverse operational and brand building experience at Pete's, Plenty, Bushel Boy Farms, Earthbound Farms, Jacks Links, and other established brands. Our Co-CEO, Craig M. Hurlbert, has a track record of building successful businesses through his former roles, including as CEO and Chairman of TAS Energy. Our other Co-CEO, Travis M. Joyner, has a long career in venture capital and management consulting. Our President, Brian Cook, has extensive CEA experience as the chief executive officer of Pete's, along with other senior management positions. Our CIO, B. David Vosburg Jr., has extensive 
experience in agricultural technology through his previous roles as CFO of Crop One and CFO of Sensei Ag. Our CFO, Kathleen Valiasek, has extensive experience as a public company CFO, most recently at Amyris.
Growth Strategies
We intend to leverage our competitive strengths to continue to optimize our production and distribution to meet the rising demand for our products through the growth strategies set forth below.
Continue to improve unit economics through technology focus and design improvements. CEA is an emerging industry that is continually benefiting from technological advancement and development. We intend to continue to optimize our facilities through design and materials improvements and by leveraging computer vision, artificial intelligence and robotics to optimize energy and labor usage. Through these enhancements, we believe we can shorten grow cycles to a maximum of seven to 21 days. We also believe we can continue to drive profitability with identified opportunities to reduce packaging costs and with an increasingly efficient cost structure as we gain economies of scale.
Scale our platform by adding additional capacity and new facilities near our customers. We use flexible, modular facility designs to enable rapid expansion near major population centers. We regularly assess our pipeline of future farm locations to maximize our national distribution footprint. Key considerations include meeting known product demand from key existing customers within the network, as well as optimizing freight routes to ensure that transportation is optimized to limit cost while enhancing customer service with consistent delivery schedules. Our approach is to build or acquire geographically distributed production facilities so we can provide our customers with locally grown, lower pesticide and herbicide produce delivered at peak freshness on a year-round basis. We plan to use substantial pre-engineered, pre-fabricated and standardized components when building our modular facilities in order to reduce execution risk for facilities where we build from the ground up. For pre-existing facilities like those acquired with the Pete's Acquisition, we expect to update facilities using our Stack & Flow Technology™. We are working to develop key partnerships with agricultural and equipment vendors to ensure efficient construction. As a result, we believe we can build, scale and commission a facility within 15 months of acquiring the underlying land, which we believe is significantly faster than our competitors. This strategy enables us to reduce the distance of our farms to our customers by more than 50% of the distance that is standard in the industry, mitigate supply chain risk, simplify transportation logistics and reduce food spoilage and waste.
Continue to develop our brand to further our differentiation and customer and consumer loyalty. We believe we are innovating within the living and loose-leaf lettuce and herbs produce category, and we intend to further establish our Local Bounti and Pete's branded line of products as synonymous with fresh, delicious, locally and sustainably grown food. We plan to develop and foster these brand associations to accelerate customer adoption, increase brand loyalty and gain greater share of customer grocery spend. As an early CEA mover in our markets, we believe we are capturing customer mind share for locally sourced produce through our quality products, lively packaging, and marketing initiatives. We actively market our brand in partnership with our retailers through retail activation strategies, including in-store displays, circular advertisements, point-of-purchase signage, and promotions. We intend to continue to support the customer experience via media strategies—both traditional and digital media—supported by our local-minded approach we will geo-target consumers serving up messaging and awareness at every touchpoint. This will further strengthen brand awareness and loyalty. We believe that our attractive and recyclable packaging will also contribute to the success of our products and we intend to invest in developing even more appealing and sustainable packaging over time. We believe that strategic branding and marketing efforts will be critical to growing our market presence, expanding within our customers as we grow our product line, and building consumer loyalty.
Expand our product line. Utilizing our advanced design and technology features, including strategic partitioning and environment control technology, we intend to leverage our proven ability to efficiently accommodate greater product diversity at our facilities. We believe our differentiated hybrid technology will yield greater product diversity over a reduced footprint. At the end of 2022, we offered 25 SKUs across living and loose-leaf lettuce, under both organic and conventional growing methods. In addition, we also added multiple value add product lines to our SKU assortment, including two chef-inspired grab-and-go salad kits, and a heat and eat Asian chicken lettuce wrap meal kit. We expect to continue to target new SKUs that incorporate spinach, kale, and arugula, which continue to grow in popularity in American households. We believe our differentiated branded offering will enable us to capture greater shelf space and in- store real estate at our retailers as we expand our product line, which will in turn expand our consumer visibility.
Continue to develop and diversify our sales channels and geographies. We intend to expand our sales channels where we can enhance our brand and maximize the efficiency of our distribution. We focus on the retail channel and complement our distribution with foodservice. In the future, we seek to co-locate with nationally recognized distributors in order to leverage their existing distribution networks and thereby decrease further the carbon footprint by not adding additional distribution, and we are currently evaluating implementation of this strategy through our existing distribution network. We believe that our leading technology and brand will enable licensing and franchising opportunities to other indoor agriculture operators, with minimal capital investment from us. Lastly, global regions with geographic constraints to traditional agriculture, such as the Middle East and parts of Asia have expressed 
interest in expanding CEA capabilities and represent potential significant opportunities for us to monetize our technology and expertise through international expansion, should we decide to expand into those markets.
Continue to invest in research and development and develop genetics and advanced technology. We believe further investment in research and development, advanced technology, and automation is critical to our plan to expand margins and increase SKU diversity in the future. Investment in plant science can enable greater yield optimization, creating plants that are bred for optimal growth in facility environments. Plant science and breeding for optimal growth does not mean our plants are genetically modified, but rather they are purposefully grown under specific conditions using innovative farming techniques. Additionally, we are developing our own, control center technology suite that enables remote, centralized control for data-driven environmental control and research and development. Currently this control center technology allows us to manage our Montana Facility efficiently with high data generation and capture. Over time, we plan to build substantial efficiency and research and development through this control center technology, including centralized control to optimize grower resources, data modeling and tracking, and development of crop growth algorithms that can be rapidly tested and rolled out across our fleet of facilities.
Leverage our industry leading focus on sustainability. We believe that the CEA space is inherently sustainable. Many of our competitors do not have the commitment to an aggressively transparent process, disclosing the good and bad. Local Bounti is committed to improving our business using the benefits of a consistent, business wide focus on our stakeholders (employees, consumers, customers, communities and investors) and their growing interest in how our actions and products impact them. Our sustainability efforts are already generating tremendous business value with employee engagement, community commitment and reduction of valuable process inputs. See "Local Bounti Sustainability Plan" below for further information on our Sustainability Program.
Product shelf-life tests have demonstrated our product lasts longer than competing offerings. We believe our unique technology and process provides customers with longer lasting freshness, higher nutritional content, and less bacteria, mold and yeast due to our controlled indoor environment. We have performed product shelf-life tests which demonstrated that our loose-leaf lettuce lasts longer in the consumer's refrigerator (assuming purchased on the day of delivery to the purchase point) than one of our organic loose-leaf lettuce competitors. Research reports attribute much of this shelf-life extension to the reduced bacteria, mildew and mold achieved using CEA production, as compared to traditionally grown products (even post-harvest washed).
ESG and Sustainability
Conventional agriculture has been feeding the world for hundreds of years, yet, given the negative impacts of climate change, it is now struggling to keep pace. Add to that the COVID–19 pandemic, the war in Ukraine, and its impact on not only food supply but also the cost of fertilizer and other inputs used in traditional agriculture, an already stressed food supply system is experiencing even more pressure. Sustainability has emerged as a global imperative, and, when it comes to agriculture, it is clear we must find ways to do better. We believe growing healthy vegetables is good business, and our growing technology delivers clean produce with safer growing methods, which we believe benefits all stakeholders and differentiates us from traditional agriculture. We expect that consumer demand for clean, nutritious, locally grown, and high-quality products will increase over time.
Our compact, efficient, and local farms provide fresh produce with minimum transportation distances. Combined with our advanced technologies and the location of our facilities in less developed communities and areas with available supporting resources such as adequate water and renewable energy, we believe Local Bounti has the potential to be among the most sustainable produce suppliers in the nation. 
We have developed a sustainability program that we believe is aligned with ESG best practices in the CEA space. We disclose our impacts in our annual sustainability reports (using the Global Reporting Initiative ("GRI") and Sustainability Accounting Standards Board ("SASB") frameworks) and other disclosures including CDP and the UN Global Compact. 
More information on our key ESG programs, goals, commitments, and metrics can be found in our most recent sustainability report, which is available on our website. Information contained on our website or connected thereto does not constitute part of, and is not incorporated by reference into, this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
While we believe our ESG goals align with our long-term growth strategy and financial and operational priorities, they are aspirational and may change, and there is no guarantee or promise that they will be met.
Environment: We are committed to minimizing our impact on the environment. In December 2022, our Board approved a new Environmental Policy, which documents our policies relating to the environment, including the following:
•Water Stewardship: We are committed to monitoring, reducing, and reusing water resources.
•Climate Protection: We are committed to adopting a science-based target (SBT) in 2023 and being carbon neutral by 2050.
•Sustainable Packaging: We are committed to exceeding 30% post-consumer or bio-based content in our packaging by 2025.
•Sustainable Sourcing: Our Board has approved a Supplier Code of Conduct, which address the standards of business conduct we expect from our suppliers. 
The value of local CEA facilities extends beyond our environmental goals. The short transport distances to our customers reduce food miles and transportation emissions. Delivering fresher and higher quality product reduces food waste in the supply chain and lowers consumer food waste. Additionally, we use significantly less pesticides, and our indoor facilities have zero high nutrient water runoff, which is common in traditional agriculture. We currently use recycled polyethylene terephthalate ("rPET") for some of our packaging.
Social – Employees: Being local and producing year-round not only allows for competitive produce prices and the opportunity for more consumers to access high quality produce, it also allows our facilities to offer full time, indoor jobs to members of the community, offsetting the seasonal work offered by more traditional agriculture businesses. We are also committed to paying a living wage, hiring locally, and promoting internally by investing in internal and community training programs. All employees receive benefits on their first day of work. To keep up with the evolving market, we survey all employees quarterly regarding various aspects of their employment experience.
Social – Community: We prioritize under-served communities where our facilities are located and as a corporation are and will continue donating produce to our communities. These investments are more impactful and provide better economic and social results in these underserved areas. These investments are supported by large on-going local purchases and significant employment. We will continue to consider underserved communities in our future site selection process as well.
Governance: Local Bounti sees ESG as a competitive advantage and strives to be fully supportive of these endeavors at all levels of the Company. This alignment and focus will aid us in steering our long-term corporate actions in the right direction. 
Climate-Related Issues: Local Bounti contributes to carbon dioxide emissions predominantly due to the use of fuel combustion and electrical consumption. Additional emissions come from processing products to be ready for human consumption, including cleaning, packaging, and on-site storage. Each of these activities generates waste. Traditional leafy produce has its largest carbon dioxide emission during the distribution process. Local Bounti, with its dispersed farming model, dramatically reduces the carbon impacts of the distribution process, although we are not yet able to fully eliminate the carbon footprint from distribution. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of our Board of Directors is responsible for reviewing, evaluating, and making recommendations to the Board of Directors regarding our programs, policies and practices relating to ESG issues and impact to support the sustainable growth of our businesses. The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee periodically reviews our carbon and water data and provides oversite for climate-related risks and opportunities to operations.
In 2022 the company launched its work to identify and assess climate-related risks and opportunities. A series of conversations across all aspects of the business occurred as the company identified short-term (0-24 months), Medium Term (2-10 years), and Long Term (10+ years) impacts that have a substantive financial or strategic impact on the business. Four primary climate-related issues have been identified, as described below: 
•Weather: We see the increase in more extreme weather patterns as primarily an opportunity for CEA businesses as field-based leafy production becomes less dependable. We have seen early indications from customers that there is an increasing demand for our products, as they provide consistent quaintly and quality despite weather variations. We expect this opportunity to expand as extreme weather patterns increase in the medium term. 
•Water: We see the water shortages experienced in the western United States as an issue that will have impacts starting in the short term. We employ production techniques that allow for a 90% reduction in water usage compared to field-based production. We are actively investigating additional water-saving measures while conducting ongoing water-use monitoring. 
•Energy: We experience energy price fluctuations as we consumes electricity and gas. We have a diversified energy portfolio and plan to continue developing redundancies at operational locations to help mitigate the impacts of price increases. We are actively investigating additional energy-conserving measures while conducting ongoing energy use monitoring.
•Supply Chain: We rely on suppliers for key elements of operations. Disruptions in the supply chain due to climate-related issues pose a risk. We strive to mitigate this risk by keeping adequate supply on hand. Additionally, we have multiple suppliers for key elements of operation to provide flexibility if there is a disruption. 
Please refer to Item 1A, Risk Factors, for further discussion regarding climate-related risks.
Competition
Local Bounti's competition includes greenhouse operators and other CEA operators such as vertical farming operators. Greenhouse operators grow crops within a sheltered structure on a horizontal plane, while vertical farming operators grow crops in vertically stacked layers indoors.
There are over 9,000 greenhouses in the United States according to the United States Census of Agriculture in 2017, an increase of 115% from seven years earlier. However, 90% of these farms are small—less than 8,000 square feet in area. Large-scale greenhouse operators have the largest market position and own and operate hundreds to thousands of acres of greenhouse. Most of the companies have the major portions of their operations in Mexico and Canada, but all are either looking to develop, are developing, or have already developed U.S.-based high-tech greenhouses. These companies include Mastronardi Produce Ltd. and Pure Flavour.
We potentially compete with traditional greenhouse producers, as well as CEA companies using high technology greenhouses such as AppHarvest, Bright Farms, and Revol Greens. We also potentially compete against vertical farming operators, including AeroFarms, Bowery Farming, and Plenty.
We believe that our Stack & Flow Technology™, modular and distributed approach, and local branded product diversity provide competitive advantages over our peers as the mainstream facility formats in CEA present a challenging trade-off between yield and operating/capital costs. Each method, independently, brings key challenges, including (a) inability to maximize revenue without consistent yield; (b) poor profitability with high costs; (c) limited retail relationships and lack of product diversity; and (d) inability to scale quickly and effectively. Local Bounti leverages a hybrid of vertical and greenhouse growing formats, which efficiently unites the best aspects of both technologies, resulting in increased volumes and year-round production. In addition, this model results in 1.5 to 2.0 times the yield of comparable greenhouse farms.
Government Regulation
Local Bounti is subject to laws and regulations administered by various federal, state and local government agencies in the United States, such as the United States Food and Drug Administration ("FDA"), the Federal Trade Commission ("FTC"), the Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA"), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration ("OSHA") and the USDA. These laws and regulations apply to the production, packaging, distribution, sale, marketing, labeling, quality, safety and transportation of our products, as well as occupational safety and health practices.
Under various federal statutes and implementing regulations, these agencies, among other things, prescribe the requirements and establish the standards for quality and safety and regulate our products and the production, labeling, marketing, promotion and advertising thereof.
Among other things, the farms in which our products are grown and packed must comply with regulatory requirements including Standards for the Growing, Harvesting, Packing and Holding of Produce for Human Consumption (the "Produce Safety Rule"). Local Bounti may be required to register with the FDA (depending on specific processing operations), in which case Local Bounti would have to comply with Current Good Manufacturing Practice, Hazard Analysis, and Risk-Based Preventive Controls for Human Food (the "Preventive Controls Rule"), as applicable. The farms also have to comply with FDA and USDA labeling and marketing requirements, and could be subject to the Organic Food Production Act, among other laws and regulations implemented by the FDA the USDA and other regulators. Certain FSMA regulations are still being developed and implemented, including recently adopted product traceability requirements, which would be directly applicable to our products. The FDA and the USDA have the authority to inspect our farms depending on the type of product and operations involved. The FDA and the USDA also require that certain information appear on our product labels and, more generally, that our labels and labeling be truthful and non-misleading. Similarly, the FTC requires that Local Bounti's marketing and advertising be truthful, non-misleading, not deceptive to consumers and not otherwise an unfair means of competition. Local Bounti is also restricted by the FDA and the USDA from making certain types of claims about our products, including nutrient content claims, health claims, organic claims and claims regarding the effects of our products on any structure or function of the body, whether express or implied, unless Local Bounti satisfies certain regulatory requirements.
Local Bounti is also subject to state and local food safety regulation, including registration and licensing requirements for our farms, enforcement of standards for our products and farms by state and local health agencies and regulation of our trade practices in connection with selling our products.
Local Bounti is also subject to labor and employment laws, laws governing advertising, privacy laws, safety regulations and other laws, including consumer protection regulations that regulate retailers or govern the promotion and sale of merchandise.
