DESCRIPTION OF OUR BUSINESS

We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on January 20, 2021. Our principal office address is located at Calle Principal 54, Munoz, Puerto Plata, Dominican Republic. Our telephone number is 346-308-4967. We are in the business of selling auto parts that we purchase in the United States to customers in the Dominican Republic. We keep a small inventory of auto parts. Our goal is to maintain a 30 day turn around period for all inventory . We plan to develop a website that will display a variety of auto parts and their prices, and will advertise our services and fees. 
Our customers will be able to select auto parts on our website according to their budget and preferences. Our customers are also able to order auto parts which are not displayed on our website by specifying the make, model and year. When we do not have the auto parts that our client wants, we will search for it. 

We offer our auto parts at price marked-up from 15% to 25% of our cost. Our customers are asked to pay us the full price in advance. There is no guarantee that our customer will pay the full purchase price in advance. In some cases, we ask for lower advance payments and the remainder during 7 days after the auto parts are delivered. Also, there is no guarantee that we will receive desired commission payment and may have to lower our prices of auto parts, resulting in diminished profits or losses. When we do not take prepayment and buy auto parts at our own expense, there a chance that we do not sell them for an extended period of time or never at all, which will result in loss of revenue and disruption of our business.
