ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
Unless the context otherwise requires, references in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to “Natural Gas Services Group,” the “Company”, "NGS", “we,” “us,” “our” or “ours” refer to Natural Gas Services Group, Inc.  Certain specialized terms used in describing our natural gas compressor business are defined in "Glossary of Industry Terms" on page i.
Smaller Reporting Company
We are a “smaller reporting company” as defined by the SEC. As such, we are eligible to comply with the scaled disclosure requirements in several Regulation S-K and Regulation S-X items. Our disclosures in this Annual Report reflect many of these scaled requirements.
The Company
We are a provider of natural gas compression equipment and services to the energy industry. We manufacture, fabricate, rent, sell and maintain natural gas compressors and flare systems for oil and natural gas production and plant facilities. We are headquartered in Midland, Texas, with fabrication facilities located in Tulsa, Oklahoma and Midland, Texas, and service facilities located in major oil and natural gas producing basins in the U.S.
We have shifted our focus over the last several years to medium to large horsepower applications that apply to natural gas associated with oil-weighted production. Our primary customers are exploration and production companies that utilize our compressor units for artificial lift applications, i.e., production enhancement enabled with high-pressure gas compression equipment, on unconventional oil wells on single and multi-well pads. In addition, our customer base includes oil and natural gas exploration and production ("E&P") companies that are focused on natural gas-weighted production (with typically smaller horsepower applications) as well as midstream companies. The Company's largest rental area is the Permian Basin (approximately 55.6% of rental revenues in 2022), with the majority of its remaining rental revenue being generated in other oil and natural gas producing regions and plays in Texas, New Mexico and Oklahoma, including the San Juan Basin, the Texas Panhandle/western Oklahoma, the Barnett Shale, and central Oklahoma. Other regions and plays in which we provide service include the Utica and Marcellus Shales, Michigan and the DJ Basin of Colorado. 
Our revenue increased 17.1% to $84.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 from $72.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. This increase was largely the result of our rental revenues increasing 17.0% to $74.5 million in 2022 from $63.6 million in 2021 as well as sales revenue increasing 24.5% to $8.6 million in 2022 from $6.9 million in 2021. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company reported a net loss of $0.6 million as compared to a net loss of $9.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. In addition, the Company's adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA") increased 55.8% to $29.2 million in 2022 from $18.7 million in 2021. See "Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" for a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to its closest GAAP financial measure, net (loss) income.
At December 31, 2022, our current assets were $54.1 million, which included $3.4 million of cash and cash equivalents.  Current liabilities were $30.4 million at year end 2022. Our stockholders' equity as of December 31, 2022 was $230.1 million.
Please see "Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" for further information.
Our Operating Units
We identify our operating units based upon major revenue sources as Rental, Sales and Service and Maintenance.  
Rental.  Our rental compression units provide small, medium and large horsepower applications for unconventional oil and natural gas production. Our rental contracts typically provide for initial terms of six to 24 months, with our larger horsepower units having contract terms of up to 60 months. By outsourcing their compression needs, we believe our customers are able to increase their revenues by producing higher volumes of oil and natural gas due to greater equipment run time. Outsourcing allows our customers to reduce their compressor downtime, operating and maintenance costs, and capital investments, and more efficiently meet their changing compression needs. We maintain and service all of the compression equipment we rent to our customers.  
The size, type and geographic diversity of our rental fleet enables us to provide our customers with a range of compression units that can serve a wide variety of applications, and to select the correct equipment for the job, rather than the customer trying to fit the job to its own equipment. We base our gas compressor rental rates on several factors, including the cost and size of the equipment, the type and complexity of service desired by the customer, the length of contract and the inclusion of any other services desired, such as installation, transportation and daily operation.
As of December 31, 2022, we had 1,869 natural gas compressors in our rental fleet totaling 425,340 horsepower.  Of this total, we had 1,221 natural gas compressors totaling 318,350 horsepower rented to 81 customers. The utilization rate of our rental fleet as of December 31, 2022 was 65.3%, while our horsepower utilization for the same period was 74.8%. We added 45 units with approximately 33,000 horsepower to our fleet during 2022. Thirty-five of those units were 400 horsepower or larger, representing approximately 80% of the horsepower added.
Engineered Equipment Sales.  This operating unit includes the following components:
•Compressor fabrication.  Fabrication involves the design, fabrication and assembly of compressor components manufactured by us or other vendors into compressor units that are ready for rental or sale. In addition to fabricating compressors for our rental fleet, we engineer and fabricate custom-made natural gas compressors for sale to customers to meet their specifications based on well pressure, production characteristics and the particular applications for which compression is sought. Fabricated compressors comprised 42.0% and 27.5% of our sales revenue during 2022 and 2021, respectively.
•Parts sales and compressor rebuilds.  To provide customer support for our compressor and flare sales businesses, we stock varying levels of replacement parts at our Midland, Texas facility and at field service locations. We also provide an exchange and rebuild program for small horsepower screw compressors and maintain an inventory of new and used compressors to facilitate this part of our business. Parts sales and compressor rebuilds comprised 55.2% and 67.2% of our sales revenue during 2022 and 2021, respectively.
•Flare fabrication.  We design, fabricate, sell, install and service flare stacks and related ignition and control devices for the onshore and offshore incineration of gas compounds such as hydrogen sulfide, carbon dioxide, natural gas and liquefied petroleum gases.  Applications for this equipment are often environmentally and regulatory driven.
•Compressor manufacturing.  We design and manufacture our own proprietary line of reciprocating natural gas compressor frames, cylinders and parts known as our “CiP”, or Cylinder-in-Plane, product line. We use the finished components to fabricate compressor units for our rental fleet or for sale to customers.  We also sell finished components to other fabricators.
Service and Maintenance.  We service and maintain compressors owned by our customers on an “as needed” and contract basis. Natural gas compressors require routine maintenance and periodic refurbishing to prolong their useful life.  Routine maintenance includes physical and visual inspections and other parametric checks that indicate a change in the condition of the compressors.  We perform engine and compressor overhauls on a condition-based interval or a time-based schedule or at the customer's request. Based on our past experience, these maintenance procedures maximize component life and unit availability and minimize downtime.
Business Strategy
Our long-term intentions to grow our revenue and profitability are based on the following business strategies:
•Expand rental fleet.  We intend to prudently increase the size of our medium and large horsepower rental fleet by fabricating compressor units in numbers that correspond to pre-contracted agreements with our customers and to market share gains we seek to achieve. We believe our future growth will be primarily driven through our placement of larger horsepower, centralized wellhead natural gas compressors for unconventional oil production, with select fabrication of medium horsepower compressors to meet customer demand beyond our inventory.
•Geographic expansion.  We will continue to expand our operations in existing areas, as well as pursue focused expansion into new geographic regions as opportunities are identified. Our largest rental area is the Permian Basin (approximately 55.6% of rental revenues in 2022), where we have continued to gain market share and believe we have the most expansion opportunities going forward. The large majority of the Company's remaining rental revenue is being generated in other oil and natural gas producing regions and plays in Texas, New Mexico and Oklahoma, 
including the San Juan Basin, the Texas Panhandle/western Oklahoma, the Barnett Shale, and central Oklahoma. Other regions and plays in which we provide service include the Utica and Marcellus Shales, Michigan and the DJ Basin of Colorado.  
•Selectively pursue acquisitions.  We will continue to evaluate potential acquisitions, joint ventures and other opportunities that could enhance our current market position, but only those that provide compelling returns to the Company.
All of the above strategies are subject to revisions and adjustments as a result of several factors discussed in Item 1A, Risk Factors.
Competitive Strengths
We believe our competitive strengths include:
•Superior customer service.  Our availability to provide a broad range of compressors has enabled us to effectively meet the evolving needs of our customers. We believe this ability, coupled with our personalized services and in-depth knowledge of our customers’ operating needs and growth plans, have allowed us to enhance our relationships with existing customers as well as attract new customers.  The size, type and geographic diversity of our rental fleet enable us to provide customers with a range of compression units that can serve a wide variety of applications.  We are able to select the correct equipment for the job, rather than the customer trying to fit its application to our equipment.
•Diversified product line.  Our compressors are available as low pressure rotary screw and higher pressure reciprocating packages.  They are designed to meet a number of applications, including compression assisted gas lift on oil wells, wellhead compression on natural gas wells, natural gas gathering and transmission, and others. In addition, our compressors can be built to handle a variety of gas mixtures, including air, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, hydrogen sulfide and hydrocarbon gases. A diversified compression product line helps us compete by being able to satisfy widely varying pressure, volume and production conditions that customers encounter. 
•Purpose-built rental compressors.  Our rental compressor packages have been designed and built to address the primary requirements of our customers in the producing regions in which we operate.  Our units are purpose-built but standardized, as the units are compact in design and are easy, quick and inexpensive to move, install and start-up.  Our control systems are technically advanced, as these systems allow the operator to monitor as well as start and stop the majority of our units remotely and/or in accordance with well conditions.
•Experienced management and operating team.  On average, our executive and operating team members have over 25 years of oilfield services and other energy industry experience. We believe our management and operating team has successfully demonstrated its ability to grow our business during times of expansion and to manage through downturns.
•Broad geographic presence.  We presently provide our products and services to a customer base of oil and natural gas exploration and production companies operating in Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Ohio, Michigan, Colorado and Wyoming.  Our footprint allows us to service many of the largest oil and natural gas producing regions in the United States.  We believe that operating in diverse geographic regions allows us better utilization of our compressors, minimal incremental expenses, operating synergies, volume-based purchasing, leveraged inventories and cross-trained personnel. 
•Long-standing customer relationships.  We have developed long-standing relationships providing compression equipment to many major and independent oil and natural gas companies.  Our customers generally continue to rent our compressors after the expiration of the initial terms of our rental agreements, which we believe reflects their satisfaction with the reliability and performance of our services and products.
Overview and Outlook
The market for compression equipment and services is dependent on the condition of the oil and natural gas industry, including the capital expenditure budgets of domestic oil and gas companies. The level of activity and capital expenditures has generally been dependent upon the prevailing view of future gas and oil prices, which are influenced by numerous supply and demand factors, including availability and cost of capital, well productivity and development costs, global and domestic economic conditions, environmental regulations, policies of OPEC countries and Russia, and other factors. In addition, while overall capital budgets of E&P companies have increased relative to 2021, overall capital expenditure budgets of energy companies have become significantly more constrained over the last several years due to the deterioration of energy equity markets and strong demands from institutional investors that companies keep capital spending within operating cash flow and 
return capital through dividends and share repurchases. While our rental agreements are not typically capital in nature, overall capital investment typically drives our customers demand for incremental compression needs. Oil and natural gas prices and the level of development and production activity have historically been characterized by significant volatility. 
Finally, due to supply chain disruptions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russian invasion of the Ukraine and the increased rate of inflation, we continue to experience cost increases and sporadic unavailability of many of our parts needed to fabricate and maintain our rental fleet. While we have a robust supplier network, pricing pressure from our customers and competitors presents challenges in increasing our rental rates to offset these increased costs. We believe our relationship with our major customer identified below continues to be strong, and it has continued to pay our invoices in a timely, consistent manner. Nevertheless, if any of these circumstances change, our business could be adversely affected. Please read Item 1A, Risk Factors, in this report. 
Major Customer

Sales and rental income to Occidental Permian, LTD. ("Oxy") for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 amounted to 42% and 40% of our revenue, respectively. No other single customer accounted for more than 10% of our revenues in 2022 or 2021. 
Oxy amounted to 55% of our accounts receivable as of December 31, 2022 and 46% of our accounts receivable as of December 31, 2021. No other customers amounted to more than 10% of our accounts receivable as of December 31, 2022 or 2021. The loss of this key customer would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, depending upon the demand for our compressors at the time of such loss and our ability to attract new customers.
Sales and Marketing
Our sales force pursues the rental and sales market for compressors and flare equipment and other services in their respective territories. Additionally, our personnel coordinate with each other to develop relationships with customers who operate in multiple regions. Our sales and marketing strategy is focused on communication with current customers and potential customers through frequent direct contact, technical assistance, print literature, direct mail and referrals. Our sales and marketing personnel coordinate with our operations personnel in order to promptly respond to and address customer needs.  Our overall sales and marketing efforts concentrate on demonstrating our commitment to enhancing the customer’s cash flow through enhanced product design, fabrication, manufacturing, installation, operations, customer service and support.
Competition
We have a number of competitors in the natural gas compression segment, some of which have greater financial resources. We believe that we compete effectively on the basis of price, customer service, including the ability to place personnel in remote locations, flexibility in meeting customer needs, and quality and reliability of our compressors and related services.
Compressor industry participants can achieve significant advantages through increased size and geographic breadth. As the number of rental compressors in our rental fleet increases, the number of sales, support, and maintenance personnel required and the minimum level of inventory do not increase proportionately.
Backlog
As of December 31, 2022, we had no sales backlog compared to $1.5 million as of December 31, 2021. Sales backlog consists of firm customer orders for which a purchase or work order has been received, satisfactory credit or a financing arrangement exists, and delivery is scheduled. In addition, the major components of our compressors are acquired from suppliers through periodic purchase orders that currently require three to six months of lead time prior to delivery of the order.
Employees
As of December 31, 2022, we had 266 total employees, none of which are represented by a labor union. We believe we have good relations with our employees.
Liability and Other Insurance Coverage
Our equipment and services are provided to customers who are subject to hazards inherent in the oil and natural gas industry, such as explosions, fires, and oil spills. We maintain liability insurance that we believe is customary in the industry and which includes environmental cleanup, but excludes product warranty insurance because the majority of components on our compressor unit are covered by the manufacturers. We also maintain insurance with respect to our facilities. Based on our historical experience, we believe that our insurance coverage is adequate. However, there is a risk that our insurance may not be sufficient to cover any particular loss or that insurance may not cover all losses. In addition, insurance rates have in the past been subject to wide fluctuation, and changes in coverage could result in less coverage, increases in cost or higher deductibles and retentions.
Government Regulation
All of our operations and facilities are subject to numerous federal, state, foreign and local laws, rules and regulations related to various aspects of our business, including containment and disposal of hazardous materials, water quality and wastewater discharges, oilfield waste and other waste materials and protection of human health.
To date, we have not been required to expend significant resources in order to satisfy applicable environmental laws and regulations. We do not anticipate any material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities or extraordinary expenditures to comply with environmental rules and regulations in the foreseeable future. However, compliance costs under existing laws or under any new requirements could become material and we could incur liabilities for noncompliance. And as noted below, we may be indirectly affected by environmental laws that affect our customers.
Our business is generally affected by political developments and by federal, state, foreign and local laws and regulations, which relate to the oil and natural gas industry. The adoption of laws and regulations affecting the oil and natural gas industry for economic, environmental and other policy reasons could increase our costs and could have an adverse effect on our operations. The state and federal environmental laws and regulations that currently apply to our operations could become more stringent in the future.
We have utilized operating and disposal practices that were or are currently standard in the industry. However, materials such as solvents, thinner, waste paint, waste oil, wash down waters and sandblast material may have been disposed of or released in or under properties currently or formerly owned or operated by us or our predecessors. In addition, some of these properties have been operated by third parties over whom we have no control either as to such entities' treatment of materials or the manner in which such materials may have been disposed of or released.
The federal Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, commonly known as CERCLA, and comparable state statutes impose strict liability on:
•owners and operators of sites, and
•persons who disposed of or arranged for the disposal of "hazardous substances" found at sites.
The modification of existing laws or regulations or the adoption of new laws or regulations that result in the curtailment of exploratory or developmental drilling for oil and gas could materially and adversely affect our operations by discouraging our customers from drilling for hydrocarbons, disrupting revenue through permitting or similar delays. For example, on January 20, 2021, the Acting Secretary for the Department of the Interior signed an order effectively suspending new fossil fuel leasing and permitting on federal lands, including in the US Gulf of Mexico, for 60 days. Then on January 27, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order indefinitely suspending new oil and natural gas leases on public lands or in offshore waters pending completion of a comprehensive review and reconsideration of federal oil and gas permitting and leasing practices. Demand for our compression products and services could be diminished in connection with these initiatives. Further, to the extent that the review results in the development of additional restrictions on exploration and drilling, limitations on the availability of leases, or restrictions on the ability to obtain required permits, it could have a material adverse impact on our operations by reducing our customers’ compression needs and the demand for our services.
Further, as discussed below under the heading "Climate Change", President Biden has announced that he intends to take aggressive action to address climate-related issues and to set the United States on a path to be carbon-neutral by 2050.
Waste Management and Disposal

The federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act ("RCRA") and analogous state laws and their implementing regulations govern the generation, transportation, treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous solid wastes. During the course of our operations, we generate wastes (including, but not limited to, used oil, antifreeze, filters, paints and solvents) in quantities regulated under RCRA. The EPA and various state agencies have limited the approved methods of disposal for these types of wastes. CERCLA and analogous state laws and their implementing regulations impose strict, and under certain conditions, joint and several liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. These persons include current and past owners and operators of the facility or disposal site where the release occurred and any company that transported, disposed of, or arranged for the transport or disposal of the hazardous substances released at the site. Under CERCLA, such persons may be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies. In addition, where contamination may be present, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury, property damage and recovery of response costs allegedly caused by hazardous substances or other pollutants released into the environment.

We currently own or lease, and in the past have owned or leased, a number of properties that have been used in support of our operations for a number of years. Although we have utilized operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time, hydrocarbons, hazardous substances, or other regulated wastes may have been disposed of or released on or under the properties owned or leased by us or on or under other locations where such materials have been taken for disposal by companies sub-contracted by us. In addition, some of these properties may have been previously owned or operated by third parties whose treatment and disposal or release of hydrocarbons, hazardous substances or other regulated wastes was not under our control. These properties and the materials released or disposed thereon may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws. Under such laws, we could be required to remove or remediate historical property contamination, or to perform certain operations to prevent future contamination. We are not currently under any order requiring that we undertake or pay for any cleanup activities. However, we cannot provide any assurance that we will not receive any such order in the future.

The Clean Water Act ("CWA") and the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 and implementing regulations govern:
•the prevention of discharges, including oil and produced water spills, and
•liability for drainage into waters.
The CWA and analogous state laws impose restrictions and strict controls with respect to the discharge of pollutants, including spills and leaks of oil and other substances, into waters of the United States. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters and wetlands is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA or an analogous state agency. The CWA also requires the development and implementation of spill prevention, control and countermeasures to help prevent the contamination of navigable waters in the event of a petroleum hydrocarbon spill or leak at hydrocarbon facilities. In addition, the CWA and analogous state laws require individual permits or coverage under general permits for discharges of storm water runoff from certain types of facilities. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties as well as other enforcement mechanisms for non-compliance with discharge permits or other requirements of the CWA and analogous state laws and regulations. Our compression operations do not generate process wastewaters that are discharged to waters of the U.S. However, the operations of our customers may generate such wastewaters subject to the CWA. While it is the responsibility of our customers to follow CWA regulations and obtain proper permits, violations of the CWA may indirectly impact our operations in a negative manner.
Safe Drinking Water Act. Some of our customers’ natural gas production is developed from unconventional sources that require hydraulic fracturing as part of the completion process. Legislation to amend the Safe Drinking Water Act (“SDWA”) to repeal the exemption for hydraulic fracturing from the definition of “underground injection” and require federal permitting and regulatory control of hydraulic fracturing, as well as legislative proposals to require disclosure of the chemical constituents of the fluids used in the fracturing process, have been proposed from time to time and the federal government continues to consider legislation to amend the SDWA. Some states have also proposed or adopted legislative or regulatory restrictions on hydraulic fracturing, including prohibitions on the practice. We cannot predict the future of such legislation and what additional, if any, provisions would be included. Additional levels of regulation or interpretation are adopted at the federal or state level could lead to increased operating costs and prohibitions or curtailment of current hydraulic practices could reduce demand for our compression services, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.
Air Emissions
Our operations are also subject to federal, state, and local regulations. The Clean Air Act and implementing regulations and comparable state laws and regulations regulate emissions of air pollutants from various industrial sources and also impose various monitoring and reporting requirements, including requirements related to emissions from certain stationary engines, such as those on our compressor units. These laws and regulations impose limits on the levels of various substances that may be emitted into the atmosphere from our compressor units and require us to meet more stringent air emission standards and install new emission control equipment on all of our engines built after July 1, 2008. 
For instance, in 2010, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) published new regulations under the CAA to control emissions of hazardous air pollutants from existing stationary reciprocal internal combustion engines. In 2012, the EPA proposed amendments to the final rule in response to several petitions for reconsideration, which were finalized and became effective in 2013. The rule requires us to undertake certain expenditures and activities, including purchasing and installing emissions control equipment on certain compressor engines and/or purchasing certified engines from complaint manufacturers.

In recent years, the EPA has lowered the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (“NAAQs”) for several air pollutants. For example, in 2013, the EPA lowered the annual standard for fine particulate matter from 15 to 12 micrograms per cubic meter. In 2015, the EPA published the final rule strengthening the standards for ground level ozone, and the states are expected to establish revised attainment/non-attainment regions. State implementation of the revised NAAQS could result in stricter permitting requirements, delay or prohibit our customers’ ability to obtain such permits, and result in increased expenditures for pollution control equipment, which could negatively impact our customers’ operations by increasing the cost of additions to equipment, and negatively impact our business.

In 2012, the EPA finalized rules that establish new air emission controls for oil and natural gas production and natural gas processing operations. Specifically, the EPA’s rule package included New Source Performance Standards to address emissions of sulfur dioxide and volatile organic compounds (“VOCs”) and a separate set of emission standards to address hazardous air pollutants frequently associated with oil and natural gas production and processing activities. The rules established specific new requirements regarding emissions from compressors and controls at natural gas processing plants, dehydrators, storage tanks and other production equipment as well as the first federal air standards for natural gas wells that are hydraulically fractured. The EPA has taken a number of steps to amend or expand on these regulations since 2012. For example, in June 2016, the EPA published New Source Performance Standards that require certain new, modified or reconstructed facilities in the oil and natural gas sector to reduce methane gas and VOC emissions. These standards expanded the 2012 standards by using certain equipment-specific emissions control practices, requiring additional controls for pneumatic controllers and pumps as well as compressors, and imposing leak detection and repair requirements for natural gas compressor and booster stations. In addition, in November 2021, the EPA proposed a rule to further reduce methane and VOC emissions from new and existing sources in the oil and gas sector. These standards, as well as any future laws and their implementing regulations, may impose stringent air permit requirements, or mandate the use of specific equipment or technologies to control emissions. We cannot predict the final regulatory requirements or the cost to comply with such requirements with any certainty.
We are also subject to air regulation at the state level. For example, sources of air emissions within Texas are controlled by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (“TCEQ”). Air emission sources that emit at greater than de minimis levels must obtain a permit prior to operation through the TCEQ. In addition, TCEQ has implemented revisions to certain air permit programs that significantly increase the air permitting requirements for new and certain existing oil and gas production and gathering sites for a number of counties in the Barnett Shale production area that established new emissions standards for engines, which impact the operation of specific categories of engines by requiring the use of alternative engines, compressor packages or the installation of aftermarket emissions control equipment. Expansion by the TCEQ of this type of program and the adoption of similar regulations in other states may increase our compliance costs.
Climate Change
In response to findings that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other Greenhouse Gases (“GHG”) endanger public health and the environment, federal legislation has been drafted in Congress to reduce GHG emissions. At the federal level, the government could seek to pursue legislative, regulatory or executive initiatives that may impose significant restrictions on fossil-fuel exploration and production and use such as limitations or bans on hydraulic fracturing of oil and gas wells, bans or restrictions on new leases for production of minerals on federal properties, and imposing restrictive requirements on new pipeline infrastructure or fossil-fuel export facilities. Other energy legislation and initiatives could include a carbon tax, methane fee or cap and trade program. At the state level, many states, including the states in which we or our customers conduct operations, have adopted legal requirements that have imposed new or more stringent permitting, disclosure or well construction requirements on oil and gas activities. Further, although Congress has not passed such legislation, almost half of 
the states have begun to address GHG emissions, primarily through the planned development of emissions inventories or regional GHG cap and trade programs. Depending on the particular program, we could be required to control GHG emissions or to purchase and surrender allowances for GHG emissions resulting from our operations. The EPA has adopted regulations under existing provisions of the CAA that, among other things, establish construction and operating permit reviews for GHG emissions of certain large GHG emissions sources, including petroleum and natural gas facilities, such as natural gas transmission compression facilities that emit 25,000 metric tons or more of carbon dioxide equivalent per year. In addition, the Department of Transportation (the “DOT”) has implemented GHG emissions limits on vehicles manufactured for operation in the United States.
At the international level, there is an agreement, the United Nations-sponsored “Paris Agreement,” for nations to limit their GHG emissions through non-binding, individually-determined reduction goals every five years after 2020. President Biden pledged the renewed participation of the United States on his first day in office. In November 2021, the United States participated in the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, Scotland, United Kingdom that resulted in a pact among approximately 200 countries, including the United States, called the Glasgow Climate Pact. Relatedly, the United States and European Union jointly announced the launch of the “Global Methane Pledge,” which aims to cut global methane pollution at least 30% by 2030 relative to 2020 levels, including “all feasible reductions” in the energy sector. In conjunction with these pacts, the United States committed to an economy-wide target of reducing net greenhouse gas emissions by 50-52 percent below 2005 levels by 2030. Also in November 2021, President Biden signed a $1 trillion dollar infrastructure bill into law. The new infrastructure law includes several climate-focused investments, including upgrades to power grids to accommodate increased use of renewable energy and expansion of electric vehicle infrastructure. Although it is not possible at this time to predict what additional domestic legislation may be adopted in light of the Paris Agreement or the Glasgow Climate Pact, or how legislation or new regulations that may be adopted based on the Paris Agreement or the Glasgow Climate Pact to address GHG emissions would impact our business, any such future laws and regulations imposing reporting obligations on, or limiting emissions of GHGs from, our compressors could require us to incur costs to reduce emissions of GHGs associated with our operations and could decrease demand for oil and natural gas.
Additionally, various states and groups of states have adopted or are considering adopting legislation, regulations or other regulatory initiatives that are focused on such areas as GHG cap and trade programs, carbon taxes, reporting and tracking programs, and restriction of emissions. For example, in 2019, Colorado passed a bill which delegates authority to local governments to regulate oil and gas activities and requires the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission to minimize emissions of methane and other air contaminants. Likewise, the New Mexico Environment Department has adopted regulations to restrict the venting or flaring of methane.
Litigation risks are also increasing, as a number of cities and other local governments have sought to bring suit against the largest oil and natural gas exploration and production companies in state or federal court, alleging, among other things, that such companies created public nuisances by producing fuels that contributed to global warming effects, such as rising sea levels, and therefore are responsible for roadway and infrastructure damages, or alleging that the companies have been aware of the adverse effects of climate change for some time but defrauded their investors by failing to adequately disclose those impacts.
There are also increasing financial risks for fossil fuel producers and oil and gas field service providers (such as the Company) as shareholders currently invested in fossil-fuel energy and related service companies concerned about the potential effects of climate change may elect in the future to shift some or all of their investments into non-energy related sectors. Institutional lenders who provide financing to fossil-fuel energy and related companies also have become more attentive to sustainable lending practices and some of them may elect not to provide funding for fossil fuel energy companies. Additionally, the lending practices of institutional lenders have been the subject of intensive lobbying efforts in recent years, oftentimes public in nature, by environmental activists, proponents of the international Paris Agreement, and foreign citizenry concerned about climate change not to provide funding for fossil fuel producers. Limitation of investments in and financings for fossil fuel energy companies could result in the restriction, delay or cancellation of drilling programs or development or production activities of our customers, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our compressor rental and sale business.
The adoption and implementation of new or more stringent international, federal or state legislation, regulations or other regulatory initiatives that impose more stringent standards for GHG emissions from the oil and natural gas sector or otherwise restrict the areas in which this sector may produce oil and natural gas or generate GHG emissions could result in increased costs of compliance or additional operating restrictions or reduced demand for our compressor products and services, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
We believe that our existing environmental control procedures are adequate and that we are in substantial compliance with environmental laws and regulations, and the phasing in of emission controls and other known regulatory requirements should not have a material adverse affect on our financial condition or operational results. However, it is possible that future developments, such as new or increasingly strict requirements and environmental laws and enforcement policies there under, 
could lead to material costs of environmental compliance by us. While we may be able to pass on the additional cost of complying with such laws to our customers, there can be no assurance that attempts to do so will be successful.  Some risk of environmental liability and other costs are inherent in the nature of our business, however, and there can be no assurance that environmental costs will not rise.    
To the extent that new laws or other governmental actions restrict the energy industry or impose additional environmental protection requirements that result in increased costs to the oil and gas industry, we could be adversely affected. We cannot determine to what extent our future operations and earnings may be affected by new legislation, new regulations or changes in existing regulations.
Occupational Safety and Health
We are subject to the requirements of Occupational Safety and Health Administration ("OSHA") and comparable state statutes. These laws and the implementing regulations strictly govern the protection of the health and safety of employees. The OSHA hazard communication standard, the EPA community right-to-know regulations under Title III of CERCLA, and similar state statutes require that we maintain and/or disclose information about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations. We believe that we are in compliance with these applicable requirements and with other comparable laws.
Patents, Trademarks and Other Intellectual Property
We believe that the success of our business depends more on the technical competence, creativity and marketing abilities of our employees than on any individual patent, trademark, or copyright. Nevertheless, as part of our ongoing research, development and manufacturing activities, we may seek patents when appropriate on inventions concerning new products and product improvements. Although we continue to use technology that was previously covered by a patent and consider it useful in certain applications, we do not consider the expired patent to be material to our business as a whole.
Suppliers and Raw Materials
Fabrication of our rental compressors involves the purchase by us of engines, compressors, coolers and other components, and the assembly of these components on skids for delivery to customer locations. These major components of our compressors are acquired through periodic purchase orders placed with third-party suppliers on an "as needed" basis, which typically requires a three to six month lead time with delivery dates scheduled to coincide with our estimated production schedules. Although we do not have formal continuing supply contracts with any major supplier, we believe we have adequate alternative sources available. In the past, we have not experienced any sudden and dramatic increases in the prices of the major components for our compressors. However, the occurrence of such an event could have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations and financial condition, particularly if we are unable to increase our rental rates and sale prices proportionate to any such component price increases.
In addition, the COVID-19 outbreak and subsequent supply chain disruptions has increased the risk that our suppliers may be prevented from conducting their business at sufficient levels to provide us with necessary equipment and supplies in a timely and sufficient amount. While we have experienced no significant supply disruptions that materially disrupted operations, to the extent we have difficulties in obtaining needed products and supplies in a timely manner, our results of operations and financial position may be adversely affected.
