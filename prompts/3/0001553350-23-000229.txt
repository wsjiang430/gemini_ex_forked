Item 1. Business
Background
 
Nocopi Technologies, Inc. develops and markets specialty reactive inks for multiple applications across various industries. Our specialty inks are used by our customers for a range of purposes from bringing entertainment products to life with a variety of color activations to providing document and brand authentication for security purposes aimed at reducing losses caused by fraudulent document reproduction or by product counterfeiting and/or diversion. Our primary markets are the large educational and toy products industry and the document and product authentication industry. We derive our revenues primarily from licensing our technologies on an exclusive or non-exclusive basis to licensees who incorporate our technologies into their product offering and from selling products incorporating our technologies to the licensees or to their licensed printers.

Industry Overview and Market Trends
 The key ingredients to an ink are pigments, dyes, resins, surfactants, dryers, oils, solvents, water, waxes, and various other additives. There are many different types of both printing processes and print applications, so the mixing or preparation of formulations for these quantities widely vary. Pigments and dyes are the key ingredient that comprise the ink’s color and are formulated from substances with certain characteristics that make them suitable for use on printed products.
 The printing inks market is seeing a shift as companies transition from manufacturing petroleum-based printing inks to manufacturing environmentally friendly, more sustainable printing inks. “Green” printing inks are based on sustainable materials such as soy and other plant-based sources and do not contain the heavy metals or other dangerous and toxic substances that petroleum-based printing inks do; thus they do not cause excessive pollution in the landfill. Examples of more environmentally friendly printing inks include water-based and oil-based printing inks. The use of “green” printing inks also reduces emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOC) associated with the printing process.
 In 2022, the global printing ink industry consumed 3 billion tons of printing ink according to Smithers industry report “The Future of Water-based vs Solvent Printing to 2027”. Sales of water-based inks in 2022 topped $5 billion and sales of solvent inks totaled $7.7 billion. The water-based printing inks market consists of sales of water-based printing inks and related services used for printing on fabric and paper. Water-based printing inks are referred to as aqueous inks and are dye and pigment inks and can be segmented by type into acrylic water-based inks, maleic water-based inks, and shellac water-based inks.
 Our Company does not produce commodity base pigments. Rather, we source various pigments, dyes and other raw materials for ink, and then employ additional chemistry in formulating those materials into a highly engineered, specialty ink for a specific use. We are a specialty ink formulator within the ink industry that custom formulates, tests, and produces specialty inks that best meet our customer’s product needs and color demands. Our customers’ demands appear to be shifting with the trend towards utilizing more “green” printing inks. In 2022, approximately 38% of our ink sales were “green” printing inks, compared to 34% in 2021. As the “green” printing ink market continues to grow, we expect to continue to transition towards manufacturing environmentally friendly, more sustainable printing inks and away from manufacturing petroleum-based printing inks. We do not expect the “green” printing ink trend to adversely affect any aspects of our operations.

Anti-Counterfeiting and Anti-Diversion Technologies and Products
 
Continuing developments in copying and printing technologies makes it easier than ever before to counterfeit a wide variety of documents. Counterfeit products are increasingly problematic for consumers, governments, and corporations. According to The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) data on counterfeiting and international trade, the total value of counterfeit and pirated goods was expected to increase to approximately $3 trillion in 2022. Product labels and packaging, retail receipts, event and transportation tickets and the like are all susceptible to counterfeiting, causing economic losses to manufacturers of brand name products. With improvements in the copying and printing technologies making it easier to counterfeit labeling and packaging and increasing the losses to businesses from such counterfeiting activities.

Our Copimark and Rub & Reveal technologies provide proprietary document authentication systems that are useful to businesses and brand owners desiring to authenticate a wide variety of printed materials and products. Our Copimark system enables businesses to print invisibly on certain areas of a document or packaging. When authentication of certain document or packaging is required, the invisible printing can be activated or revealed by use of a special highlighter pen. Other variations of our Copimark technology involve multiple color responses from a common pen, visible marks of one color that turn another color with the pen or visible and invisible marks that turn into a multicolored image. Our Rub & Reveal system permits the invisible printing of an authenticating symbol or code that can be revealed by rubbing a fingernail over the printed area.
 
Our technologies provide users with the ability to authenticate documents and detect counterfeit documents. Applications include the authentication of documents having intrinsic value, such as merchandise receipts, checks, travelers' checks, gift certificates and event tickets, and the authentication of product labeling and packaging. When applied to product labels and packaging, our systems allow detection of counterfeit products, the labels and packaging of which would not contain the authenticating marks invisibly printed on the packaging or labels of the legitimate product.
 
Our marketing efforts for these technologies are focused on specific industries we believe may be affected by product counterfeiting. These technologies also combat product diversion (i.e. sale of legitimate products through unauthorized distribution channels or in unauthorized markets). Another of our related technologies, our invisible inkjet technology, permits manufacturers and distributors to track the movement of products from production to ultimate consumption when coupled with proprietary software. The “track and trace” capability provided by this technology is an attractive capability to brand owners. Our ink technology is also utilized in retail receipt and document fraud markets through licensing arrangements with four printers and distributors in the United States and Canada who provide loss prevention products to retailers and other outlets. We market these technologies through the use of licensed printers and distributors.
 
Contrast Technologies, formerly known as Euro-Nocopi, S.A., is a former affiliate of our Company that, since June 2003, has held a perpetual royalty-free license to utilize certain of our anti-counterfeiting and anti-diversion technologies in Europe.

Competition 
 
Nocopi Technologies competes in the fragmented specialty ink industry which is highly competitive. Competition is based on several key criteria which include quality, price, service, performance, product innovation, product recognition, speed, and delivery. Our competitors range from large, publicly owned international companies with broad product offerings to local, privately held independent specialty producers offering a specific market niche or product. Overall, many participants tend to offer a varied and broad array of product lines designed to meet specific customer requirements.
 
The ink industry has become increasingly global as participants have focused on establishing and maintaining leadership positions outside of their home markets. Many of these participant’s product lines face increasing competition due to industry consolidation, pricing pressures and competing technologies. Nonetheless, we believe our patented and proprietary technologies provide a unique and cost-effective solution for our customers. To improve our competitive position, Nocopi Technologies is building and leveraging our corporate brand as a differentiator to create value and better communicate our specialty production capabilities which we believe make it easier to introduce new product lines and applications to provide scale to our operations and ultimately enable us to successfully compete in the market.
