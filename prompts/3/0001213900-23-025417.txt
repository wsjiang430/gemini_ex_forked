ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview



We are developing a digital gaming platform (“Platform”) that will offer our proprietary games as well as games developed and published by third parties. Our vision is to develop, design, acquire, and manage conventional digital games and to combine them with novel methods, such as the ability to create and mint unique in-game features, such as skins, characters, weapons, gear, in the form of non-fungible tokens, or “NFTs,” that will allow users to have unique experiences and more control over in-game assets.



We plan to initially launch our own proprietary games that are simple and fun to play, and that offer gamers the ability to mint their own affordable NFTs within the Platform, with unique and exclusive features, that can be utilized across the network of games and Platform that we plan to build.



Non-Fungible Tokens



A non-fungible token, or NFT, is a digital, cryptographic token on the blockchain that certifies a unique asset. When someone “mints” an NFT, they create a file that lives on a blockchain that cannot be edited or deleted. Because the file exists on a blockchain, it can be viewed publicly, meaning the item’s provenance is public and verifiable. While NFTs have been generally built on the Ethereum blockchain, recently other blockchains, such as Polygon, have also emerged as a building block for NFTs, some of which offer lower-cost network fees and faster transaction processing speeds. Our NFTs will be launched on the Polygon network, which is an Ethereum compatible blockchain building platform (i.e. Polygon’s parent chain is Ethereum) that provides a secure and lower-cost alternative to Ethereum’s escalating gas fees and wait times without sacrificing the security granted by the Ethereum blockchain.



NFTs are digital assets that can represent a unique real-world asset, such as art, music, in-game items, or videos. NFTs are most-commonly powered by smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. Ethereum is a decentralized blockchain platform that establishes a peer-to-peer network that securely executes and verifies application code, called smart contracts. “Smart contracts” is a term used to describe computer code that automatically executes all or parts of an agreement and is stored on a blockchain-based platform. In the case of in-game NFTs, these NFTs generally can be images, skins, virtual real estate, pets, or other items that can be owned and held in a digital wallet. A digital wallet (or e-wallet) is a software-based system that securely stores users’ payment information and passwords for numerous payment methods and websites. Currently, NFTs are being used to sell a wide range of virtual collectibles, including:




● | virtual sports trading cards and video clips;
--+----------------------------------------------


● | music and album cover art;
--+---------------------------


● | art, memes, or other digital images;
--+-------------------------------------


● | in-game assets; and
--+--------------------


● | virtual real estate, fashion, and other real-world representations in the metaverse, a virtual-reality space in which users can interact with a computer-generated environment and other users.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Mission



Our mission is to acquire and develop digital games of various genres to attract gamers of all types, including, but not limited to, multiplayer online games, simulation games, adventure games, real-time strategy games, role-playing, sports games, fighting games, puzzle games, and other skill-based games. We will seek to make each game unique in design and gameplay. In addition to owned-and-operated games we will develop, the Platform we intend to build will be designed to allow onboarding of games developed and published by third-parties and to provide access to certain unique features, such as blockchain and NFT architecture. We believe that these features will open up new dimensions for game developers and publishers by providing them with additional potential revenue streams and by modernizing their gaming assets to allow them to compete in the new paradigm. We also intend to design the Platform in a manner that will provide both game owners and users access to Company-sponsored events, experiences, and other mutually beneficial opportunities.

Our Platform



We are developing a digital gaming platform, called “Gaxos,” that can be used as a base for our proprietary games, as well as for third-party game developers and publishers. The Platform is intended to provide game developers and publishers with tools and features that they can use to augment their games, including, but not limited to tools that make use of blockchain and NFTs. The Platform will only allow users to purchase NFTs created by the Company and third-party game developers on our Platform and only these NFTs will have in-game utility across the Platform and the games. In-game NFTs allow players to own their in-game assets instead of the game developer. We are integrating blockchain and NFT technologies to better the collective experiences of our gamers. We believe that the Platform tools and features will give us the ability to benefit from a wide variety of games with less overhead and developmental costs.



New users of the Platform will create an account by entering an email address in order to engage with the Platform. Users participate in purchasing NFTs by linking their digital wallets to the Platform and engaging with the smart contracts in order to mint NFTs offered on the Platform. When creating an account, our users will be required to accept our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. The Company intends to rely on third-party partners to perform all money transmission. We presently plan to accept credit cards, debit cards and cryptocurrency, only in the form of Bitcoin and Ethereum. We do not intend to accept any other forms of cryptocurrency besides Bitcoin and Ethereum. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we intend to purchase and hold MATIC, in increments as needed, solely for the purpose of paying the fees associated with minting our NFTs on the Polygon network. Our intention is to immediately convert all cryptocurrency received as payment to cash. We intend to hold only the minimal amount of MATIC required to interact with the blockchain as part of our core business of minting NFTs, and we do not intend to accept MATIC as a form of payment or to hold MATIC as a long term asset. We are currently in the process of selecting the right custodian for our crypto assets and do not have any custody arrangements.



We will not accept such cryptocurrency payments directly, but plan to use a third-party vendor to accept and process any such cryptocurrency payments on our behalf. We currently intend to have the third-party vendor send any such cryptocurrency to our custodial wallet and then have our custodian convert the cryptocurrency into U.S. dollars.



We will not offer any NFTs for purchase prior to the initial launch of the Platform and the launch of the games in which the NFT may be used. All NFTs offered on the Platform will be immediately usable for the intended entertainment purpose at the time they are sold. The NFTs that we initially intend to offer on the Platform will be in the form of avatar designs which will be used for entertainment value and are intended to enhance the users in-game aesthetic experience. However, as is typical with other games, a player’s individual efforts and successes in playing the games and using the in-game assets, may result in some of the assets unlocking certain additional content, features or functionality of our games. Passively holding an NFT will not unlock these items. To the extent that unlocking any of these items enhances the perceived value of a NFT, that will be as a result of the player’s own effort.



We have policies and procedures to analyze whether each NFT listed on our platform and each crypto asset accepted as payment could be deemed to be a “security” under applicable laws. Our policies and procedures do not constitute a legal standard, and are not binding on regulators or courts, but rather represent our company-developed plan, which permits us to make a risk-based assessment regarding the likelihood that a particular NFT or crypto asset could be deemed a “security” under applicable laws. We have designated certain employees and officers who will be responsible for making such determinations, and will have them undergo training regarding the recognition of a “security”. We plan to work with legal counsel experienced in crypto asset regulatory matters to make a determination with respect to each NFT developed by the Company to be listed on the Platform. NFTs that do not pass the screening process will be refused listing on the Platform. Since our NFT’s are not deemed to be securities and we will only accept crypto that has been deemed by regulators not to constitute a security we believe that KYC and AML requirements are not applicable to our business. We expect our risk assessment policies will continuously evolve to take into account developments in case law, applicable facts, developments in technology, and changes in applicable regulatory schemes. We intend to rely on continuing guidance issued by regulatory agencies with respect to any specific crypto assets and will monitor any updates from such agencies. We will also periodically reassess the classification of our crypto assets in accordance with such continual developments, guidance and updates.

Our primary objective is to build and grow our Platform to enable us to launch games and to obtain revenues through the sale or minting of NFTs to users of our games and to earn fees and/or commissions on the sale of NFTs by third parties that engage with the smart contracts on our Platform. Our efforts to grow the Platform will be focused on these purposes, not to increase the value of any previously sold NFTs. Additionally, while we intend to continuously improve the functionality of the Platform following the launch of our initial games and the Platform, through the launch of additional games as the potential adoption and implementation of new technologies, (i) all NFTs offered will be designed to provide users with immediate in-game entertainment value at a modest cost, (ii) we will continuously offer new NFTs on an ongoing basis and each drop of NFTs will be at a fixed price, and (iii) we intend to market and sell NFTs to Platform users solely for consumptive use as a means of entertainment value on, and in connection with, the Platform. We may, in the future, also earn royalty fees in the event that NFTs that are created on our Platform are resold, however, no assurance can be given that any such transactions will occur or that we will earn any such royalty fees. Further, no resales of NFTs can be made on our Platform and we do not intend to market our NFTs in any way that promotes their resale. We also will not list any of the NFTs with any third party marketplace. As a result, while the number of games that an NFT may be used in, and the functionality of the Platform, may increase and change over time, new and existing users of the Platform will always have the opportunity to acquire new NFTs for entertainment value at a modest cost. Thus, we do not anticipate that there will be a disparity in price between already issued NFTs and new NFTs that may be purchased on our Platform. Finally, while we may use profits from our business, which includes the sale of NFTs on our Platform, to reinvest and further develop our business, the goal of this is to provide a better gaming experience, grow the number of games on the Platform, and to increase the number of third parties that use our Platform so that we can earn fees and/or commissions on the sale of NFTs. Our focus of reinvestment is not to increase the value of NFTs previously sold. To the extent that any NFT increases in value it will likely be due to the efforts of the player that uses the NFT assets in game. For example, to the extent that a player’s individual efforts and successes in playing the games and using the in-game assets results in unlocking certain additional content features or functionality of our games, these personal efforts of the user may impact the value of that player’s NFT. While we do not believe that the NFTs that we plan to mint and sell are “securities,” there is regulatory uncertainty with respect to this issue. If NFTs sold on the Platform were deemed to be securities, we may be found to be in violation of securities laws for engaging in transactions regarding unregistered securities. Such a determination could lead to an enforcement action by the SEC and result in fines and other penalties, and have a negative impact on our business. See Risk Factors — Risks Related to Digital Assets.”



Polygon Network (MATIC)



Similar to Ethereum, Polygon is one of the biggest decentralized blockchains with smart contract functionality. Ethereum is a “Layer 1” blockchain that has higher transaction fees, often referred to as “gas fees” that are used to power transactions. These fees tend to be significantly higher than Polygon. Polygon is a “Layer 2” scaling solution to Ethereum built on top of Ethereum that uses a proof-of-stake sidechain to process transactions and therefore reduces purchase and transfer transaction gas fees to only a few pennies.



The Polygon network uses MATIC tokens for governance and security. Validators or operators that ensure security and validate blocks on the Polygon network receive gas fees in the form of MATIC tokens. MATIC tokens allow developers to connect their Ethereum compatible smart contracts in Polygon. Polygon is often chosen by developers for its speed and lower transaction costs while maintaining full compatibility with Ethereum, enabling developers to move their code freely between the two blockchains.



The median gas price on the Polygon network as of April 29, 2022 is less than $0.01 as compared to $2.03 on the Ethereum network. We do not anticipate any material changes in gas prices on the Polygon network that would affect our business model. In general, if gas prices become too high, demand for transaction processing on the network will decrease and thereby reduce the demand for our NFTs. Reduced demand resulting from fees that are too high will have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and prospects, however, reduced demand due to an increase in transaction fees will have a less significant impact than that of Ethereum due to the significantly lower transaction fees of the Polygon network.

Our Strategy



Our strategy includes the development of proprietary games, combined with the development of our Platform which will also allow third parties to develop and offer their games to gamers with enhanced features to be offered by the tools to be included in-to our Platform.



In addition to developing proprietary games, part of our strategy includes acquiring games in various genres from third-party developers/publishers that are currently in development, have already been developed but not commercialized, or games that have active users and/or revenues.



We intend to implement a number of initiatives and strategies that we believe will allow us to achieve revenue in the very near term and give us the ability to grow our user base and revenue opportunities significantly. This includes the following:




● | NFT sales or minting fees — revenues that will be generated from the sale of NFTs to users of our games;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | NFT commissions — fees and/or commissions that will be charged on the sale of NFTs by third parties that utilize of our Platform;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | NFT royalties — royalties that will be paid to us in the event that NFTs that are created on our Platform are resold; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Advertising and Partnerships — fees that will be paid by game advertisers, developers, hardware companies, or other strategic partners.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




We believe that the sale of NFTs to our gamers will be the principal source of our revenue. NFTs provide a license to the digital content that the NFTs represent. In addition to the revenue that we receive from the sale of NFTs, we will receive a royalty if and when a user transfers or sells their NFTs to others on third-party platforms, such as OpenSea or Rarible.



NFTs can be designed to provide for the payment of royalties to compensate original NFT creators for the use of the licensed intellectual property rights to their NFT. We believe that royalties present a potential opportunity for a continuous passive-income stream. Royalty rates and mechanisms can be coded into the smart contracts on the blockchain to permit a set percentage of the sale price to be collected for future sales.



We believe that royalties along with our other revenue streams will allow us to sell NFTs to our users at reasonable prices, unlike the current NFT market, and still economically benefit in the event our original NFTs generate a high demand and thus, a high resale price. We currently anticipate that the initial royalty fee for our initial smart contracts will be set at the current market standard of approximately 5-10%. The royalty rate for future smart contracts may be set at different rates from our initial smart contracts depending on changes in the market standard rate.



We intend to utilize various marketing strategies to target users, third-party game publishers, and developers, and believe that as the quantity of the gaming assets on our Platform increases, the likelihood of adoption of our Platform and NFT products will increase.



In addition, we will continuously seek to expand and improve the functionality of the Platform through the adoption and implementation of new technologies, such as augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR), artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and Web3.0 infrastructure, that allows us to expand our product offerings to gamers and developers. We currently have no plans to enhance the Platform with the foregoing but we will be continuously researching new technologies in order to stay competitive with the market. Web3.0 is the next generation of the internet based on blockchain technology, that incorporates concepts such as decentralization and token-based economics. We will also be seeking to license and/or partner with third parties for access to or development of smart technology that we can leverage to increase our market share and other opportunities that are accretive to our business and mission.

Plan of Operations



We have had a dedicated approach to long-term success that we believe will allow us to achieve our milestones in product development, user acquisition, and growth. In the next twelve months we plan to accomplish the following:

Milestones | Timeline 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------
Initial Development | 
● Complete production and development of our three initial games; | Complete pending platform development and testing
● Complete the creation of the initial series of NFT skins and avatars; | Complete pending platform development and testing
● Launch of a successful beta testing of the initial games with a limited group of users; | Q2 2023 
● Develop and launch the Platform; | Q3 2023 
● On-board third-party games on the Platform; and | Q4 2023 
Future Development | 
● Launch of digital advertising campaigns for the Platform promotion and user acquisition; | Ongoing 
● Create and grow our gamer community; | Ongoing 
● Quarterly launches of new games; | Ongoing 
● Develop additional NFT in-game accessories. | Ongoing 




We currently estimate that the cost of the initial development of our games and Platform development and launch will cost approximately $1.5 million, and that we will be able to launch the 15 games described below for a total cost of less than $850,000. The funds raised from our initial public offering shall be dedicated to the growth and development of the Platform, our games, and creation of NFTs.



We have acquired certain rights related to, and are currently developing, 12 games. Of these games, we have commenced active development of 9 games. Currently, we estimate our initial 6 games will be completed by the end of the first quarter of 2023. Thereafter, we plan to complete 4 more games that are currently in early production by the end of the second quarter of 2023, followed by the completion of 5 games by the fourth quarter of 2023.




Games | Current Stage of Development | Anticipated Completion Date 
----------+----------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------
6 Games | Late Production/Testing | Complete pending platform development and testing
3-4 Games | Early Production | Q2 2023 
2 Games | Pre-Production/ Early Production | Q3 2023 
3 Games | Pre-Production | Q4 2023 




The first three games that we intend to bring to market are “NFToids: Arena Fighter,” “NFToids: Laser Quest,” and “NFToids: Squad Battle,” each of which will include the ability of users to acquire their own unique avatars, called “NFToids.” NFToids are 3D, playable NFT avatars that can be used to compete in games across our Platform. Our first collection of NFToids will include a wide array of player avatars and designs that can be utilized across our network of games. We plan to release and launch a variety of collections of NFToids, and to make them available to all users of our Platform. To access all of our games’ features, a user would need to purchase an NFT. However, other parts of the game such as the tutorials sections are available without NFT ownership. Users can purchase one or multiple NFTs and select which NFT they would like to utilize when starting a game. Each NFT affects the design and gameplay experience differently within our games.



We intend to generate revenue primarily from the sale of our NFTs. We believe that an increase in games available on the Platform will increase users and demand for the Platform. As our userbase grows, we expect to generate more NFT sales and thereby increase our revenues.



Arena Fighter, Laser Quest, and Squad Battle



Arena Fighter will be a competitive fighting game set in various rings and backgrounds where gamers battle for XP. Laser Quest will be a made up of various obstacle courses that will include different challenges. Squad Battle will be a multiplayer shooting game where users can battle each other or against the AI in various environments.

NFT Market



The NFT industry is experiencing exponential growth and we believe that there is a significant opportunity for the Platform and ecosystem. Once an NFT is created, it exists on the blockchain and does not solely rely on a game’s centralized servers. Traditional in-game assets are lost when a game is shut down. NFTs, on the other hand, survive game operability and can be bought, sold, and transferred independently of the game. Furthermore, blockchain-enabled game assets in the form of NFTs cannot be duplicated or tampered with because of the permanent record created in the blockchain.



According to NonFungible, NFT sales totaled just over $17 billion in 2021, compared to approximately just $183 million in 2020, with an average price of $807. However, in March 2021, a digital-only artwork created by Mike Winkelman, aka the digital artist Beeple, sold for approximately $70 million at a Christie’s auction. Additionally, the largest NFT marketplace, OpenSea, has now traded over $10 billion in total volume.



NFT games generated $2.32 billion in revenue in the third quarter of 2021, according to data compiled in the annual report by the Blockchain Game Alliance. That was roughly 22% of all NFT trading volume industry-wide in the quarter as blockchain games gathered steam.



NFT Liquidity



Network liquidity depends on the size of the network, the number of transactions taking place, and the liquidity inherent to that system. Liquidity is typically a big factor in determining the price of cryptocurrencies and other digital assets, including NFTs. However, we do not anticipate network liquidity to be a major consideration in our business as the purpose of making NFTs available for purchase on the Platform to our gamers is to enhance the gamers’ gaming experience and not for the resale value of the NFTs.



NFTs in the Gaming Industry



NFT games generated over $5 billion in revenue in 2021, according to data compiled by NonFungible. That was roughly 30% of all NFT trading volume industry-wide.



As of the end of 2021, the most successful blockchain game was Axie Infinity. The game generated more than $4 billion in lifetime sales and accounted for approximately 66% of the market in 2021. Axie Infinity allows players to collect “Axies, fierce creatures that love to battle, build, and hunt for treasure.”



NBA TopShot was second in sales volume with $800 million traded. NBA TopShot offers “Packs” for sale that a purchaser would open, just like a physical pack of trading cards, to see a scoring moment from NBA history. Some other notable games such as Sorare, where players can buy, sell, trade, and manage a virtual soccer team have traded volume of approximately $72 million.



Fortune Business Insights estimate that the global gaming market was over $200 billion in 2021 and is expected to grow to approximately $550 billion by 2028. Blockchain gaming represented a little over 2% in 2021 and is expected to grow to over 10% of the market by 2026.



Interest in blockchain gaming has also been growing steadily through 2021. The graph below shows the global search interest according to Google Trends. Blockchain gaming, NFT games, and play-to-earn keyword searches saw a significant increase around the first week of July 2021.

Intellectual Property



Our business is dependent upon the creation, acquisition, use and protection of intellectual property. Some of this intellectual property is expected to be in the form of software code, patented technology, copyright, and trade secrets that we will use to develop our games and the Platform. While we will develop our own intellectual property, we may also acquire and/or license other intellectual property which is owned by third parties.



We protect our intellectual property rights by relying on federal, state and common law protections, as well as contractual restrictions. We actively seek protection covering any intellectual property we believe may be useful or relevant to our business.



Our goal is to obtain, maintain and enforce protection for our intellectual property, and to operate without infringing on the rights of other parties. Our policy is to actively seek the broadest intellectual property protection possible for our intellectual property through a combination of contractual arrangements, registration of our domain names, copyrights, trademarks, service marks and/or patents. We have established business procedures designed to maintain the confidentiality of our proprietary information, including the use of confidentiality agreements with employees, independent contractors, consultants, and entities with which we conduct business.



The Platform will allow third-party game developers to mint NFTs using their own intellectual property and our tools to list those NFTs for sale (primary sales) on the Platform. The Platform only allows NFTs that were originally minted using the Company’s NFT infrastructure to be listed for sale. All third party game developers who create NFTs on the Platform will be required to agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy prior to engaging with the Platform. Our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy will require creators to attest they own the intellectual property used to create their NFTs and to monitor for obvious copyright violations. It is not yet certain to what extent the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) applies to NFT platforms. However, it seems likely that NFT platform owners will be subject to at least some responsibility for responding to copyright infringement on their sites, therefore, we plan to take proactive approach by registering with the DMCA to retain a designated agent for DMCA notices as well as instructions for submitting copyright infringement claims.



License with Columbia University



On August 29, 2022 (the “Effective Date”), we entered into a software and patent license agreement (the “Columbia Agreement”) with Columbia University in the City of New York (“Columbia University”) pursuant to which Columbia University granted us a royalty-bearing, exclusive, worldwide, non-transferable license to certain intellectual property to (i) discover, develop, manufacture, have made, use, sell, offer to sell, have sold, import, export, distribute, rent or lease certain Licensed Products (as defined in the Columbia Agreement) solely for computer gaming for entertainment purposes involving non-fungible tokens (NFTs) (the “Field”) and throughout the territory, and (ii) copy, use, modify, and create derivative works from licensed software in Source Code (as defined in the Columbia Agreement) and Object Code form (as defined in the Columbia Agreement) in the Field and throughout the territory during the term, for the sole purpose of incorporating the licensed software into or bundling the Licensed Software (as defined in the Columbia Agreement) with licensed products in the Field. The term of the License Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and shall extend, on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis, until the later of (i) the date of expiration of the last to expire of the issued patents falling within the definition of Licensed Patents or (ii) fifteen (15) years after the first bona fide commercial launch of a Licensed Product (as defined in the Columbia Agreement) in the country in question, unless terminated earlier pursuant to the terms of the Columbia Agreement. Pursuant to the Columbia Agreement, we agreed to pay Columbia University (i) a license fee of $25,000, (ii) certain revenue-based milestone payments, (iii) royalty payments, depending on net revenues, (iv) minimum royalty payments, (v) a percentage of sublicense income, (vi) certain success based payments, and (vii) reimbursement for reasonable fees, costs, and expenses incurred for patent litigation.

Our Privacy Policy



We recognize that gamers and other users of our games and Platform care deeply about how their personal information is collected, used and shared.



When gamers or developers use our games or Platform, they are required to provide us with certain personal information. We take commercially reasonable and appropriate measures to protect this personal information from accidental loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction, taking into account the risks involved in processing and the nature of such data, and comply with applicable laws and regulations. We do not currently transfer any personal information to third-parties that do not act on our behalf, and should we intend to do so, we will only do so with users’ consent. Similarly, we do not currently collect sensitive personal information from users. We may disclose personal information to certain types of third-party companies, but only to the extent needed to enable them to provide such services. The types of companies that may receive personal information and their functions are: marketing assistance, analytics and reporting, customer support, email and SMS delivery, cloud infrastructure, and systems monitoring. All such third parties function as our agents, performing services at our instruction and on our behalf pursuant to contracts which require them to provide at least the same level of privacy protection as is required by our privacy policy. In addition, we may be required to disclose personal information in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including for the purpose of meeting national security or law enforcement requirements. We may also disclose personal information to other third parties when compelled to do so by government authorities or required by law or regulation including, but not limited to, in response to court orders and subpoenas.
Government Regulation



We are subject to various federal, state, and international laws and regulations that affect companies conducting business on the Internet and mobile platforms, including those relating to privacy, use and protection of player and employee personal information and data (including the collection of data from minors), the Internet, behavioral tracking, mobile applications, content, advertising and marketing activities and anti-corruption. Additional laws in all of these areas are likely to be passed in the future, which could result in significant limitations on or changes to the ways in which we can collect, use, host, store or transmit the personal information and data of our customers or employees, communicate with our players and deliver products and services, which may significantly increase our compliance costs.
Competition



We operate in industries that are highly competitive and evolving. Specifically, our business faces intense competition in gaming, NFT marketplaces, and other various digital products. Our games face competition from other games, such as Axie Infinity, The Sandbox, Sorare, and Splinterlands. In addition, our Platform may face competition from other NFT marketplaces that cater to game users and gaming companies. Further, our competition may become more intense if gaming industry leaders such as Sony, Nintendo, and Microsoft, all of whom have significant financial, technical and other resources, greater brand recognition and longer operating histories, decide to focus their efforts on NFTs.



Our ability to compete depends in large part on our continuous commitment to research and development, our ability to rapidly introduce new features and functionality, to on-board 3rd party game developers and to improve proven applications for established markets in which we have competitive advantages. We intend to work closely with our customers to continuously enhance the performance, functionality, usability, reliability and flexibility of the Platform.

Education



As part of our Platform and product offering, we intend to provide educational content free-of-charge on our website(s). We believe that it is important to educate our visitors and the community about NFTs, gaming, third-party services and products, and all the respective processes that would be required to participate in our experiences. The educational content will include but not be limited to articles, “how-to” videos, graphical walkthroughs, responses to frequently asked questions (FAQs), gameplay, white papers, webinars, and fireside chats. We may develop premium content that will not be free-of-charge such as hardcopy literature, e-books, or other thought-leadership products.
Employees



As of March 29, 2023, we have a total of 3 full-time employees and 10 consultants. We are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements. We believe that we maintain good relations with our employees.
Our Corporate Information
