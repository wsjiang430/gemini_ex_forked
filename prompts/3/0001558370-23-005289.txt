Item 1.       Business
Overview
​
We are a fully integrated biopharmaceutical company specializing in the end-to-end development, manufacturing, and commercialization of innovative medical countermeasures that combat unmet and emerging biothreats. Our ecosystem is driven by the discovery efforts of our subsidiary, Skunkworx Bio, Inc. (“Skunkworx”), the clinical and commercial biodefense expertise of our subsidiary, Elusys Therapeutics, Inc. (“Elusys”), and the bioanalytical, process development and biomanufacturing capabilities of our subsidiary, Scorpius Biomanufacturing, Inc. (“Scorpius”). The coordination of this ecosystem potentiates the streamlined development and delivery of life-saving medical countermeasures, including our anthrax antitoxin ANTHIM® (obiltoxaximab).
​
The monoclonal antibody ANTHIM® (obiltoxaximab) received FDA approval and orphan drug exclusivity in 2016 for the treatment of inhalational anthrax in combination with antibiotics, and as a prophylaxis when alternative therapies are not available or are not appropriate. Additionally, ANTHIM® was approved in 2020 as the only licensed anthrax antitoxin treatment in the European Union (“EU”) and Canada, and in 2021 in the United Kingdom. Working closely with Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (“BARDA”), the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (“NIAID”), and the Department of Defense (“DoD”), Elusys has successfully advanced ANTHIM® to the commercial stage and provides the therapeutic for inclusion in both the US Strategic National Stockpile (“SNS”) and the Public Health Agency of Canada Office of Emergency Response Services Depot.
​
Scorpius pairs cGMP biomanufacturing and quality control expertise with cutting edge capabilities in immunoassays, molecular assays, and bioanalytical methods to support cell- and gene-based therapies as well as large molecule biologics. Scorpius decreases our dependence on third-party contract research and development biomanufacturing organizations (CDMOs) for the manufacture of ANTHIM® (obiltoxaximab) and other assets and allows us to be opportunistic in offering excess capacity to third parties as a fee-for-service model. Our lead facility commenced operations in October 2022 in San Antonio, Texas. Planning and development efforts are underway on a potential commercial manufacturing facility to be built in Manhattan, Kansas in the coming years.

During the past year, our priorities have shifted to our biodefense and biomanufacturing capabilities resulting in a refocusing of our resources and efforts towards biodefense and biomanufacturing and away from our clinical-stage oncology assets including HS-110 and PTX-35.
​
OUR BIOMANUFACTURING, PROCESS DEVELOPMENT, AND BIOMANUFACTURING CAPABILITIES: SCORPIUS BIOMANUFACTURING, INC.
Manufacturing
Scorpius (formerly known as Scorpion Biological Services, Inc.) provides process development and biomanufacturing services to support our biotherapeutics and discovery pipeline. Scorpius also supports the biomanufacturing needs of third parties who use its excess biomanufacturing capacity as a fee-for-service model. Scorpius couples cGMP biomanufacturing and quality control expertise with cutting edge capabilities in immunoassays, molecular assays, and bioanalytical methods to support cell- and gene-based therapies as well as large molecule biologics using American-made equipment, reagents, and materials. The subsidiary expects to decrease our dependence on third-party CDMOs for the manufacture of ANTHIM®, assuming receipt of necessary regulatory approvals, and other assets as well as allow us to be opportunistic in offering excess capacity to third parties on a fee-for-service model. We are in the process of completing the technology transfer of ANTHIM® to Scorpius for future production. We anticipate the prioritization of Scorpius on American-made equipment, reagents, and materials paired with domestic sourcing of biomanufacturing expertise will make us competitive for U.S. government contracts and biodefense assets. We anticipate this will successfully support our expansion within the growing CDMO market. 
​
We commenced operations of the leased San Antonio facility in September 2022 and are planning to begin development efforts on a commercial manufacturing facility expected to be built in Manhattan, Kansas in the coming years. We have historically relied on third-party manufacturers to produce and store our product candidates for clinical use and currently do not operate our own manufacturing facilities. In order to promote efficiency and reduce our reliance on third-party vendors, we have enhanced our in-house development of bioanalytic, process development and manufacturing capabilities and offer such services to third parties for fees. We expect to fill production capacity by transitioning our outsourced manufacturing and development in-house following validation activities and then contracting with external customers. However, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in these new operations.
​
We intend to meet our financing needs for the operations of the facility through multiple alternatives, including, but not limited to, cash on hand, grant funding and incentives, additional equity financings, debt financings and/or funding from partnerships or collaborations, and potential revenue, if any, from our planned development and manufacturing facility.
​
In April 2022, we announced a planned partnership of Scorpius, a private developer, the State of Kansas, and local and university affiliates to support the development of a 500,000+ square foot biodefense-focused large molecule and biologics biomanufacturing phased, multi-building facility in Manhattan, Kansas. Scorpius intends to utilize the new facility for large molecule and biologics manufacturing, with a particular focus on biodefense. In addition to servicing our own pipeline, Scorpius plans to operate and utilize the facility as a full-service CDMO to provide third-party manufacturing services on a fee-for-service basis. Scorpius and the developer have applied for over $300 million in funding, incentives, and tax relief to support the development of the facility. In April 2022, the City Commission of Manhattan, Kansas, passed a resolution supporting the proposed commercial manufacturing facility and its intent to offer an Economic Development Package that includes the issuance of approximately $567 million in industrial revenue bonds with proposed sales tax exemptions, an anticipated 10-year 100% property tax abatement plan, and an expected $8 million forgivable loan that will be tied to the realized capital investment and employee jobs, wages, and benefits. The Economic Development Package is conditioned upon successful negotiation and future action by the City Commission and upon Scorpius meeting certain negotiated performance and hiring goals.
​
We plan to manufacture CGMP pharmaceutical-grade products for our customers in our San Antonio facility. To date Scorpius has three customers for which it has not recognized any revenue. The deposits from these customer are in deferred revenue and will be converted to revenue once we meet our performance obligations for these contracts. The process for manufacturing generally uses commercially available raw materials from multiple suppliers, and in some instances, from a single source supplier. We rely on third parties to supply most of the necessary raw materials and supplies for the products 

6



we manufacture on behalf of our customers and our inability to obtain such raw materials or supplies may adversely impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business” for additional discussion of raw materials supplied by third party vendors for the products we manufacture for our customers.
​
Biodefense
​
In 2022, we acquired ANTHIM® (obiltoxaximab) when we consummated the transaction contemplated by the Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization (the “Merger Agreement”) with our wholly owned subsidiary (“Merger Sub”), Elusys and Fortis Advisors LLC, pursuant to which we acquired Elusys through the merger (the “Merger”) of Merger Sub with Elusys. ANTHIM® is a monoclonal antibody antitoxin for anthrax. Our biodefense discovery and preclinical efforts remain focused on identifying novel assets to combat emerging biological threats. To date, all revenue that Elusys received for the sale of ANTHIM®, subsequent to our acquisition of Elusys, has been $6.0 million in procurement contracts to provide ANTHIM® (obiltoxaximab) to the Canada Office of Emergency Response Services Depot.
​
Anthrax
​
Anthrax is a disease caused by Bacillus anthracis. While it is primarily a disease of animals, cases of anthrax in humans occur through contact with infected animals or animal products or through intentional spread of Bacillus anthracis (“B. Anthracis”) spores as a biowarfare or bioterrorism agent. Due to its virulence, high mortality, and ease to produce and disseminate, B. anthracis is considered a potent and dangerous “Category A” biowarfare or bioterrorism agent. Inhalational anthrax (i.e., when infection occurs via inhalation of bacterial spores) is particularly deadly. Untreated, the mortality rate is 97% and remains high (~50%) for individuals that are not administered aggressive antimicrobial treatment at the earliest stages of the disease. Once the disease has progressed to the fulminant stage, accumulated anthrax toxins drive progression of disease despite antibiotic therapy, resulting in death. In addition, antibiotics may be ineffective in infections with multi-drug-resistant B. anthracis or contraindicated in certain patient populations.) Bacillus anthracis is recognized by Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasures Enterprise as a high-priority threat.
​
About ANTHIM® (obiltoxaximab)
​
ANTHIM® (obiltoxaximab) is a monoclonal antibody that binds the protective antigen (PA) component of the anthrax. Obiltoxaximab’s toxin neutralizing activity prevents entry of anthrax toxin into susceptible cells, avoiding further spread of the toxin throughout the body and the ensuing tissue damage that leads to death. ANTHIM® (obiltoxaximab) is supplied as single-dose vials for IV infusion.
​
The development of ANTHIM® (obiltoxaximab) was supported by ~$250M USD in non-dilutive development contracts from the National Institutes of Health (“NIH”), Department of Defense (“DoD”), and Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority “(“BARDA”) to Elusys. To date, Elusys has received ~$151M USD and ~$6M USD in procurement contracts to provide ANTHIM® (obiltoxaximab) to the U.S. SNS and the Public Health Agency of Canada Office of Emergency Response Services Depot. NightHawk Biosciences acquired Elusys in April 2022 and is committed to expanding domestic and international sales of ANTHIM® (obiltoxaximab).
​
ANTHIM® (obiltoxaximab) was approved in the U.S. in 2016 in adults and pediatric patients for the treatment of inhalational anthrax in combination with appropriate antibacterial drugs and for prophylaxis of inhalational anthrax when alternative therapies are not appropriate or available. Furthermore, it was licensed as ANTHIM® (obiltoxaximab) in Canada in 2020, and as NYXTHRACIS® (formerly Obiltoxaximab SFL) in the EU in 2020 in adults and pediatric patients for the treatment of inhalational anthrax in combination with appropriate antibacterial drugs and for the post-exposure prophylaxis of inhalational anthrax when alternative therapies are not appropriate or available. ANTHIM® (obiltoxaximab) should only be used for prophylaxis when its benefit for prevention of inhalational anthrax outweighs the risk of hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis. The effectiveness of ANTHIM® (obiltoxaximab) is based solely on efficacy studies in animal models of inhalational anthrax. There have been no studies of the safety or pharmacokinetics (PK) of ANTHIM® (obiltoxaximab) in the pediatric population. Dosing in pediatric patients was derived using a population PK approach. ANTHIM® (obiltoxaximab) does not have direct antibacterial activity. As such, ANTHIM® (obiltoxaximab) should be used in combination with appropriate antibacterial drugs. ANTHIM® (obiltoxaximab) is not expected to cross the blood-brain barrier and does not prevent or treat meningitis.

​
Acquisition of Elusys 
​
On April 18, 2022, we closed the Merger contemplated by the Merger Agreement (the “Closing”). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, as merger consideration (“Merger Consideration”) we paid at the Closing a cash upfront payment of $3,000,000 to certain of the equity holders of Elusys (the “Sellers”) and assumed and contributed $867,646 to the payment of 50% of certain Elusys lease termination and employee severance payments. We have also paid to the Sellers (i) $2,000,000 and (ii) agreed to pay earn out payments for a period of 12 years from the date of Closing equal to 10% of the gross dollar amount of payments received during each one year period during such twelve year period with respect to any sale, license or commercialization anywhere in the world of ANTHIM® that either: (a) occurs during the first nine years after the Closing Date in any respect; or (b) occurs thereafter pursuant to any contract, agreement, commitment or order that is placed, granted, awarded or entered into during the first nine years after the Closing Date.
​
In addition, Elusys shareholders’ are to receive an additional payment of approximately $6.0 million, net from the fulfillment of an existing U.S. Government contract which we have agreed to fulfill the future obligations of Elusys under such contract and pass through and distribute to the Sellers the revenue that is received under such contract minus the costs associated with such fulfillment obligations, subject to certain adjustments to the Merger Consideration specified in the Merger Agreement, including income taxes payable with respect to such payments. The Merger Agreement further provides that eighty percent of any amounts paid to and received by Elusys after the Closing and prior to June 30, 2023 with respect to the sale of 1,500 pre-filled vials of ANTHIM® shall be paid to the Sellers, subject to certain adjustments specified in the Merger Agreement. We also agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain, finance, operate and promote ANTHIM® and maintain the existing government contract and to continue to operate the Elusys business so as to allow the Sellers to receive the Merger Consideration.
 ​
The Merger Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants of us, Elusys and the Merger Sub. Subject to certain customary limitations, the Sellers have agreed to indemnify us and our officers and directors against certain losses related to, among other things, breaches of Elusys’ representations and warranties, certain specified liabilities and the failure to perform covenants or obligations under the Merger Agreement.
 ​
The foregoing summary of the Merger Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Merger Agreement that was filed with the 8-K on April 18, 2022 .
​
Biothreat Advisory Board
​
In August 2021, we announced the formation of our Biothreat Advisory Board to support the development of our biosecurity/biodefense initiatives. The advisory board includes Greg Burel, David Lasseter, Former Deputy Asst. Sec. of Defense for Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction, Andrew Webber, Former Asst. Sec. of Defense for Nuclear, Chemical & Biological Defense Programs, Jack Kingston, Former US Representative, Secretariat of the Alliance for Biosecurity (current), Gregor Koblentz, PhD, Professor of Biodefense at George Mason University, Expert on Chemical and Biological Weapons, and Former US Senator (AR) Mark Pryor. This panel was assembled to provide ongoing guidance on the development and commercialization of our biodefense assets and platforms. 
​
RapidVax®: Preclinical Stage
Development Programs
Our biodefense efforts remain focused on identifying, manufacturing, and commercializing novel assets to combat emerging and existing biological threats through in-house discovery as well as external partnership and in-licensing opportunities such as Lytic Solutions, LLC.
​
In November 2018, we formed the discovery subsidiary Skunkworx (formerly known as Delphi Therapeutics, Inc.) to support in-house nomination of biologics for preclinical and clinical development. Our approach utilizes “Pocket Biologics” derived from diverse proprietary antibody and small protein libraries to identify and differentiate 

8



pharmacologically active “HotSpot” sites on proteins relevant to disease. Coupled with the integration of computational and bioinformatic analysis, the goal is to “improve” candidate selection and accelerate validation of innovative therapeutics and biodefense assets from discovery into preclinical development.
​
Skunkworx is designing RapidVax® as a flexible “plug-and-play” vaccine platform designed to leverage our vast experience developing gp96-based vaccines and couples the immune-activating properties of heat shock protein gp96 and the T-cell co-stimulator OX40L with a flexible antigen expression system to promote antigen-specific T-cell activation, the generation of long-lasting memory cells, and neutralizing antibody production via the interaction of T follicular helper cells with B cells. RapidVax is designed to utilize a common unprogrammed vaccine base that can be manufactured in bulk, stockpiled, and rapidly customized upon identification of a biological threat to enable an accelerated time to clinic and to harness shared development, clinical safety, and manufacturing synergies. 
​
Oncology
​
Prior to 2022, our focus was on the development of our oncology product candidates. More specifically, we were evaluating the potential of the gp96 platform immunotherapy HS-110 (viagenpumatucel-L) in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (“NSCLC”) and completed the enrollment of our Phase 2 trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of HS-110 in combination with either nivolumab (Opdivo®), a Bristol-Myers Squibb anti-PD 1 checkpoint inhibitor, or Merck’s anti-PD1 checkpoint inhibitor, pembrolizumab (KEYTRUDA®), for the treatment of patients with advanced NSCLC. In addition, we completed an open-label, single arm, Phase 1 clinical trial assessing safety and tolerability of PTX-35, a monoclonal antibody which was part of our TNF receptor superfamily member 25 (TNFRSF25) platform, in patients with advanced solid tumors refractory to, or ineligible for, or who refuse available standard of care. 
​
In our third quarter 2022 10-Q, we deprioritized our oncology program and the activities of our Heat Biologics I, Inc. and Pelican Therapeutics, Inc. (“Pelican”) subsidiaries to streamline operations to support the discovery, development, and commercialization of innovative medical countermeasures. In January 2023, we terminated all of our license agreements with the University of Miami, including all agreements associated with the gp96 and TNFRSF25 platforms. We are not pursuing further development of the gp96 based HS-110 (viagenpumatucel-L) and RapidVax programs.
​
Terminated License Agreements with University of Miami
From 2008 through 2020, we entered into the following eight (8) license agreements with the University of Miami, all of which notice of termination was provided by us to the University of Miami in January 2023, pursuant to which we or one of our subsidiaries was granted an exclusive, worldwide right to make, use or sell licensed materials based upon the patent-related rights set forth in the license agreements. Under the Agreements set forth in clauses (i)-(v) below, the licensees obtained exclusive rights to different patent families each directed to therapeutic compositions and methods related to targeting gp96.

​
Strategy
Our objective is to become a market leader in the development of innovative medical countermeasures, prioritizing American-made equipment, reagents, materials, and in-house biomanufacturing to streamline the commercialization and delivery of novel biodefense biologics to the U.S. and allied partners. We believe our integrated end-to-end ecosystem provides a strategic advantage by reducing dependency on external third-parties and accelerating our development programs. 
We consider expanded U.S. and international sales of our monoclonal antibody anthrax antitoxin ANTHIM® (obiltoxaximab) a driver of future company growth. To date, Elusys has received ~$151M USD and ~$6M USD in procurement contracts to provide ANTHIM® (obiltoxaximab) to the U.S. SNS and the Public Health Agency of Canada Office of Emergency Response Services Depot, respectively. We are actively engaging with new and existing government programs and considering potential investments with business partners to create and expand ANTHIM® (obiltoxaximab) deliveries. 
We believe there is a growing market need and deficient availability for large molecule biomanufacturing. Scorpius is expected to decrease our dependence on third-party CDMOs for the manufacture of ANTHIM® (obiltoxaximab) and other assets, and allows us to be opportunistic in offering excess capacity to third parties as a fee-for-service model to fill this market gap. Additionally, we anticipate Scorpius prioritization of American-made equipment, reagents, and materials paired with domestic sourcing of biomanufacturing expertise will make the organization competitive for U.S. government contracts and biodefense assets.
​
The key elements of our strategy are:
​

● | Establish a fully integrated biopharmaceutical company specializing in end-to-end development and delivery of medical countermeasures and specialty immune-stimulating products: The coordinated efforts of our subsidiaries Skunkworx, Elusys, and Scorpius form a drug development ecosystem designed to fuel innovation, from discovery to commercialization, with minimal reliance on external vendors. This capability offers the potential to translate our discoveries into therapeutics with increased efficiency and quality and without compromising our agility to pursue new innovations. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Maximize commercial opportunities for ANTHIM® (obiltoxaximab): We believe that ANTHIM® (obiltoxaximab) will continue to be a critical biodefense asset for stockpiling by the U.S. SNS and Public Health
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

10




Agency of Canada Office of Emergency Response Services Depot. We intend to be opportunistic in seeking strategic partnerships that maximize the economic potential of this asset and are in the process of completing the technology transfer to Scorpius for future biomanufacturing.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Maximize commercial opportunities for Scorpius Biomanufacturing, Inc: We launched Scorpius in October 2022 as a CDMO focused on developing bioanalytic, process development, and biomanufacturing capabilities to support our clinical and commercial pipeline. We are opportunistic in offering excess biomanufacturing capacity to third parties as a fee-for-service model and believe our prioritization of American-made equipment, reagents, and materials paired with domestic sourcing of biomanufacturing expertise will make the organization competitive for U.S. government contracts and biodefense assets.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Develop and obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates: Our biodefense efforts remain focused on identifying, manufacturing, and commercializing novel assets to combat unmet and emerging biological threats through in-house discovery, external partnership, and in-licensing opportunities. We anticipate future announcements related to ongoing discovery and development efforts as these programs progress. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Enhance our partnering efforts: We are continually exploring partnerships for licensing and other collaborative relationships and remain opportunistic in seeking strategic partnerships that maximize our economic potential and align with our objective to become a market leader in the development and commercialization of innovative medical countermeasures.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Further expand our broad patent portfolio: We have made a significant investment in the development of our patent portfolio to protect our technologies and programs, and we intend to continue to expand our portfolio. Our Elusys subsidiary owns or exclusively licenses a patent estate that covers our ANTHIM® product. We are also developing a patent estate for various new pre-clinical biodefense-related technologies developed by NightHawk or our Skunkworx subsidiary. We also maintain some legacy patent assets relating to gp96 and TNFRSF25 that are owned or co-owned by us and Pelican.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Manage our business with efficiency and discipline: We believe we have efficiently utilized our capital and human resources to develop and acquire our product candidates and programs and create a broad intellectual property portfolio. These resources form our drug development ecosystem. We use project management techniques to assist us in making disciplined strategic program decisions and to attempt to limit the risk profile of our product pipeline.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Obtain additional non-dilutive grant funding: To develop our technologies and assets more fully, we continually seek and access external sources of grant funding on our own behalf and in conjunction with our external partners to support the development of our pipeline.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Intellectual Property
Our goal is to obtain, maintain and enforce patent protection for our products, formulations, processes, methods and other proprietary technologies; preserve our trade secrets and exclusive rights in our unique biological materials; and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of other parties, both in the United States and in other countries. Our policy is to actively seek to obtain, where appropriate, the strongest intellectual property protection possible for our current product candidates and any future product candidates and our subsidiaries’ proprietary information and proprietary technology through a combination of contractual arrangements and patents, both in the United States and abroad. However, even patent protection may not always afford us with complete protection against competitors who seek to circumvent our patents. See “Risk Factors – Risks Related to Intellectual Property.”
We will continue to depend upon the skills, knowledge and experience of our scientific and technical personnel, as well as that of our advisors, consultants and other contractors, none of which is patentable. To help protect our proprietary know-how, which is not patentable, and for inventions for which patents may be difficult to enforce, we currently rely and will in the future rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect our interests. To this end, we require all of our employees, consultants, advisors and other contractors to enter into confidentiality agreements that 

11



prohibit the disclosure of confidential information and, where applicable, require disclosure and assignment to us of the ideas, developments, discoveries and inventions important to our business.
Elusys Intellectual Property
Elusys has an exclusive, fully paid up, worldwide patent license, dated June 30, 2003, from the Board of Regents of the University of Texas which grants Elusys the right to use for the manufacture, offer and sale of antibodies that bind immunologically to anthrax antigens under the patent rights held by the University of Texas under the U.S. patent application entitled “Neutralization of the Anthrax Toxin”, serial number 10/288,269 filed on November 5, 2001 (and subsequently issued by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office on November 4, 2008, serial number 7,446,182) and the U.S. patent application entitled "Antibodies With Increased Affinities For Anthrax Antigens", serial number 10/620,049 filed on July 15, 2003 (and subsequently issued by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office on March 8, 2011, serial number 7,902,344). The term of agreement continues until all patent rights have expired, unless terminated automatically due to bankruptcy or insolvency of Elusys or by mutual written agreement. ANTHIM® is covered by 5 US patents which are owned by Elusys or exclusively licensed from the Board of Regents of the University of Texas.
Elusys is the assignee of the U.S. patent application entitled “Antibodies that bind B. anthracis exotoxin, formulations thereof, and methods of use”, serial number 11/904,882 filed on September 28, 2007 (and subsequently issued by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office on January 10, 2012, serial number 8,093,360) and the U.S. patent application entitled “Methods of preventing or treating anthrax using anti-anthrax antibodies”, serial number 13/076,082 filed on March 30, 2011 (and subsequently issued by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office on December 31, 2013, serial number 8,617,548).
Emerging and Legacy Intellectual Property
​
NightHawk and Skunkworx hold 5 non-provisional, international (PCT) applications and approximately 10 U.S. provisional applications which covering emerging, pre-clinical biodefense-related technologies, including antibody-based assets related to the “Pocket Biologics” concepts. We also own approximately 30 patents and 30 patent applications, in the U.S., Europe, China, Japan, and other countries, which cover historical gp96 assets. Pelican owns about 20 patents and 20 patent applications, in the U.S., Europe, China, Japan, and other countries, which cover historical TNFRSF25 assets, including coverage of PTX35.
License Agreement with Shattuck Labs
In June 2016, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Shattuck Labs, Inc. (“Shattuck”) pursuant to which we licensed to Shattuck certain provisional patent applications and know-how related to fusion proteins to treat cancer and other diseases that were not being developed by us. Shattuck paid us an initial license fee of $50,000 and is obligated to pay us fees upon its receipt of sublicensing income, achievement of certain milestones and royalties upon sales of commercial products. The technology that was out-licensed to Shattuck is in the early stages of development and there is a low likelihood of success for any technology at such stage, and there can be no assurance that any products will be developed by Shattuck or that we will derive any revenue from Shattuck. In February 2023, we were notified by Shattuck that a milestone was met and we received an additional $100,000 in milestone payments.
External Manufacturing
We have historically relied on third-party manufacturers to produce and store our product candidates for clinical use and currently do not operate our own manufacturing facilities. In order to promote efficiency and reduce our reliance on third-party vendors, we have enhanced our in-house development of bioanalytic, process development and manufacturing capabilities and offer such services to third parties for fees. We have entered into a lease for a 20,144 square foot facility in San Antonio, TX to conduct such services. Our expansion in Texas is part of a company-wide-growth strategy to enhance efficiency and decrease our dependence on third-party vendors as we advance our commercial pipeline. Operations at the facility commenced in October 2022, and we expect to fill production capacity by transitioning our outsourced manufacturing and development in-house immediately, followed by contracting with external customers. However, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in these new operations.

ANTHIM® (obiltoxaximab) is a best-in-class monoclonal antibody antitoxin for anthrax. ANTHIM® (obiltoxaximab) received FDA approval and orphan drug exclusivity in 2016 for the treatment of inhalational anthrax, in combination with antibiotics, and as a prophylaxis when alternative therapies are not available or are not appropriate. ANTHIM® (obiltoxaximab) was also approved in 2020 and 2021 as the only licensed anthrax anti-toxin treatment in the EU, UK, and Canada. ANTHIM® (obiltoxaximab) is being manufactured by an external vendor, Lonza Sales AG (“Lonza”) and we are in the process of completing the tech transfer of this asset to Scorpius for future production. In 2015, Elusys entered into a bulk ordering agreement with Lonza for the commercial production of ANTHIM®. Under the agreement Lonza will manufacture ANTHIM® pursuant to purchase orders issued in accordance with forecasts that we provide. We will purchase ANTHIM® that meets agreed specifications in batches, with the price per batch varying according to the total number of batches ordered for serial production in a single manufacturing campaign. Once we agree to a schedule of services and pricing terms, we are obligated to purchase a minimum number of batches which may be reduced under certain circumstances. On March 31, 2022, we became obligated to purchase batches of ANTHIM® from Lonza. We may be obligated to pay certain fees to Lonza upon cancellation of purchase orders within a certain specified period of time prior to projected commencement of the applicable batch.

Competition
The pharmaceutical, biologics and diagnostic industry is highly competitive and characterized by several established large companies, mid-sized companies, as well as smaller companies like ours. If our competitors market products that are less expensive, safer, or more effective than any future products developed from our product candidates, or that reach the market before our approved product candidates, we may not achieve commercial success. Technological developments in our field of research and development occur at a rapid rate and we expect competition to intensify as advances in this field are made. We will be required to continue to devote substantial resources and efforts to our research and development activities. If we fail to stay at the forefront of technological change, we may be unable to compete effectively. 
Biodefense Competition
We anticipate our most significant competitor for ANTHIM® (obiltoxaximab) will be Emergent BioSolutions, Inc. (“Emergent”). Emergent is the provider of the anthrax antitoxin raxibacumab. Raxibacumab received FDA approval on December 14, 2012, while ANTHIM® (obiltoxaximab) received FDA approval on March 18, 2016. ANTHIM® (obiltoxaximab) and raxibacumab both inhibit the binding of anthrax toxin PA to its cellular receptors, preventing the intracellular entry of the anthrax lethal factor and edema factor, the enzymatic toxin components responsible for the pathogenic effects of anthrax toxin. Package inserts indicate that ANTHIM® (obiltoxaximab) has an affinity equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) of 0.33 nM compared to 2.78 nM for raxibacumab, and a potentially longer shelf life of 7 years compared to 5 years for raxibacumab. ANTHIM® (obiltoxaximab) and raxibacumab have both been supplied to the CDC’s strategic national stockpile. We are fulfilling a delivery order for the U.S. SNS this year and anticipate based on previous delivery orders and option agreements that ANTHIM® (obiltoxaximab) will continue to fulfill delivery orders as part of the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness & Response’s (ASPR) objective to diversify and acquire products with a longer shelf-life.
Internationally, ANTHIM® (obiltoxaximab) was approved as the only licensed anthrax antitoxin treatment in the EU and Canada in 2020 and in the UK in 2021. In Canada, the approval of ANTHIM® (obiltoxaximab) blocks future purchases of raxibacumab without Canadian Extraordinary-Use New Drug (EUND) approval. Furthermore, we completed delivery of an initial order of ANTHIM® (obiltoxaximab) to the Public Health Agency of Canada Office of Emergency Response Services Depot in 2022 and anticipate discission of future orders. Similarly, in the EU, orphan drug exclusivity (10 year) at the time of approval provides an advantage to ANTHIM® (obiltoxaximab) as we seek to support HERA’s (the European Health Emergency Preparedness and Response Authority) Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) stockpile initiatives in France, Finland, and Poland. We believe these approvals position ANTHIM® (obiltoxaximab) for increasing biosecurity preparedness in commercially approved ex-U.S. ally territories and we will be opportunistic in seeking strategic partnerships that maximize economic potential of this asset.

Contract Development Biomanufacturing Organization (CDMO) Competition
We formed Scorpius to develop bioanalytic, process development, and biomanufacturing capabilities for our clinical and commercial pipeline as well as to offer excess biomanufacturing capacity to third parties as a fee-for-service CDMO model. Scorpius is focused on cell- and gene-based therapies as well as large molecule biologics and provides a broad array of services prioritizing American-made equipment, reagents, and materials when possible. Scorpius pairs cGMP biomanufacturing and quality control expertise with cutting edge capabilities in immunoassays, molecular assays, and bioanalytical methods to support the advancement of clinical and commercial programs. 
​
We anticipate providing competition to established biomanufacturers including Lonza Group, Ltd and WuXi AppTec as well as recently announced biomanufacturing efforts from ThermoFisher Scientific, Inc. The COVID-19 pandemic revealed a critical shortage in U.S. biomanufacturing capacity. Historically, therapies could often take ~10 years to commercialize. However, with the implementation of Emergency Use Authorization, complex, effective vaccines can now advance through pipelines at record speed, contributing to new expectations for time to market, cost reduction, regulatory compliance, and good manufacturing performance. Considering the global cell and gene therapy clinical trials market size was valued at $9.2 billion in 2020 and is expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 22.3% from 2021 to 2028 per Grand View Research, we anticipate that a shortage of industry capacity may minimize the risk of direct competition. Additionally, we anticipate Scorpius prioritization of American-made equipment, reagents, and materials paired with domestic sourcing of biomanufacturing expertise will make the organization competitive for U.S. government contracts and biodefense assets. We formed the subsidiary Scorpius to focus on developing bioanalytic, process development and biomanufacturing capability to support our biotherapeutics and discovery pipeline. We plan to offer excess biomanufacturing capacity to third parties as a fee-for-service CDMO model. Scorpius is focused on cell- and gene-based therapies and large molecule biologics. We provide a broad array of biologics manufacturing, analytical and R&D services, offering services using American-made equipment, reagents, and materials. Scorpius couples cGMP biomanufacturing and quality control expertise with cutting edge capabilities in immunoassays, molecular assays, and bioanalytical methods to support the advancement of our development and commercial programs.
​
Government Regulation
FDA Approval Process
In the United States, pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, (the “FDC Act”), and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Biological products used for the prevention, treatment, or cure of a disease or condition of a human being are subject to regulation under the FDC Act, except the section of the FDC Act that governs the approval of new drug applications, or NDAs. Biological products are approved for marketing under provisions of the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, via a Biologics License Application, or BLA. However, the application process and requirements for approval of BLAs are very similar to those for NDAs, and biologics are associated with similar approval risks and costs as drugs. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending NDAs or BLAs, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties, and criminal prosecution.
Pharmaceutical product development for a new product or certain changes to an approved product in the U.S. typically involves preclinical laboratory and animal tests, the submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application, or IND, which must become effective before clinical testing may commence, and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the drug for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. Satisfaction of FDA pre-market approval requirements typically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity, and novelty of the product or disease.
Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation, and toxicity, as well as animal trials to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including good laboratory practices. The results of preclinical testing are 

14



submitted to the FDA as part of an IND along with other information, including information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls, and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Long term preclinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted.
A 30 day waiting period after the submission of each IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. If the FDA has neither commented on nor questioned the IND within this 30 day period, the clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin.
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug or biologic to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted: (1) in compliance with federal regulations; (2) in compliance with good clinical practice, or GCP, an international standard meant to protect the rights and health of patients and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators, and monitors; as well as (3) under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing on U.S. patients and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND.
The FDA may order the temporary or permanent discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time, or impose other sanctions, if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. The study protocol and informed consent information for patients in clinical trials must also be submitted to an institutional review board, or IRB, for approval. An IRB may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB’s requirements, or may impose other conditions.
Clinical trials to support NDAs or BLAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. In Phase 1, the initial introduction of the drug or biologic into healthy human subjects or patients, the product is tested to assess metabolism, pharmacokinetics, pharmacological actions, side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, early evidence on effectiveness. Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population to evaluate the effectiveness of the drug or biologic for a particular indication, dosage tolerance, and optimum dosage, and to identify common adverse effects and safety risks. If a compound demonstrates evidence of effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 evaluations, Phase 3 trials are undertaken to obtain the additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of patients, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to permit the FDA to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug or biologic and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product. In most cases, the FDA requires two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug or biologic. A single Phase 3 trial with other confirmatory evidence may be sufficient in rare instances where the study is a large multicenter trial demonstrating internal consistency and a statistically very persuasive finding of a clinically meaningful effect on mortality, irreversible morbidity or prevention of a disease with a potentially serious outcome and confirmation of the result in a second trial would be practically or ethically impossible.
After completion of the required clinical testing, an NDA or BLA is prepared and submitted to the FDA. FDA approval of the NDA or BLA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the United States. The NDA or BLA must include the results of all preclinical, clinical, and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the product’s pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture, and controls. The cost of preparing and submitting an NDA or BLA is substantial. The submission of most NDAs and BLAs is additionally subject to a substantial application user fee and the manufacturer and/or sponsor under an approved new drug application are also subject to an annual program fee. These fees are typically increased annually.
The FDA undertakes to perform an initial filing review within 60 days from its receipt of an NDA or BLA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of NDAs and BLAs. Most such applications for standard review drug or biologic products are reviewed within ten to twelve months; most applications for priority review drugs or biologics are reviewed in six to eight months. The FDA can extend these reviews by three months. Priority review can be applied to drugs that the FDA determines offer major advances in treatment or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. For biologics, priority review is further limited to products intended to treat a serious or life-threatening 

15



disease relative to the currently approved products. The review process for both standard and priority review may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider certain late-submitted information, or information intended to clarify information already provided in the submission.
The FDA may also refer applications for novel drug or biologic products, or drug or biologic products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to an advisory committee – typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts – for review, evaluation, and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. Before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. Additionally, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured. FDA will not approve the product unless compliance with current good manufacturing practice, or cGMP, is satisfactory and the NDA or BLA contains data that provide substantial evidence that the drug or biologic is safe and effective in the indication studied.
After the FDA evaluates the NDA or BLA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing, or information, in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA or BLA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or nine months depending on the type of information included.
An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug or biologic with specific prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of NDA or BLA approval, the FDA may require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, to help ensure that the benefits of the drug or biologic outweigh the potential risks. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use, or ETASU. ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patient registries. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. Moreover, product approval may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the product’s safety or efficacy. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained, or problems are identified following initial marketing.
Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA or BLA or NDA or BLA supplement before the change can be implemented. In order for Scorpius to manufacture ANTHIM® we will be required to obtain FDA approval for the change in manufacturing facility. An NDA or BLA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing NDA or BLA supplements as it does in reviewing NDAs or BLAs.
Post-Approval Requirements
Any products for which we receive FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among others, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, restrictions on promoting products for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the product’s approved uses, known as ’off-label’ use, limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and requirements for promotional activities involving the internet. Although physicians may prescribe legally available products for off-label uses if the physician deems that use to be appropriate in their professional medical judgment, manufacturers may not market or promote such off-label uses.
In addition, quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to applicable manufacturing requirements after approval to ensure the long-term stability of the product. cGMP regulations require among other things, quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation and the obligation to investigate and correct any deviations from cGMP. Manufacturers and other entities involved in the 

16



manufacture and distribution of approved products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort on production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of an approved BLA, including, among other things, recall or withdrawal of the product from the market. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. Other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval.
The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product. Discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements can have negative consequences, including adverse publicity, judicial or administrative enforcement, warning letters from the FDA, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, and civil or criminal penalties, among others. Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a product’s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures. Also, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our product candidates under development.
Additional Controls for Biologics
To help reduce the increased risk of the introduction of adventitious agents, the PHSA emphasizes the importance of manufacturing controls for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The PHSA also provides authority to the FDA to immediately suspend licenses in situations where there exists a danger to public health, to prepare or procure products in the event of shortages and critical public health needs, and to authorize the creation and enforcement of regulations to prevent the introduction or spread of communicable diseases in the U.S. and between states.
After a BLA is approved, the product may also be subject to official lot release as a condition of approval. As part of the manufacturing process, the manufacturer is required to perform certain tests on each lot of the product before it is released for distribution. If the product is subject to official release by the FDA, the manufacturer submits samples of each lot of product to the FDA together with a release protocol showing a summary of the history of manufacture of the lot and the results of all of the manufacturer’s tests performed on the lot. The FDA may also perform certain confirmatory tests on lots of some products, such as viral vaccines, before releasing the lots for distribution by the manufacturer. In addition, the FDA conducts laboratory research related to the regulatory standards on the safety, purity, potency, and effectiveness of biological products. As with drugs, after approval of biologics, manufacturers must address any safety issues that arise, are subject to recalls or a halt in manufacturing, and are subject to periodic inspection after approval.
Cell and Tissue-Based Biologics
Establishments that manufacture cell and tissue-based products must comply with the FDA’s current good tissue practices, or cGTP, which are FDA regulations that govern the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture of such products. The primary intent of the cGTP requirements is to ensure that T-cell and tissue-based products are manufactured in a manner designed to prevent the introduction, transmission and spread of communicable disease. FDA regulations also include requirements for a unified registration and listing system, donor screening and testing, adverse reaction reporting, and labeling.
Cell and tissue-based products may also be subject to the same approval standards, including demonstration of safety and efficacy, as other biologic and drug products if they meet certain criteria such as if the cells or tissues are more than minimally manipulated or if they are intended for a non-homologous use. Marketing of these products in the U.S. will require FDA approval under the BLA pathway as discussed above.

CDMO Regulatory Approval
We are required to comply with the regulatory requirements of various local, state, national and international regulatory bodies having jurisdiction in the countries or localities where we manufacture products or where our customers’ products are distributed. In particular, we are subject to laws and regulations concerning research and development, testing, manufacturing processes, equipment and facilities, including compliance with CGMPs, labeling and distribution, import and export, and product registration and listing. As a result, our facilities are subject to regulation by the FDA, as well as regulatory bodies of other jurisdictions where our customers have marketing approval for their products including, but not limited to, the EMA, ANVISA, Health Canada, and the Australian Department of Health. Scorpius is subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. Accordingly, Scorpius must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of an approved BLA, including, among other things, recall or withdrawal of the product from the market. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. Other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval.
​
We are also required to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, as discussed in “Environmental and Safety Matters” below. These regulatory requirements impact many aspects of our operations, including manufacturing, developing, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, import and export and record keeping related to customers’ products. Noncompliance with any applicable regulatory requirements can result in government refusal to approve facilities for manufacturing products or products for commercialization. 
 ​
Our customers’ products must undergo pre-clinical and clinical evaluations relating to product safety and efficacy before they are approved as commercial therapeutic products. The regulatory authorities having jurisdiction in the countries in which our customers intend to market their products may delay or put on hold clinical trials, delay approval of a product or determine that the product is not approvable. The FDA or other regulatory agencies can delay approval of a drug if our manufacturing facilities are not able to demonstrate compliance with CGMPs, pass other aspects of pre-approval inspections (i.e., compliance with filed submissions) or properly scale up to produce commercial supplies. The FDA and comparable government authorities having jurisdiction in the countries in which our customers intend to market their products have the authority to withdraw product approval or suspend manufacture if there are significant problems with raw materials or supplies, quality control and assurance or the product is deemed adulterated or misbranded. If new legislation or regulations are enacted or existing legislation or regulations are amended or are interpreted or enforced differently, we may be required to obtain additional approvals or operate according to different manufacturing or operating standards or pay additional fees. This may require a change in our manufacturing techniques or additional capital investments in our facilities.
 ​
The costs associated with complying with the various applicable local, state, national and international regulations could be significant and the failure to comply with such legal requirements could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business” for additional discussion of the costs associated with complying with the various regulations. Failure to comply with existing and future regulatory requirements could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Environmental and Safety Matters
 ​
Certain products manufactured by us involve the use, storage and transportation of toxic and hazardous materials. Our operations are subject to extensive laws and regulations relating to the storage, handling, emission, transportation and discharge of materials into the environment and the maintenance of safe working conditions. We maintain environmental and industrial safety and health compliance programs and training at our facilities.
 ​
Prevailing legislation tends to hold companies primarily responsible for the proper disposal of their waste even after transfer to third party waste disposal facilities. Other future developments, such as increasingly strict environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, and enforcement policies, could result in substantial costs and liabilities to us and could 

18



subject the handling, manufacture, use, reuse or disposal of substances or pollutants at our facilities to more rigorous scrutiny than at present.
​
Other U.S. Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
In the United States, our activities are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including but not limited to, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, for instance the Office of Inspector General, the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”), and individual U.S. Attorney offices within the DOJ, and state and local governments. For example, sales, marketing and scientific/educational grant programs must comply with the anti-fraud and abuse provisions of the Social Security Act, the false claims laws, the physician payment transparency laws, the privacy and security provisions of HIPAA, as amended by HITECH, and similar state laws, each as amended.
The federal anti-kickback statute prohibits, among other things, any person or entity, from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term remuneration has been interpreted broadly to include anything of value. The anti-kickback statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution. The exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchasing or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for protection under a statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor, however, does not make the conduct per se illegal under the anti-kickback statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances. Violations of this law are punishable by imprisonment, criminal fines, administrative civil money penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs.
Additionally, the intent standard under the anti-kickback statute was amended by the Affordable Care Act to a stricter standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively the ACA, provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act., as discussed below.
The civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person or entity that, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent.
Although we would not submit claims directly to payors, drug manufacturers can be held liable under the federal civil False Claims Act, which imposes civil penalties, including through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities (including manufacturers) for, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented to federal programs (including Medicare and Medicaid) claims for items or services, including drugs, that are false or fraudulent, claims for items or services not provided as claimed, or claims for medically unnecessary items or services; making a false statement or record material to payment of a false claim; or avoiding, decreasing or concealing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. Penalties for a False Claims Act violation include three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus mandatory civil penalties for each separate false claim, the potential for exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs and, although the federal False Claims Act is a civil statute, conduct that results in a False Claims Act violation may also implicate various federal criminal statutes. The government may deem manufacturers to have “caused” the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers or promoting a product off-label. Claims which include items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute are false or fraudulent claims for purposes of the False Claims Act. Our future marketing and activities relating to the reporting of wholesaler or estimated retail prices for our products, if 

19



approved, the reporting of prices used to calculate Medicaid rebate information and other information affecting federal, state and third-party reimbursement for our products, and the sale and marketing of our product and any future product candidates, are subject to scrutiny under this law. Pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies’ marketing of the product for unapproved, and thus non-reimbursable, uses.
HIPAA created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud or to obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises, any money or property owned by, or under the control or custody of, any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by trick, scheme or device, a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal anti-kickback statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
We may be subject to data privacy and security regulations by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct business. HIPAA, as amended by the HITECH Act, and their respective implementing regulations. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to business associates, defined as independent contractors or agents of covered entities, which include health care providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouse, that create, receive, or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities and business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, certain state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in specified circumstances, some of which are more stringent and many of which differ from each other in significant ways, thus complicating compliance efforts. Failure to comply with these laws, where applicable, can result in the imposition of significant civil and criminal penalties.
Additionally, the Federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act under the ACA, and its implementing regulations, require that certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biological and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to annually report to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid, or CMS, information related to certain payments or other transfers of value made or distributed to physicians and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, the physicians and teaching hospitals and to report annually certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Failure to submit timely, accurately, and completely the required information may result in civil monetary penalties. Certain states also mandate implementation of compliance programs, impose restrictions on pharmaceutical manufacturer marketing practices and/or require the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to healthcare providers and entities.
In order to distribute products commercially, we must also comply with state laws that require the registration of manufacturers and wholesale distributors of drug and biological products in a state, including, in certain states, manufacturers and distributors who ship products into the state even if such manufacturers or distributors have no place of business within the state. Some states also impose requirements on manufacturers and distributors to establish the pedigree of product in the chain of distribution, including some states that require manufacturers and others to adopt new technology capable of tracking and tracing product as it moves through the distribution chain. Several states have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state, make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials and other activities, and/or register their sales representatives, as well as to prohibit pharmacies and other healthcare entities from providing certain physician prescribing data to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for use in sales and marketing, and to prohibit certain other sales and marketing practices. All of our activities are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.
If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal and state healthcare laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to it, we may be subject to penalties, including without limitation, significant civil, 

20



criminal and/or administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, injunctions, private “qui tam” actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government, or refusal to enter into government contracts, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings, and the curtailment or restructuring of operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. If any of the physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we expect to do business is found to be not in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government funded healthcare programs. Ensuring business arrangements comply with applicable healthcare laws, as well as responding to possible investigations by government authorities, can be time- and resource-consuming and can divert a company’s attention from the business.
Strict data privacy laws regulating the collection, transmission, storage and use of employee data and consumers’ personally-identifying information are evolving in the EU, U.S. and other jurisdictions in which we operate. Outside of the U.S., the laws, regulations and standards in many jurisdictions apply broadly to the collection, use, and other processing of personal information. For example, in the EU, the collection and use of personal data is governed by the provisions of the General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”). The GDPR, together with national legislation, regulations and guidelines of the EU member states governing the processing of personal data, impose strict obligations on entities subject to the GDPR, including but not limited to: (i) accountability and transparency requirements, and enhanced requirements for obtaining valid consent from data subjects; (ii) obligations to consider data protection as any new products or services are developed and to limit the amount of personal data processed; (iii) obligations to comply with the data protection rights of data subjects; and (iv) obligations to report certain personal data breaches to governmental authorities and individuals. Data protection authorities from the different E.U. member states and other European countries may enforce the GDPR and national data protection laws differently, and introduce additional national regulations and guidelines, which adds to the complexity of processing European personal data. Failure to comply with the requirements of the GDPR and the related national data protection laws may result in significant monetary fines and other administrative penalties (the GDPR authorizes fines for certain violations of up to 4% of global annual revenue or €20 million, whichever is greater) as well as civil liability claims from individuals whose personal data was processed. Additionally, expenses associated with compliance could reduce our operating margins.
The GDPR also prohibits the transfer of personal data from the E.U. to countries outside of the E.U. unless made to a country deemed by the European Commission to provide adequate protection for personal data or accomplished by means of an approved data transfer mechanism (e.g., standard contractual clauses). Data protection authority guidance and enforcement actions that restrict companies’ ability to transfer data may increase risk relating to data transfers or make it more difficult or impossible to transfer E.U. personal data to the U.S.
Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidates for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the U.S. and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend, in part, on the extent to that third-party payors provide coverage, and establish adequate reimbursement levels for such products. In the U.S., third-party payors include federal and state healthcare programs, private managed care providers, health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price of a product or for establishing the reimbursement rate that such a payor will pay for the product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost- effectiveness of medical products, therapies and services, in addition to questioning their safety and efficacy. We may need to conduct expensive pharmaco-economic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our product candidates, in addition to the costs required to obtain the FDA approvals. Our product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the product. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on investment in product development.

Different pricing and reimbursement schemes exist in other countries. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. Other countries allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country.
The marketability of any product candidate for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, emphasis on managed care in the U.S. has increased and we expect the pressure on healthcare pricing will continue to increase. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
U.S. Healthcare Reform
In the U.S. and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and likely will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system directed at broadening the availability of healthcare, improving the quality of healthcare, and containing or lowering the cost of healthcare.
Some of the provisions of the ACA have yet to be fully implemented, while certain provisions have been subject to judicial and Congressional challenges. It is unclear how these challenges and other efforts to repeal and replace the ACA will impact our business in the future.
Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the U.S. since the ACA was enacted. Additionally, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs.
We cannot predict what healthcare reform initiatives may be adopted in the future. Further federal, state and foreign legislative and regulatory developments are likely, and we expect ongoing initiatives to increase pressure on drug pricing. Such reforms could have an adverse effect on anticipated revenues from product candidates and may affect our overall financial condition and ability to develop product candidates.
We anticipate that current and future U.S. legislative healthcare reforms may result in additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved product, if covered, and could seriously harm our business. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare and other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors.
Non-U.S. Regulation
Before our products can be marketed outside of the U.S., they are subject to regulatory approval of the respective authorities in the country in which the product should be marketed. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. No action can be taken to market any product in a country until an appropriate application has been approved by the regulatory authorities in that country. The current approval process varies from country to country, and the time spent in gaining approval varies from that required for FDA approval. In certain countries, the sales price of a product must also be approved. The pricing review period often begins after market approval is granted. Even if a product is approved by a regulatory authority, satisfactory prices might not be approved for such product.
In Europe, marketing authorizations may be submitted at a centralized, a decentralized or national level; however, the centralized procedure is mandatory for the approval of biotechnology products and provides for the grant of a single 

22



marketing authorization that is valid in all EU member states. There can be no assurance that the chosen regulatory strategy will secure regulatory approval on a timely basis or at all.
While we intend to market our products outside the U.S. in compliance with our respective license agreements, we have not made any applications with non-U.S. authorities and have no timeline for such applications or marketing.
Research and Development
We have built an internal and external research and development organization that includes expertise in discovery research, preclinical development, product formulation, analytical chemistry, manufacturing, clinical development, and regulatory and quality assurance. Sponsors of clinical trials of FDA-regulated products, including drugs, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information. Our cancer trials have been registered on clinicaltrials.gov. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigators, and other aspects of the clinical trial is then made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to discuss the results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed until the new product or new indication being studied has been approved. Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of development. Research and development expenses were $23.5 million and $16.5 million during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

We are a “smaller reporting company”, as defined in Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will cease to be a smaller reporting company if we have (i) more than $250 million in market value of our shares held by non-affiliates as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter or (ii) more than $100 million of annual revenues in our most recent fiscal year completed before the last business day of our second fiscal quarter and a market value of our shares held by non-affiliates more than $700 million as of the last business day of our second fiscal quarter. 
Human Capital
We believe that our success depends upon our ability to attract, develop, retain and motivate key personnel. Our management and scientific teams possess considerable experience in drug discovery, research and development, manufacturing, clinical and regulatory affairs and believe we directly benefit from this experience and industry knowledge. Our research team comprises B.S., M.S. and Ph.D.-level scientists with expertise in oncology, immunology, and molecular biology.
As of December 31, 2022, we had a total of 77 full-time employees, of which 29 are part of our research team located in San Antonio, Texas, 16 are part of our research team located in Morrisville, North Carolina, 5 are part of our research team located in New Brunswick, New Jersey, 3 are part of our research team located in Parsippany, New Jersey and 24 are part of our corporate team. We consider our relationships with our employees to be good. None of our employees is represented by a labor union. We anticipate that we will need to identify, attract, train and retain other highly skilled personnel to pursue our development program. Hiring for such personnel is competitive, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain our key employees or attract, assimilate or retain the qualified personnel necessary for the development of our business.
Although, management continually seeks to add additional talent to its work force, management believes that it has sufficient human capital to operate its business successfully. 
Our compensation programs are designed to align the compensation of our employees with our performance and to provide the proper incentives to attract, retain and motivate employees to achieve superior results. The structure of our compensation programs balances incentive earnings for both short-term and long-term performance. Specifically:

● | we provide employee wages that are competitive and consistent with employee positions, skill levels, experience, knowledge and geographic location;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | we engage nationally recognized outside compensation and benefits consulting firms to independently evaluate the effectiveness of our executive compensation and benefit programs and to provide benchmarking against our peers within the industry;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | we align our executives’ long-term equity compensation with our shareholders’ interests by linking realizable pay with stock performance;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | annual increases and incentive compensation are based on merit, which is communicated to employees at the time of hiring and documented through our talent management process as part of our annual review procedures and upon internal transfer and/or promotion; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | all employees are eligible for health insurance, paid and unpaid leaves, a 401K retirement plan with employer matching contributions (maximum of 4% match) and life and disability/accident coverage. We also offer a variety of voluntary benefits that allow employees to select the options that meet their needs.
