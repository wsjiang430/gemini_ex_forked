Business 
 ​
 Overview 
 Phibro Animal Health Corporation is a leading global diversified animal health and mineral nutrition company. We strive to be a trusted partner with livestock producers, veterinarians and farmers by providing solutions to help them maintain and enhance the health of their animals and produce healthy, affordable food while using fewer natural resources. We sell more than 1,500 product presentations in over 75 countries to approximately 3,500 customers. We develop, manufacture and market a broad range of products for food animals including poultry, swine, beef and dairy cattle and aquaculture. Our products help prevent, control and treat diseases, enhance nutrition to help improve health and contribute to balanced mineral nutrition. We sell animal health and mineral nutrition products either directly to integrated poultry, swine and cattle integrators or through commercial animal feed manufacturers, wholesalers and distributors. 
 Our products include: 
 •

 Animal health products such as antibacterials, anticoccidials, nutritional specialty products and vaccines that help improve the animal’s health and therefore improve performance, food safety and animal welfare. Our Animal Health segment also includes antibacterials and other processing aids used to improve production efficiency in the ethanol fermentation industry. 
 ​
 •

 Mineral nutrition products that fortify the animal’s diet and help maintain optimal health. 
 ​
 We have focused our efforts in regions where the majority of livestock production is consolidated in large commercial farms. We believe we are well positioned to grow our sales with our established network of sales, marketing and distribution professionals in markets in North America, Latin America, Asia Pacific, Europe and Africa. 
 We are investing resources to develop future products for the companion animal sector. Our business is currently concentrated in the livestock sector. 
 In addition to animal health and mineral nutrition products, we manufacture and market specific ingredients for use in the personal care, industrial chemical and chemical catalyst industries. We sell performance products directly to customers in the aforementioned industries. 
 Our Class A common stock trades on the Nasdaq Stock Market (“Nasdaq”) under the trading symbol “PAHC.” Our Class B common stock is not listed or traded on any stock exchange. We are a Delaware corporation.
 Unless otherwise indicated or the context requires otherwise, references in this report to “we,” “our,” “us,” “the Company,” “Phibro,” “PAHC” and similar expressions refer to Phibro Animal Health Corporation and its subsidiaries.

 MFAs and Other 
 Our MFAs and other products primarily consists of concentrated medicated products administered through animal feeds, commonly referred to as Medicated Feed Additives (“MFAs”). Our MFAs and other products primarily consists of the production and sale of antibacterials (including

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 Stafac®, Terramycin®, Neo-Terramycin® and Mecadox®) and anticoccidials (including Nicarb®, Aviax®, Aviax Plus™, Coxistac™ and amprolium). MFAs and other products also include antibacterial products and other processing aids, used to improve production efficiencies in the ethanol fermentation industry. 
 Approximately 50% of our MFAs and other sales in fiscal year 2019 were to the poultry industry, with sales to swine, cattle, dairy and other customers accounting for the remainder. We sell our MFAs and other products in all regions where we do business, with the largest region (as measured by net sales) accounting for approximately one-third of the product group’s net sales. 
 Nutritional Specialties 
 Many of our proprietary nutritional specialty products have been developed through basic research in cooperation with private research companies or by leading universities with whom we collaborate and then further develop through commercial trials with customers. Our nutritional specialty products include OmniGen-AF®, a patented nutritional specialty product that has been shown in several studies to help maintain a cow’s healthy immune system; Animate®, an anionic nutritional specialty product that helps optimize the health and performance of the transition dairy cow; Magni-Phi®, a proprietary nutritional specialty product that has been shown to help improve immune response in poultry; and, Cellerate Yeast Solutions®, a line of proprietary yeast culture products that are used in all classes of livestock to help improve digestive health, which may lead to improved animal health and performance. We sell our nutritional specialty products in the United States and various other countries internationally. 
 In August 2019, we acquired the business and assets of Osprey Biotechnics, Inc. (“Osprey”). Osprey is a developer, manufacturer and marketer of microbial products and bioproducts for a variety of applications serving animal health and nutrition, environmental, industrial and agricultural customers. Osprey also produces key components of our recently launched Provia PrimeTM direct fed microbial product for poultry. 
 Vaccines 
 Our vaccines products are primarily focused on preventing diseases in poultry and swine. We market vaccines in all regions in which we operate. We market our vaccine products to protect animals from either viral or bacterial disease challenges. 
 We have developed and distribute over 20 licensed vaccine presentations for prevention of diseases in poultry, including vaccines to protect against Infectious Bursal Disease, Infectious Bronchitis, Newcastle Disease, Salmonella and Coryza. 
 We develop, manufacture and distribute autogenous vaccines against animal diseases, primarily for swine, in the United States. Our autogenous vaccines allow us to produce custom vaccines for veterinarians that contain antigens specific to each farm, allowing Phibro to provide comprehensive health management solutions to our customers. Our autogenous vaccine products include the Tailor Made® line of vaccines and the MJPRRS® vaccine. We also market adjuvants to animal vaccine manufacturers. 
 We have developed TAbic®, an innovative and proprietary delivery platform for vaccines. TAbic is a patented technology for formulation and delivery of vaccine antigens in effervescent tablets, packaged in sealed aluminum blister packages. The technology replaces the glass bottles that are in common use today, and offers significant advantages including storage requirements, customer handling and disposal. Several of our vaccine products are available in the patented TAbic format. 
 We also focus on innovation to produce new antigens or new presentations of antigens, and have developed new vaccines, such as MB-1TM, a live attenuated vaccine for Infectious Bursal disease, developed from the M.B. strain, adapted for in-ovo or subcutaneous injection at the hatchery, the inactivated subunit Infectious Bursal Disease Virus and Egg Drop Syndrome vaccines, being sold as monovalent vaccines or in combinations with other antigens. 
 We are making operational a vaccine production facility in Sligo, Ireland to produce poultry vaccines, with longer-term expectations to add swine and cattle vaccines. The facility is currently idle.

 Our Mineral Nutrition business manufactures and markets approximately 400 formulations and concentrations of trace minerals such as zinc, manganese, copper, iron and other compounds, with a focus on customers in North America. Our customers use these products to fortify the daily feed requirements of their livestock’s diets and maintain an optimal balance of trace elements in each animal. We manufacture and market a broad range of mineral nutrition products for food animals including poultry, swine and beef and dairy cattle. Volume growth in the mineral nutrition sector is primarily driven by livestock production numbers, while pricing is largely based on costs of the underlying commodity metals. Demand for our mineral nutrition products can vary in different seasons of the year and due to changes in weather conditions in a particular region, both of which may cause animal feed consumption to fluctuate. As a result, we may experience regional and seasonal fluctuations in our Mineral Nutrition segment. 
Performance Products 
 Our Performance Products business manufactures and markets a number of specialty ingredients for use in the personal care, industrial chemical and chemical catalyst industries, predominantly in the United States.

 Antibacterials are biological or chemical products used in the animal health industry to treat or to prevent bacterial diseases, thereby promoting animal health, resulting in more efficient livestock growth. Several factors contribute to limit the efficiency, weight gain and feed conversions of livestock production, including stress, poor nutrition, environmental and management challenges and disease. Antibacterials help prevent, control and treat disease in livestock, which can also lead to improved overall health of the animals, improved rate of weight gain and more efficient feed conversion. Our antibacterial products include: 
 •

  Oxytetracycline and Neomycin. Terramycin® utilizes the active ingredient oxytetracycline and Neo-Terramycin® combines the active ingredients neomycin and oxytetracycline to prevent, control and treat a wide range of diseases in chickens, turkeys, cattle, swine and aquaculture. We sell Terramycin and Neo-Terramycin products primarily to livestock and aquaculture producers, feed companies and distributors. 
 ​
 •

  Virginiamycin. Virginiamycin is an antibacterial marketed under the brand names Stafac® to poultry, swine and cattle producers, Eskalin™ to dairy cows and beef cattle producers and V-Max® for beef cattle producers. Virginiamycin is used primarily to prevent necrotic enteritis in chickens, treat and control swine dysentery and aid in the prevention or reduce the incidence of liver abscesses in cattle. Our experience in the development and production of virginiamycin has enabled us to develop significant intellectual property through trade secret know-how, which has helped protect against competition from generics. We are the sole worldwide manufacturer and marketer of virginiamycin. 
 ​
 •

  Carbadox. We market carbadox under the brand name Mecadox® for use in swine feeds to control swine Salmonellosis and swine dysentery and, as a result, improve animal health and performance. Mecadox is sold primarily in the United States to feed companies and large integrated swine producers. 
 ​
 Anticoccidials are produced through fermentation or chemical synthesis, and are primarily used to prevent and control the disease coccidiosis in poultry and cattle, thereby promoting animal health, resulting in more efficient livestock growth. Coccidiosis is a disease of the digestive tract that has considerable health consequences to livestock and, as a result, is of great concern to livestock producers. We sell our anticoccidials primarily to integrated poultry producers and feed companies and to international animal health companies. Our anticoccidial products include: 
 •

  Nicarbazin. We produce and market nicarbazin, a broad-spectrum anticoccidial used for coccidiosis prevention in poultry. We market nicarbazin under the trademarks Nicarb® and Nicarmix® and as an active pharmaceutical ingredient. 
 ​
 •

  Amprolium. We produce and market amprolium primarily as an active pharmaceutical ingredient. 
 ​
 •

  Salinomycin and Semduramicin. We produce and market Coxistac®, Aviax®/Aviax Plus™/Avi-Carb® and Posistac™, which are in a class of compounds known as ionophores, to combat coccidiosis in poultry and increase feed efficiency in swine. 
 ​
 Anthelmintics are used to treat infestations of parasitic intestinal worms. Our anthelmintic products include Rumatel® and Banminth®, which are both marketed to control major internal nematode parasites in beef and dairy cattle and swine.

 Mineral Nutrition 
 Our mineral nutrition products principally include inorganic and organic compounds of copper, zinc, cobalt, iron, selenium, manganese, magnesium and iodine. Our mineral nutrition products also include GemStone®, our exclusive line of chelated organic trace minerals, including zinc, manganese, copper and iron glycine chelates. These organic trace minerals improve bioavailability for livestock production and are available in a highly concentrated, easy-flowing granule. 
 Our major mineral nutrition customers are regional and national feed companies, distributors, co-ops, premixers, integrated swine, beef and poultry operations and pet food companies. The majority of our customers have nutrition staffs who determine their own formulae for custom trace mineral premixes. 
 Trace mineral costs fluctuate with commodity markets, and therefore, these products are price-sensitive. Their sale requires a focused effort on cost management, quality control, customer service, pricing and logistics execution to be profitable. 
 Performance Products 
 Our Performance Products business manufactures and markets products for use in the personal care, industrial chemical and chemical catalyst industries. We operate the business through our PhibroChem (a division of PAHC), Ferro Metal and Chemical Corporation Limited and Phibro-Tech, Inc. (“Phibro-Tech”) business units. 
Sales and Marketing 
 Our sales organization includes sales, marketing and technical support employees. In markets where we do not have a direct commercial presence, we generally contract with distributors that provide logistics and sales and marketing support for our products. Together, our Animal Health and Mineral Nutrition businesses have a sales, marketing and technical support organization of approximately 350 employees plus approximately 200 distributors who market our portfolio of approximately 1,400 product presentations to livestock producers, animal feed companies and distributors in over 75 countries. 
 In direct sales markets, we sell our animal health and mineral nutrition products through our local sales offices, either directly to integrated poultry, swine and cattle integrators or through commercial animal feed manufacturers, wholesalers and distributors. Our sales representatives visit our customers, including animal feed companies, distributors and livestock producers, to inform, promote and sell our products and services. In direct service markets, our technical operations specialists provide scientific consulting focused on disease management and herd management, training and education on diverse topics, including responsible product use. 
 We sell our Performance Products through our local sales offices to the personal care, industrial chemical and chemical catalyst industries. We market these products predominately in the United States. 
 Customers 
 We have approximately 3,500 customers, of which approximately 3,200 customers are served by our Animal Health and Mineral Nutrition businesses. We consider a diverse set of livestock producers, including poultry and swine operations and beef and dairy farmers, to be the primary customers of our livestock products. We sell our products directly to livestock and aquaculture producers and to distributors that typically re-sell the products to livestock producers. We do not consider the business to be dependent on a single customer or a few customers, and we believe the loss of any one customer would not have a material adverse effect on our results. 
 We typically sell pursuant to purchase orders from customers and generally do not enter into long-term delivery contracts. 
 Product Registrations, Patents and Trademarks 
 We own certain product registrations, patents, trade names and trademarks, and use know-how, trade secrets, formulae and manufacturing techniques, which assist in maintaining the competitive positions of certain of our products. We believe that technology is an important component of our competitive 

 14

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 position, and it provides us with low cost positions enabling us to produce high quality products. Patents protect some of our technology, but a significant portion of our competitive advantage is based on know-how built up over many years of commercial operation, which is protected as trade secrets. We own, or have exclusive rights to use under license, approximately 250 patents or pending applications in more than 50 countries but we believe that no single patent is of material importance to our business and, accordingly, that the expiration or termination thereof would not materially affect our business. 
 We market our animal health products under hundreds of governmental product registrations approving many of our products with respect to animal drug safety and efficacy. The use of many of our medicated products is regulated by authorities that are specific to each country (e.g., the FDA in the United States, Health Canada in Canada and European Food Safety Authority (“EFSA”) and the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) in Europe. Medicated product registrations and requirements are country- and product-specific for each country in which they are sold. We continuously monitor, maintain and update the appropriate registration files pertaining to such regulations and approvals. In certain countries where we work with a third party distributor, local regulatory requirements may require registration in the name of such distributor. As of June 30, 2019, we had approximately 750 Animal Health product registrations globally, including approximately 400 MFA registrations and approximately 350 vaccine registrations. Our MFA global registrations included 94 registrations for virginiamycin. 
 Additionally, many of our vaccine products are based on proprietary master seeds, proprietary adjuvant formulations or patented virus grouping technology. We actively seek to protect our proprietary information, including our trade secrets and proprietary know-how, by seeking to require our employees, consultants, advisors and partners to enter into confidentiality agreements and other arrangements upon the commencement of their employment or engagement. 
 We seek to file and maintain trademark registrations around the world based on commercial activities in most regions where we have, or desire to have, a business presence for a particular product or service. We currently maintain, or have rights to use under license, approximately 1,600 trademark registrations or pending applications globally, identifying goods and services related to our business. 
 Our technology, brands and other intellectual property are important elements of our business. We rely on patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, as well as non-disclosure agreements, to protect our intellectual property rights. Our policy is to vigorously protect, enforce and defend our rights to our intellectual property, as appropriate. 
 Regulatory 
 Many of our animal health and mineral nutrition products require licensing by a governmental agency before marketing. To maintain compliance with these regulatory requirements, we have established processes, systems and dedicated resources with end-to-end involvement from product concept to launch and maintenance in the market. Our regulatory function seeks to engage in dialogue with various global agencies regarding their policies that relate to animal health products. For products that are currently subject to formal licensing by government agencies, our business relies on the ongoing approval and/or periodic re-approval of those licenses. Failure to maintain and, where applicable, renew those licenses for any reason including, but not limited to, changing regulations, more stringent technical, legal or regulatory requirements, or failure of the company or its agents to make timely, complete or accurate submissions, could result in suspension or loss of the company’s rights to market its products in one or more countries. 
United States 
 In the United States, governmental oversight of animal nutrition and health products is conducted primarily by the United States Department of Agriculture (“USDA”) and/or the FDA. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) has jurisdiction over certain products applied topically to animals or to premises to control external parasites and shares regulatory jurisdiction of ethanol manufactured in biofuel manufacturing facilities with the FDA. 
 The USDA and the FDA are the agencies responsible for the safety and wholesomeness of the U.S. human food supply. The FDA regulates foods intended for human consumption and, through the Center for Veterinary Medicine (“CVM”), regulates the manufacture and distribution of animal drugs 

 15

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 marketed in the U.S. including those administered to animals from which human foods are derived. All manufacturers of animal health pharmaceuticals marketed in the United States, must show their products to be safe, effective and produced by a consistent method of manufacture as defined under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. To protect the food and drug supply, the FDA develops technical standards for human and animal drug safety, effectiveness, labeling and Good Manufacturing Practice. The CVM evaluates data necessary to support approvals of veterinary drugs. Drug sponsors are required to file reports of certain product quality defects and adverse events in accordance with agency requirements. 
 The main regulatory body in the United States for veterinary pesticides is the EPA. The EPA’s Office of Pesticide Programs is responsible for the regulation of pesticide products applied to animals. All manufacturers of animal health pesticides must show their products will not cause “unreasonable adverse effects to man or the environment” as stated in the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act. Within the United States, pesticide products that are approved by the EPA must also be approved by individual state pesticide authorities before distribution in that state. Post-approval monitoring of products is required, with reports provided to the EPA and some state regulatory agencies. 
 FDA approval of Type A/B/C Medicated Feed Articles and drugs is based on satisfactory demonstration of safety, efficacy, manufacturing quality standards and appropriate labeling. Efficacy requirements are based on the desired label claim and encompass all species for which label indication is desired. Safety requirements include target animal safety and, in the case of food animals, human food safety (HFS). HFS reviews include drug residue levels and the safety of those residue levels. In addition to the safety and efficacy requirements for animal drugs used in food-producing animals, environmental safety must be demonstrated. Depending on the compound, the environmental studies may be quite extensive and expensive. In many instances, the regulatory hurdles for a drug that will be used in food-producing animals are at least as stringent as, if not more so than, those required for a drug used in humans. In addition, certain safety requirements relating to antimicrobial resistance must be met for antimicrobial products. 
 The CVM Office of New Animal Drug Evaluation is responsible for reviewing information submitted by drug sponsors who wish to obtain approval to manufacture and sell animal drugs. A new animal drug is deemed unsafe unless there is an approved New Animal Drug Application (“NADA”). Virtually all animal drugs are “new animal drugs” within the meaning of the term in the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. An approved Abbreviated New Animal Drug Application (“ANADA”) is a generic equivalent of an NADA previously approved by the FDA. Both are regulated by the FDA. The drug development process for human therapeutics can be more involved than that for animal drugs. However, because human food safety and environmental safety are issues for food-producing animals, the animal drug approval process for food-producing animals typically takes longer than for non-food-producing animals, such as companion animals. 
 The FDA may deny an NADA or ANADA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, require additional testing or information, or require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of a product. There can be no assurances that FDA approval of any NADA or ANADA will be granted on a timely basis, or at all. Moreover, if regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which it may be marketed. Finally, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur following initial marketing. Among the conditions for NADA or ANADA approval is the requirement that the prospective manufacturer’s quality control and manufacturing procedures conform to FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practice (“cGMP”) regulations. A manufacturing facility is periodically inspected by the FDA for determination of compliance with cGMP after an initial pre-approval inspection. Certain subsequent manufacturing changes must be approved by the FDA prior to implementation. In complying with standards set forth in these regulations, manufacturers must continue to expend time, monies and effort in the area of production and quality control to ensure compliance. The process of seeking FDA approvals can be costly, time consuming, and subject to unanticipated and significant delays. There can be no assurance that such approvals will be granted on a timely basis, or at all. Any delay in obtaining or any failure to obtain FDA or foreign government approvals, or the suspension or revocation of such approvals, would adversely affect our ability to introduce and market our products and to generate revenue.

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 The issue of the potential for increased bacterial resistance to certain antibiotics used in certain food-producing animals is the subject of discussions on a worldwide basis and, in certain instances, has led to government restrictions on the use of antibiotics in these food-producing animals. The sale of antibiotics is a material portion of our business. Legislative bills are introduced in the United States Congress from time to time that, if adopted, could have an adverse effect on our business. One of these initiatives is a proposed bill called the Preservation of Antibiotics for Medical Treatment Act, which has been introduced in almost every Congress since the mid 2000’s. To date, such bills have not had sufficient support to become law. Should statutory, regulatory or other developments result in restrictions on the sale of our products, it could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
 In November 2004, the CVM released a draft for comment of its risk assessment of streptogramin resistance for treatment of certain infections in humans attributable to the use of streptogramins in animals (the “risk assessment”). The risk assessment was initiated after approval of a human drug called Synercid® (quinupristin/dalfopristin) for treating vancomycin resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREf), which led to increased attention regarding the use of streptogramins in animals. Synercid and virginiamycin (the active ingredient in our Stafac product) are both members of the streptogramin class of antimicrobial drugs. The risk assessment was unable to produce any firm conclusions as to whether, and, if so, how much, the use of virginiamycin in food animals contributes to the occurrence of streptogramin-resistant infections in humans via a foodborne pathway. 
 In classifying streptogramins in 2003 as a “medically important antimicrobial” (“MIA”) on the CVM’s Guidance for Industry (“GFI”) 152 list, a guidance document for evaluating the microbial safety of antimicrobial new animal drugs on food for human consumption, the FDA’s stated concern was the potential impact on use of Synercid for treating VREf in humans. In 2010, the U.S. label for Synercid was changed and the VREf indication was removed. The FDA determined that data submitted by the sponsor of Synercid failed to verify clinical benefit of the product for the treatment of VREf infections in humans. We have requested that the FDA remove the streptogramin class of antimicrobials from GFI 152 to reflect that they are not “medically important” for human therapy, however, the FDA has declined our request. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in the future in gaining the FDA’s agreement with our view that streptogramins are no longer medically important and accordingly that this antimicrobial class should be removed from the GFI 152 list of MIAs. 
 Effective January 2017, the CVM’s revised Veterinary Feed Directive (“VFD”) regulations, which included changes to the control and use of antimicrobial products for use in animal feed, require that affected antimicrobial products may only be used if authorized by a veterinarian in accordance with the regulations. Prior to implementation of the revised VFD regulations, many approved antimicrobial products could be obtained and used without formal veterinary authorization. 
 In January 2017, the FDA and industry completed the process of label changes for MIA products to remove production claims and to limit the use of MIAs to those uses that are considered necessary for assuring animal health, namely for the prevention, control, and/or treatment of disease, and that MIA use in food-producing animals should include veterinary oversight or consultation. The label changes were the result of recommendations from the CVM, as described in GFI 213 (“New Animal Drugs and New Animal Drug Combination Products Administered in or on Medicated Feed or Drinking Water of Food-Producing Animals: Recommendations for Drug Sponsors for Voluntarily Aligning Product Use Conditions with GFI 209”) and GFI 209 (“The Judicious Use of Medically Important Antimicrobial Drugs in Food-Producing Animals”). We completed the process for label changes as described in GFI 213 by January 2017, within the timeline requested by the FDA. 
 In April 2016, the FDA began initial steps to withdraw approval of Mecadox (carbadox), due to concerns that certain residues from the product may persist in tissues for longer than previously determined. In July 2016, we submitted our data, analyses and information to the FDA that we believe support the continued safe use of Mecadox. In March 2018, the FDA indefinitely stayed the withdrawal proceedings; we continue to submit data to the FDA and respond to their questions. There is no timeline for the conclusion of this matter. The initial action by the FDA does not prohibit the sale or use of Mecadox in the United States. We have complete confidence in the safety of Mecadox. Mecadox has been approved and sold in the United States for more than 40 years and is a widely used treatment for controlling bacterial 

 17

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 diseases including Salmonella and swine dysentery. Mecadox is not used in human medicine and the class of drug is not considered a medically important antimicrobial. The approved Mecadox label requires a 42-day withdrawal period pre-harvesting, and to date we have not seen any hazardous residues of carbadox being detected from pig meat treated in accordance with the approved label. 
 The FDA routinely carries out audits related to cGMP standards for manufacturing facilities that make veterinary drug products and active pharmaceutical ingredients approved for sale in the U.S. The FDA inspectors may make observations during the course of these inspections, which may require corrective action in order for the manufacturing facility to remain in compliance with cGMP standards. Failure to take such corrective actions could result in the manufacturing facility being ineligible to receive future FDA approvals. In very serious cases of noncompliance with cGMP standards, the FDA may issue a warning letter which could result in products produced in such manufacturing facility no longer being eligible for sale in the U.S. Although it is our objective to remain in full conformance with U.S. cGMP standards, we have in the past received adverse observations and may in the future receive adverse observations or warning letters. Failure to comply with cGMP standards could have a material impact on our business and financial results. 
 European Union 
 European Union (“E.U.”) legislation requires that veterinary medicinal products must have a marketing authorization before they are placed on the market in the European Union. A veterinary medicinal product must meet certain quality, safety, efficacy and environmental criteria to receive a marketing authorization. The European Medicines Agency (and its main veterinary scientific committee, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Veterinary Use) and the national authorities in the various E.U. Member States, are responsible for administering this regime. 
 A separate E.U. regime applies to feed additives. It provides for a re-registration process for existing additives and this process is ongoing. For certain types of additives, the authorizations are not generic in nature (so that they can be relied upon by any operator) but are limited to the company that obtained the marketing authorization. They are known as Brand Specific Approvals (“BSA”). The system is similar to the U.S. system, where regulatory approval is for the formulated product or “brand.” 
 The EFSA is responsible for the E.U. risk assessment regarding food and feed safety. Operating under the European Commission, in close collaboration with national authorities and in open consultation with its stakeholders, the EFSA provides independent scientific advice and communication on existing and emerging risks. The EFSA may issue advice regarding the process of adopting or revising European legislation on food or feed safety, deciding whether to approve regulated substances such as pesticides and food additives, or developing new regulatory frameworks and policies, for instance, in the field of nutrition. The EFSA aims to provide appropriate, consistent, accurate and timely communications on food safety issues to all stakeholders and the public at large, based on the Authority’s risk assessments and scientific expertise. The containment of antimicrobial resistance is one of the key areas of concern for the EFSA, EMA, the European Commission and its Directorates, the European Parliament and European Member State Governments. 
 A number of manufacturers, including us, submitted dossiers in order to re-register various anticoccidials for the purpose of obtaining regulatory approval from the European Commission. The BSA for our nicarbazin product was published in October 2010. We sell nicarbazin under our own BSA and as an active ingredient for another marketer’s product that has obtained a BSA and is sold in the European Union. Similarly, a BSA for our semduramicin product, Aviax, was published in 2006 and required reauthorization in October 2016. We have submitted a dossier for reauthorization in accordance with the requirements of the EFSA and responded to request for additional information from the EFSA by submitting additional data. Because the EFSA’s requests were in addition to standard reauthorization requirements, the current BSA remains valid while the EFSA reviews the additional data we have submitted. There can be no guarantee that these submissions will be reviewed favorably or in a timely manner. Failure to gain reauthorization in a timely manner could have an adverse financial impact on our business. 
 In December 2018, the European Parliament and Council of the E.U. promulgated new veterinary medicinal products regulations known as E.U. 2019/6. The implementing act for these regulations has not yet been passed but includes rules that could require animals or animal origin products imported into the 

 18

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 E.U. from other countries to be produced under the same conditions as are required in the E.U. This may preclude the use of veterinary products not approved in the E.U. or require animal health products to be used in the manner approved in the E.U. If such restrictions are implemented, they could result in a reduction or elimination of the use of our products, especially our antibacterial products, in countries that export animals or animal derived products to the E.U. and other countries that align their regulations with E.U. regulations. 
Brazil 
 The Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock Production and Supply (“MAPA”) is the regulatory body in Brazil responsible for the regulation and control of pharmaceuticals, biologicals and medicinal feed additives for animal use. MAPA’s regulatory activities are conducted through the Secretary of Agricultural Defense and its Livestock Products Inspection Department. These activities include the inspection and licensing of both manufacturing and commercial establishments for veterinary products, as well as the submission, review and approval of pharmaceuticals, biologicals and medicinal feed additives. 
 Rest of world 
 We are subject to regulatory requirements governing investigation, clinical trials and marketing approval for animal drugs in many other countries in which our products are sold. The regulatory approval process includes similar risks to those associated with the FDA and European Commission approvals set forth above. 
 Global policy and guidance 
 Country-specific regulatory laws have provisions that include requirements for certain labeling, safety, efficacy and manufacturers’ quality procedures (to assure the consistency of the products), as well as company records and reports. With the exception of Australia, Canada, Japan and New Zealand, most other countries’ regulatory agencies will generally refer to the FDA, USDA, European Union and other international animal health entities, including the World Organization for Animal Health, Codex Alimentarius Commission, the recognized international standard-setting body for food (“Codex”), before establishing their own standards and regulations for veterinary pharmaceuticals and vaccines. 
 The Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives is an international expert scientific committee that is administered jointly by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and the World Health Organization. It provides risk assessments and safety evaluations of residues of veterinary drugs in animal products as well as exposure and residue definition and maximum residue limit proposals for veterinary drugs in traded food commodities. These internationally published references may also be used by national authorities when setting domestic standards. We work with the national authorities to establish acceptable safe levels of residual product in food-producing animals after treatment. This in turn enables the calculation of appropriate withdrawal times for our products prior to an animal entering the food chain. 
 In July 2014, the Codex adopted risk management advice language for a number of compounds including carbadox. The advice language states “authorities should prevent residues of carbadox in food. This can be accomplished by not using carbadox in food producing animals.” The advice language is to provide advice only and is not binding on individual national authorities, and almost all national authorities already have long-established regulatory standards for carbadox, including prohibiting the use of carbadox in swine production within their territory, prohibiting the importation of pork from swine that are fed carbadox, or permitting the importation of pork from swine that are fed carbadox provided there is no detection of carbadox residues in the meat. The advice language may be considered by national authorities in making future risk management determinations. To the extent additional national authorities elect to follow the advice and prohibit the use of carbadox in food-producing animals and/or the importation of pork from swine that are fed carbadox, such decisions could have an adverse effect on our sales of carbadox in those countries or in countries that produce meat for export to those countries. 
 Advertising and promotion review 
 Promotion of animal health products is controlled by regulations in many countries. These rules generally restrict advertising and promotion to those approved claims and uses that have been reviewed and 

 19

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 endorsed by the applicable agency. We conduct a review of promotion material for compliance with the local and regional requirements in the markets where we sell animal health products. 
Food Safety Inspection Service/Generally Recognized As Safe 
 The FDA is authorized to determine the safety of substances (including “generally recognized as safe” substances, and food and feed additives), as well as prescribing safe conditions of use. The FDA, which has the responsibility for determining the safety of substances, together with the Food Safety and Inspection Service, the food safety branch within the USDA, maintain the authority in the United States to determine that new substances and new uses of previously approved substances are suitable for use in meat, milk and poultry products. 
Competition 
 We are engaged in highly competitive industries and, with respect to all of our major products, face competition from a substantial number of global and regional competitors. Some competitors have greater financial, R&D, production and other resources than we have. Our competitive position is based principally on our product registrations, customer service and support, breadth of product line, product quality, manufacturing technology, facility location, and product prices. We face competition in every market in which we participate. Many of our products face competition from products that may be used as an alternative or substitute. 
 There has been, and there may continue to be, consolidation in the animal health market, which could strengthen our competitors. Our competitors can be expected to continue to improve the design and performance of their products and to introduce new products with competitive price and performance characteristics. There can be no assurance that we will have sufficient resources to maintain our current competitive position, however, we believe the following strengths create sustainable competitive advantages that will enable us to continue our growth as a leader in our industry: 
 Products Aligned with Need for Increased Protein Production 
 Increased scarcity of natural resources is increasing the need for efficient production of food animals such as poultry, swine and cattle. Our animal health products, including our MFAs, vaccines and nutritional specialty products, help prevent and manage disease outbreaks and enhance nutrition to help support natural defenses against diseases. These products are often critical to our customers’ efficient production of healthy animals. Our leading MFAs product franchise, Stafac/V-Max/Eskalin, is approved in over 30 countries for use in poultry, swine and cattle and is regarded as one of the leading MFA products for production animals. Our nicarbazin and amprolium MFAs are globally recognized anticoccidials. Our nutritional specialty product offerings such as OmniGen-AF and Animate are used increasingly in the global dairy industry, and Magni-Phi is rapidly becoming an important product for poultry producers. Our vaccine products are effective against critical diseases in poultry, swine and cattle. 
Global Presence with Existing Infrastructure in Key High-Growth Markets 
 We have an established direct presence in many important emerging markets, and we believe we are a leader in many of the emerging markets in which we operate. Our existing operations and established sales, marketing and distribution network in over 75 countries provide us with opportunities to take advantage of global growth opportunities. Outside of the United States, our global footprint reaches to key high growth regions (countries where the livestock production growth rate is expected to be higher than the average growth rate) including Brazil and other countries in South America, China, India and Southeast Asia, Russia and former CIS countries, Mexico, Turkey, Australia, Canada and South Africa and other countries in Africa. Our operations in countries outside of the United States contributed approximately 63% of our Animal Health segment revenues for the year ended June 30, 2019. 
Leading Positions in High Growth Sub-sectors of the Animal Health Market 
 We are a global leader in the development, manufacture and commercialization of MFA and nutritional specialty products for the animal health market. We believe we are well positioned in the fastest growing food animal species segments of the animal health market with significant presence in poultry and 

 20

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 swine, which are projected by Vetnosis to grow globally at compound annual rates from 2018 through 2023 of 5.7% and 2.6%, respectively. Our sales of MFA products were third largest in the animal health market. According to Vetnosis, MFA products are projected to grow at a compound annual rate of approximately 2.3% between 2018 and 2023. 
Diversified and Complementary Product Portfolio with Strong Brand Name Recognition 
 We market products across the three largest livestock species (poultry, cattle and swine) and aquaculture and in the major product categories (MFAs, vaccines and nutritional specialty products). We believe our diversity of species and product categories enhances our sales mix and lowers our sales concentration risk. The complementary nature of our Animal Health and Mineral Nutrition portfolio provides us with unique cross-selling opportunities that can be used to gain access to new customers or deepen our relationships with existing customers. We believe we have strong brand name recognition for the Phibro name and for many of our animal health and mineral nutrition products, and we believe Phibro vaccines are recognized as an industry standard in efficacy against highly virulent disease challenges. Our diverse portfolio of products also allows us to address the distinct growing conditions of livestock in different regions. 
Experienced Sales Force and Technical Support Staff with Strong, Consultative Customer Relationships 
 Within our Animal Health and Mineral Nutrition segments, utilizing both our sales, marketing and technical support organization of approximately 350 employees and a broad distribution network, we market our portfolio of more than 1,400 product presentations to livestock producers and veterinarians in over 75 countries. We interact with customers at both their corporate and operating level, which we believe allows us to develop an in-depth understanding of their needs. Our technical support and research personnel are also important contributors to our overall sales effort. We have a total of approximately 170 technical, field service and quality control/quality assurance personnel throughout the world. These professionals interface directly with our key customers to provide practical solutions to derive optimum benefits from our products. 
Experienced, Committed Employees and Management Team 
 We have a diverse and highly skilled team of animal health professionals, including technical and field service personnel located in key countries throughout the world. These individuals have extensive field experience and are vital to helping us maintain and grow our business. Many of our field team have more than 20 years of experience in the animal health industry and many have been with us for more than 10 years. 
 We have a strong management team with a proven track record of success at both the corporate and operating levels. The executive management team has diverse backgrounds and an average of approximately 20 years of experience in the animal health industry. 
 Employees 
 As of June 30, 2019, we had approximately 1,600 employees. Employees at our Guarulhos, Brazil facility are covered by a multi-employer regional industry-specific union. Certain of our Israeli employees are covered by site-specific collective bargaining agreements. Certain employees are covered by individual employment agreements. We believe our relations with union and non-union employees are good. 
Manufacturing 
 The Animal Health business segment manufactures many products internally and supplements that production with contract manufacturing organizations (“CMOs”) as necessary. 
 We manufacture active pharmaceutical ingredients for certain of our antibacterial and anticoccidial products in Guarulhos, Brazil and Braganca Paulista, Brazil. We manufacture active pharmaceutical ingredients for certain of our anticoccidial and antimocirobal products in Neot Hovav, Israel. We produce vaccines in Beit Shemesh, Israel and Omaha, Nebraska. We produce adjuvants in 

 21

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 Omaha, Nebraska. We produce pharmaceuticals, disinfectants and other animal health products in Petach Tikva, Israel. We produce certain of our major nutritional specialty and mineral nutrition products in Quincy and Chillicothe, Illinois, and we produce certain of our mineral nutrition products in Omaha, Nebraska. 
 We supplement internal manufacturing and production capabilities with CMOs. We purchase certain active pharmaceutical ingredients for other medicated products from CMOs in China, India, Mexico and other locations. We then formulate the final dosage form in our facilities and in contract facilities located in Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Israel, Malaysia, Mexico, South Africa and the United States. 
 We purchase certain raw materials necessary for the commercial production of our products from a variety of third-party suppliers. Such raw materials are generally available from multiple sources, are purchased worldwide and are normally available in quantities adequate to meet the needs of the Company’s business. 
 We believe that our existing facilities, as supplemented by CMOs, are adequate for our current requirements and for our operations in the foreseeable future. 
 Research and Development 
 Most of our manufacturing facilities have chemists and technicians on staff involved in product development, quality assurance, quality control and providing technical services to customers. Research, development and technical service efforts are conducted by our veterinarians (DVMs) and nutritionists at various facilities. 
We operate Animal Health R&D and product testing at our facilities in: Guarulhos, Brazil; Beit Shemesh, Israel; Neot Hovav, Israel; Ma’ayan Tzvi, Israel; Quincy, Illinois; Corvallis, Oregon; State College, Pennsylvania; Manhattan, Kansas; St. Paul, Minnesota; and Omaha, Nebraska. 
 These facilities provide R&D services relating to: fermentation development and micro-biological strain improvement; vaccine development; chemical synthesis and formulation development; nutritional specialty product development; and ethanol-related products. 
Environmental, Health and Safety 
 Our operations and properties are subject to Environmental Laws (as defined below) and regulations. We have incurred, and will continue to incur, expenses to attain and maintain compliance with Environmental Laws. While we believe that our operations are currently in material compliance with Environmental Laws, we have, from time to time, received notices of violation from governmental authorities, and have been involved in civil or criminal action for such violations, including for odor releases in Guarulhos, Brazil. Additionally, at various sites, our subsidiaries are engaged in continuing investigation, remediation and/or monitoring to address contamination associated with historical operations. We maintain accruals for costs and liabilities associated with Environmental Laws, which we currently believe are adequate. In many instances, it is difficult to predict the ultimate costs under Environmental Laws and the time period during which such costs are likely to be incurred. 
 Governmental authorities have the power to enforce compliance with their regulations. Violators of Environmental Laws may be subject to civil, criminal and administrative penalties, injunctions or both. Failure to comply with Environmental Laws may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of operations and/or permits, limitations on production, or increased operating costs. In addition, private plaintiffs may initiate lawsuits for personal injury, property damage, diminution in property value or other relief as a result of our operations. Environmental Laws, and the interpretation or enforcement thereof, are subject to change and may become more stringent in the future, potentially resulting in substantial future costs or capital or operating expenses. We devote considerable resources to complying with Environmental Laws and managing environmental liabilities. We have developed programs to identify requirements under and maintain compliance with Environmental Laws; however, we cannot predict with certainty the impact of increased and more stringent regulation on our operations, future capital expenditure requirements, or 

 22

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 the cost of compliance. Based upon our experience to date, we believe that the future cost of compliance with existing Environmental Laws, and liabilities for known environmental claims pursuant to such Environmental Laws, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows or liquidity. 
Environmental Health and Safety Regulations 
 The following summarizes the principal Environmental Laws affecting our business. 
  Waste Management. Our operations are subject to statutes and regulations addressing the contamination by, and management of, hazardous substances and solid and hazardous wastes. In the United States, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended (“CERCLA”), also known as the “Superfund” law, and comparable state laws, generally impose strict joint and several liability for costs of investigation and remediation and related liabilities, on defined classes of “potentially responsible parties” (“PRPs”). PRPs can be required to bear all of such costs regardless of fault, the legality of the original disposal or ownership of the disposal site. We have been, and may become, subject to liability under CERCLA for cleanup costs or investigation or clean up obligations or related third-party claims in connection with releases of hazardous substances at or from our current or former sites or offsite waste disposal facilities used by us, including those caused by predecessors or relating to divested properties or operations. 
 We must also comply with the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, as amended (“RCRA”), and comparable state laws regulating the treatment, storage, disposal, remediation and transportation of solid and hazardous wastes. These laws impose management requirements on generators and transporters of such wastes and on the owners and operators of treatment, storage and disposal facilities. As current or historic recyclers of chemical waste, certain of our subsidiaries have been, and are likely to be, the focus of extensive compliance reviews by environmental regulatory authorities under RCRA. Our subsidiary Phibro-Tech currently has a RCRA operating permit for its Santa Fe Springs, California facility, for which a renewal application is under review. Phibro-Tech initially submitted an application for renewal of its permit for the Santa Fe Springs facility in 1996. We are unable to predict when the State of California will issue a draft permit for public review and comment. Until the State of California issues its final decision on the renewal application, the facility is continuing to operate under the exiting permit. In addition, because we or our subsidiaries have closed several facilities that had been the subject of RCRA permits, we or our subsidiaries have been and will be required to investigate and remediate certain environmental contamination conditions at these shutdown plant sites within the requirements of RCRA corrective action programs. 
  Federal Water Pollution Control Act, as amended. We must comply with regulations related to the discharge of pollutants to the waters of the United States without governmental authorization, including those pursuant to the Federal Water Pollution Control Act. 
  Chemical Product Registration Requirements. We must comply with regulations related to the testing, manufacturing, labeling, registration and safety analysis of our products in order to distribute many of our products, including, for example, in the United States, the federal Toxic Substances Control Act and Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act, and in the European Union, the Regulation on Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemical Substances (“REACH”). 
  Air Emissions. Our operations are subject to the U.S. Clean Air Act (the “CAA”) and comparable U.S. state and foreign statutes and regulations, which regulate emissions of various air pollutants and contaminants. Certain of the CAA’s regulatory programs are the subject of ongoing review and/or are subject to ongoing litigation, such as the rules establishing new Maximum Achievable Control Technology for industrial boilers; significant expenditures may be required to meet current and emerging air quality standards. Regulatory agencies can also impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance with air permits or other air quality regulations. States may choose to set more stringent air emissions rules than those in the CAA. State, national and international authorities have also issued requirements focusing on greenhouse gas reductions. In the United States, the EPA has promulgated federal greenhouse gas regulations under the CAA affecting certain sources. In addition, a number of state, local 

 23

  TABLE OF CONTENTS
 and regional greenhouse gas initiatives are also being developed or are already in place. In Israel and Brazil, implementation of the Kyoto Protocol requirements regarding greenhouse gas emission reductions consists of energy efficiency regulations, carbon dioxide emissions allowances trading and renewable energy requirements. 
Capital Expenditures 
 We have incurred and expect to continue to incur costs to maintain compliance with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. Our capital expenditures relating to environmental, health and safety regulations were $5.4 million for fiscal year ended June 30, 2019. We estimate that our capital expenditures for compliance will be $6.4 million and $4.6 million for fiscal years 2020 and 2021, respectively; however, these estimates are subject to change given the uncertainty of future Environmental Laws and the interpretation and enforcement thereof, as further described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our environmental capital expenditure plans cover, among other things, the currently expected costs associated with known permit requirements relating to facility improvements. 
Contamination and Hazardous Substance Risks 
  Investigation, Remediation and Monitoring Activities. Certain of PAHC’s subsidiaries that are currently or were historically engaged in recycling and other activities involving hazardous materials have been required to perform site investigations at their active, closed and former facilities and neighboring properties. Contamination of soil, groundwater and other environmental media has been identified or is suspected at several of these locations, including Santa Fe Springs, California; Powder Springs, Georgia; Union, Illinois; Sewaren, New Jersey; Sumter, South Carolina; and Joliet, Illinois, and regulatory authorities have required, and will continue to require, further investigation, corrective action and monitoring over future years. These subsidiaries also have been, and in the future may be, required to undertake additional capital improvements as part of these actions. In addition, RCRA and other applicable statutes and regulations require these subsidiaries to develop closure and post-closure plans for their facilities and in the event of a facility closure, obtain a permit that sets forth a closure plan for investigation, remediation and monitoring and requires post-closure monitoring and maintenance for up to 30 years. We believe we are in material compliance with these requirements and maintain adequate reserves to complete remediation and monitoring obligations at these locations. 
 In connection with past acquisitions and divestitures, we have undertaken certain indemnification obligations that require us, or may in the future require us, to conduct or finance environmental cleanups at sites we no longer own or operate. Under the terms of the sale of the former facility in Joliet, Illinois, Phibro-Tech remains responsible for any required investigation and remediation of the site attributable to conditions at the site at the time of the February 2011 sale date, and we believe we have sufficient reserves to cover the cost of the remediation. 
  PRP at Omega Chemical Superfund Site. The EPA is investigating and planning for the remediation of offsite contaminated groundwater that has migrated from the Omega Chemical Corporation Superfund Site (“Omega Chemical Site”), which is upgradient of Phibro-Tech’s Santa Fe Springs, California facility. The EPA has named Phibro-Tech and certain other subsidiaries of PAHC as PRPs due to groundwater contamination from Phibro-Tech’s Santa Fe Springs facility that has allegedly commingled with contaminated groundwater from the Omega Chemical Site. In September 2012, the EPA notified approximately 140 PRPs, including Phibro-Tech and the other subsidiaries, that they have been identified as potentially responsible for remedial action for the groundwater plume affected by the Omega Chemical Site and for EPA oversight and response costs. Phibro-Tech contends that any groundwater contamination at its site is localized and due to historical operations that pre-date Phibro-Tech and/or contaminated groundwater that has migrated from upgradient properties. In addition, a successor to a prior owner of the Phibro-Tech site has asserted that PAHC and Phibro-Tech are obligated to provide indemnification for its potential liability and defense costs relating to the groundwater plume affected by the Omega Chemical Site. Phibro-Tech has vigorously contested this position and has asserted that the successor to the prior owner is required to indemnify Phibro-Tech for its potential liability and defense costs. Furthermore, a group of companies that sent chemicals to the Omega Chemical Site for processing and recycling has filed a complaint under CERCLA and RCRA in the United States District Court for the Central District of 

 24

  TABLE OF CONTENTS​
 California against many of the PRPs allegedly associated with the groundwater plume affected by the Omega Chemical Site (including Phibro-Tech) for contribution toward past and future costs associated with the investigation and remediation of the groundwater plume affected by the Omega Chemical Site. Due to the ongoing nature of the EPA’s investigation, the preliminary stage of the ongoing litigation and Phibro-Tech’s dispute with the prior owner’s successor, at this time we cannot predict with any degree of certainty what, if any, liability Phibro-Tech or the other subsidiaries may ultimately have for investigation, remediation and the EPA oversight and response costs associated with the affected groundwater plume. 
  Potential Claims. In addition to cleanup obligations, we could also be held liable for any and all consequences arising out of human exposure to hazardous substances or other environmental damage, which liability may not be covered by insurance. 
  Environmental Accruals and Financial Assurance. We have established environmental accruals to cover known remediation and monitoring costs at certain of our current and former facilities. Our accruals for environmental liabilities are recorded by calculating our best estimate of probable and reasonably estimable future costs using current information that is available at the time of the accrual. Our accruals for environmental liabilities totaled $5.9 million and $6.8 million as of June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. 
 In certain instances, regulatory authorities have required us to provide financial assurance for estimated costs of remediation, corrective action, monitoring and closure and post-closure plans. Our subsidiaries, in most instances, have chosen to provide the required financial assurance by means of surety bonds or letters of credit, issued pursuant to our revolving credit facility. As of June 30, 2019, surety bonds and letters of credit provided $11.7 million of financial assurance. 
 Workplace Health and Safety 
 We are committed to manufacturing safe products and achieving a safe workplace. Our Environmental Health and Safety (“EHS”) Global Director, along with regional and site-based EHS professionals, manage environmental, health and safety matters throughout the Company. The site managers are responsible for implementing the established EHS controls. To protect employees, we have established health and safety policies, programs and processes at all our manufacturing sites. An external EHS audit is performed at each of our sites as needed based on the conditions at the respective sites.
