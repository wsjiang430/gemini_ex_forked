ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Our Business
 Ranpak is a leading provider of environmentally sustainable, systems-based, product protection and end-of-line automation solutions for e-commerce and industrial supply chains. Since our inception in 1972, we have delivered high quality protective packaging solutions, while maintaining our commitment to environmental sustainability. We differentiate ourselves by our:
•Distinct Business Model. Our paper-based Protective Packaging Solutions (“PPS”) business utilizes a razor/razor-blade model where our proprietary PPS systems are provided to our distributors and certain select end-users for a nominal user fee, charged on a per-unit basis, and are coupled with the sale of high-margin value-added paper consumables that work exclusively with our PPS systems. Use of other suppliers’ paper on our PPS systems increases the likelihood of negative operating consequences, such as jamming, ineffective yield, and/or other performance deficiencies. We retain ownership of most of our PPS systems. This business model is designed to generate attractive margins that are recurring in nature through the sale of our paper consumables. Our business is global, with a strong presence in the U.S. and Europe along with an expanding footprint in Asia, serving end-users in approximately 57 countries across 6 continents. End-users rely on our paper consumables for use exclusively with our installed base of systems.


•Environmentally Sustainable Product Portfolio. Our paper packaging materials are fiber-based, biodegradable, renewable, and curb-side recyclable to customers. Our paper packaging materials contain little or no plastic or other resin-based inputs. Additionally, a majority of our paper packaging materials are manufactured from entirely or partially recycled content. In 2022, approximately 54.5% of our raw paper supply was Forest Stewardship Council (“FSC”) certified. Through our proprietary PPS systems and value-added kraft paper consumables, we offer a reliable, fast, and effective suite of protective packaging solutions. We believe that preference for environmentally sustainable packaging solutions will be a key driver of growth moving forward, particularly to the extent plastics and other resin-based solutions come under increasing public scrutiny. 
 •Attractive Financial Profile. We historically have benefited from consistently strong growth in net revenue and our installed base, net revenue that is recurring in nature, attractive profit margins, and substantial free cash flow conversion. Our capital expenditures per PPS system and each system’s long protective useful life result in attractive payback periods and returns on invested capital. Our sales are geographically diverse, with 43.3% of our 2022 net revenue generated from end-users in North America, 46.5% generated from end-users in Europe, and 10.2% generated from end-users in Asia and other locations.
 •Diversified End-User Base. Through our extensive distributor network and select direct sales, we have over 139,100 installed systems serving over 36,000 end-users across diversified and growing end-user markets, as of December 31, 2022. We have a full suite of paper-based PPS systems to meet the needs of a variety of end-users, from small businesses to global corporations. These end-users include leading e-Commerce companies, as well as suppliers and sellers of automotive after-market parts, information technology (“IT”)/electronics, machinery, home goods, industrial, warehousing/transport services, healthcare, and other products.
 •Well Established, Long-Term Distributor Relationships. We have arrangements with approximately 300 distributors globally, which enable us to reach thousands of small and medium-sized end-users while maintaining an asset-light capital base and a lean sales force. We have long-term, established relationships with our distributors and the continuity of these relationships evidences the strength of our business model, as well as the value proposition we provide for our distributors and end-users. Furthermore, the depth and longevity of these relationships have created a distributor network that is highly knowledgeable and well versed in conveying the benefits of our systems to new and existing end-users. Moreover, substantially all of our net revenue from distributors is generated by those who have agreed to sell our products exclusively and not to sell or promote our competitors’ paper-based solutions. 
 •Reputation as a Reliable Leader in Comprehensive Fiber-Based Solutions. We believe our PPS systems are known for their reliability, speed, and total cost effectiveness. We work hand-in-hand with our distributors or, on a selective basis, directly with some end-users to ensure that end-users obtain a solution that meets their specific needs, whether that be a single unit for a low volume end-user or a highly-customized base of hundreds of units across multiple facilities for a high-volume end-user. Furthermore, through our distributors, we strive to ensure that our end-users are consistently supplied with our paper consumables on-time and that their PPS systems are running with minimal downtime. Most importantly, we, either directly or with our distributors, work with end-users to examine their end-of-line operations to maximize throughput, minimize cost and reduce breakage. 
 •Unique Approach to Automation. Our Automated Paper Solutions (“APS”) and Automated Solutions (“AS”) (collectively, “Automation”) product lines provide end-of-line automation systems that solve two distinct challenges facing end-users of our products: 
 •Automated Dunnage Insertion. Our APS systems pair three-dimensional computer vision with Ranpak converters to automatically determine the optimal amount of void-fill or wrapping necessary to protect the product or products being shipped and then dispense that optimal amount into a box prior to its being sealed by our automated solution. These systems reduce the total cost of ownership for our end-users by reducing labor and dunnage costs. 
 •Automated Box-Sizing. Our AS systems include several automated box-sizing solutions and corrugated case erectors to tailor the size of the corrugated box to the size of the product or products being shipped. These systems allow our end-users to both reduce their void-fill needs and optimize their logistics with smaller boxes while reducing labor costs. 
 These solutions offer end-users numerous benefits including the reduction of shipping costs, waste, and labor, resulting in improved efficiency.
 •Multiple Drivers of Growth. We believe that our business benefits from multiple factors that will drive our future growth:
 •Growth of E-commerce. E-commerce is a significant growth driver in our business. Approximately 31.0% of our net revenue is derived from sales to e-commerce end-users, and the overall e-commerce market demonstrated compound annual growth in the high teens from 2015 to 2019. E-commerce activity increased further beginning in 2020 due to the growth experienced during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. While such growth slowed in 2022, we continue to believe that global investment in e-commerce provides a significant tailwind for us. 


•Focus on Sustainability. Additionally, we believe both our end-users and consumers, generally, are demonstrating an increasing preference for environmentally sustainable solutions. We believe that these increasing preferences in favor of environmental sustainability will also be a significant driver of our continued growth. We believe our investments into paper innovations help close the price gap for sustainable solutions and provide an important tailwind for continued growth.
 •Demand for Automation. Our Automation product lines provide significant improvements to end-of-line packaging speed and lower labor costs for many high-volume businesses. As businesses become more sophisticated, we believe many will look for ways to improve production efficiencies driving further demand for automated solutions.
 •Expansion into Cold Chain. We believe businesses and consumers are increasingly demonstrating preferences for environmentally sustainable cold chain solutions to keep food and beverages cold during transit. We have expanded our offering to include fiber-based liners and sustainable plant-based cool packs to keep perishable goods cool while they are being delivered to consumers.
 •Expansion into Retail Channel and Consumables. We believe the retail channel provides a substantial opportunity for consumable versions of our existing Wrapping product line. We also believe significant opportunity exists to sell environmentally friendly packaging alternatives directly to consumers.
 •Continued Product Development and Innovation. We believe our ability to consistently innovate and add products to our portfolio through internal development and mergers and acquisitions (“M&A”) will provide us with additional growth opportunities.
 •Geographic Expansion. Historically, geographic expansion has fueled our growth, and we believe further geographic expansion will continue to drive our future growth.
 •Keen Focus on Innovation and Strategic Investments. We believe we are a leading innovator in packaging material, packaging systems and manufacturing technologies. Our solutions deliver automation, productivity and sustainability enhancements to our end-users’ operations. Through our robust research and development (“R&D”) pipeline, we plan to continue to improve our value proposition by rolling-out next generation products to improve performance and efficiency as well as expanding product lines adapted to continuously evolving consumer and business preferences. We work to respond to customer needs and develop innovative products and solutions that improve supply chain performance, reduce costs and environmental impact, and deliver value. Our recent innovations include:
 •2022
 •Globally launched Flap’it!, a new solution in our AS product suite
 •Globally launched the next generation of the Cut’it! EVO solution in our AS product suite
 •2021
 •Launched new PPS Cushioning product, PadPak® Auto-Coiler, in North America
 •Launched new APS product, AutoFill, in North America
 •Formed R Squared Robotics to develop cutting-edge end-of-line packaging systems utilizing the power of artificial intelligence and three-dimensional computer vision combined with robotics
 In addition to expanding our offerings through internal development, we seek to provide value added solutions to our customers through acquisitions as well as strategic investments and partnerships. In 2021, we made two strategic investments to supplement our portfolio:
 •Pickle Robot Co. (“Pickle”): Pickle has developed a low cost, collaborative package-handling robot that automates several key tasks along the e-commerce supply chain including sorting, as well as loading and unloading of packaged goods within logistical lines. Our investment in Pickle is highly strategic and complements and expands our Automation products.
 •creapaper GmbH (“Creapaper”): Creapaper is the inventor of grasspaper and uses a patented process to produce graspap, a raw material required for producing grasspaper. Creapaper has been expanding its reach across Europe through its development and placement of carbon dioxide-saving grasspaper products such as hygienic papers, food & carrying bags, and single-use plastic replacements with retail clients in Germany, Switzerland, Austria, the Netherlands and Italy.
 •Intellectual Property. We have a long history of continuous systems innovation and product development supported by our comprehensive patent portfolio. We have maintained an extensive patenting program since our inception for our PPS systems 


and accessories, processes and paper packaging materials. We maintain substantial trade secret knowledge regarding the utilization of our paper consumables in each model of our PPS systems product lines, which, together with the distributor contractual arrangements described above, prevent third-party paper from being used on our PPS systems. We hold over 774 U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications directed to various innovations related to our business, as well as more than 264 U.S. and foreign trademark registrations and trademark applications that protect our branding.
 •Focus on Talent and Leadership: We have assembled a strong international team of talented, motivated, inclusive, and diverse employees to maintain our leadership in the industry, drive our growth and to achieve our strategic objectives. We have implemented a focused talent acquisition and development strategy to ensure our teams continue to have the right skills to execute our strategy on a global basis.
 Our PPS Products
 Our PPS products are designed to be flexible and responsive to the needs of our end-users. The flexibility and breadth of our full range of systems allows us to provide our end-users with the optimal protective solution to meet their specific needs and help ensure that their products reach their shipping destination in a cost-effective manner with minimal breakage. We derive substantially all of our net revenue (over 90% in 2022 and 2021) through the sale of high-margin paper consumables that work exclusively with our PPS systems. These PPS systems, which include the accompanying paper consumables, fall into three broad categories:
 •Void-Fill. Our Void-Fill protective systems quickly and efficiently convert paper to fill empty spaces in secondary packages and protect objects, reducing object movement during shipping and potential damage sustained in transit. We sell our Void-Fill products under the brand name FillPak® and offer a variety of FillPak® units. We have an installed base of approximately 82,000 FillPak® units as of December 31, 2022. Our Void-Fill products generated $130.6 million in revenue in 2022, accounting for 40.0% of our net revenue.
 •Cushioning. Our Cushioning protective systems convert paper into cushioning pads by crimping paper to trap air between the layers so that objects are protected from external shocks and vibrations during shipping as well as to prevent movement of objects as they travel through the global supply chain. We sell our Cushioning products under the brand name PadPak® and offer a variety of PadPak® units. We have an installed base of approximately 35,000 PadPak® units as of December 31, 2022. Our Cushioning products generated $140.3 million in revenue in 2022 and accounted for 43.0% of our net revenue. 
 •Wrapping. Our Wrapping protective systems create pads or paper mesh to securely wrap and protect fragile items from shock and surface damage sustained during the shipping and handling process. In addition to securely wrapping and protecting fragile items, our Wrapping systems are used to line boxes and provide separation when shipping multiple objects. We sell our Wrapping products under the brand names WrapPak®, Geami®, and ReadyRoll®. We offer a variety of WrapPak® and Geami® converter units. We offer both motorized Geami® dispensing systems and manual systems, where the operator simply pulls the paired sheets against tension to expand the die-cut kraft paper. We also offer the Geami® combination of die-cut and tissue in a disposable cardboard dispenser as well as in a Geami®-based offering to be sold directly to consumers without a dispenser in retail stores under the brand name ReadyRoll®. We do not set minimum annual paper consumption targets for the disposable units, as the full production cost and margin associated with the dispenser is covered with each sale.Included within our Wrapping systems are our Cold Chain products, which are used to provide insulation for goods that require temperatures to be controlled during transport. Additionally, we further expanded our Cold Chain products with the December 2021 acquisition of Recycold Cool Solutions B.V. (“Recycold”), the manufacturer of Recycold Cool Packs, which are sustainable cool packs made from a biodegradable, plant-based gel.We have an installed base of approximately 22,000 WrapPak® units, which were predominantly Geami® converter units, as of December 31, 2022. Our Wrapping products generated $40.5 million in revenue in 2022, which accounted for 12.4% of our net revenue. Geami® revenue includes sale of tissue rolls in addition to kraft paper.
 We retain ownership of most of our PPS systems (other than, e.g., certain disposable Wrapping systems and FillPak® Manual). This model allows distributors and end-users access to our proprietary systems at little or no capital expense and enables us or our distributors to reclaim un- or under-utilized units for refurbishment and redeployment, which benefits us, our distributors, and our end-users through increased efficiency and cost savings. As of December 31, 2022, we had an installed base of approximately 139,100 PPS systems.
 Our consumables ship in bulk, which is efficient for customers in shipping and require less storage space than many competing products. We convert the vast majority of raw paper to create rolls and bundles of paper that integrate with our PPS systems and into direct or consumable products. Our PPS systems predominantly use kraft paper of varying weights, sizes, and configurations. Unlike many competitive products (e.g., foam, air pillows, bubble wrap, loose fill, etc.), our paper packaging materials are fiber-based, renewable, and environmentally sustainable. With the exception of the pouches used for our Recycold cool packs, none of our paper

consumables include plastic or other resin-based components. Instead, they are paper-based and biodegradable, renewable, and curb-side recyclable. Additionally, a majority of our paper consumables sold to end-users are created from entirely or partially recycled content. In 2022, 54.8% of the pulp used to manufacture our paper consumables was recycled fiber, with 8.3% recycled from post-industrial waste and 46.5% recycled from post-consumer waste. In 2022, approximately 54.5% of our raw paper supply was FSC certified.
 Our Automation Products
Our AS solutions are comprised of configurable automated systems that fulfill the needs of end-of-line packaging automation for product distribution and shipping. We utilize one-dimensional box reduction that optimizes the size of corrugated boxes to fit the contents being shipped. In addition to optimizing box-size, our AS solutions can be configured to automatically erect and form corrugated boxes, and apply glued lids to seal the box. Our solutions allow end-users to minimize dunnage use, utilize sustainable dunnage, and improve the speed and efficiency of end-of-line packaging operations as well as help reduce product returns from damage during shipment.
 Our APS solutions utilize proven Ranpak paper converter technology and help end users automate the void filling and box closure processes after product packing is complete. Using machine vision, these technologies dispense the proper amount of void fill to protect products while minimizing labor requirements to pack and, depending on end-user need, can be configured to close the box, insert sustainable paper cushioning liners within boxes, and/or apply shipping labels. Our solutions provide for the capability to insert void and close multiple dimensions of box sizes to suit the end user needs. Our APS solutions can be fully automated or semi-automated, depending on end-user business process requirements. These systems allow end-users to minimize labor, optimize their use of dunnage, improve protection for items being shipped, and make end-of-line packaging operations more efficient.
 Unlike our PPS systems and APS solutions, we do not retain ownership of our AS solutions. Rather, we design and sell our AS solutions outright to our customers and derive revenue by designing, manufacturing, installing, and servicing AS solutions at end-user facilities. Depending on the needs of a customer, our APS solutions may consist of components that are sold outright to the customer or may include a mix of components sold outright and components of which we retain ownership. However, in all cases, our current business model for our Automation product line involves the direct or indirect sale of highly customized systems, designed on the basis of our consultancy and product engineering expertise. As the market for our Automation products is rapidly evolving, we have extended our Automation services to offer extended service warranties beyond the initial warranty period, packaging line solutions, and the sale of spare parts. Our Automation products accounted for 4.6% of our net revenue in 2022.
 Our Distribution Model
 We sell the vast majority of our paper packaging materials to an established network of approximately 300 distributors worldwide who, in turn, store, market and sell our products, including bundles and rolls, to end-users. Moreover, substantially all of our net revenue from distributors is generated by those who have agreed to exclusivity with our products and not to sell or promote competitors’ paper-based solutions. Our sales and marketing teams, as well as our highly skilled engineers, work closely with distributors and ultimate end-users, on-site or remotely, to optimize the custom configuration and installation of our PPS systems and Automation products at the end-user’s facility. For each product, we set targets for minimum annual paper consumption in order to justify the capital deployed to that account. Accordingly, our sales team, in conjunction with our distributors, help end-users select which products meet their specific needs based on their own volume requirements and business objectives. Sales through our global distributor network accounted for 90.5% of our net revenue in 2022.
 In addition, we sell our PPS systems and Automation products directly to certain select end-users. In some cases, these end-users operate some of the largest, most complex and sophisticated warehouse operations into which our PPS and Automation systems are integrated. Our engineering and other teams also assist our direct-sale end-users in ensuring the optimal customized installation of our products at their facilities. Direct sales to end-users accounted for 9.5% of our net revenue in 2022.
 Through our distributor network and our direct sales, we serve greater than 36,000 end-users including participants in e-commerce, the auto after-market, electronics, machinery, home goods, industrial, warehousing/transport services, healthcare, and other markets. Our field of end-users is diverse, with greater than 75.8% of distributor-serviced end-users generating less than $10,000 of our net revenue in 2022.
Our Performance
 In 2022, we generated net revenue of $326.5 million and $42.5 million of income from operations. Our revenues are geographically diverse, with 43.3% of our 2022 net revenue generated from end-users in North America, 46.5% generated from end-users in Europe, and 10.2% generated from end-users in Asia and other locations. In addition, approximately 58.3% of our net revenue in 2022 was generated from outside the United States.
Our Strategy
 Our strategy for adding to our customer base includes investing in innovation, our sales force and distributor relationships across all end markets as well as expanding geographically. Beyond our leading position in paper-based Void-Fill and Cushioning protective packaging systems, we expect to also focus on other emerging applications, such as Wrapping, Automation, Cold Chain, and Retail Consumables, for continued growth. While still relatively small, representing 12.4% of our net revenue in 2022, we believe our Wrapping product line can provide a platform for growth largely due to our Geami® products, which provide a highly effective and environmentally friendly alternative to plastic bubble wrap, as well as an opportunity to expand our distribution channels into the retail and retail shipping segments. Our December 2021 acquisition of Recycold helps us to provide a more comprehensive sustainable Cold Chain solution for customers. We also have invested in the development of alternative and more sustainable paper pulps and substrates through our investment in Creapaper.
 Our Automation products represented only 4.6% of our net revenue in 2022, however, following development through acquisitions and organic growth, we believe it will serve as a platform for expansion to better serve end-users with higher volume requirements and more sophisticated end-of-line needs. In 2021, we created R Squared Robotics, a division of Ranpak, that uses three-dimensional computer vision and artificial intelligence technologies to improve end-of-line packaging and logistics functions. Additionally, in July 2021, we advanced our focus on Automation with a strategic investment in Pickle. We are currently building facilities in both the United States and the Netherlands with dedicated space for Automation functions. All of these efforts complement and expand our focus on our Automation products. We believe our Automation products provide us with an opportunity to increase our penetration with existing customers and broaden our customer base to include business segments that we have not historically served. We will also continue to identify additional product and service opportunities for our current and future end-user markets.
We are pursuing expansion of our customer base in several ways. We have a global sales organization that works hand-in-hand with the sales representatives of our approximately 300 distributors to introduce our products and services to potential accounts. Our broad product portfolio allows us to serve any type of business with protective packaging needs across all end markets. We will also seek to broaden our customer base through geographic expansion by enhancing our regional capabilities in sales and marketing and expanding sales of our existing product lines in growth regions, such as Asia-Pacific (“APAC”), South America, and Central and Eastern Europe. We have recently established a full-service paper conversion facility in Malaysia, which we anticipate to be operational in the second half of 2023. We believe the Malaysia facility can improve our ability to serve customers in the region by shortening lead times as well as provide a more attractive cost profile to the APAC market than we have historically been able to offer. Combined with the localized presence and connection to Southeast Asia, we believe the Malaysia facility can bring favorable growth opportunities.
 We seek to enhance our position as a leading global provider of innovative sustainable packaging solutions that our customers rely on to improve performance, cost competitiveness and automation to enhance productivity within their operations. In order to achieve these goals, we are focused on the following strategic priorities.
 •Grow organically. We will continue to focus on offering innovative solutions that enable our end-users to meet their sustainability needs while growing their business, reducing their costs and mitigating the risks associated with ineffective and/or unreliable end-of-line systems. We will also continue to provide distributors with the tools to win new accounts through training programs such as our Ranpak Academy and collaboration with our sales and engineering teams. We plan on leveraging our position as a trusted provider of sustainable packaging solutions to leading e-commerce end-users and industrial business to business end-users and further align ourselves with these market leaders as they expand to new locations and geographies, as well as continue to serve small, high growth platforms. We also believe there are significant opportunities to increase penetration across end markets. We aim to grow beyond our current PPS systems by expanding our existing Wrapping, Automation and Retail and Consumables offerings into new end-markets. Finally, we believe our fiber-based wrapping systems offer a cost-competitive, environmentally friendly, and compelling alternative to plastic-based wrap and we expect them to gain share as the focus on environmental sustainability becomes increasingly ingrained in commerce.
 •Drive innovation. We intend to maintain and extend our technological leadership, expertise and our environmentally sustainable value proposition through continuous improvement of our product and service offerings to bolster speed, improve efficacy, and decrease packing footprint, as well as by introducing new products that deliver the environmentally friendly solutions customers require for their business needs. Our recent innovations in 2022 and 2021 include Flap’it!, the next generation of our Cut’it! EVO solution, PadPak® Auto-Coiler, and AutoFill. 
 •Pursue targeted growth opportunities. We have identified a number of potential growth opportunities, including market expansion for existing products, such as Wrapping, as well as in additional areas of focus, such as Cold Chain/thermal packaging, sales through the retail channel, and automation. We intend to further build out our regional capabilities and combine our local market knowledge in new or currently under-served geographies with our broad portfolio and strengths in innovation and customer service to take advantage of the burgeoning growth opportunities across the globe. For example, the Asia-Pacific region has a large, well-developed parcel shipping business, but currently represents only 10.2% of our net revenue in 2022. We believe that the new Malaysia facility can strengthen our performance in the APAC region. We believe 


that growing environmental awareness world-wide, combined with an increasing regulatory trend to limit the use of polymer-based foams and plastic films in many jurisdictions, present an opportunity for our paper-based protective packaging solutions in an ever-expanding number of geographies.
 •Grow via partnerships and acquisitions. We believe that we are well-positioned to execute a growth strategy, targeting acquisitions or partnerships in our key areas of focus and adjacent business lines. In addition to our investment in Pickle and our acquisition of Recycold, in September 2021, we made a strategic investment in Creapaper, the inventor of grasspaper and provider of grasspaper products, a natural paper substrate. Our investment and acquisition activity in 2021 demonstrates our continued focus on growing the company through appropriate business acquisition opportunities as well as developing partnerships to expand the scope of our technologies, geographic presence and product offerings. We expect to focus on identifying opportunities and executing an accretive M&A strategy to further solidify our position as a leader in environmentally sustainable solutions by enhancing growth in our key areas of focus and/or acquiring adjacent businesses to our product offering.
 Industry
The macroeconomic effects of COVID-19 emphasized the importance of the broader global protective packaging industry in the world economy. The global protective packaging industry is fragmented and competitive with market leaders accounting for a relatively small share of the market. This fragmentation is due primarily to the variety of product types and the myriad of applications in which they are used around the world.
 Protective packaging is used to store and protect goods during shipping and handling from shock, vibration, abrasion and other damages. It is mainly used to fill the empty space between the product/merchandise and exterior carton or container (often referred to as dunnage), or to protect goods during shipment. As a general matter, the value of the goods being shipped, as well as the potential cost of breakage, far outweigh the cost of in-the-box protective packaging, which drives the demand for effective protective packaging solutions like ours. Protective packaging comes in various forms such as foam, air pillows, bubble wrap, cushion products, loose fill (e.g., Styrofoam packing peanuts), paperboard protectors and protective mailers, as well as non-engineered solutions such as newsprint, tissue paper, shredded corrugated cardboard and other materials.
 The protective packaging industry is characterized by a diversity of applications and end markets, within both the industrial and consumer segments. Historically, growth in the protective packaging industry has been positively impacted by trends such as expedited delivery of individualized packages, globalization of the supply chain, and increased focus on efficiency and reduced shipping costs. We believe more recent and future growth drivers include further expansion of e-commerce activity, increased customization of protective packaging systems in markets such as electronics, and increased demand for environmentally friendly protective packaging. In our view, those markets most closely linked to e-commerce and/or sustainable packaging are those best positioned for growth in the future.
 Our Market
 Our end-user market consists of any business that sells and ships products requiring packaging. Accordingly, these end-users are highly dependent on their ability to obtain a cost-effective and efficient in-the-box packaging solution. Our end-users operate in a variety of businesses, including e-commerce, the automotive after-market, electronics, machinery/manufacturing, home goods, pharmaceuticals, retail and others.
 We primarily sell our products to our distributors which, in turn, market and sell our products to our end-users. We also sell products directly to select end-users. In 2022, 90.5% of our net revenue was derived from sales to our distributors and approximately 9.5% of our net revenue was derived from sales directly to end-users.
 Distributors. We primarily sell our products to our network of approximately 300 distributors worldwide. These distributors vary in size and, generally, offer a broad suite of packaging and other warehousing products and services to the end-users they serve, including other protective packaging systems, such as plastic bubble wrap and air pillows. Substantially all of our net revenue from distributors is generated by those who have agreed to exclusivity with our products and not to sell or promote competitors’ paper-based solutions.
 Additionally, our distributors benefit from the collaborative approach we foster with our internal sales, engineering and marketing organization. We work with our distributors to win additional end-users of our paper-based products that the distributor, in turn, can service on an on-going basis with a broad suite of packaging equipment and supplies. Our distributors also typically address the needs of our end-users directly with respect to any ongoing protective system service needs. In order to facilitate the collaborative process, we meet with our distributors to discuss end-user needs and potential solutions, provide training programs (including through our

Ranpak Academy program) for distributors that are designed to cultivate their knowledge of, and loyalty to, our brands, as well as provide the tools they need to successfully market and place our systems.
 As a result of these and other efforts, we have built and maintained a well-established distributor network that is comprised primarily of long-term business relationships and the continuity of these relationships evidences the strength of our business model, as well as the value proposition for our distributors and end-users. Furthermore, the depth and longevity of these relationships result in a distributor network that is highly knowledgeable and well versed in conveying the benefits of our systems to end-users. We believe that our distributor-based distribution model is particularly well suited to the highly fragmented nature of the protective packaging solution end-user market we seek to serve by enabling us to reach a broad range of end users across size, industry and geography while maintaining a lean internal salesforce and capital base.
 End-Users. We have greater than 36,000 global end-users. These end-users operate in a wide variety of businesses and rely on our systems for a cost-effective and efficient paper-based protective packaging solution that meets their operational and shipping needs. Our field of end-users is diverse and historically stable, with greater than 75.8% of distributor-serviced accounts generating less than $10,000 in annual net revenue in 2022. Our end-users vary in size from extremely small specialty manufacturers or retailers to some of the largest global e-commerce companies. While most of our end-users purchase our products from our distributors, we also sell our products directly to select end-users. Direct sales to end-users accounted for approximately 9.5% of our net revenue in 2022.
 E-commerce. We believe changing consumer preferences and buying habits will drive continued e-commerce growth, both among pure-play e-commerce companies, as well as among historical brick-and-mortar companies seeking to expand their e-commerce presence. We further believe the critical necessity of brand owners to optimize supply chains and reduce capital spend drives the important trend in concentration of logistics through third-party logistics providers that in turn drives increasing needs for efficient packaging end-of-line solutions. The availability of a broader product selection on-line, faster delivery times, and increased in-store pickup options all drive significant growth in on-line sales. This expansion of e-commerce is a worldwide trend that we believe will continue to accelerate as on-line penetration grows in developed and emerging markets. Although some of our e-commerce end-users are focused on the responsible reduction of their need for void-fill material more broadly, they generally require protective packaging solutions that can be integrated into their existing supply and distribution infrastructures on a low-cost and efficient basis. Most commonly, our e-commerce end-users purchase our Void-Fill solutions, but many also use our Automation, Wrapping, and Cushioning systems. Sales to our e-commerce end-users, directly and through distributors accounted for approximately 31.0% of our net revenue in 2022.
The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated the growing macroeconomic emphasis on e-commerce in the global economy. In 2022, many of the obstacles on daily life brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic began to subside and we saw consumers eager to embrace a return to normalcy and experience-based activities in their discretionary spending, including shopping in a physical store or eating out at restaurants. While this resulted in decreased e-commerce activity in 2022 compared to recent years, we believe that brick-and-mortar experiences and e-commerce activity will complement each other as companies work to balance both presences for their businesses, and e-commerce will continue to be an important piece of the global economy.
 Industrial Manufacturing. Our industrial manufacturing end market includes end users manufacturing products utilized for tools, construction supplies, energy and utilities, chemicals, paints, and metals. We believe demand in these sectors will increase as growing populations and expanding middle classes in developing countries generate more disposable income. Higher demand for advanced machines spurs increased spending on tools and robotics while higher demand for housing, infrastructure and commercial buildings benefits the tools and construction supplies sectors. Sales to industrial manufacturing end-users accounted for approximately 12.5% of our net revenue in 2022.
 Automotive Aftermarket. The automotive after-market is driven by the need for replacement parts as automobiles age, as well as by the desire of consumers to customize vehicles to enhance performance and improve aesthetics. Increasing average age of vehicles and digitalization of component delivery sales and services, along with the advent of on-line portals distributing after-market components is expected to contribute to the continued growth of the automotive after-market industry. Our automotive after-market end-users require protective packaging solutions that have strong protective qualities, as the products they ship are often heavy, require greater care in handling, and have a higher individual per-unit value. Accordingly, these end-users most commonly purchase our Cushioning solutions. Our packaging solutions are typically designed to integrate into these end-users’ existing industrial processes for the production and distribution of automotive parts. Sales to our automotive after-market end-users accounted for approximately 9.8% of our net revenue in 2022.
Electronics. Widespread product innovation combined with an expanding working population, a corresponding growth in household formation and disposable incomes are key factors contributing to the growth of the global consumer electronics market. Thriving demand for smartphones across the globe and the miniaturization of electronic devices are additional factors boosting growth in the global consumer electronics market. We believe this demand for electronics will continue to grow as innovation, such as the Internet-of-Things and voice-connected devices, drives increased demand for the latest electronics hardware. Our electronics end-users

customarily sell products such as computer hardware and electronics that are often already securely packaged in primary packages by the manufacturer and, as a result, require less robust protective packaging systems from us. Sales to our electronics end-users accounted for approximately 7.3% of our net revenue in 2022.
 Industrial Machinery. We believe demand for industrial machinery and equipment used in sectors such as agriculture, construction, mining, packaging, and food processing will increase as economies expand, thus requiring additional infrastructure spend as well as increasing the need to feed growing middle-class populations across the globe. Sales to our machinery end-users accounted for approximately 6.4% of our net revenue in 2022.
 Other. Our end-users also operate in many other industries, including [Warehousing (6.9% of net revenue in 2022), Home Furnishings (4.5%), Printing and Business Services (2.7%), and other various industries (18.8%)].
 Our Paper Suppliers
 We purchase kraft paper from various suppliers for conversion into the paper consumables we sell. The kraft paper we purchase includes paper that is substantially manufactured from virgin pulp, as well as paper that is substantially manufactured from recycled post-industrial and/or post-consumer waste. Before we determine to purchase paper from any supplier, the supplier must undergo a qualification process to ensure that its product meets our exacting requirements. This qualification process involves an evaluation of the physical specifications of the potential supply source, as well as extensive testing for the paper’s convertibility – on the fan-folding, rewinding and die-cutting raw paper converters in our facilities – and in the protective packaging systems we place with our end-users. Much of our paper is sourced from suppliers that are FSC certified. As a result, in 2022, approximately 54.5% of our raw paper supply was FSC certified. Once a supplier is qualified, we purchase large rolls of kraft paper from that supplier for integration into our existing supply and production chain. The paper rolls are converted at our facilities before sale to our distributors and direct end-users for use with our Void-Fill, Cushioning and Wrapping protective systems.
 In 2022, we purchased paper from approximately 31 paper suppliers and our largest single source of paper supplies sold us approximately 43.7% and 21.7% of the paper supplies purchased in North America and globally, respectively. While the cost of paper supplies is our largest input cost, we typically negotiate supply and pricing arrangements with most of our paper suppliers annually, many of which we have long-standing relationships with, which helps us mitigate shorter term fluctuations in paper cost. In 2021 and 2022, global inflation and other macroeconomic factors, including COVID-19 and the conflict in Ukraine, have contributed to the increases in the cost of paper. Where we can, we will look to pass these increased market costs on to our customers to mitigate the impact of these costs. We are unable to predict our ability to pass these costs on to our customers and how much of these increases we will be able to pass on to our customers. As such, we expect some continued pressure on our gross margin in the medium term relative to our historical margin profile.
 Our Competition
 We compete with companies producing competing products that are well-established, have significant scale, and have a broad product offering. There are other manufacturers of protective packaging products, some of which are companies offering similar products that operate across regions and others that operate in a single region or single country. Our primary competitors include Sealed Air Protective Division, Pregis (FP International/Easypack), Intertape Polymer Group (IPG), Storopack and Sprick. Most competing manufacturers offer multi-substrate solutions including foam, loose-fill, plastic air pillows, and plastic bubble wrap in addition to a fiber-based offering. We believe we are the only major “in-the-box” protective packaging specialist that has a focus on a single environmentally friendly substrate (i.e., fiber) which enables us to have a best-in-class product offering as well as the credibility with customers that we are truly devoted to seeking environmentally sustainable solutions. We believe that we are one of the leading suppliers of fiber-based packaging materials and related systems in the principal geographic areas in which we offer those products. Additionally, we believe we are a leader in automated void reduction systems technology.
Human Capital Resources
 We are a global organization that values life experiences, ideas, and cultures that each of our employees bring to Ranpak, striving to create an atmosphere of acceptance and respect, facilitating an encouraging environment, and helping employees attain professional and educational goals. We are proud to count men and women of all races and ethnicities as members of our Board of Directors, management team, and employee workforce. We are a Charter Pledge Partner in The Board Challenge, which is an initiative to improve diverse representation in corporate U.S. boardrooms. As a Charter Pledge Partner, we acknowledge that we already have diversity in our boardroom and pledge to use our resources to accelerate change within other companies. We utilize interview guides in our hiring processes to help identify different competencies, such as diversity, equity, and inclusion competencies, to ensure that new hires are developed in these areas. Additionally, we developed robust anti-bias training to ensure that every potential candidate is given a fair and merit-based evaluation of their skills.

We strive to maintain an active dialogue with our employees and provide employees a comprehensive benefits package including competitive wages, medical, life, and accident insurance, incentive bonus programs, and a 401(k) plan with an employer matching contribution. We have departmental budgets set aside for training and also provide a tuition reimbursement program for employees seeking bachelors or masters degrees. Certain employees are also eligible for stock-based compensation programs that are designed to encourage long-term performance aligned with Company objectives. In June 2019 and September 2021, every employee (excluding those eligible for stock-based compensation programs) received an equity award, providing a community of employee-owners who can personally share in the reward of our collective success.
As of December 31, 2022, we had 819 employees worldwide, 330 of whom were located in the United States. We have 159 of our employees located in Europe who are covered by collective bargaining agreements.
Our Intellectual Property
 Our intellectual property provides a strong competitive advantage. We own or license over 774 U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications directed to various innovations related to packaging machines, stock material, packaging processes, and packaging products, as well as more than 264 U.S. and foreign trademark registrations and trademark applications that protect our branding of our packaging products, services, and equipment. We continue to innovate and advance that competitive advantage and file numerous U.S. and foreign patent applications each year. We are also vigilant in protecting our intellectual property, by monitoring competitor activity, providing notice to potential infringers, and bringing litigation whenever and wherever necessary and appropriate.
Seasonality
 We estimate that approximately 31.0% of our net revenue in 2022, either directly or to distributors, was destined for end-users in the e-commerce sectors, whose businesses frequently follow traditional retail seasonal trends, including a concentration of sales in the holiday period in the fourth quarter. Our results tend to follow similar patterns, with the highest net revenue typically recorded in our fourth fiscal quarter and the slowest sales in our first fiscal quarter of each fiscal year. We expect this seasonality to continue in the future and, as a result, our results of operations between fiscal quarters in a given year may not be directly comparable.
Governmental Regulation
 Federal, State, Local, and International Regulations
 We are required to comply with numerous laws and regulations covering areas such as workplace health and safety, data privacy and protection, labor and employment. We monitor changes in these laws to maintain compliance with applicable requirements. Compliance with, or liability under, these laws and regulations may require us to incur significant costs and have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, earnings, and competitive position.
Environmental Matters
 We are subject to a number of federal, state, local and international environmental-related health and safety laws and regulations that govern, among other things, the manufacture and assembly of our products; the discharge or pollutants into the air, soil and water; the use, handling, transportation, storage and disposals of hazardous materials; and environmental remediation or reclamation activities. We are required to hold various permits to conduct our operations. Compliance with, or liability under, these laws, regulations and permits can require us to incur significant costs and have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, earnings, and competitive position.
Legal Proceedings
 From time to time, we have and may again become party to intellectual property litigation or other legal proceedings that we consider to be a part of the ordinary course of our business. Historically, one category of legal proceeding to which we have been a party has involved claims of patent or other intellectual property infringement. While we are judicious in initiating litigation to those circumstances justified by legal and business considerations, we have initiated and will continue to initiate affirmative action to protect our intellectual property. This litigation includes defending counterclaims brought by the counterparty against whom we have initiated a claim of infringement as part of their infringement-defense strategy.
