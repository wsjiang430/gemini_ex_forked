Organizational History
 
We were formed as a Nevada corporation on May 19, 2014.
 
On May 23, 2014, we, along with Reliant Pools, Inc. (“Reliant Pools”) and the stockholders of Reliant Pools, entered into an Agreement for the Exchange of Common Stock (the “Exchange Agreement”). Pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, the stockholders of Reliant Pools exchanged 2.1 million shares of common stock, representing 100% of the outstanding common stock of Reliant Pools, for 2.1 million shares of our common stock (the “Exchange”). As a result of the Exchange, Reliant Pools became our wholly-owned subsidiary. The President of Reliant Pools, and its largest stockholder at the time of the Exchange was Michael Chavez, our then President, then Chief Executive Officer and then sole director. The following shares of restricted common stock were issued in connection with the Exchange: 900,000 shares of common stock to Michael Chavez, our then President, then Chief Executive Officer and then sole director; 750,000 shares of common stock to Elijah May, our current Chief Executive Officer and sole director; and 450,000 shares of common stock to Becky Spohn, our former Controller.
 
Reliant Pools was originally formed as a Texas General Partnership (Reliant Pools, G.P.) in September 2013, and was owned by Mr. Chavez, Mr. May, Ms. Spohn, and a third party, who subsequently was unable to perform the services required for him to vest his interest, which interest was subsequently terminated, leaving Mr. Chavez, Mr. May and Ms. Spohn as the sole owners of Reliant Pools, G.P. In May 2014, Reliant Pools, G.P. was converted from a Texas General Partnership to a Nevada corporation, Reliant Pools, Inc., with the same ownership as described above at the time of the Exchange. On October 10, 2018, the Company incorporated a new wholly-owned subsidiary in Texas, Reliant Custom Homes, Inc. The Company is exploring opportunities to expand operations in the Austin, Texas area as a custom home builder.
 
Description of Business Operations:
 
We, through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Reliant Pools (which has been in operation since September 2013), are an award winning, custom, swimming pool construction company located in the greater Austin, Texas market. In the future we also plan to offer residential swimming pool maintenance services. We assist customers with the design of, and then construct, recreational pools which blend in with the surroundings, geometric pools which complement the home’s architecture and water features (e.g., waterfalls and negative edge pools) which provide the relaxing sounds of moving water. We won four Association of Pool & Spa Professionals (ARSP) Region 3 Design Awards for our designs in 2016 and one award in 2017. Moving forward, we plan on expanding our operations through an accretive business model in which we plan to acquire competitors in both the custom pool construction and pool maintenance/service industries locally, regionally, and nationally.

To date, the majority of our growth has been through referral business. We offer a wide variety of pool projects based upon price and the desires of the client. When our sales personnel meet with a prospective customer, we provide them with an array of projects from the basic pool building to more high-end projects that may include waterfalls, mason work, backyard lighting and in-ground spas to highlight the outdoor living experience.
 
Types of Pools
 
The most common type of pools that we build are either a “Freeform Pool” or “Geometric Pool” which are described as follows:
 
“Freeform Pool” - A “Freeform” pool is usually accomplished with some combination of the following:
 

● | Gentle curves; non-traditional shapes; 
--+-------------------------------------------


● | Natural rock, flagstone or “rolled beams” around the perimeter; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Natural rock or stone built-in at various places around the pool; and/or 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Rock or stone pavers, exposed aggregate, scrolled or stamped concrete. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
“Geometric Pool” - A “Geometric” pool is usually accomplished with some combination of the following:
 

● | Clean, straight lines and/or geometric shapes; 
--+---------------------------------------------------


● | Brick coping or “paving tiles” around the perimeter; and/or 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


● | Brick or tiled decking, or stamped concrete. 
--+-------------------------------------------------

 
Geometric pool designs often utilize sleek and straight lines. This style of pool is usually a more formal design, even without additional water features or spa included.
 
Competitive Strengths
 
We believe we have a strong competitive position in the custom pool construction industry in Austin, Texas, due to, among other things:
 

● | Industry Expertise. We believe our employees and subcontractors are among the most skilled and experienced in the region. With over 40 years of industry experience (combined experience of the management, plan designers, and the construction personnel and subcontractors), we are dedicated to customer satisfaction from the moment we contract with a customer to the day each project is completed. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Reputation and Name Recognition. Our name recognition, reputation and quality of workmanship has resulted in referral business and established relationships with home builders who refer us prospective customers from time-to-time. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | Innovative Sales and Marketing Approach. Our experienced sales designers provide us with significant advantages over competitors that have less qualified sales personnel and/or utilize less sophisticated sales methods. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Customer Satisfaction. Customer satisfaction is a key component of our marketing strategy which is based upon referral business. We use only top quality materials and equipment. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Growth Strategy
 
We believe that our competitive strengths provide a platform for expansion. Our growth strategy includes the following components:
 

● | Pursue Pool Cleaning and Maintenance. We plan on expanding our operations into pool cleaning and maintenance by acquisition as well as starting a custom homes division, funding permitting. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Pursue Vertical Business Opportunities. We also plan on expanding our revenue centers by either acquiring or developing vertical businesses that complement the pool building business. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Swimming Pool Sales and Industry
 
 Swimming pools can be constructed as (1) residential in-ground swimming pools, (2) residential above-ground swimming pools (usually 12 to 24 feet in diameter), or (3) commercial swimming pools. Our operations are focused solely on construction of residential in-ground swimming pools, provided we plan to expand into maintenance services related to residential in-ground swimming pools in the future. Specifically, we focus on the installation of concrete, in-ground residential swimming pools.
Types of In-ground Pools
 
In-ground pools come in three basic varieties: vinyl-lined, fiberglass, and gunite/shotcrete or concrete.
 
Gunite or Shotcrete pools
 
Are similar to concrete pools and can be finished with tile, plaster, paint, aggregate or fiberglass. These pools are often well suited to areas that are prone to extremely high temperature and areas where the soil is known to expand. Pools made from concrete, gunite or shotcrete are generally strong and durable so potential buyers often take comfort in the fact that these structures usually don’t require much in terms of maintenance and repair.
 
We use Shotcrete in the construction of our pools. Shotcrete is concrete (or sometimes mortar) conveyed through a hose and pneumatically projected at high velocity onto a surface, as a construction technique. It is reinforced by conventional steel rods, steel mesh, and/or fibers. Fiber reinforcement (steel or synthetic) is also used for stabilization in applications such as slopes or tunneling.
 
Shotcrete is usually an all-inclusive term for both the wet-mix and dry-mix versions. In pool construction, however, the term “shotcrete” refers to wet-mix and “gunite” to dry-mix. In this context, these terms are not interchangeable.
 
Shotcrete is placed and compacted at the same time, due to the force with the nozzle. It can be sprayed onto any type or shape of surface, including vertical or overhead areas. This allows us to tailor the shape of pools to a client’s needs.

Vinyl-lined pools
 
Vinyl-lined pools are structurally similar to above ground pools. When this type of pool is installed, a hole is dug in the ground and a frame is assembled around the perimeter of the hole. Sand is then laid in the bottom of the hole and a vinyl liner is attached to the structure’s wall. Vinyl-lined pools can be attractive because they tend to be the least expensive in-ground pool to install but this also means that they can be less durable. We do not design, build or install vinyl-lined pools.
 
Fiberglass pools
 
Fiberglass pools can be quite attractive to potential buyers. These pools are built in a factory in one piece out of fiberglass-reinforced plastic that is molded into a basin-shape that resembles a giant bathtub. Fiberglass pools can be initially more expensive to purchase, but the maintenance cost is generally lower than it is with other in-ground pools. Unlike the vinyl-lined variety, this type of pool doesn’t have a liner that needs to be replaced. In addition, fiberglass pools usually require fewer chemicals than are necessary in the maintenance of a concrete pool. We do not design, build or install fiberglass pools.
 
Principal Suppliers and Subcontractors
 
We regularly evaluate supplier relationships and consider alternate sourcing as appropriate to assure competitive costs and quality standards. We currently do not have long-term contracts with our suppliers. We also believe there are currently a number of other suppliers that offer comparable terms.
 
We utilize independent subcontractors to install pools. Our on-site personnel act as a field supervisor to oversee all aspects of the installation process, including scheduling, to coordinate the activities of the subcontractors and communicate with the customer. 
 
Seasonality
 
Our business exhibits substantial seasonality, which we believe is typical of the swimming pool supply industry. Peak activity occurs during the warmest months of the year, typically April through September. Unseasonable warming or cooling trends can accelerate or delay the start or end of the pool season, which could impact our future planned maintenance services and our construction services. Weather also impacts our construction and installation products to the extent that above average precipitation, late spring thaws and other extreme weather conditions delay, interrupt or cancel current or planned construction and installation activities. The likelihood that unusual weather patterns will severely impact our results of operations is exacerbated by the concentration of our operations in Austin, Texas.
Our Pool Construction Operations
 
We estimate that it takes 45 working days to complete each pool we construct (not including days lost to rain or other inclement weather). Our standard arrangement with customers provides for a one year limited warranty for our work, and subject to certain exceptions, warrants that the pool structure will remain structurally sound (i.e., will remain capable of retaining water), during the period that the pool is owned by the original customer.
 
Dependence on a Limited Number of Customers
 
The Company had gross revenue of $1,506,830 and $1,178,054 for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The Company had no customers representing approximately 10% of gross revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018 and had two customers representing more than 10% of gross revenue, and a combined 23% of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017.
 
Other than through occasional referrals from such entities, we do not have any agreements or relationships in place with home builders.

Our Industry
 
We believe that the swimming pool industry is relatively young, with room for continued growth. According to Aqua Magazine, there are approximately 25 million households in the United States that have the right kind of home (i.e., don’t have an above ground pool and don’t live in an apartment or other multi-family housing), who meet all of the criteria for the purchase of a pool and don’t already own one. We also believe that significant growth opportunities exist with pool remodel activities due to the aging of the installed base of swimming pools, technological advancements and the development of energy-efficient products.
 
Maintaining proper chemical balance and the related upkeep and repair of swimming pool equipment, such as pumps, heaters, filters and safety equipment, creates a non-discretionary demand for pool chemicals, equipment and other related parts and supplies. We also believe cosmetic considerations such as a pool’s appearance and the overall look of backyard environments create an ongoing demand for other maintenance-related goods and certain discretionary products.
 
The following tables reflect growth in the domestic installed base of in-ground and above-ground swimming pools over the past 11 years ending in 2015 (based on Company estimates and information from 2014 P.K. Data, Inc. reports):
 


New swimming pool construction comprises the bulk of consumer spending in the pool industry. The demand for new pools is driven by the perceived benefits of pool ownership including relaxation, entertainment, family activity, exercise and convenience. The industry competes for new pool sales against other discretionary consumer purchases such as home remodeling, boats, motorcycles, recreational vehicles and vacations. The industry is also affected by other factors including, but not limited to, consumer preferences or attitudes toward pool and landscape products for aesthetic, environmental, safety or other reasons.
 
Certain trends in the housing market, the availability of consumer credit and general economic conditions (as commonly measured by Gross Domestic Product or GDP) affect our industry. We believe that over the long term, housing turnover and single-family home value appreciation may correlate with demand for new pool construction, with higher rates of home turnover and appreciation having a positive impact on new pool starts over time. We also believe that homeowners’ access to consumer credit is a critical factor enabling the purchase of new swimming pools. Similar to other discretionary purchases, replacement and refurbishment activities are more heavily impacted by economic factors such as consumer confidence, GDP and employment.

Planned Swimming Pool Maintenance Services
 
In the future we plan to offer swimming pool maintenance operations including the following services:
 

Skimming – | The first step in any pool maintenance routine is skimming. A skimmer is a fine mesh net attached to a long pole. It is used to remove floating debris such as leaves and drowned insects. If left untended, debris may clog filters and/or sink to the bottom of the pool where it can leave unsightly stains. Skimming is recommended on a daily basis or as the need arises. 
---------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Vacuuming – | Even with routine skimming, fine particles like dust and dirt eventually sink and settle to the bottom of a pool. There are two kinds of pool vacuums: automatic and manual. Automatic vacuums run along the bottom of the pool and generate suction in random patterns; manual vacuums attach to a long pole that allows you to steer the suction yourself. Vacuuming is recommended at least once per week. The average pool requires 30 minutes of vacuuming. 
----------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Brushing – | Brushing keeps the walls of a pool clean. It is recommended that pools are brushed once a week before vacuuming. 
---------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Cleaning Filters – | Filters come in three types: sand, cartridge and diatomaceous earth (DE). Each type has unique cleaning requirements. Sand filters must be “backwashed” and treated with a special sand-cleaning chemical. Cartridge filters are removed and sprayed with a garden hose. DE filters are backwashed like sand filters, but more DE must be added. Filters typically need to be changed once every nine to twelve months. 
-----------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Pool Heater Maintenance – | The typical pool heater can go at least a few years before it needs servicing. Sometimes, calcium and other minerals build up in the heater’s tubes, restricting its operation. When this happens, it is necessary to disassemble and repair the heater. 
------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Water Level – | A pool can lose water through natural evaporation and from people splashing and getting in and out of the pool. Water levels should not be allowed to fall below the intake tubes for the skimmer basket as it can ruin the pool pump. If the water is low, it is necessary to fill the pool, which is done by turning a manual fill value, using a garden hose or automatically if the pool supports automatic fills. 
------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Maintaining pH – | pH is a measure of how acidic/basic water is. A certain level of acidity must be maintained in a pool. A pH level of 7 is considered ideal; less than 7 is considered too acidic. Acidic water can damage a pool liner, pool equipment and even human skin. Water that is too alkaline can clog filters and cloud the water — and it can cause swimmers eyes and nose to burn and cause dry and itchy skin. pH typically needs to be checked once a week. 
---------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Shocking the Pool – | Over time, organic contaminants such as ammonia and nitrogen can build up in a pool. These contaminants interact with the pool’s chlorine to form chloramines (a combination of chlorine and ammonia), which create a chlorine-like odor that is in a pool. Adding more chlorine can remedy this situation. This is known as “shocking” the pool. Some pool owners shock their pools as frequently as once a week; others go longer. 
------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Winterizing – | Winterizing (required in climates which experience winter weather below freezing) entails removing water from a pool’s plumbing with an air compressor and draining as much water as possible from the filter and the heater, disconnecting the heater, the pump and any chemical feeders, then giving the pool a good cleaning and finally, shocking the pool and covering it to prevent debris from getting in the pool. 
------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Competition
 
The sales and installation industry of in-ground residential swimming pools is highly fragmented. We face competition primarily from regional and local installers. We believe that there are a small number of swimming pool companies that compete with us on a national basis. Barriers to entry in the swimming pool sales and installation industry are relatively low.
 
We believe that the principal competitive factors in the pool design and installation business are the quality and level of customer service, product pricing, breadth and quality of products offered, ability to procure labor and materials on a market by market basis from local and regional sources, financial integrity and stability, and consistency of business relationships with customers. We believe we compare favorably with respect to each of these factors.
 
The swimming pool cleaning services industry has a low level of market share concentration. To our knowledge, the majority of the industry is characterized by self-employed individuals who work as independent contractors or small operators with fewer than three employees. Since companies typically offer swimming pool cleaning within a limited geographic scope in order to limit transportation expenses, there are limited benefits to economies of scale; consequently there is a low level of market share concentration.
 
Advertising and Marketing
 
We estimate that currently 30% of our customers come from word of mouth referrals from prior clients (for which we do not pay any referral fees or other compensation) and that 60% of our current clients locate us through Google adwords searches (for which we pay fees based on the click through rate of potential customers and our placement in rankings of key google word search terms which we update from time-to-time), with 10% of our customers finding us through Yelp (which we pay nominal fees for advertising on a month-to-month basis in connection with), provided that historically the majority of our customers to date have come from word of mouth referrals. Total advertising and marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $14,418 and for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $13,088.
Employees
 
We currently have four employees which we employ on a full-time basis. No employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. We believe we have satisfactory relations with our employees.
 
We utilize independent subcontractors to install pools. Our personnel act as field supervisors to oversee all aspects of the installation process and as schedulers to coordinate the activities of the subcontractors and communicate with the customer.
 
Government Regulations
 
Our assets, operations and pool and spa construction activities are subject to regulation by federal, state and local authorities, including regulation by various authorities under federal, state and local environmental laws. Regulation affects almost every aspect of our business, including requiring conformity with local and regional plans, and public building approvals, together with a number of other safety and health regulations relating to pool and spa construction. Additionally, each municipality (including Austin, Texas which is the only city we currently operate in) has its own planning and zoning requirements. Permits and approvals mandated by regulation for construction of pools and spas are often numerous, significantly time-consuming and onerous to obtain, and not guaranteed. The permit processes are administered by numerous Federal, state, regional and local boards and agencies with independent jurisdictions. Permits, when received, are subject to appeal or collateral attack and are of limited duration. Such permits, once expired, may or may not be renewed and development for which the permit is required may not be completed if such renewal is not granted. Although we believe that our operations are in full compliance in all material respects with applicable Federal, state and local requirements, our growth and ability to construct future pools and spas in Austin, Texas and other jurisdictions, may be limited and more costly as a result of legislative, regulatory or municipal requirements. Furthermore, changes in such regulations and requirements may affect our capacity to conduct our business effectively and/or to operate profitably.
 
8


In Austin, Texas, we are required to obtain building permits for each pool we construct, based on our submitted plans for such pools. We are also required to abide by certain pool construction guidelines, which require among other things, that each pool is enclosed by a fence at least four feet high, with self-closing and self-latching gates. Additionally, all pools and spas we construct are subject to the Virginia Graeme Baker Pool & Spa Safety Act (P&SS Act) which was enacted by Congress and signed into law by President George W. Bush on December 19, 2007. Designed to prevent the tragic and hidden hazard of drain entrapments and eviscerations in pools and spas, the law became effective on December 19, 2008. The P&SS Act requires, among other things, that all pools and spas be equipped with drain covers that (a) have mechanical devices which let air in to ease the vacuum created when an entrapment or blockage is sensed by the drain cover; (b) have electro-mechanical devices that shut off pumps when a blockage/entrapment is sensed; or (c) include pumps or motors with built-in software that shuts off pumps when a blockage/entrapment is sensed.
 
Notwithstanding the above, our current costs associated with compliance with environmental laws (Federal, state and local) are currently minimal and because we don’t own any of the properties on which we construct our pools and spas, we don’t bear the direct costs or liability associated with compliance with environmental laws on such properties. Additionally, we currently build in the costs of permitting and compliance with building codes into all of our projects, provided that if such costs increase in the future, customers may be unwilling to pay such costs, and it could result in a decrease in demand for our services or our margins.
 
Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act
 
In April 2012, the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (“JOBS Act”) was enacted into law. The JOBS Act provides, among other things:
 

● | Exemptions for “emerging growth companies” (such as the Company) from certain financial disclosure and governance requirements for up to five years and provides a new form of financing to small companies;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Amendments to certain provisions of the federal securities laws to simplify the sale of securities and increase the threshold number of record holders required to trigger the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Relaxation of the general solicitation and general advertising prohibition for Rule 506 offerings; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Adoption of a new exemption for public offerings of securities in amounts not exceeding $50 million; and 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Exemption from registration by a non-reporting company of offers and sales of securities of up to $1,000,000 that comply with rules to be adopted by the SEC pursuant to Section 4(6) of the Securities Act and exemption of such sales from state law registration, documentation or offering requirements. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In general, under the JOBS Act a company is an “emerging growth company” if its initial public offering (“IPO”) of common equity securities was effected after December 8, 2011 and the company had less than $1 billion of total annual gross revenues during its last completed fiscal year. A company will no longer qualify as an “emerging growth company” after the earliest of
 

(i) | the completion of the fiscal year in which the company has total annual gross revenues of $1 billion or more, 
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(ii) | the completion of the fiscal year of the fifth anniversary of the company’s IPO; 
-----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
9



(iii) | the company’s issuance of more than $1 billion in nonconvertible debt in the prior three-year period, or 
------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(iv) | the company becoming a “larger accelerated filer” as defined under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. 
-----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The JOBS Act provides additional new guidelines and exemptions for non-reporting companies and for non-public offerings. Those exemptions that impact the Company are discussed below.
 
Financial Disclosure. The financial disclosure in a registration statement filed by an “emerging growth company” pursuant to the Securities Act, will differ from registration statements filed by other companies as follows:
 

(i) | audited financial statements required for only two fiscal years (provided that “smaller reporting companies” such as the Company are only required to provide two years of financial statements); 
----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(ii) | selected financial data required for only the fiscal years that were audited (provided that “smaller reporting companies” such as the Company are not required to provide selected financial data as required by Item 301 of Regulation S-K); and 
-----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(iii) | executive compensation only needs to be presented in the limited format now required for “smaller reporting companies”. 
------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
However, the requirements for financial disclosure provided by Regulation S-K promulgated by the Rules and Regulations of the SEC already provide certain of these exemptions for smaller reporting companies. The Company is a smaller reporting company. Currently a smaller reporting company is not required to file as part of its registration statement selected financial data and only needs to include audited financial statements for its two most current fiscal years with no required tabular disclosure of contractual obligations.
 
The JOBS Act also exempts the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm from having to comply with any rules adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (“PCAOB”) after the date of the JOBS Act’s enactment, except as otherwise required by SEC rule.
 
The JOBS Act further exempts an “emerging growth company” from any requirement adopted by the PCAOB for mandatory rotation of the Company’s accounting firm or for a supplemental auditor report about the audit.
 
Internal Control Attestation. The JOBS Act also provides an exemption from the requirement of the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm to file a report on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting, although management of the Company is still required to file its report on the adequacy of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
 
Section 102(a) of the JOBS Act exempts “emerging growth companies” from the requirements in §14A(e) of the Exchange for companies with a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act, to hold stockholder votes for executive compensation and golden parachutes.
 
Other Items of the JOBS Act. The JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can communicate with potential investors that are qualified institutional buyers or institutions that are accredited to determine interest in a contemplated offering either prior to or after the date of filing the respective registration statement. The JOBS Act also permits research reports by a broker or dealer about an “emerging growth company” regardless of whether such report provides sufficient information for an investment decision. In addition the JOBS Act precludes the SEC and Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) from adopting certain restrictive rules or regulations regarding brokers, dealers and potential investors, communications with management and distribution of research reports on the “emerging growth company’s” initial public offerings (IPOs).

Section 106 of the JOBS Act permits “emerging growth companies” to submit registration statements under the Securities Act, on a confidential basis provided that the registration statement and all amendments thereto are publicly filed at least 21 days before the issuer conducts any road show. This is intended to allow “emerging growth companies” to explore the IPO option without disclosing to the market the fact that it is seeking to go public or disclosing the information contained in its registration statement until the company is ready to conduct a roadshow.
 
Election to Opt Out of Transition Period. Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts “emerging growth companies” from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standard.
 
The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. The Company has elected not to opt out of the transition period.

Those 4,000,000 shares represent 27.4% of the Company’s common stock and together with the 4,500,000 shares held by Mr. May prior to the parties’ entry into the Voting Agreement, constitute 58.3% of the Company’s total outstanding shares of common stock. The Voting Agreement has a term of ten years, through November 3, 2027, but can be terminated at any time by Mr. May and terminates automatically upon the death of Mr. May. In connection with his entry into the Voting Agreement, Mr. Chavez provided Mr. May an irrevocable voting proxy to vote the shares covered by the Voting Agreement. Additionally, during the term of such agreement, Mr. Chavez agreed not to transfer the shares covered by the Voting Agreement except pursuant to certain limited exceptions.
