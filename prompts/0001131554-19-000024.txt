synchronization and social media, identity and access management, secure mobility management through multiple channels including e-commerce, m-commerce, telesales, enterprise, indirect, and retail outlets. Our technologies are designed to be flexible and scalable across a wide range of existing communication services and connected devices, while offering a best-in-class experience for our customers and supporting traditional and non-traditional devices. The extensible nature of our platforms enables our customers to rapidly respond to the ever changing and competitive nature of the telecommunications, enterprise and mobile marketplaces.
Our platforms, products and solutions conduct business-to-consumer (“B2C”), business-to-business (“B2B”), enterprise and indirect channel (i.e.: resellers/dealers) transactions. The capabilities of our platforms are designed to provide our customers with the opportunity to improve operational performance and efficiencies, dynamically identify new revenue opportunities and rapidly deploy new services. They are also designed to provide customers the opportunity to improve performance and efficiencies for activation, content migration and connectivity management for connected devices.
Our platforms, products and solutions offer flexible, scalable, extensible and relevant solutions backed by service level agreements (“SLA’s”) and exception handling. Our various platforms are designed to be:
Carrier Grade: We design our platforms to handle high-volume transactions from carriers rapidly and efficiently, with virtually no down-time. Our platforms are also capable of simultaneously handling millions of device content related transactions on a daily basis to ensure that personal content on all subscriber devices stays fresh and synchronized with the Cloud.
Ease of Use: Our Platforms resolve complexity with back end data and system frameworks to create simple, easy use cases to end users and subscribers. Our Digital platform provides automation of device, product and service fulfillment - relieving manual work flows and providing economy of scale; it orchestrates data from various data and business silos to create new, elegant and powerful end user use cases that existing system frameworks cannot support. Our Messaging platform provides common onboarding for third party brands that allow them to create bots and other commerce instances and then manage them throughout the customer lifecycle. Our Cloud platform creates an easy cross platform sync and access to subscriber personal data.
Data-driven: Our platforms, products and solutions operate with the assistance of analytics, smart tagging, artificial intelligence, natural language processing, reporting and other data-driven insights. Our technology uses data to help shape user experiences, summarize reporting, prompt next best actions and recommendations and conduct automated dialogue with subscribers. 
Automated:  We design our platforms to eliminate manual processes and to automate otherwise labor-intensive tasks, thus improving operating efficiencies and order accuracy and cost reduction. By tracking every order and identifying those that are not provisioned properly, our platforms are designed to substantially reduce the need for manual intervention and reduce unnecessary customer service center calls. The technology of our platforms automatically guides a customer's request for service through the entire series of required steps.
Predictable and Reliable:  We are committed to providing high-quality, dependable services to our customers. To ensure reliability, system uptime and other service offerings, our transaction management is guaranteed through SLAs. Our platforms offer a complete customer management solution, including exception handling, which we believe is one of the main factors that differentiates us from our competitors. In performing exception handling, our platforms recognize and isolate transaction orders that are not configured to specifications, process them in a timely manner and communicate these orders back to our customers, thereby improving efficiencies and reducing backlog. In the past couple years, if manual intervention is required, our exception handling services are performed through outsourced to centers located in Canada and the United States and, where applicable, to other cost-effective geographies. Additionally, our database is designed to preserve data integrity while ensuring fast, efficient, transaction-oriented data retrieval methods.
Seamless:  Our platforms integrate information across our customers' entire operation, including subscriber information, order information, delivery status, installation scheduling and content stored on the device to allow for the seamless activation and content transfer during the device purchase flow. Through our platforms, the device is automatically activated and consumer's content is available for use via the Cloud, ensuring continuity of service and reducing subscriber churn propensity. CSPs and multi-channel retailers can bundle additional applications during retail phone purchases, and also provide live updates to support new features and new devices. We have built our platforms using an open design with fully-documented software interfaces, commonly referred to as application programming interfaces (“API”). Our APIs enable our customers, strategic partners and other third parties to integrate our platforms with other software applications and to build best-in-class cloud-based applications incorporating third-party or customer-designed capabilities. Through our open design and alliance program, we believe we provide our customers with superior solutions that combine our technology with best-of-breed applications with the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of commercial, packaged interfaces.
6

Scalable:  Our platforms are designed to process expanding transaction volumes reliably and cost effectively. While our transaction volume has increased rapidly since our inception, we anticipate substantial future growth in transaction volumes, and we believe our platforms are capable of scaling their output commensurately, requiring principally routine computer hardware and software updates. Our synchronization and activation platforms routinely support our customers' transactions at the highest level of demands when needed with our current production deployments. We continue to see the number of transactions for connected devices, such as smartphones, mobile Internet devices (“MID”), laptops, tablets and wirelessly enabled consumer electronics such as cameras, tablets, e-readers, personal navigation devices, global positioning system (“GPS”) enabled devices, and other connected consumer electronics, to be one of the fastest growing transaction types across all our platforms, products and services. Our Synchronoss Personal Cloud platform is deployed across more than 95 million devices, managing 20 billion entities in the Cloud and performing more than 4 million synchronizations per day.
Value-add Reporting Tools:  Our platforms' attributes are tightly integrated into the critical workflows of our customers and have analytical reporting capabilities that provide near real-time information for every step of the relevant transaction processes. In addition to improving end-user customer satisfaction, these capabilities are designed to provide our customers with value-added insights into historical and current transaction trends. We also offer mobile reporting capabilities for users to receive critical data about their transactions on connected devices.
Build Consumer Loyalty and Create New Revenue Streams: Our synchronization services help drive consumers to the CSPs, OEM or multi-channel retailers by presenting them with a branded application and fully-integrated Web portal that provides convenience, security, and continuity for end user customers, which we believe helps our customers by further building the loyalty of their subscribers. Our Synchronoss Personal Cloud solution helps reduce subscriber churn by making it easy for subscribers to migrate smartphone content from an old device to a new device. Our Synchronoss Personal Cloud solution enables our carrier customers to sell premium value-add cloud storage solutions as well as cloud enabling premium partner opportunities. We are designing solutions that will allow carriers, OEMs and retail distributors to promote and fulfill new services through mobile channels to better monetize their cloud subscriber base.
Efficient:  Our platforms' capabilities provide what we believe to be a more cost-effective, efficient and productive approach to enabling new activations across services and channels. Our solutions allow our customers to reduce overhead costs associated with building and operating their own customer transaction management infrastructure. With automated activation and integrated fall out support, our e-commerce platforms centralize customer service expectations, which we believe dramatically reduces our customers’ subscriber acquisition/retention costs in addition to operating expenses for training and staffing costs. We also provide our customers with the information and tools intended to more efficiently manage marketing and operational aspects of their business, as well as business intelligence required to do targeted up-selling of their products and services.
Quick Concept to Market Delivery:  The automation and ease of integration of our on-demand platform allows our customers to accelerate the deployment of their services and new service offerings by shortening the time between a subscriber's order and the provisioning of service or activation and enabling of a connected device(s).
Extensible and Relevant:  Our customers operate in dynamic and fast paced industries. Our platforms and solutions are built in a modular fashion, thereby conducive to be extended dynamically and enabling our customers to offer solutions that are relevant to current market situations, with the goal of providing them with the competitive edge required for them to be successful. The platforms are also designed to be highly customizable to each carrier’s specific back end systems as well as branding requirements.
Secure: By leveraging our identity and access management capabilities consumers can self-register their identity, be verified and credentialed and manage their profile in order to have the best customer experience possible. This solution also supports identity proofing and scoring in order to conduct fraud and cyber security detection and prevention.
Synchronoss Digital Platforms 
Digital Experience Platform
Our Digital Experience platform allows IT professionals, business owners and business analysts (aka “citizen developers”) to author and manage digital customer experiences in a cloud-native, low/no-code environment. The platform sits between customer-facing touch points and a customer’s existing back office systems - orchestrating data, work flows and processes into digital customer journeys that interface with end user channels creating user experiences that can be centrally managed and coordinated with less resources than is typical in a traditional IT environment. 
7

Journey Creator
Journey Creator is a purpose-built, easy to use cloud-native toolset that allows IT managers and business owners to collaborate on creating and managing end user experiences across all customer-facing channels. Journey Creator is middleware that sits in between back office systems and customer-facing touch points - integrating orchestrating critical data and functionality into existing channel UI/UX. Journey Creator operates in an any-to-any environment - integrating with any system and any channel UI. 
Integration: Graphical user interface (“GUI”) is fully integrated into Journey Creator for creating endpoints and drag-and drop data mapping. Journey Creator supports complex transformations and mappings via GUI.
UI Flexibility & Control: Journey Creator’s dynamic API and libraries enable any channel client to have a rich and dynamic UI that is run by the channel. It is currently optimized for Javascript clients
Business Logic: Drag and Drop Interface for even complex logic with option to use Groovy script if highly computationally complex rules are required.
Omni-channel: DXP is an API-first platform where the state is not held in the client even when the client is a SPA. A core journey is defined and channel-specific variants can be configured on top of the core journey to simple re-use.
“Pause and Resume Experiences:” Journey Creator centrally manages different channel UI’s and integrates the journeys to back end systems. Because Journey Creator is a common command and control layer, it can carry the state of one channel to the state of another channel, essentially allowing a “pause and resume” effect from one customer touch point to another. This creates a consistent, friction free customer experience that recognizes the user appropriately as they move from one channel experience to the next. 
Dev Ops: Journeys are digital content and able to be deployed and rolled back like web content. The engine that runs the journey remains unchanged between releases.
Resource Optimization: Journey creator is designed to lower cost and decrease time to market while increasing the complexity and effectiveness of omni-channel customer experiences. Journey Creator serves as a central, standardized development environment with an efficient and easy to use, low/no-code object-oriented interface that literally links systems and end-user UIs together. Because it’s centralized and non-developer friendly, a smaller, central team is capable to building and managing complex interfaces with a fraction of the resources and time necessary to manage less sophisticated experience in standard environments. 
Customer Experience (“CX”) IQ
CXIQ uses analytics, artificial intelligence and completely new methods of gathering actionable insights to produce insights to help our customers improve their channel experiences. CXIQ integrates into Journey Creator to allow for real-time feedback to newly created journeys, allowing experience authors and managers to make real time changes necessary to improve the quality and effect of the journey
Journey Advisor
Journey Advisor uses programmed analytics to make intelligent recommendations to customer facing reps and agents. Journey Advisor drives the UI and business rules of a digital sales device (tablet, smart phone, etc.). The analytics that inform the business rules and work flow are derived from customers’ existing systems and guided by the Synchronoss Insights Platform (“SIP”) dynamically insert recommended “next best actions” for a rep based on filters set by a CRM system, customer profile, business rules, etc. Journey Advisor accelerates rep competency from a new hire to a new campaign/offer. This not only assists the rep’s alignment with forecasted key performance indicators (“KPIs”), it helps model complex decisions and ultimately solves customer problems in less time. 
8

Digital Coach
Digital Coach is a tool within DXP that serves as an intelligent dashboard or portal for customer facing reps to assess their performance against their goals and against peers. The Synchronoss Insights Platform (“SIP”) creates intelligent work flows around individual and group KPIs and uses “gamification” 
Digital Channels
Our Digital Channels product provides a customized, predictive interface to purchasing devices and services from Operators and maintaining an effective, automated self-service environment. Digital Channels applies our Activation platform’s ability to sit over top of existing data silos as a “Logic Layer” and surgically extract data as needed to create a personalized account self-service portal for Operator’s B2B major accounts and consumer buy flows. As Operators expand their offerings and markets, the need to conflate different services into a single buy flow is imperative to making good use of their massive distribution channel. To that end, our Digital Channels product can provide an easy to use, powerful, personalized single interface, buy flow and self-service interface for a one-stop-shop and care interface online and on mobile applications. As an example, Digital Channels is being deployed by Sprint to combine their wireline, wireless and IoT product lines into a single B2B buy flow - saving them cost, decreasing time to market and unlocking new revenue.
Activation Platform
Our Activation technology is a scalable and flexible platform that decouples the order processing customer experience from varied and legacy IT back office order management systems. This enables sale, delivery, and assurance of new “Complex Product” bundles quickly and cheaply, creates a uniform product portfolio and pricing schema across all Sales Channels and reduces cost while improving the customer experience by reducing error rates and throughput time in processing orders, alarms, etc. The platform is fully scalable, agile and adaptable to future products, services and channel changes, it serves as a future-proof activation platform with end-to-end channel visibility and analytics and features a flexible commercial model - Software as a service (“SaaS”) or product sale with professional services.
Network Optimization
The Synchronoss Spatial Suite provides an accurate, scalable solution for optimizing every phase of the network asset lifecycle including planning, sales, marketing and customer service. In addition to handling large volumes of customer transactions quickly and efficiently, our platforms are designed to recognize, isolate and address transactions when there is insufficient information or other erroneous process elements. This knowledge enables us to adapt our solutions to automate a higher percentage of transactions over time, further improving the value of our solutions to our customers. Our platforms also offer a centralized reporting platform that provides intelligent, real-time analytics around the entire workflow related to any transaction. This reporting allows our customers to appropriately identify buying behaviors and trends, define their subscriber segments and pin-point areas where their business is changing or could be improved. These analytics enable our customers to upsell new and additional products and services in a targeted fashion that help increase their consumption of our product offerings. The automation and ease of integration of our platforms are designed to enable our customers to lower the cost of new subscriber acquisitions, enhance the accuracy and reliability of customer transactions thereby reducing the inbound service call volumes, and responding rapidly to competitive market conditions to create new revenue streams.

Demand Drivers for Our Business
We believe Synchronoss is positioned to stay ahead of changing dynamics in the TMT and IoT markets. The demand drivers for our business underpin our platform, product and solution strategies to provide forward looking solutions to TMT providers to respond to changes and threats in their markets. TMT providers need to digitally transform to increase and find new sources of revenue, reduce operational cost and complexity and improve the appeal of their products and services to better compete with new standards set by over-the-top (“OTT”) competitors. 
Overall Trends in the TMT Market

• | Convergence: Communications companies are moving into different spaces (entertainment, content etc. for growth)


• | Digital Transformation: Companies are using digital technology to grow revenue, cut costs and become more competitive with better customer experiences


• | Competition: Digital companies are re-setting customer experience expectations in response to the digital advancements made by the FAANG (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google) level of companies


• | Disintermediation: Telecommunications providers are losing revenue and opportunity to provide growth-oriented and value-add services

Trends in Telecommunications

• | Revenue Growth: CTIA reported wireless services have declined 5% to $179 billion showing the 2nd year in a row of decline. GSMA predicts overall operator revenue will remain relatively flat from $1.05 trillion in 2017 to $1.10 trillion in 2025.

12


• | Smart Phone Growth: International Data Corporation (“IDC”) reports overall global smartphones are expected to decline 0.7% to 1.455 billion units in 2018.


• | Capital Expenditures: Accenture predicts operators are expected to spend $275 billion on 5G in the US alone.


• | Disintermediation: Over-the-top (“OTT”) service providers cost operators $104 billion in revenue in 2017 (~12% decline in services revenue) according to Juniper Research.

Trends in Media Companies

• | Disintermediation: OTT and TV everywhere services are disrupting US cable and satellite TV subscription models resulting in over 1 million “cord cutters” in the third quarter of 2018 (the greatest net subscriber loss in a quarter) accordingly to Company Reports.


• | Content Costs: OTT competitors are driving content costs up. Netflix, for example plans to spend over $8 billion on original content, Amazon $4.5 billion according to the Diffusion Group.


• | Social Media: Facebook and Google have become two of the largest funders and publishers of media in the world, taking revenue directly away from traditional media and content companies.


• | Mobile Operators: Acquisition of MSOs and content companies (e.g. AT&T Direct TV, TWC, Verizon and Oath).

Trends in Technology Companies

• | FAANG Disruption: Forbes predicts by 2020 customer experience will overtake price and product as the key brand differentiator.


• | Innovative, New Customer Experiences: In the last year, 1 in 5 shoppers made a purchase using voice (e.g. Alexa, Siri, etc.) according to SupplyChainBrain.


• | Digital Transformation: Enterprises can increase revenues by 23% with digital-first strategies according to IDG. Gartner predicts phone-based communications will account for only 10% of all customer service interactions in 2020. 


• | Artificial Intelligence: Business Insider Intelligence predicts 10% of all global assets (~$8 trillion) will be managed by robots by 2020. Gartner predicts (i) by 2020, smart personalization engines used to recognize customer intent will enable digital businesses to increase their profits by up to 15%; (ii) by 2021, 15% of all customer service interactions will be completely handled by AI, an increase of 400% from 2017; and (iii) by 2022, 50% of new digital business revenue streams will be discovered using machine-generated dynamic metadata.

Propagation of 5G Network and IoT

• | Perhaps the biggest growth driver of the next five years will be the advent of the 5G Network and the epoch change in business that comes with it. Network operators will trial 5G in 2018, with the goal of launching in 2020. 5G tops out at 10 gigabits per second (“Gbps”). That means 5G is a hundred times faster than the current 4G technology-at its theoretical maximum speed. Perhaps the real value in 5G isn’t the speed but the low latency. The 5G Network was designed around enabling use cases in the IoT marketplace and this network will set the IoT market on its way. Smart Cities will be a major driver and customer of the 5G networks. Gartner estimates that around 380 million connected things are in use in cities to deliver sustainability and climate change goals in 2017, and that this figure will increase to 1.39 billion units in 2020, representing 20 percent of all smart city connected things in use. The amount of data traffic will likely grow faster than the number of connections because of the increase of deployment of video applications on M2M connections and the increased use of applications, such as telemedicine and smart car navigation systems, which require greater bandwidth and lower latency. Moreover, more people are moving into urban environments where IoT and smart cities are growing. By 2050, there is expected to be 7.5 billion people living in urban environments, equivalent to the entire world population today. Simply put, cities will be forced to get more efficient causing a greater need for IoT device, ecosystem, network and administrative solutions. For example, Ericsson predicts that major 5G network deployments should be expected from 2020, with an estimate of 1.5 billion 5G subscriptions for enhanced mobile broadband by the end of 2024. Further, Deloitte Global predicts about 1 million 5G handsets will be shipped by the end of 2019 and IDC predicts that 5G will be a key enabler of enterprise transformation in 2019, with over 70% of all 5G connections to stem from business use cases by 2024.

Growth Strategy
Our growth strategy is to establish our platforms as disruptive technology to the TMT and IoT customers and pursue a leadership agenda in strategically select vertical segments of the digital transformation, cloud, advanced messaging and IoT solutions markets. We expect to scale our growth across our platforms and pursue logical extensions of new products and solutions into new markets 
13

as it makes sense. We will continue to focus our technology and development efforts around helping our customers create new revenue, optimize their cost and operations and innovate the experience of their end customer touch points. 
The tenants of our growth strategy are:
Expanding Our Customer Base from Operators to TMT
By expanding our product and market focus from white label services and back office solutions for Operators, MSOs and OEMs to Digital, IoT and Advanced Messaging solutions for the broader TMT market, we have increased the breadth and depth of opportunities for our technologies and significantly grown our potential customers base. With that comes an increased variety of potential customer engagements in focused verticals markets, shortened sales cycles and higher overall visibility in the TMT/IoT marketplaces. 
Growing from Domestic to Global Reach
 We have invested significantly in our sales, marketing and operations to expand our historically North American presence and revenue weighting to a global presence - especially in the EMEA and APAC markets. Similarly, with our digital platform, we are addressing the issues facing many large, global companies who struggle to create proficient and less costly service distribution across dozens of different countries and regions. This allows us to efficiently sell once and deploy many times inside extremely large companies while delivering impactful global solutions in record time.
Scaling via Partnerships
In 2018 we built a strong partner network around technology companies that have complimentary solutions, ready channels and a strategic overlap in their customers and prospects. This focus extends the scope of our functionality and appeal to new customers with partner technologies, greatly increasing the reach of our sales and marketing which in turn increase the scale and sales velocity of our platforms, products and solutions at lower cost.
Transition from Licensing to Recurring 
Healthy growth for Synchronoss will be realized by the deliberate and systematic shift from perpetual license-based revenue to SaaS and Platform as a Service (“PaaS”) recurring revenue models. From a customer standpoint, this will allow us to focus and better serve high value relationships characterized by mutual commitment, collaboration on achieving customer KPIs from each deployment, shared success in transactions and other models. Building our growth model around recurring revenue brings increased predictability, stability and reliability of revenue, predictable cash flow, lower risk, and higher value focus in sales and marketing. Additionally, recurring revenue models greatly help with managing expense and investment relative to the success of platform engagements.
Customers
Our industry-leading customers include Tier 1 mobile service providers such as AT&T Inc., Verizon Wireless, Vodafone, KDDI, NTT DoCoMo, Orange, SoftBank, Sprint, T-Mobile US and Telstra, and Tier 1 cable operators/MSOs and wireline operators including AT&T Inc., BT Group, Comcast, Cablevision, Charter, CenturyLink, Mediacom and Level 3 Communications. These customers utilize our platforms, technology and services to service both consumer and business customers.
We maintain strong and collaborative relationships with our customers, which we believe to be one of our core competencies and critical to our success. Contracts extend up to 60 months from execution and include minimum transaction or revenue commitments from our customers. Many of our significant customers may terminate their contracts for convenience upon written notice, in many cases payment of contractual penalties would accompany such termination.
Our top five customers accounted for 69%, 73% and 74% of net revenues for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Contracts with these customers typically run for three to five years. Of these customers, Verizon accounted for more than 10% of our revenues in 2018. The loss of Verizon as a customer would have a material negative impact on our company. However, we believe that the costs incurred and subscriber disruption by Verizon to replace Synchronoss’ solutions would be substantial. 
Sales, Partnerships and Marketing
Sales
We sell our platforms, products and services through a direct sales force, our strategic partnerships and, collaboration with our customers to re-sell services to their end customers and subscribers. To date, we have concentrated our sales efforts on a range of select verticals of the TMT and IoT markets including telecommunications companies (CSPs, MSOs), OEMs, technology 
14

providers, media companies, government and multi-channel retailers both domestically and internationally. Typically, our sales process involves an initial consultative process that allows our customers to better assess the operating and capital expenditure benefits associated with an optimal activation, provisioning, and cloud-based content management architecture. Our sales teams are well trained in our platforms, products and services and well versed in market trends, demands and conditions that our current and potential customers are facing. This enables them to identify and qualify opportunities that are appropriate for our platform and solution deployments to benefit these customers. Following each sale, we assign account managers to provide ongoing support and to identify additional sales opportunities. We generate leads from contacts made through trade-shows, seminars, conferences, events, analyst relationships, social media, market research, our Web site, customers, strategic partners and our ongoing public relations programs.
Partnerships
We have a dedicated partner outreach organization that functions in tandem with business development within Synchronoss. The Synchronoss Partnership program has three dedicated vectors of focus:
Go To Market/Channels: We are pursuing partnerships with technology companies who supply customers and hosted solutions to Synchronoss platforms, products and solutions. Synchronoss will supply value by introducing these partners to our pipeline of global customers and will receive the benefit of customers from our Technology partners who have interest in Synchronoss platform, products and solutions. These partnerships will provide new sales funnels and scale to Synchronoss offerings.
Technology Augmentation: We are pursuing partnerships with technology companies with complementary IP in platforms, products and solutions. Synchronoss is pursuing partnerships with a two-way value-add in technologies that supply strategic functionality to our mutual customers. These partnerships will provide ready-made technologies that allow our platforms, products and solutions to participate in new markets without the investment in new technology.
System Integrators: We are pursuing partnerships with system integrators (“SI”) and consulting firms in order to expose our platforms, products and solutions to a wider range of customers and supply our SI partners with ready-made IP to fulfill on their custom solutions. These partnerships will provide SI’s with turnkey technologies to fulfill vertical lines of solutions in the TMT and IoT space and will formulate the basis of a formal Synchronoss Partnership Program featuring toolkits, documentation, a dedicated extranet and other channel support.
Maintain Technology Leadership: We strive to continue to build upon our technology leadership by continuing to invest in research and development to increase the automation of processes and workflows and develop complementary product modules that leverage our platforms and competitive strengths, thus driving increased interest by making it more economical for customers to use us as a third-party solutions provider. In addition, we believe our close relationships with our Tier 1 customers will continue to provide us with valuable insights into the dynamics that are creating demand for next-generation solutions.
Leverage and Enforce our Intellectual Property: We have a significant repository of granted and filed patents and trademarks, and we expect to use this as a differentiator of our products and services in the marketplace.
Marketing
We focus our marketing efforts on increasing the visibility of Synchronoss and its technologies in our target the markets, communicating the value of our platforms, products and services, engaging the subscriber base to increase adoption through CSP and MSO accounts, and creating new opportunities in our partner channels. We do this through the following practices and points of emphasis:

• | Public Relations - We generate visibility with joint customer and partner releases and announcements, the soliciting of earned media from prominent industry publishers, the release of thought leadership content and other owned media of interest to our target markets. Our team is active in preeminent technology and industry forums such as TeleManagement Forum (“TM Forum”), Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association (“CTIA”) and the Global System for Mobile Communications (“GSMA”). We participate regularly and invest heavily in our presence at major events, exhibiting and hosting strategic meetings, conducting product demonstrations, speak at keynotes, panels and other forums including the Consumer Electronics Show (“CES”), Mobile World Congress (“MWC”) in Europe, Asia and The United States, and are constantly evaluating our ability to participate in new events, forums and technology communities.


• | Analyst Relations - We invest in premium relationships with Gartner, Forrester and communicate regularly with IDC, Strategy Analytics, Ovum and others. We are active in the promotion of our technologies to analysts and shape

15

their perceived value vis-à-vis competitors in various market quadrants. We participate in frequent dialogue to propagate mention of our technologies, white paper downloads and other means of increasing our visibility to key decision makers within the TMT and IoT markets.

• | Account Based, Digital Marketing (“ABM”) - We work closely with sales to create custom offers that are digitally sent to key prospects and account contacts via email, text and social media. The campaigns are monitored for engagement and guidance of continuing, sales driven communications.


• | Product Marketing - Our marketing team creates sales materials including presentations, downloadable documents and various multimedia to support our direct sales model.


• | Social Media Marketing - Our team distributes updates, tweets and posts across a variety of social media on accounts of the Company and select Synchronoss leaders.


• | Digital Marketing - Our team maintains our corporate web site and creates digital content to be used in ABM and other means of digital outreach. Additionally, we create targeted SEO profiles for each product and monitor discovery and engagement KPIs, automated responses, campaign landing pages and inbound direct contact forms.


• | Partnership Marketing - Our team works closely with marketing resources from our strategic partners to create content, participate in joint campaigns, speaking engagements and the use of marketing development funds.


• | Go-To-Market Collaborations - Our-Go-To Market team collaborates with product owners and channel marketers from our Operator customers to increase subscriber awareness and engagement of our white label Personal Cloud and Advanced Messaging products.

Competition
Competition across our markets is intense and includes rapidly-changing technologies, evolving industry standards, new product introductions and converging spaces and services. 
We are aware of the categories of competitors set forth below relative to the different platforms we offer in the TMT and IoT markets. Our competitors spend significant resources on developing and marketing products and services that will compete with our platforms on a global scale. We anticipate the markets in which we compete will remain intensely competitive for the near future:
Digital Competitors

• | System Integrators - Accenture, Amdocs and others engage our customers in long term contracts for services focused on digital transformation.


• | CRM and BPM Providers - Major providers of CRM and other systems of record such as Salesforce, Pega Systems and Vlocity are engaging with our customers in engagements that emulate our Digital Experience Platform.


• | Internal IT- Our customers and prospects IT developers and system administrators are engaged in products to upgrade existing systems that would conflict with our Digital Experience and IoT platforms.

Cloud Competitors

• | Over-the-Top (“OTT”) Service & Platform Providers - Apple, Google, Drop Box, Box, Microsoft and Amazon all provide global personal cloud services. Apple and Google are primarily tied to their device platforms where Amazon and Microsoft provide device-agnostic services closely tied to their other service offerings. By and large, OTT cloud service providers do not target Operators as their distribution channel and solicit customers at large by leveraging captured audiences from their device or software platforms.


• | White Label Platform Providers - The field of platform-independent, white label personal cloud providers has consolidated in recent years with Funambol, Onecloud and others competing for Operator distribution deals. However, these providers generally target 2nd and 3rd tier regional operators with low-risk, revenue share business models and do not generally pose a real threat to Tier 1 world-wide Operators.

16

Messaging Competitors
Over-the-Top (“OTT”) Service Providers - Major device and OS platform providers such as Google, Microsoft along with prominent web platform providers such as Yahoo! have traditionally offered branded email solutions to Operators. Operators have, in recent years, turned from white label solutions to OTT-branded solutions in an effort to shed costs. Tier 1 Operators have vacillated between OTT and white label solutions world-wide as Carriers are now looking to consolidate branded touch points with their customers in multiple channels. 
IoT Competitors
IoT Platform and Solutions providers such as Honeywell, Siemens, GE are among just some of the large competitors in the IoT and Smart Buildings market.  Most focus on IoT solutions for their systems and equipment but may over time begin looking at aggregation solutions to provide complete building monitoring and management. 

IoT Platforms - there are numerous IoT platforms such as Cisco IoT Cloud which provide capabilities in building end to end solutions.  Enterprise clients and System Integrators can use these platforms to create competitive solutions.
We believe we are positioned to be competitive in each platform segment. We believe the most important factors making us a strong competitor include:
Competitive Advantages for Synchronoss Digital Platforms
The impact of “FAANG” (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google) on the market is easy to see by virtue of the market share, revenue and cultural impact attained by like companies. As companies in the TMT space look to reclaim lost market share, revenue and seek to trim costs to compensate, they must find ways to deliver compelling, Omni-channel customer experiences. On this point, the IDC expects that companies are spending upwards of $1.3 trillion on digital transformation initiatives as of 2018. A great part of this effort is captured by the $16.91 billion companies are projected to spend according to Touch Point on customer experience management by 2022 as businesses with Omni-channel experiences have a 30% higher customer lifetime value compared to others who offer single channel experiences according to Hubspot.
However, Capgemini reports 90% of companies lack the skill sets to capitalize on these initiatives - further, they lack the software to help their existing systems find ways to capitalize on faster times to market, featuring more innovative customer experiences at lower costs. For this reason, Synchronoss has invested significantly in revitalizing its digital platform to assist TMT companies in not only catching up but actively competing for the revenue, market share and cultural impact they have lost to FAANG companies.

• | Omni-Channel Innovation - Synchronoss DXP creates an environment where companies can centrally create and manage Omni-channel experiences - allowing total control of channel user experiences creating a continuous and intelligent pause and resume experience across channels.


• | Simple Systems Integration - Synchronoss DXP integrates into any back office system APIs, extracting mission-critical data and work flows into its Journey Creator environment - using this data to fuel innovative customer experiences into existing channels. This eliminates the need for companies to “rip and replace” their existing systems in order to innovate, create new revenue and reduce costs.


• | Easy to Operate Tools - Synchronoss DXP is a low/no-code, object-oriented environment that centrally collects back office data and uses this data to create compelling, intelligent user experiences across various end channels. The drag-n-drop journey creation experience is simple, intuitive to allow IT developers to operate faster and create an environment easy enough for business analysts and channel owners to collaborate.


• | Cost Efficient creation of FAANG-like Experiences - Synchronoss DXP allows existing systems to support middleware that sits between the back office and channel user experiences to create a centralized command and control center to author user experiences across touch points. This allows companies to author and manage better, more innovative and more effective customer experiences with a fraction of the manpower necessary in a business-as-usual (“BAU”) environment. DXP, in essence, is essential to check all the boxes of digital transformation: new revenue, innovative experiences and reduced costs.

Competitive Advantages for Synchronoss Cloud Platforms
17


• | Once an enterprising, forward-looking service proposition for Operators, the personal cloud market has matured over the last decade to become a staple of meeting a person’s digital needs. Today, data is becoming more valuable than the devices themselves. By the end of 2019, Statista estimates that more than 2 billion subscribers will have personal cloud accounts, of which 500 million Google Photos subscribers upload 1.2 billion photos and videos every day according to Techcrunch. Similarly, Apple has increased their free and premium cloud storage tiers by 200% according to Appleinsider. Further, as we look ahead to the advent of IoT and 5G, IDC estimates that there will be 80 billion devices in the IoT space alone by 2025 that look to utilize private clouds for various mission-critical, edge-data-transfer use cases. In 2018, Datanami reports the three biggest public cloud vendors grew at a rate approaching 50%. Over 3.2 billion images are shared online every day according to Stackla. 

We believe Synchronoss provides the world’s largest white label cloud solution for Operators in which they can generate new services revenue but can extend a branded relationship to an essential service, capture valuable data to provide better experiences and offer a level of security that has not been demonstrated by OTT competitors.
Competitive Advantages for Synchronoss Messaging Platforms 
The decline of Operator revenue growth includes a precipitous drop in messaging revenue and relevance. Traditional SMS traffic has plummeted giving rise to IP (Internet Protocol) based messaging -much of this traffic is attributed to the growth in popularity from Over-the-top (“OTT”) providers such as WeChat, Line, Facebook Messenger, Snapchat, Whats App? and more. It is estimated that there are over 4 billion messaging users. WeChat and Line alone outpace daily SMS traffic by over a 3-1 ratio with 45 billion and 25 billion messages a day respectively. And with this shift in traffic comes an equally dramatic shift in commerce. By 2030 it is estimated that OTT and RCS commerce will constitute 90% of all messaging revenue - an inverse position from 2015 when premium SMS drove almost all revenue. These new messaging venues are using advanced experiences such as chat bots that drive high user engagement. 67% of consumers recently surveyed have used a chat bot in the last 12 months. 
We believe due to our IP in advanced mobile messaging and strong Operator track record and heritage, Synchronoss is well-positioned to take part in the ground floor of the new messaging revenue growth. Synchronoss extended its Operator email contracts in Japan in their transition to an RCS messaging paradigm. We were selected to provide our RCS/RTC technology and platforms to the first Operator messaging cooperative in Japan, powering their Plus Message offering. Our white label Advanced Messaging Platform offers a comprehensive solution for Operators to take advantage of the onset of RCS messaging: 

• | Operator Neutrality - Synchronoss has historically managed discrete confidential contracts between competitive Operators world-wide. We believe this puts us in a unique position to work with Operators who are seeking to band together and create national messaging services to offset their collective loss to OTT Messaging Providers. 


• | P2P Messaging: Synchronoss’ Advanced Messaging platform works with various MaaP configurations across Operators and OEMs, providing key messaging management services for RCS capable handsets and clients.


• | A2P Commerce: Our Advanced Messaging supports native RCS, SMS and Client-driven RCS solutions providing maximum range across devices and operating systems - giving Operators maximum scale for commerce engagement.


• | Brand Ecosystem Management: Our Advanced Messaging Platform provides an easy-to-use management portal for brands and Operators to connect commerce to subscribers.


• | Operator-Grade Scale and Security: We believe our track record with massive, secure Operator installations, meeting highly regulated SLA requirements, puts Synchronoss in a position to look after the interests of each individual Operator as well as collectives.

Competitive Advantages for Synchronoss IoT Platforms
The forecasted growth in IoT devices and the IOT business is set to eclipse all previous mobile growth. M2M connections are set to double in 2021 to 3.3 billion. By 2020, it is estimated that 75% of new vehicles are expected to be Internet equipped and by 2025 the number of smart cities is expected to increase 4 times to 88. It is estimated that companies will spend upwards of $1 trillion on IoT by 2020 to capitalize on these new opportunities. We believe this opportunity is offset by a highly fractious nature of a complex landscape of disparate technologies, standards, data pools, business models and a gap in accessible administrative tools. This creates challenges for Operators, who are looking to recoup massive capital outlay of their 5G networks by monetizing new services. 
18

Synchronoss has been closely involved in enabling Operator IoT offerings supporting the provisioning of Internet capable vehicles and wearables. Our white-label business model is accretive to Operators, allowing them to bring new IoT services to market - adding new revenue and new value to IoT Network packages. 
Our Smart Buildings platform uses automation, orchestration and analytics that bring disparate building systems together - creating energy efficiencies, insights and easier points of management for administrators. This creates an easy to sell, easy to use plug and play, end-to-end solution powering IoT use cases that can be deployed quickly and operated easily.
Employees
We believe that our growth and success are attributable in large part to our employees and an experienced management team, many members of which have years of industry experience in building, implementing, marketing and selling transaction management solutions critical to business operations. We intend to continue training our employees, as well as developing and promoting our culture, and believe that these efforts provide us with a sustainable competitive advantage. We offer a work environment that enables employees to make meaningful contributions, as well as incentive programs that are designed to continue to motivate, retain and reward our employees.
As of December 31, 2018, we had 1,428 full-time employees located in India, North America, Europe and Asia Pacific regions. None of our employees are covered by any collective bargaining agreements.
