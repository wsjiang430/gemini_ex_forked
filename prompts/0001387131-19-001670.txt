Item 1. | Business
------------+---------

General
 
The Bank of South Carolina (the “Bank”) was organized on October 22, 1986 and opened for business as a state-chartered financial institution on February 26, 1987, in Charleston, South Carolina. The Bank was reorganized into a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, effective April 17, 1995. At the time of the reorganization, each outstanding share of the Bank was exchanged for two shares of Company stock.
Market Area
 
The Bank operates as an independent, community oriented, commercial bank providing a broad range of financial services and products to the Charleston – North Charleston metro area, which includes Charleston, Berkeley, and Dorchester county. We have four banking house locations: 256 Meeting Street, Charleston, SC; 100 North Main Street, Summerville, SC; 1337 Chuck Dawley Boulevard, Mt. Pleasant, SC; and 2027 Sam Rittenberg Boulevard, Charleston, SC. We intend to open a banking office at 9403 Highway 78, North Charleston, SC in 2019 (copy of the lease incorporated as Exhibit 10.13 in the June 30, 2017 Form 10-Q).
 
The Charleston – North Charleston metro area grew 33.11% between 2012 and 2017 according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. The primary economic drivers of our market area are manufacturing, hospitality, technology, and the healthcare industry. This includes manufacturing campuses for Boeing, Volvo Cars, and Mercedes-Benz Vans in the area. Hospitality has also contributed to the economic growth as both Conde Nast Traveler and Travel Leisure Magazine have recognized the area as a top tourism destination. Additionally, Charleston is considered the number one mid-sized U.S. metro area for IT growth according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Competition
 
The financial services industry is highly competitive. We face competition in attracting deposits and originating loans based upon a variety of factors including: 
 

● | interest rates offered on deposit accounts 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | interest rates charged on loans 
● | credit and service charges 
● | the quality of services rendered 
● | the convenience of banking facilities and other delivery channels 
● | relative lending limits in the case of loans 
● | increase in non-banking financial institutions providing similar services 
● | continued consolidation, and 
● | legislative, regulatory, economic, and technological changes 

 
We compete with commercial banks, savings institutions, finance companies, credit unions and other financial services companies. Many of our larger commercial bank competitors have greater name recognition and offer certain services that we do not. However, we believe that we have developed an effective competitive advantage in our market area by emphasizing exceptional service and knowledge of local trends and conditions.
 
Lending Activities
 
We focus our lending activities on small and middle market businesses, professionals and individuals in our geographic markets and typically require personal guarantees. Our primary lending activities are for commercial, commercial real estate, and consumer purposes, with the largest category being commercial real estate. Most of our lending activity is to borrowers within our market area.
Commercial Loans
 
As of December 31, 2018, $54.8 million, or 19.96%, of our loan portfolio consisted of commercial loans. We originate various types of secured and unsecured commercial loans to customers in our market area in order to provide customers with working capital and funds for other general business purposes. The term of these loans generally range from less than one year to 10 years. These loans bear either a fixed interest rate or an interest rate linked to a variable market index, depending on the individual loan, its purpose, and underwriting of that loan.
 
Commercial credit decisions are based upon our credit assessment of each applicant. We evaluate the applicant’s ability to repay in accordance with the proposed terms of the loan and assess the risks involved. In addition to evaluating the applicant’s financial statements, we consider the adequacy of the primary and secondary sources of repayment for the loan. Credit agency reports of the applicant’s personal credit history supplement our analysis of the applicant’s creditworthiness. In addition, collateral supporting a secured transaction is analyzed to determine its marketability. Commercial business loans generally have higher interest rates than residential loans of similar duration because they have a higher risk of default with repayment generally depending on the successful operation of the borrower’s business and the adequacy of any collateral.
 
Commercial Real Estate Loans
 
As of December 31, 2018, commercial real estate construction loans comprised $7.3 million, or 2.66%, of our loan portfolio. We make construction loans for commercial properties to businesses. Advances on construction loans are made in accordance with a schedule reflecting the cost of construction. Loans are typically underwritten with a maximum loan to value ratio of 80% based on current appraisals with value defined as the purchase price, appraised value, or cost of construction, whichever is lower. Repayment of construction loans on non-residential and income-producing properties is normally attributable to rental income, income from the borrower’s operating entity, or the sale of the property. Construction loans are interest-only during the construction period, which typically does not exceed twelve months and are often paid-off with permanent financing.
 
Before making a commitment to fund a construction loan, we require an appraisal of the property by a state-certified or state-licensed appraiser. We review and inspect properties before disbursement of funds during the term of the construction loan.

Construction financing generally involves greater credit risk than long-term financing on improved, owner-occupied real estate. Risk of loss on a construction loan depends largely upon the accuracy of the initial estimate of the value of the property at completion of construction compared to the estimated cost (including interest) of construction and other assumptions. Construction loans also expose us to risk that improvements will not be completed on time in accordance with specifications and projected costs.
 
As of December 31, 2018, $143.7 million, or 52.32%, of our loan portfolio consisted of other commercial real estate loans, excluding commercial construction loans. Properties securing our commercial real estate loans are primarily comprised of business owner-occupied properties, small office buildings and office suites, and income-producing real estate.
 
We base our decision to lend primarily on the economic viability of the property and the creditworthiness of the borrower. In evaluating a proposed commercial real estate loan, we emphasize the ratio of the property’s projected net cash flow to the loan’s debt service requirement computed after a deduction for an appropriate vacancy factor and reasonable expenses. We typically require property casualty insurance, title insurance, earthquake insurance, wind and hail coverage, and, if appropriate, flood insurance, in order to protect our security interest in the underlying property.
 
Commercial real estate loans generally carry higher credit risks, as they typically involve larger loan balances concentrated with single borrowers or groups of related borrowers. In addition, the payment of loans secured by income-producing properties typically depends on the successful operation of the property, as repayment of the loan generally is dependent, in large part, on sufficient income from the property to cover operating expenses and debt service. Changes in economic conditions not within the control of the borrower or lender could affect the value of the underlying collateral or the future cash flow of the property.
 
Consumer Loans
 
Consumer real estate loans were $63.8 million, or 23.22%, of the loan portfolio as of December 31, 2018. Consumer real estate loans consist of consumer construction loans, consumer real estate loans, HELOCs, and mortgage originations. We make construction loans for owner-occupied residential properties. Advances on construction loans are in accordance with a schedule reflecting the cost of construction, but are limited to a maximum loan-to-value ratio of 80%. Before making a commitment to fund a construction loan, we require an appraisal of the property by a state-certified or state-licensed appraiser. We review and inspect properties before disbursement of funds during the term of the construction loan. Similar to commercial real estate construction financing, consumer construction financing generally involves greater credit risk than long-term financing on improved, owner-occupied real estate. Risk of loss on a construction loan depends largely upon the accuracy of the initial estimate of the value of the property at completion of construction compared to the estimated cost (including interest) of construction and other assumptions. Construction loans also expose us to risk that improvements will not be completed on time in accordance with specifications and projected costs.
 
Consumer real estate loans consist of loans secured by first or second mortgages on primary residences, and originate as adjustable-rate or fixed-rate loans. Owner-occupied properties located in the Company’s market area serve as the collateral for these loans. The Company currently originates residential mortgage loans for our portfolio with a maximum loan-to-value ratio of 80% for traditional owner-occupied homes.
 
In addition to consumer real estate loans, we offer home equity loans and lines of credit secured by the borrower’s primary or secondary residence. Our home equity loans and lines of credit currently originate with adjustable- rate with a floor. We generally underwrite home equity loans and lines of credit with the same criteria that we use to underwrite mortgage loans to be sold. For a borrower’s primary and secondary residences, home equity loans and lines of credit are typically underwritten with a maximum loan-to-value ratio of 80% when combined with the principal balance of the existing mortgage loan. We require a current appraisal or internally prepared real estate evaluations on home equity loans and lines of credit. At the time we close a home equity loan or line of credit, we record a mortgage to perfect our security interest in the underlying collateral.
 
All residential loans that we originate are underwritten pursuant to our policies and procedures. We originate both adjustable-rate and fixed-rate loans. A rising interest rate environment that typically results in decreased loan demand may adversely affect our loan origination and sales activity.
 
Other consumer loans totaled $5.0 million and were 1.83% of the loan portfolio as of December 31, 2018. These loans are originated for various purposes, including the purchase of automobiles, boats, and other personal purposes.
 
Consumer loans may entail greater credit risk than mortgage loans to be sold, particularly in the case of consumer loans that are unsecured or are secured by rapidly depreciable assets, such as automobiles. In addition, consumer loan collections are dependent on the borrower’s continuing financial stability, and thus are more likely to be affected by adverse personal circumstances. The application of various federal and state laws, including bankruptcy and insolvency laws, may also limit the amount which can be recovered on such loans.

Loan Approval Procedures and Authority
 
Our lending activities follow written, non-discriminatory underwriting standards and loan origination procedures established by the Board of Directors of the Bank. The loan approval process is intended to assess the borrower’s ability to repay the loan and the value of the collateral that will secure the loan. To assess the borrower’s ability to repay, we review the borrower’s employment, credit history, and information on the historical and projected income and expenses of the borrower.
 
The objectives of our lending program are to: 
 

1. | Establish a sound asset structure 
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Provide a sound and profitable loan portfolio to: 
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


a) | Protect the depositor’s funds 
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


b) | Maximize the shareholders’ return on their investment 
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | Promote the stable economic growth and development of the market area served by the Bank 
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4. | Comply with all regulatory agency requirements and applicable law 
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The underwriting standards and loan origination procedures include officer lending limits, which are approved by the Board of Directors. The individual secured/unsecured lending authority of the President/Chief Executive Officer of the Bank is set at $1,500,000 and the individual secured/unsecured lending authority of the Senior Lender/Executive Vice President is set at $750,000. The President/Chief Executive Officer of the Bank and the Senior Lender/Executive Vice President may jointly lend up to 10% of the Bank’s unimpaired capital for the previous quarter end. In the absence of either of the above, the other may, jointly with the approval of either the Chairman of the Board of Directors or a majority of the Loan Committee of the Board of Directors, lend up to 10% of the Bank’s unimpaired capital for the previous quarter end. The Board of Directors, with two-thirds vote, may approve the aggregate credit in excess of this limit but may not exceed 15% of the Bank’s unimpaired capital. Loan limits apply to the total direct and indirect liability of the borrower. All loans above the loan officer’s authority must have the approval of a loan officer with the authority to approve a loan of that amount. Pooling of loan authority is not allowed except as outlined above for the President/Chief Executive Officer, Senior Lender/Executive Vice President, a majority of the Loan Committee or two-thirds of the Board of Directors.
 
All new credit which results in aggregate direct, indirect, and related credit, not under an approved line of credit of a threshold set forth in our loan policy, with the exceptions of mortgage loans in the process of being sold to investors and loans secured by properly margined negotiable securities traded on an established market or other cash collateral, are reviewed in detail on a monthly basis by the Loan Committee. Certain new credits that meet a higher threshold than required for the Loan Committee are reviewed by the Board of Directors of the Bank at its regular monthly meeting.
 
Employees
 
At December 31, 2018, we employed 79 people, with four individuals considered part time and one individual considered hourly, none of whom are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We provide a variety of benefit programs including an Employee Stock Ownership Plan and Trust, Stock Incentive Plan, health, life, disability and other insurance. We believe our relationship with our employees is excellent.
Supervision and Regulation
 
We are subject to extensive state and federal banking laws and regulations that impose specific requirements or restrictions and provide for general regulatory oversight of virtually all aspects of operations. The regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors, customers, and the integrity of the U.S. banking system and capital markets. The following information describes some of the more significant laws and regulations applicable to us. The description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the applicable laws and regulations. Proposals to change the laws and regulations governing the banking industry are frequently raised in Congress, state legislatures, and with the various bank regulatory agencies. Changes in applicable laws or regulations, or a change in the way such laws or regulations are interpreted by regulatory agencies or courts, may have a material impact on our business operations and earnings.
 
Dodd-Frank Act
 
On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) became effective. This law has broadly affected the financial services industry by implementing changes to the financial regulatory landscape aimed at strengthening the sound operation of the financial services industry, and will continue to significantly change the current bank regulatory structure and affect the lending, deposit, investment, trading and operating activities of financial institutions and their holding companies, including the Company and the Bank.

The Dodd-Frank Act created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the “CFPB”) to centralize responsibility for consumer financial protection, including implementing, examining and enforcing compliance with federal consumer financial laws. The CFPB exercises supervisory review of banks under its jurisdiction. The CFPB focuses its rulemaking in several areas, particularly in the areas of mortgage reform involving the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the Truth in Lending Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. There are many provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act mandating regulators to adopt new regulations and conduct studies upon which future regulation may be based. Governmental intervention and new regulations could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 
Volcker Rule
 
Section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Act, known as the “Volcker Rule,” prohibits any bank, bank holding company, or affiliate (referred to collectively as “banking entities”) from engaging in two types of activities: proprietary trading and the ownership or sponsorship of private equity or hedge funds that are referred to as covered funds. Proprietary trading, in general, is trading in securities on a short-term basis for a banking entity’s own account. In December 2013, federal banking agencies, the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, finalized a regulation to implement the Volcker Rule. At December 31, 2018, the Company has evaluated our securities portfolio and has determined that we do not hold any covered funds.
Bank Holding Company Act
 
The Company is a one-bank holding company under the Federal Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended. As a result, the Company is primarily subject to the supervision, examination and reporting requirements of the Board of Governors (the “Federal Reserve Board”) of the Federal Reserve Bank (the “Federal Reserve”) under the act and its regulations promulgated thereunder. Moreover, as a bank holding company located in South Carolina, the Company is also subject to the regulations of the South Carolina State Board of Financial Institutions.
Capital Requirements
 
The Federal Reserve Board imposes certain capital requirements on the Company under the Bank Holding Company Act, including a minimum leverage ratio and minimum ratio of “qualifying” capital to risk-weighted assets. These requirements are essentially the same as those that apply to the Bank and are described under “Regulatory Capital Requirements” in the notes to the financial statements (see Note 18). The ability of the Company to pay dividends to shareholders depends on the Bank’s ability to pay dividends to the Company, which is subject to regulatory restrictions as described below in “Dividends.”
 
Standards for Safety and Soundness
 
The Federal Deposit Insurance Act requires the federal banking regulatory agencies to prescribe, by regulation or guideline, operational and managerial standards for all insured depository institutions relating to (1) internal controls, information systems and internal audit systems, (2) loan documentation, (3) credit underwriting, (4) interest rate risk exposure, and (5) asset growth. The agencies also must prescribe standards for asset quality, earnings, and stock valuation, as well as standards for compensation, fees, and benefits. The federal banking agencies have adopted regulations and “Interagency Guidelines Establishing Standards for Safety and Soundness” to implement these required standards. These guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards that the federal banking agencies use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired.
 
Regulatory Examination
 
All insured institutions must undergo regular on-site examinations by their appropriate banking agency. The cost of examinations of insured depository institutions and any affiliates may be assessed by the appropriate banking agency against each institution or affiliate, as it deems necessary or appropriate. Insured institutions are required to submit annual reports to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”), their federal regulatory agency, and state supervisor when applicable.
 
The federal banking regulatory agencies prescribe, by regulation, standards for all insured depository institutions and depository institution holding companies relating to, among other things, the following:
 

● | Internal controls 
--+------------------------------------------
● | Information systems and audit systems 
● | Loan documentation 
● | Credit underwriting 
● | Interest rate risk exposure 
● | Asset quality 
● | Liquidity 
● | Capital adequacy 
● | Bank Secrecy Act 
● | Sensitivity to market risk

Transactions with Affiliates and Insiders
 
We are subject to certain restrictions on extensions of credit to executive officers, directors, certain principal shareholders, and their related interests. Such extensions of credit must be made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates, and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with third parties and must not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features.
 
Dividends
 
The Company’s principal source of cash flow, including cash flow to pay dividends to its shareholders, is dividends it receives from the Bank. Statutory and regulatory limitations apply to the Bank’s payment of dividends to the Company. As a general rule, the amount of a dividend may not exceed, without prior regulatory approval, the sum of net income in the calendar year to date and the retained net earnings of the immediately preceding two calendar years. A depository institution may not pay any dividend if payment would cause the institution to become undercapitalized or if it already is undercapitalized.
Consumer Protection Regulations
 
Activities of the Bank are subject to a variety of statutes and regulations designed to protect consumers. Interest and other charges collected by the Bank are subject to state usury laws and federal laws concerning interest rates. Our loan operations are also subject to federal laws applicable to credit transactions, such as:

● | The federal Truth-In-Lending Act, which governs disclosures of credit terms to consumer borrowers 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | The Home Mortgage Disclosure Act of 1975, which requires financial institutions to provide information to enable the public and public officials to determine whether a financial institution is fulfilling its obligation to help meet the housing needs of the community it serves 
● | The Fair Lending Act, which requires fair, equitable, and nondiscriminatory access to credit for consumers 
● | The Equal Credit Opportunity Act, prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, creed or other prohibited factors in extending credit 
● | The Fair Credit Reporting Act of 1978, which governs the use and provision of information to credit reporting agencies 
● | The Fair Debt Collection Act, which governs the manner in which consumer debt may be collected by collection agencies 
● | The rules and regulations of the various federal agencies charged with the responsibility of implementing such federal laws. 

 
The deposit operations of the Bank also are subject to:
 

● | The Right to Financial Privacy Act, which imposes a duty to maintain confidentiality of consumer financial records and prescribes procedures for complying with administrative subpoenas of financial records 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | The Electronic Funds Transfer Act and the Federal Reserve Board issued Regulation E to implement the act, which governs automatic deposits to and withdrawals from deposit and customer’s rights and liabilities arising from the use of automated teller machines and other electronic banking services 
● | Regulation DD, which implements the Truth in Savings Act to enable consumers to make informed decisions about deposit accounts at depository institutions. 

Enforcement Powers
 
The Company is subject to supervision and examination by the Federal Reserve and the South Carolina State Board of Financial Institutions. The Bank is subject to extensive federal and state regulations that significantly affect business and activities. These regulatory bodies have broad authority to implement standards and to initiate proceedings designed to prohibit depository institutions from engaging in activities that represent unsafe or unsound banking practices or constitute violations of applicable laws, rules, regulations, administrative orders, or written agreements with regulators. These regulatory bodies are authorized to take action against institutions that fail to meet such standards, including the assessment of civil monetary penalties, the issuance of cease-and-desist orders, and other actions.
Bank Secrecy Act/Anti-Money Laundering
 
We are subject to the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering laws and regulations, including the USA Patriot Act of 2001 (“USA Patriot Act”). We must maintain a Bank Secrecy Act Program that includes established internal policies, procedures, and controls; a designated compliance officer; an ongoing employee-training program; and testing of the program by an independent audit function. The enactment of the USA Patriot Act amended and expanded the focus of the Bank Secrecy Act to facilitate information sharing among governmental entities and the Company for the purpose of combating terrorism and money laundering. It improves anti-money laundering and financial transparency laws, information collection tools and the enforcement mechanics for the U.S. government. These provisions include (a) standards for verifying customer identification at account opening; (b) rules to promote cooperation among financial institutions, regulators, and law enforcement entities in identifying parties that may be involved in terrorism or money laundering; (c) reports by nonfinancial trades and businesses filed with the U.S. Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network for transactions exceeding $10,000; (d) suspicious activities reports by brokers and dealers if they believe a customer may be violating U.S. laws; and (e) regulations and enhanced due diligence requirements for financial institutions that administer, maintain, or manage private bank accounts or correspondent accounts for non-U.S. persons.

Similar in purpose to the Bank Secrecy Act, the Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”), a division of the U.S. Department of Treasury, controls and imposes economic and trade sanctions based on U.S. foreign policy and national security goals against targeted countries and individuals based on threats to foreign policy, national security, or the U.S. economy. OFAC has and will send banking regulatory agencies lists of names of individuals and organizations suspected of aiding, concealing, or engaging in terrorist acts. Among other things, the Bank must block transactions with or accounts of sanctioned persons and report those transactions after their occurrence.
 
Bank regulators routinely examine institutions for compliance with these obligations and are required to consider compliance in connection with the regulatory review of applications.
 
Privacy and Credit Reporting
 
In connection with our lending activities, we are subject to a number of federal laws designed to protect borrowers and promote lending to various sectors of the economy and population. These include the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Truth-in-Lending Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, and the Community Reinvestment Act (the “CRA”). The CRA requires the appropriate federal banking agency, in connection with its examination of a bank, to assess the bank’s record in meeting the credit needs of the communities served by the bank, including low and moderate income neighborhoods. Under the CRA, institutions are assigned a rating of “outstanding,” “satisfactory,” “needs to improve,” or “substantial non-compliance.” In addition, federal banking regulators, pursuant to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, have enacted regulations limiting the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose nonpublic consumer information to non-affiliated third parties. The regulations require disclosure of privacy policies and allow consumers to prevent certain personal information from being shared with nonaffiliated third parties.
