--------+---------

Overview 
 TripAdvisor is an online travel company and our mission is to help people around the world to plan, book and experience the perfect trip. We seek to achieve our mission by providing consumers and travel partners a global platform with rich consumer-generated content, price comparison tools and online reservation and related services for destinations, accommodations, travel activities and experiences, and restaurants.
 TripAdvisor, Inc., by and through its subsidiaries, owns and operates a portfolio of leading online travel brands. Our flagship brand, TripAdvisor, is the world’s largest travel site based on monthly unique visitors, which reached 490 million average monthly unique visitors during our seasonal peak during the year ended December 31, 2018, according to our internal log files. 
 Our TripAdvisor-branded websites include www.tripadvisor.com in the United States and localized versions of the TripAdvisor website in 48 markets and 28 languages worldwide. TripAdvisor features approximately 730 million reviews and opinions on approximately 8.1 million places to stay, places to eat and things to do – including 1.3 million hotels, inns, B&Bs and specialty lodging, 875,000 rental properties, 4.9 million restaurants and 1.0 million travel activities and experiences worldwide. We also enable consumers to compare prices and/or book a number of these travel experiences on either a TripAdvisor website or mobile application (“app”), or on the website or mobile app of one of our travel partners.
 In addition to the flagship TripAdvisor brand, we manage and operate the following other travel media brands, connected by the common goal of providing consumers the most comprehensive travel-planning and trip-taking resources in the travel industry: www.airfarewatchdog.com, www.bokun.io, www.bookingbuddy.com, www.cruisecritic.com, www.familyvacationcritic.com, www.flipkey.com, www.thefork.com (including www.lafourchette.com, www.eltenedor.com, and www.iens.nl), www.holidaylettings.co.uk, www.holidaywatchdog.com, www.housetrip.com, www.jetsetter.com, www.niumba.com, www.onetime.com, www.oyster.com, www.seatguru.com, www.smartertravel.com, www.tingo.com, www.vacationhomerentals.com, and www.viator.com. 
 Our Industry and Market Opportunity 
 We operate in the global travel industry, focusing exclusively on online travel and travel-related activity, and the online advertising market.
 Phocuswright, an independent travel, tourism and hospitality research firm, estimates the annual global travel market at $1.7 trillion. Phocuswright also estimates online penetration of global travel bookings to be less than 50%. However, travel bookings have been moving online as consumers gain access to the internet and global tourism activity continues to increase, driven by middle class and economic growth. TripAdvisor, as an internet-enabled travel-focused business, allows consumers to research travel activity and share their experiences and opinions with a global audience. As consumer online travel media consumption and online travel commerce activity increases, we believe travel and travel-related businesses will continue to allocate greater percentages of their marketing budgets to online channels in order to grow their businesses. We believe this creates a significant long-term growth opportunity for our business.
Our Business Model 
 Our businesses match demand, or consumers that seek to discover, research, price compare and book the best travel experiences online with supply from travel partners around the world that provide travel accommodations and experiences. 
Consumer Offerings
 TripAdvisor enables consumers to plan, book and experience the perfect trip by providing content, supply, price, and convenience. Content and supply has enabled TripAdvisor to become a well-known global brand, one that has attracted the world’s largest travel audience, based on average monthly unique visitors, and influences a

significant amount of travel commerce. We are focused on creating the best online experience in travel planning and booking, making it easier for consumers to research destinations and experiences, read and contribute user-generated content, compare destinations and businesses based on quality, price and availability, and complete bookings powered by our travel partners. 
 Travel Partners
 Our portfolio of travel-related websites enables our travel partners to be discovered, to advertise and to sell their services to a global travel audience. Travel partners may include hotel chains, independent hoteliers, online travel agencies, or OTAs, destination marketing organizations, and other travel-related and non-travel related product and service providers—who seek to market and sell their products and services to a global audience. We enable media advertising opportunities – and in some cases, facilitate transactions between consumers and travel partners in a number of ways, including by sending referrals to our travel partners’ websites, facilitating bookings on behalf of our travel partners, by serving as the merchant of record – particularly in our Experiences and Rentals offerings – and by offering advertising placements on our websites and mobile apps.
Segments and Products
 We manage our business in two reportable segments: Hotel and Non-Hotel. Our Non-Hotel reportable segment consists of our Experiences, Restaurants and Rentals offerings. During the first quarter of 2018, we renamed Attractions as “Experiences” and Vacation Rentals as “Rentals.” These changes had no impact on the composition of our segments or on any financial information. These segments have been determined based on how the chief operating decision maker regularly assesses information and evaluates performance for operating decision-making purposes, including allocation of resources. Financial information and additional descriptive information related to our segments is contained in “Note 18: Segment and Geographic Information” and “Note 4: Revenue Recognition,” in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 on this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 The Hotel segment accounted for 72%, 77%, and 80%, of our consolidated revenue in the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and includes revenue generated from the following sources:
  
• | TripAdvisor-branded Click-based and Transaction Revenue. Our largest source of Hotel segment revenue is generated from click-based advertising on TripAdvisor-branded websites, which is primarily comprised of contextually-relevant links to our travel partners’ sites. Our click-based travel partners are predominantly OTAs and direct suppliers in the hotel category. Click-based advertising is generally priced on a cost-per-click, or “CPC” basis, with payments from travel partners determined by the number of travelers who click on a link multiplied by the CPC rate for each specific click. CPC rates that our travel partners pay are determined in a dynamic, competitive auction process, also known as our metasearch auction. Transaction revenue is generated from our hotel instant booking feature, which enables hotel shoppers to book directly on TripAdvisor through a travel partner, with the latter serving as the merchant of record for the transaction. We earn a pre-determined commission rate from our travel partners for each consumer that completes a hotel reservation on our website or app.

• | TripAdvisor-branded Display-based Advertising and Subscription Revenue. Travel partners can promote their brands in a contextually-relevant manner through a variety of display-based advertising placements on our websites. Our display-based advertising clients are predominantly direct suppliers of hotels, air travel and cruises, as well as destination marketing organizations. Other display clients include OTAs and other travel-related businesses, as well as advertisers from non-travel categories. Display-based advertising is sold predominantly on a cost per thousand impressions, or CPM, basis. We also offer subscription-based advertising to hoteliers, owners of B&Bs and other specialty lodging properties, enabling subscribers to advertise their businesses on our website, as well as manage and promote their website URL, email address, phone number, special offers and other information related to their business. Subscription advertising services are predominantly sold for a flat fee for a contracted period of time of one year or less.

• | Other Hotel Revenue. Our other Hotel revenue primarily includes revenue from non-TripAdvisor-branded websites, such as www.bookingbuddy.com, www.cruisecritic.com, www.onetime.com, and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

www.smartertravel.com, which primarily includes click-based advertising and display-based advertising revenue sources, as described above.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Non-Hotel offerings – Experiences, Restaurants and Rentals – have comprised an increasing percentage of consumer demand and consolidated revenue. Our Non-Hotel reportable segment accounted for 28%, 23%, and 20% of our consolidated revenue in the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and includes revenue generated from the following sources: 
  
• | Experiences. We provide information and services for consumers to research, book and travel activities and experiences in popular travel destinations both through Viator, our dedicated Experiences offering, and on our TripAdvisor website and app. We also power travel activities and experience booking capabilities to consumers on affiliate partner websites, including some of the world’s top airlines, hotel chains and online and offline travel agencies. We work with local tour or travel activities/experiences operators (the “supplier”) to provide consumers with access to tours, activities and experiences (the “activity”) in popular destinations worldwide. We generate commissions for each booking transaction we facilitate through our online reservation system. To a lesser extent, we earn commissions from third-party merchant partners, which display and promote our supplier activities on their websites to generate bookings.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Restaurants. We provide information and services for consumers to research and book restaurants in popular travel destinations through our dedicated restaurant reservations offering, TheFork, and on our TripAdvisor websites and mobile apps. TheFork is an online restaurant booking platform operating on a number of websites (including www.lafourchette.com, www.eltenedor.com, and www.iens.nl), with a network of restaurant partners located primarily across Europe and Australia. Our bookable restaurants are available on www.thefork.com and on TripAdvisor-branded websites and mobile apps. We primarily generate transaction fees (or per seated diner fees) that are paid by restaurants for diners seated primarily from bookings through TheFork’s online reservation system. To a lesser extent, we also generate subscription fees for subscription-based advertising to restaurants, access to certain online reservation management services and marketing analytic tools provided by TheFork and TripAdvisor.

• | Rentals. We provide information and services for consumers to research and book vacation and short-term rental properties, including full home rentals, condominiums, villas, beach rentals, cabins and cottages. Our Rentals offering generates revenue primarily by offering individual property owners and managers the ability to list their properties on our websites and mobile apps thereby connecting homeowners with travelers through a free-to-list, commission-based option or, to a lesser extent, by an annual subscription-based fee structure. These properties are listed on www.flipkey.com, www.holidaylettings.co.uk, www.housetrip.com, www.niumba.com, www.vacationhomerentals.com, and on our TripAdvisor-branded websites and mobile apps.

Seasonality 
 Traveler expenditures in the global travel market tend to follow a seasonal pattern. As such, advertising investments made by travel partners to market to potential travelers and, therefore, our revenue and profits tend to be seasonal as well. Our financial performance tends to be seasonally highest in the second and third quarters of a year, as it is a key period for leisure travel research and trip-taking, which includes the seasonal peak in traveler hotel and rental stays, and travel activities and experiences taken, compared to the first and fourth quarters which represent seasonal low points. Further significant shifts in our business mix or adverse economic conditions could result in future seasonal patterns that are different from historical trends. 
Our Long-Term Growth Strategy 
 Our mission is to help people around the world plan, book and experience the perfect trip. We seek to deliver on this mission by: increasing and leveraging our rich, user-generated content and global brand to attract consumers to our websites and mobile apps; delivering the best consumer experience throughout all phases of the travel journey from inspiration and travel-planning to trip-taking and sharing the experience; deepening our relationships with travel partners by providing them an array of advertising opportunities to generate qualified leads, or hotel shoppers

we pass along to travel partners; and investing in technology, product development, marketing and other strategic areas that we believe can improve the TripAdvisor experience and improve our long-term business prospects.
  
• | Drive consumer engagement with our platform. TripAdvisor is a globally-recognized travel brand built on travel reviews and travel research. A large, global travel audience leverages TripAdvisor’s rich content to discover, plan, and book travel experiences. We seek to further amplify our global brand by raising consumer awareness for – and engagement with – our end-to-end product offerings, such as the ability to seamlessly research, price compare, book and share travel experiences on our platform. We believe building deeper, more durable consumer relationships can attract more consumers more frequently to our products, either directly to our websites and mobile apps or through various online and offline marketing channels, and that these consumers will then become qualified leads that we can provide to our partners. These channels include search engines through search engine optimization, or SEO, and search engine marketing, or SEM, retargeting and television, or brand advertising.

• | Deliver the best consumer experience possible on our platform. We believe delivering consumers a more holistic, end-to-end product experience is critically important for the long-term health of our business. We have invested – and will continue to invest – in product enhancements that ensure TripAdvisor gives consumers an assistive experience throughout all phases of the travel journey – from inspiration and discovery, to researching, price shopping and booking, to finding and booking things to do and places to eat, to sharing.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Deepen relationships with our travel partners. Our large, global audience makes it an attractive platform for listing and advertising opportunities that helps generate impressions, brand awareness, qualified leads and bookings for travel partners. We believe that growing the number of listings and bookable supply, especially in our in-destination Experiences and Restaurants offerings, enables consumers not only to find and book the perfect trip, but also enables partners to drive transactions for their business. We also provide business-to-business services – including subscription-based advertising services, such as TripAdvisor’s Business Advantage for hoteliers and Premium for Restaurants, which are advertising opportunities and marketing analytics tools – that are designed to help our partners attract customers, more effectively manage their presence on TripAdvisor, and grow their business.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Invest in technology and product. We prioritize rapid product-testing and speed to market as we seek to deliver consumers a richer experience. We launch new product features on our websites and mobile apps on a regular product release cycle. Also, during the year ended December 31, 2018, more than half of our average monthly unique visitors came from mobile phones, according to our log files. We have invested – and will continue to invest – to improve the features, functionality, consumer engagement, and commercialization of our offerings on all devices to meet, and hopefully, exceed, evolving consumer needs and expectations.

 Marketing and Competition
We compete in a large, dynamic and competitive global travel industry. We face competition for content, consumers, and advertisers from other online travel and price comparison services (known in the industry as “metasearch”), as well as OTAs. In order to favorably attract consumers to our websites and mobile apps, we invest to amplify our global brand and raise consumer awareness of, and engagement with, our end-to-end product offerings. We invest through various marketing channels, including domain direct and various online and offline marketing channels, including online search engines (primarily Google), social media, emails and in more recent years, through television brand advertising. The relative success of our marketing strategy can be influenced by changes that we, our partners, or our competitors make to our respective products and marketing strategies. During 2018, our total advertising expense was approximately $544 million, primarily driven by investments in online search engines, and to a lesser extent, investments in offline marketing channels, which was primarily television advertising. We intend to continue to promote brand awareness through both online and offline advertising efforts. 
 We compete with different types of companies in the various markets and geographies in which we operate, including large and small companies in the travel space as well as broader service providers. More specifically:
  
• | In our Hotel segment, we face competition from, and in some cases partner with, the following businesses: OTAs (including Expedia Group, Inc., or Expedia, and Booking Holdings Inc., or Booking,
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

and many of their respective subsidiaries and operating companies); hotel metasearch providers (including trivago, a subsidiary of Expedia, Kayak and HotelsCombined, subsidiaries of Booking, and Ctrip.com International, Ltd); large online search, social media, and marketplace platforms and companies (including Google, Facebook, Microsoft’s Bing, Yahoo, Baidu, Alibaba, and Amazon); and traditional offline travel agencies; and global hotel chains seeking to promote direct bookings.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | In our Non-Hotel segment, Experiences competes with online travel agencies, such as Airbnb, Booking, and GetYourGuide; traditional travel agencies; online travel service providers; and wholesalers, among others. Our Restaurants offering competes with other online restaurant reservation services, such as SeatMe (owned by Yelp) and OpenTable (a subsidiary of Booking), and local or regional providers. Our Rentals offering competes with companies focused on alternative lodging and shared accommodations and online accommodation searches, including Airbnb, HomeAway (a subsidiary of Expedia) and Booking.com (a subsidiary of Booking).
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 As the industry continues to shift towards online travel services and the technology supporting it continues to evolve, we anticipate that the existing competitive landscape will continue to change, new competitors may emerge, and industry consolidation may continue. 
 Commercial Relationships 
 We have a number of commercial relationships that are important to the success of our business. Although these relationships are memorialized in agreements, many of these agreements are for limited terms or are terminable at will or on short notice. As a result, we seek to ensure the mutual success of these relationships. 
 We have commercial relationships with the majority of the world’s leading OTAs, as well as a variety of other travel partners pursuant to which these companies primarily purchase traveler leads from us, generally on a click-based advertising basis. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 our two most significant travel partners were Expedia (and its subsidiaries) and Booking (and its subsidiaries), each of which accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenue and together accounted for approximately 37%, 43% and 46% of our consolidated revenue, respectively. Nearly all of this concentration of revenue is recorded in our Hotel segment for these reporting periods. 
 Operations and Technology 
 We have assembled a team of highly skilled software engineers, computer scientists, data scientists, network engineers and systems engineers whose expertise spans a broad range of technical areas, including a wide variety of open source operating systems, databases, languages, analytics, networking, scalable web architecture, operations and warehousing technologies. We make significant investments in product and feature development, data management, personalization technologies, scalable infrastructures, networking, data warehousing, and search engine technologies. 
 Our systems infrastructure and web and database servers for TripAdvisor-branded websites are housed at two geographically separate facilities and have multiple communication links as well as continuous monitoring and engineering support. Each facility is fully self-sufficient and operational with its own hardware, networking, software and content, and is structured in an active/passive, fully redundant configuration. Substantially all of our software components, data, and content are replicated in multiple datacenters and development centers, as well as being backed up at offsite locations. Our systems are monitored and protected though multiple layers of security. Several of our individual subsidiaries and businesses, including Viator, have their own data infrastructure and technology teams. 
 Intellectual Property 
 Our intellectual property, including patents, trademarks, copyrights, domain names, trade dress, proprietary technology and trade secrets, is an important component of our business. We rely on our intellectual property rights in our content, proprietary technology, software code, ratings indexes, databases of reviews and forum content. We 
 
6


have acquired some of our intellectual property rights through licenses and content agreements with third parties and these arrangements may place restrictions on the use of our intellectual property. 
 We protect our intellectual property by relying on our terms of use, confidentiality agreements and contractual provisions, as well as on international, national, federal, state and common law rights. We protect our brands by pursuing the trademark registration of our core brands, as appropriate, maintaining our trademark portfolio, securing contractual trademark rights protection when appropriate, and relying on common law trademark rights when appropriate. We also register copyrights and domain names as deemed appropriate. Additionally, we protect our trademarks, domain names and copyrights with the use of intellectual property licenses and an enforcement program. 
 We have considered, and will continue to consider, the appropriateness of filing for patents to protect future inventions, as circumstances may warrant. However, many patents protect only specific inventions and there can be no assurance that others may not create new products or methods that achieve similar results without infringing upon patents owned by us. 
 In connection with our copyrightable content, we post and institute procedures under the U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act and similar “host privilege” statutes worldwide to gain immunity from copyright liability for photographs, text and other content loaded on our sites by users.  However, differences between statutes, limitations on immunity, and moderation efforts in the many jurisdictions in which we operate may affect our ability to claim immunity.  
 From time to time, we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of our business, including claims of alleged infringement by us of the trademarks, copyrights, patents, and other intellectual property rights of third parties.  In addition, litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, protect our trade secrets or determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights claimed by others.  Any such litigation, regardless of outcome or merit, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and technical resources, any of which could materially harm our business.  
 Regulation 
 We are subject to a number of laws and regulations that affect companies conducting business on the internet and relating to the travel industry, the vacation rental industry and the provision of travel services.  As we continue to expand the reach of our brands into additional international markets, we are increasingly subject to additional laws and regulations.  This includes laws and regulations regarding, among other matters, consumer privacy, libel, rights of publicity, data protection, content, intellectual property, distribution, electronic contracts and other communications, consumer protection, taxation, online payment services, competition and protection of minors. These laws and regulations are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change. Many of these laws and regulations are being tested in courts, and could be interpreted by regulators and courts in ways that could harm our business. In addition, the application and interpretation of these laws and regulations is often uncertain, particularly in the new and rapidly-evolving industry in which we operate. 
 In addition, we provide advertising data and information and conduct marketing activities that are subject to consumer protection laws that regulate unfair and deceptive practices, domestically and internationally, including, in some countries, pricing display requirements, licensing and registration requirements and industry specific value-added tax regimes. The United States and European Union have adopted legislation that regulates certain aspects of the internet, including online editorial and user-generated content, data privacy, behavioral targeting and online advertising, taxation, and liability for third-party activities. It is impossible to accurately predict how this new legislation will be interpreted and applied or whether new taxes or regulations will be imposed on our services, and whether or how we might be affected. Increased regulation of the internet could increase the cost of doing business or otherwise materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or operational results.

We are subject to laws that require protection of user privacy and user data.  As our business has evolved, we have begun to receive and store a greater volume of personally identifiable data.  This data is increasingly subject to laws and regulations in numerous jurisdictions around the world.  For example, the European Union, in May 2018, adopted the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, which requires companies, including ours, to meet enhanced requirements regarding the handling of personal data. The enactment, interpretation and application of this law is still in a state of flux, and the interpretation and application of GDPR may vary from country to country.   In addition, similar laws are currently under discussion in other jurisdictions. 
 Also, on June 23, 2016, the United Kingdom passed a referendum to exit the European Union, known as Brexit.  Since the terms of the United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union are uncertain, we are unable to predict the effect Brexit will have on our business and results of operations; however, we will likely face new regulatory costs and challenges if the U.K. regulations diverge from those of the European Union.  
 Corporate History, Equity Ownership and Voting Control
 TripAdvisor was co-founded in February 2000 by Stephen Kaufer, our current Chief Executive Officer and President. In April 2004, TripAdvisor was acquired by IAC/InterActiveCorp, or IAC. In August 2005, IAC spun-off its portfolio of travel brands, including TripAdvisor, into Expedia, at the time a separate newly-formed Delaware corporation. On December 20, 2011 Expedia completed a spin-off of TripAdvisor into a separate publicly-traded Delaware corporation. We refer to this second spin-off transaction as the “Spin-Off.” Following the Spin-Off, on December 21, 2011, TripAdvisor began trading on The NASDAQ Global Select Market, or NASDAQ, as an independent public company under the trading symbol “TRIP.”
 On December 11, 2012, Liberty Interactive Corporation, or Liberty, purchased an aggregate of approximately 4.8 million shares of common stock of TripAdvisor from Barry Diller, our former Chairman of the Board of Directors and Senior Executive, and certain of his affiliates. As a result, Liberty beneficially owned approximately 18.2 million shares of our common stock and 12.8 million shares of our Class B common stock. 
 On August 27, 2014, the entire beneficial ownership of our common stock and Class B common stock held by Liberty was acquired by Liberty TripAdvisor Holdings, Inc., or LTRIP. Simultaneously, Liberty, LTRIP’s former parent company, distributed, by means of a dividend, to the holders of its Liberty Ventures common stock, Liberty’s entire equity interest in LTRIP. We refer to this transaction as the “Liberty Spin-Off”. As a result of the Liberty Spin-Off, effective August 27, 2014, LTRIP became a separate, publicly traded company holding 100% of Liberty’s interest in TripAdvisor. 
 As a result of these transactions, as of December 31, 2018, LTRIP beneficially owned approximately 18.2 million shares of our common stock and 12.8 million shares of our Class B common stock, which constitute 14.5% of the outstanding shares of common stock and 100% of the outstanding shares of Class B common stock. Assuming the conversion of all of LTRIP’s shares of Class B common stock into common stock, LTRIP would beneficially own 22.5% of the outstanding common stock. Because each share of Class B common stock is entitled to ten votes per share and each share of common stock is entitled to one vote per share, LTRIP may be deemed to beneficially own equity securities representing 57.7% of our voting power.
 Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had 3,366 employees. Of these employees, approximately half of these employees were based in the United States. We believe we have good relationships with our employees, including relationships with employees represented by international works councils or other similar organizations.
