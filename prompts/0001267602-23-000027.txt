ITEM 1. BUSINESS

Unless the context otherwise requires, throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the words “Alimera” “Alimera Sciences” “we,” “us,” the “registrant” or the “Company” refer to Alimera Sciences, Inc. and its subsidiaries (as applicable).

The term “ILUVIEN” is our registered trademark. All other trademarks, trade names and service marks appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are the property of their respective owners.

Overview

We are a commercial-stage global pharmaceutical company developing and commercializing ILUVIEN for the treatment of diabetic macular edema (DME), a leading cause of blindness, and outside the U.S. for non-infectious uveitis affecting the posterior segment of the eye (NIU-PS). ILUVIEN is a state-of-the-art, sustained release intravitreal implant that enables patients to maintain vision longer, and importantly, with fewer injections. We commercialize ILUVIEN in the U.S., Europe, China and Middle East. We are also studying ILUVIEN in a clinical trial, the NEW DAY Study, where it is being evaluated for efficacy as baseline therapy in patients with early DME by comparing ILUVIEN to the current standard of care, anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy. Alimera’s mission is to be invaluable to patients, physicians and partners concerned with retinal health and maintaining better vision longer.
Business Strategy

We presently focus on diseases affecting the back of the eye, or retina, because we believe these diseases are not sufficiently treated with current competing therapies and treatment regimens and represent a significant market opportunity. Our strategy is to establish ILUVIEN as a leading therapy for DME and NIU-PS patients for which ILUVIEN is proven safe and effective because of its ability to help patients see better, longer with fewer injections for up to three years. We rely on our management’s experience and the breadth of our commercial resources in both the U.S. and Europe to maintain focus on the retinal space to commercialize ILUVIEN. We intend to use those same strengths to acquire, obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize other potential eye care products. To implement our strategy, we intend to: 

Maximize the commercial success of ILUVIEN for treatment of DME in the U.S., Europe, and the Middle East where we have obtained regulatory approval. We are seeking to increase our direct sales and sales to distributors in the U.S., Europe and the Middle East where we have obtained regulatory approval and are currently marketing ILUVIEN. We are also pursuing opportunities to sell ILUVIEN in the remaining countries where we have obtained regulatory approval but are not currently marketing ILUVIEN for this indication.

oComplete our NEW DAY Study. With the NEW DAY Study, we intend to demonstrate the efficacy of ILUVIEN as a baseline therapy in patients with early DME by comparing ILUVIEN to the current standard of care, anti-VEGF therapy. We believe that ILUVIEN continues to be underutilized in the treatment of DME and should be used much earlier in patients suffering from DME. Our prior clinical data sets demonstrate the ability of ILUVIEN to control the underlying disease process and reduce the recurrence of edema for up to three years, rather than treating recurrent chronic edema with short-term therapies.


Maximize the commercial success of ILUVIEN for the treatment of NIU-PS in Europe where we have obtained regulatory approval. We are seeking to increase our direct sales and sales to distributors in Europe and the Middle East where we have obtained regulatory approval and are currently marketing ILUVIEN. We are also pursuing opportunities to sell ILUVIEN in the remaining countries where we have obtained regulatory approval but are not currently marketing ILUVIEN for this indication.

Continue to pursue approval for ILUVIEN for DME and NIU-PS in additional countries. We will evaluate seeking regulatory approval for the treatment of DME in countries where we do not have approval and of NIU-PS in the remainder of Europe and in the Middle East and Africa where we own the rights to market ILUVIEN. In 2021, we entered into a license agreement with a distributor in China that plans to pursue regulatory approval and commercialization of ILUVIEN for DME in China and the Western Pacific.

Expand our ophthalmic product offerings. We believe there are further unmet medical needs in the treatment of retinal diseases. We intend to continue to evaluate in-licensing and acquisition opportunities for compounds and technologies with potential treatment applications for diseases affecting the eye.




ILUVIEN

Our only commercial product is ILUVIEN®, an intravitreal implant that treats patients by delivering a continuous microdose of the corticosteroid fluocinolone acetonide (FAc) in the eye, for up to 36 months. “Intravitreal” refers to the space inside the eye behind the lens that contains the jelly-like substance called vitreous. ILUVIEN was initially developed to treat DME, a disease of the retina that affects individuals with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes and can lead to severe vision loss and blindness. ILUVIEN is also used in certain countries in the European Economic Area (EEA) to prevent relapse in recurrent NIU-PS. Uveitis is an inflammatory disease of the uveal tract, which is comprised of the iris, ciliary body and choroid, that can lead to severe vision loss and blindness.

ILUVIEN is inserted into the back of the patient’s eye in a non-surgical procedure employing a device with a 25-gauge needle, which allows for a self-sealing wound. We believe that corticosteroids provide the best option in the treatment of DME and NIU-PS because they reduce the inflammatory aspects of the disease. Further, we believe that ILUVIEN’s CONTINUOUS MICRODOSING™ delivery makes it the only approved drug therapy for DME that can deliver consistent daily therapeutic levels of corticosteroid and reduce the recurrence of DME and uveitis. The delivery mechanism of ILUVIEN provides lower daily and aggregate exposure to corticosteroids than any other intraocular dosage forms currently available, which we believe mitigates the typical risks associated with corticosteroid therapy. Further, the ILUVIEN implant, which is non-bioerodible, provides consistent delivery as a result of its constant surface area, permitting elution of FAc to the vitreous. This provides a sustained therapeutic effect on DME and NIU-PS. Other therapies that physicians currently use to treat DME, such as anti-VEGF treatments and other corticosteroids, are acute (short-acting) therapies that provide a higher initial daily dose but then rapidly decline, requiring frequent reinjection by the physician to maintain an effective dose or reestablish the therapeutic effect after the disease has recurred.

The active compound in ILUVIEN is FAc, a non-proprietary corticosteroid. ILUVIEN delivers continuous daily sub-microgram levels of FAc in both in vitro and in vivo release kinetic studies for up to 36 months, making it the only single injection therapy available to treat the retina consistently every day for up to three years, allowing patients to see better, longer with fewer injections. 

Corticosteroids, including FAc, have demonstrated a range of pharmacological actions, including inhibition of inflammation, inhibition of leukostasis, up regulation of occludin, inhibition of the release of certain inflammatory cytokines and suppression of VEGF secretion. Leukostasis refers to the accumulation of white blood cells at a particular site, which leads to further tissue damage. Occludin is an important protein in maintaining and reinforcing the tight junctions between cells. These pharmacological actions have the potential to treat various ocular conditions, including DME, NIU-PS, Non-Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy (NPDR), retinal vein occlusion (RVO), dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and wet AMD. However, FAc shares many of the same “class effect” side effects seen with other corticosteroids that are currently available for intraocular use. The two main side effects of using corticosteroids to treat ocular conditions are increased intraocular pressure, which may increase the risk of glaucoma, and the acceleration of cataract formation. FAc is uniquely lipophilic, making it very effective at penetrating retina tissue, and allowing it to achieve a therapeutic effect at a very low dose, typically lower than other corticosteroids. In order to mitigate these side effects, ILUVIEN is designed to deliver significantly lower daily exposure than any other available corticosteroid dosage form while maintaining a therapeutic effect. Additionally, as demonstrated with real-world evidence, the side effects of ILUVIEN are consistent with and predictable following the use of shorter duration or acute corticosteroid therapies, increasing the physician’s ability to manage those side effects.

The amended loan agreement also provides for an additional tranche of up to $15.0 million, at the discretion of the lenders.

 

Disease Overview and Market Opportunity
Diabetes and Diabetic Retinopathy

Diabetes mellitus, with its systemic and ophthalmic complications, represents a global public health threat. The International Diabetes Federation (IDF) estimated prevalence of diabetes worldwide in 2021 increased to 537 million people and is expected to increase to 783 million people by 2045.

The 2020 National Diabetes Statistics Reports published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that as of 2019, 37.3 million Americans, or 11.3% of the U.S. population, had diabetes and that there were 1.4 million new cases of diabetes diagnosed among people ages 18 and older. Approximately 1 in 4 U.S. adults living with diabetes, 8.5 million Americans, did not know they had the condition and are therefore not being monitored and treated to control their disease and prevent systemic and ophthalmic complications. The report also identified that around 96.0 million people have prediabetes, a condition that if not treated often leads to type 2 diabetes within five years. In this population, only 19.0% of adults know they had prediabetes. In the International Diabetes Federation 10th Edition IDF Diabetes Atlas, it is estimated that there are approximately 61.0 million people in Europe in 2021 with diabetes and that 22.0 million remain undiagnosed. In the Middle East, it is estimated there are approximately 22.4 million people with diabetes and 17.5 million remain undiagnosed.

All patients with diabetes are at risk of developing some form of diabetic retinopathy, an ophthalmic complication of diabetes with symptoms including the swelling and leakage of blood vessels within the retina or the abnormal growth of new blood vessels on the surface of the retina. According to the CDC Vision Health Initiative, diabetic retinopathy causes approximately 12,000 to 24,000 new cases of blindness in the U.S. each year; making diabetes the leading cause of new cases of blindness in adults aged 20 to 70. Diabetic retinopathy can be divided into either non-proliferative or proliferative retinopathy. Non-proliferative retinopathy develops first and causes increased capillary permeability, micro aneurysms, hemorrhages, exudates (when fluid leaks into spaces between vessels), macular ischemia (lack of oxygen) and macular edema (thickening of the retina caused by fluid leakage from capillaries). Proliferative retinopathy is an advanced stage of diabetic retinopathy that, in addition to characteristics of non-proliferative retinopathy, results in the growth of new blood vessels. These new blood vessels are abnormal and fragile, growing along the retina and along the surface of the clear vitreous gel that fills the inside of the eye. By themselves, these blood vessels do not cause symptoms or vision loss. However, these blood vessels have thin, fragile walls that are prone to leakage and hemorrhage.

Diabetic Macular Edema (DME)

When the blood vessel leakage of diabetic retinopathy leads to the build-up of fluid, or edema, in a region of the retina called the macula, the condition is called diabetic macular edema. This area of the eye is important for the sharp, straight-ahead vision that is used for reading, recognizing faces, and driving. There are an estimated 750,000 people with DME in the U.S., according to the National Eye Institute’s 2019 update. DME is the most common cause of vision loss among people with diabetic retinopathy and about 30% of people with diabetic retinopathy will develop DME. It is more likely to occur as diabetic retinopathy worsens, although it may occur at any stage of the disease. The onset of DME is painless and may go undetected by the patient until it manifests with the blurring of central vision or acute vision loss. The severity of this blurring may range from mild to profound loss of vision.

Studies have shown that DME is a multifactorial disease underpinned by inflammatory cytokine activity in the eye. Of the currently approved pharmacotherapies used to treat DME, only corticosteroids, including FAc found in the ILUVIEN implant, affect multiple cytokines.

As the incidence of diabetes continues to increase worldwide, the incidence of DME and other complications is predicted to rise as well. Most patients who suffer from diabetes do not meet glycemic (glucose or blood sugar) targets, resulting in hyperglycemia (elevated levels of glucose in the blood). This, in turn, leads to the development of micro-vascular complications, which manifest in the eye as diabetic retinopathy, as well as elevated cytokines that break down the blood-retina barrier, leading to macular edema in many diabetic retinopathy patients.

Uveitis

Uveitis means inflammation of the uveal tract, which is a layer of tissue located between the outer layer (cornea and sclera) and the inner layer (retina) of the eye. The front portion (anterior) of the uveal tract contains the iris, and the back portion (posterior) of the uveal tract contains the choroid and the stroma of the ciliary body. Inflammation of the uvea encompasses approximately 30 inflammatory disorders characterized by intraocular inflammation, a major cause of visual loss in people of working age in both developed and developing countries. It can affect people of all ages, producing swelling and destroying eye tissues, which can lead to severe vision loss and blindness. According to the classification scheme recommended by the International Uveitis Study Group, the disease can be classified on the basis of anatomic locations: anterior, intermediate, posterior or pan uveitis. Uveitis can be caused by a number of factors such as infection (infectious uveitis) or other autoimmune diseases or conditions. Non-infectious uveitis (NIU) is a persistent and recurrent disease that can adversely affect the retina. Additionally, it commonly affects vision, more so than anterior uveitis, and macular edema is the most common mechanism of visual loss, affecting 44% patients with posterior uveitis.



There are two forms of uveitis:

infectious uveitis (bacterial, viral, fungal, or parasitic), which is treated with an appropriate antimicrobial drug as well as corticosteroids and cycloplegics; and

NIU, where corticosteroids are used to reduce inflammation and prevent adhesions in the eye.

Current Treatments for DME

Anti-VEGF therapies are the current standard of care for the treatment of DME. Lucentis® (ranibizumab), Eylea® (aflibercept), Beovu® (brolucizumab-dbll), and Vabysmo® (faricimab) are approved in the U.S. Cimerli is a ranibizumab biosimilar that is approved in the U.S as well. Off-label injections of the anti-VEGF therapy Avastin (bevacizumab) are also used to treat DME. However, anti-VEGF therapies are acute therapies and require multiple and frequent injections to achieve the same therapeutic effect reported in randomized controlled trials. Further, DME is a multi-factorial disease, and anti-VEGF therapy does not address all of these factors. As a result, many patients do not achieve a sufficient response, either because of the limited therapeutic effect or the inability or unwillingness of patients to routinely attend clinic appointments, meaning that anti-VEGF therapy is not optimally administered. When not optimally administered, these acute therapies allow for a recurrence of the edema. In addition, these therapies have safety profiles that include an increased risk of endophthalmitis, a serious eye infection that must be treated with high doses of antibiotics and is associated with any intravitreal injection. There is also evidence that intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy affects systemic VEGF levels, which may have cardiovascular complications and have shown both acute and chronic increases in intraocular pressure (IOP) following injection.

Intravitreal corticosteroid therapies are also used to treat DME. Acute corticosteroids typically have peak effects within two to three months, and there is a need for repeated injections. Similarly, without optimized treatment frequency, macular edema is allowed to recur when the effect of acute corticosteroids dissipates. Ozurdex (dexamethasone), a short-acting corticosteroid, is marketed for the treatment of vision loss associated with DME in Europe and for the treatment of DME in the U.S. Triamcinolone acetonide, another short-acting steroid, is commonly used off-label to treat DME. In contrast to the dexamethasone implant and triamcinolone acetonide, which are both acute therapies, ILUVIEN is a long-term persistent and continuous steroid delivery therapy. The steroid in the ILUVIEN implant, FAc, is a key lipophilic component that allows a single implant to deliver a sustained daily dose for up to 36 months. Corticosteroids have historically been associated with significant increases in intraocular pressure, which may increase the risk of glaucoma. Additionally, corticosteroids are associated with the acceleration of cataract formation. We believe the low dose of ILUVIEN mitigates these side effects and makes them more manageable. Additionally, the side effects of ILUVIEN are consistent with and predictable following the use of shorter duration or acute corticosteroid therapies, increasing the physician’s ability to manage those side effects.

DME is also currently treated by Laser photocoagulation, a retinal procedure in which a laser is used to apply a burn, or a pattern of burns, to cauterize leaky blood vessels to reduce edema. Laser photocoagulation may be used in conjunction with drug therapies as well. Visual acuity gains are less frequently realized with this therapy, as it is used to prevent or slow the loss of vision. Further, this destructive procedure has undesirable side effects including partial loss of peripheral and night vision.

Our NEW DAY Study

We believe that ILUVIEN continues to be underutilized in the treatment of DME and should be used much earlier in patients suffering from DME. Our prior clinical data sets demonstrate the ability of ILUVIEN to control the underlying disease process and reduce the recurrence of edema for up to three years, rather than treating recurrent chronic edema with short-term therapies. With the NEW DAY Study, we intend to demonstrate the efficacy of ILUVIEN as baseline therapy in patients with early DME by comparing ILUVIEN to the current standard of care, anti-VEGF therapy. 

In July 2020, we announced the initiation of our NEW DAY clinical trial, a multicenter, single masked, randomized and controlled trial designed to generate prospective data evaluating ILUVIEN as a baseline therapy in the treatment of DME and demonstrate its advantages over using the current standard of care of repeat anti-VEGF injections. The NEW DAY Study is planned to enroll approximately 300 treatment-naïve, or almost naïve, DME patients in approximately 40 sites around the U.S. As of February 28, 2023, we have enrolled 261 DME patients. We expect to complete enrollment in the NEW DAY Study in the first half of 2023.

Patients who meet the entry criteria will be randomized to receive either an ILUVIEN intravitreal implant or five injections of intravitreal aflibercept 2 mg at four-week intervals for the first 16 weeks as a loading dose. After the initial 16-week period, both treatment arms will be evaluated every four weeks and receive supplemental intravitreal injections of aflibercept 2 mg only as needed. Criteria for supplemental treatment is set by protocol and will be identical in both treatment arms. The planned treatment period in the study is 18 months. Once the treatment period is concluded, patients will be given the option to participate in an open label extension study for up to 42 months.

The primary outcome measure for the NEW DAY Study is the mean number of supplemental aflibercept injections needed during the trial between treatment groups. Key secondary endpoints include mean best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) score over time up to 18 months, time to first supplemental treatment, retinal thickness amplitude on optical coherence tomography (OCT), and diabetic retinopathy scores. In addition, the trial will collect patient-reported outcome measures to 

 
evaluate the effect on patients’ quality of life and level of functioning. Exploratory endpoints will include neuronal functional measures and OCT imaging measures of retinal nerve layer thickness.

Current Treatments for NIU-PS

Historically, the treatment of uveitis varies according to the type and location of uveitis. The inflammation in NIU can be anterior (at the front of the eye) or posterior (at the back of the eye) or in both locations. Importantly though, all forms of NIU can affect the posterior segment of the eye. In anterior forms of NIU, drops are used to address inflammation; however, in patients where the posterior segment is affected, these drops do not penetrate the eye to address the posterior segment. Other agents, both intravitreal and systemic, are specifically licensed for the treatment of active non-infectious posterior uveitis. This means that treatment of NIU-PS focuses on (a) systemic therapy, administered in a tablet form or via injection, which very often leads to side effects that adversely affect the whole body, or (b) the localized delivery of therapies, usually a steroid.

Patients with NIU-PS are initially treated with systemic steroids, which are very effective, but when used at high doses for extended periods can lead to serious side effects. These side effects include acne, weight gain, sleep and mood disorders, hypertension and osteoporosis, which can limit the sustained use of systemic steroids. Patients then often progress to steroid-sparing therapies with systemic immune suppressants or biologics, which themselves can have severe side effects, including an increased risk of cancer and infections. In addition, periocular or intraocular steroids may be used to try to locally control inflammation in NIU-PS. Other therapies that may be used to treat NIU-PS include immunosuppressive drugs and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonists.

A significant problem for patients and clinicians is that recurrence of NIU-PS is very common. In chronic NIU-PS, recurrence often occurs within six months of withholding treatment, and patients and clinicians are forced to go through cycles of treatment initiation and cessation with the accompanying complexity of managing several drug classes, and their side effects, at once. For the patient, this approach to treatment provides temporary relief, but with uncertainty of when the next relapse of their disease will occur. Recurrence is known to put the patient’s vision at risk, so there is a need for treatments that can provide longer term control of inflammation in this setting.

For patients with recurrent NIU-PS, locally delivered (intravitreal) steroids present an attractive treatment strategy allowing for effective delivery of steroid therapy at the point of need, while minimizing the risk of systemic side effects. For intravitreal treatment, the short-acting Ozurdex implant is marketed in Europe for the treatment of adult patients with active inflammation of the posterior segment of the eye presenting as NIU and for the treatment of NIU.

In contrast clinical trials have demonstrated that ILUVIEN significantly extends the time to relapse in patients with recurrent NIU-PS, while at the same time reducing the need for adjunctive treatments, including systemic drug treatment.

Where We Sell Direct

We commercially market ILUVIEN directly in the U.S., Germany, the U.K., Portugal and Ireland.

Where We Sell Through Distributors

We have entered into various agreements under which distributors are providing or will provide regulatory, reimbursement or sales and marketing support for ILUVIEN in Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Australia, New Zealand, China and several countries in the Western Pacific and several countries in the Middle East. As of December 31, 2022, we have recognized net product revenue from our international distributors in the Middle East, China, Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, France, Italy, Luxembourg, Spain and the Netherlands.

ILUVIEN for Other Diseases of the Eye

Although we are not actively conducting clinical trials for a new indication, we believe that ILUVIEN has the potential to address other ophthalmic diseases such as RVO, NPDR, dry AMD and wet AMD.

Sales and Marketing

Our sales personnel focus on physician offices, clinics, pharmacies and hospitals in the U.S. and in European countries where we seek to persuade end users to purchase ILUVIEN. In our promotional efforts, we focus on three main areas to generate demand for ILUVIEN. The first is to gain access for ILUVIEN on formularies, contracts and through national and local health care authorities to achieve a reasonable price in the countries in which we intend to commercialize. Second is to educate physicians on the efficacy and safety of ILUVIEN through direct promotion, advocacy building and indirect marketing activities. Third is to enable patients and caregivers in markets where it is permitted to become more educated on their disease and the possible treatments. 

The COVID-19 pandemic negatively affected our sales and marketing efforts in a number of ways, which in turn had an adverse impact on our revenues that has continued to a lesser degree through the date of this report. For example, governments and private parties imposed limitations on in-person access to physicians during certain periods of the pandemic. During the periods in which those limitations were in effect, they made it difficult or impossible for our sales representatives (including those employed by our distributors) to meet with retina specialists and their staff to educate them about the benefits of ILUVIEN and to provide support for insurance pre-certifications. We are continuing to monitor the effects of the pandemic and have increased our engagement with customers to mitigate any loss of revenue in affected markets. 

Distributor Agreements

We have various agreements under which distributors are providing or will provide regulatory, reimbursement or sales and marketing support for commercialization of ILUVIEN in Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Australia and New Zealand, China and other countries of the Western Pacific and in the Middle East. Pursuant to these agreements, our distributors assisted or will assist us in obtaining and maintaining approval and reimbursement approval, or they will seek approval or reimbursement approval with our oversight in those countries, if such approval or reimbursement approval has not already been obtained. For more information about our April 2021 license agreement with Ocumension Therapeutics (Ocumension) for China and the Western Pacific, see “Licenses and Agreements” below. 

Manufacturing

We do not have an in-house manufacturing capability for our products and depend and expect to continue to depend exclusively on third-party contract manufacturers to produce and package ILUVIEN. We manage the quality of our product produced by these manufacturers through quality agreements and our quality system to ensure that they produce active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and finished drug products in accordance with the FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) and all other applicable laws and regulations. We maintain agreements with potential and existing manufacturers that include confidentiality and intellectual property provisions to protect our proprietary rights related to ILUVIEN.

The manufacturing process for ILUVIEN consists of filling a polyimide tube with a paste consisting of 190 micrograms of FAc in an aqueous slurry of polyvinyl alcohol, cutting the tube into smaller sections in the proper lengths for the ILUVIEN implant, capping each small section with a permeable membrane cap on one end and an impermeable silicone cap on the other end to create the ILUVIEN implant, curing the implant at high temperature, loading the implant inside the ILUVIEN applicator, and packaging and sterilizing the product. This process has been validated at Alliance Medical Products Inc., a Siegfried Company (Alliance). 

We have agreements with a single third-party manufacturer for each of the following: 

the manufacture of FAc, ILUVIEN’s active pharmaceutical ingredient (FARMABIOS SpA/Byron Chemical Company Inc.);
the manufacture of the components of the ILUVIEN applicator (Cadence, Inc. (Cadence));
the manufacture of the ILUVIEN implant, final assembly of the injector with the implant and release testing in the U.S. (Alliance);
the quality release testing of ILUVIEN (Alliance);
final product release to market in the EEA (carried out in Ireland by Packaging Coordinators, Inc.); and
final product release to market in the U.K. (carried out in Ireland by Packaging Coordinators, Inc.).

Although we may seek alternative providers in the future, we do not currently have alternate providers for any of these tasks. 

Under our agreement with Alliance, we are responsible for supplying Alliance with the ILUVIEN applicator and the API. We purchased certain equipment at Alliance’s facility that Alliance uses solely to manufacture and package ILUVIEN for us. We have agreed to order from Alliance at least 80% of our total requirements for new units of ILUVIEN in the covered territories in a calendar year, provided that Alliance is able to fulfill our supply requirements and is not in breach of its agreements or obligations to us. Although we have approval to sell ILUVIEN in Canada, we do not currently have plans to pursue commercialization there. As of the date of this report, we order 100% of our global requirements for ILUVIEN units from Alliance because we do not have an alternate supplier. The amended and restated agreement had an original term through February 2023 and automatically renews for successive terms of one year unless either party delivers written notice of non-renewal to the other at least 12 months before the end of the then current term. As of the date of this report, we have not received or delivered a notice of non-renewal.

On October 30, 2020, we entered into a Manufacturing Services Agreement with Cadence, to manufacture the components used in the ILUVIEN applicator. Cadence has been manufacturing production components since the second quarter of 2021 following receipt of European and FDA approval of the change. 

Business Segments

During the first quarter of 2021, our Chief Executive Officer (CEO), who is the chief operating decision maker (CODM), changed the manner in which the CODM monitors performance, aligns strategies and allocates resources, which resulted in a change in the operating segments. Our operations are now managed as three operating segments: U.S., International and Operating Cost. We determined that each of these operating segments represented a reportable segment. Previously, we were managed as two operating segments: U.S. and International. Financial information about our business segments is included below in Part II, ITEM 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Results of Operations - Segment Review” and Note 19 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
Customers

Our revenues for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were generated from product sales primarily in the U.S., Germany, France and the U.K. and for 2021, the upfront license payment under the Ocumension License Agreement, which resulted in license revenue of approximately $11.0 million. In the U.S., two large pharmaceutical distributors accounted for 63% and 55% of our consolidated product revenues for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. These distributors maintain inventories of ILUVIEN and sell to physician offices, pharmacies and hospitals. Internationally, in countries where we sell direct, our customers are hospitals, clinics and pharmacies. We sometimes refer to physician offices, pharmacies, hospitals and clinics as end users. In international countries where we sell to distributors, these distributors maintain inventory levels of ILUVIEN and sell to their customers.

Competition

The development and commercialization of new drugs and drug delivery technologies is highly competitive. We face competition with respect to ILUVIEN and any products or product candidates we may develop or commercialize in the future from major pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies worldwide, many of whom have substantially greater financial and other resources than we do.

In the countries in which ILUVIEN has received or been recommended for marketing authorization or becomes approved for use in the treatment of DME, it competes or will compete against the use of anti-VEGF therapies, short duration corticosteroids and laser photocoagulation or other therapies that may be approved in the future. Other companies are working to develop other drug therapies and sustained delivery platforms for DME and other indications. These competitive therapies may result in pricing pressure even if ILUVIEN is otherwise viewed as a preferable therapy. We believe that the following drugs and treatments compete with ILUVIEN:

Lucentis© (ranibizumab injection), marketed by Genentech (Roche) in the U.S. and Novartis in the rest of the world, and Avastin (bevacizumab), an oncology product marketed by the Roche group, are both antibodies that inhibit VEGF signaling pathways. Lucentis is currently approved for the treatment of DME, the treatment of diabetic retinopathy in patients with DME, the treatment of neovascular wet AMD and the treatment of macular edema following RVO in the U.S. In the EEA, the indications are similar except for diabetic retinopathy where the indication is for the treatment of proliferative diabetic retinopathy.

Avastin© (bevacizumab), is used by retinal specialists in both the U.S. and in certain countries of the EEA in the treatment of numerous retinal diseases off label but is not formulated or approved for any ophthalmic use.

Eylea© (aflibercept), marketed by Regeneron in the U.S. and by Bayer in the EEA, is a VEGF antagonist that is approved for the treatment of DME, diabetic retinopathy in patients with DME, neovascular wet AMD and RVO in the U.S. In the EEA, the indication does not include diabetic retinopathy.

Beovu® (brolucizumab-dbll), marketed by Novartis, is a VEGF inhibitor indicated for the treatment of neovascular wet AMD. Beovu has been approved for the treatment of wet AMD in the U.S. and in all 27 European Union member states as well as the U.K., Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein. Novartis has completed trials for the treatment of DME and indicated publicly that they are seeking FDA approval for that indication. 

Vabysmo® (faricimab), marketed by Genentech, is a VEGF inhibitor and Ang-2 inhibitor indicated for the treatment of patients with neovascular wet AMD and DME. Vabysmo was approved in January 2022 for the treatment of DME in the U.S. The European Medicines Agency has also validated the faricimab Marketing Authorization Application submission in wet AMD and DME.

Ozurdex© (dexamethasone intravitreal implant), marketed by Allergan (now owned by AbbVie), is a short duration biodegradable implant that delivers the corticosteroid dexamethasone. Ozurdex is approved for the treatment of DME, macular edema following branch or central RVO and NIU in the U.S. In the EEA, the indication for DME is for visual impairment due to DME in persons who are pseudophakic (persons who have had an artificial lens implanted after the natural eye lens has been removed) or who are considered insufficiently responsive to, or unsuitable for, non-corticosteroid therapy. It is also indicated for macular edema following either Branch Retinal Vein Occlusion (BRVO) or Central Retinal Vein Occlusion (CRVO) and inflammation of the posterior segment of the eye presenting as non-infectious uveitis.

Humira© (adalimumab), marketed by Abbvie, is a TNF-blocker that has an ophthalmic indication. It works by targeting and blocking a specific source of inflammation that plays a role in NIU. In the U.S., Humira is indicated for the treatment of non-infectious intermediate, posterior and pan uveitis. In the EEA, Humira is indicated for the treatment of chronic non-infectious anterior uveitis in children aged two years or older who have had an inadequate response to or are intolerant to conventional therapy.

Intravitreal triamcinolone is used by some physicians for the treatment of DME although it is not approved for DME.

Laser photocoagulation is currently used to treat DME and may be used in conjunction with drug therapies as well. Other laser or surgical treatments for DME may also compete against ILUVIEN.

In addition, a number of other companies are developing drug therapies or delivery platforms for the treatment of retinal diseases.

We believe we will be less likely to face a generic competitor for ILUVIEN for the treatment of DME because of the bioequivalency requirements of a generic form of ILUVIEN. A generic pharmaceutical competitor to ILUVIEN would need to establish bioequivalency through the demonstration of an equivalent pharmacodynamic endpoint in a clinical trial. We believe 

 
conducting such a clinical trial would be cost-prohibitive and time-consuming, although we cannot provide any assurances in that regard.

The licensing and acquisition of pharmaceutical products, which is part of our strategy, is a highly competitive area. A number of more established companies are also pursuing strategies to license or acquire products. These established companies may have a competitive advantage over us due to, among other factors, their size, cash flow and institutional experience.

The active pharmaceutical ingredient in ILUVIEN is FAc, which is not patent protected. As a result, our competitors could develop an alternative formulation or delivery mechanisms to treat diseases of the eye with FAc. For a description of our license of proprietary insert technology for ILUVIEN, see the section immediately below.
The COVID-19 Pandemic and Our Steps to Address its Effects on Our Business
The unprecedented events of the COVID-19 pandemic, and its unpredictable duration, in the regions where we have customers, employees and distributors had an adverse impact on our revenues beginning late in the first quarter of 2020. These adverse effects have continued to the date of this report to a lesser degree in certain of our key markets in Europe that have now begun to recover. These factors may continue to adversely impact our revenue and capital resources, although the extent and duration of that impact is currently uncertain.
In response to these developments, we implemented certain measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic on our financial position and operations. We are continuing to monitor the effects of the SARS-CoV-2 variants and to increase our engagement with our customers to mitigate any anticipated loss of revenue in those markets that may be affected.
Licenses and Agreements

EyePoint Pharmaceuticals US, Inc.

In 2005, we entered into an agreement with EyePoint Pharmaceuticals US, Inc. (EyePoint), for the use of FAc in EyePoint’s proprietary insert technology which was amended and restated in July 2017 (the New Collaboration Agreement). The New Collaboration Agreement provides us with a license to utilize certain underlying technology used in the development and commercialization of ILUVIEN. Pursuant to the New Collaboration Agreement, we hold a worldwide license from EyePoint for the use of steroids, including FAc, in EyePoint’s proprietary insert technology for the treatment of all ocular diseases, other than uveitis outside of Europe, the Middle East and Africa.

The New Collaboration Agreement provides us with a license to develop and sell EyePoint’s proprietary insert technology to deliver other corticosteroids to the back of the eye for the treatment and prevention of eye diseases in humans or to treat DME by delivering a compound to the back of the eye through a direct delivery method through an incision required for a 25-gauge or larger needle. We do not have the right to develop and sell EyePoint’s proprietary insert technology for indications for diseases outside of the eye anywhere in the world, or for the treatment of uveitis outside of Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Further, the New Collaboration Agreement permits EyePoint to grant to any other party the right to use its intellectual property (a) to treat DME through an incision smaller than that required for a 25-gauge needle, unless using a corticosteroid delivered to the back of the eye, (b) to deliver any compound outside the back of the eye unless it is to treat DME through an incision required for a 25-gauge or larger needle, or (c) to deliver non-corticosteroids to the back of the eye, unless it is to treat DME through an incision required for a 25-gauge or larger needle.

In accordance with the New Collaboration Agreement we pay a 6% royalty on net revenues and other related consideration to EyePoint and we will pay an additional 2% royalty on global net revenues and other related consideration in excess of $75.0 million in any year. Following the signing of the New Collaboration Agreement, we retained a right to offset $15.0 million of future royalty payments (the Future Offset). As of December 31, 2022, the balance of the Future Offset was approximately $7.0 million, which is fully reserved on our balance sheet. We will be able to recover the balance of the Future Offset as a reduction of future royalties that would otherwise be owed to EyePoint by reducing the royalty from 6% to 5.2% for net revenues and other related consideration up to $75.0 million annually and from 8% to 6.8% for net revenues and other related consideration in excess of $75.0 million annually. During 2022 and 2021, we recognized approximately $2.8 million and $2.9 million of royalty expense, respectively. 

On December 17, 2020, EyePoint entered into a royalty purchase agreement (the SWK Agreement) with SWK Funding, LLC (SWK) pursuant to which EyePoint sold its interest in royalties that we are obligated to pay EyePoint under the New Collaboration Agreement to SWK. We are not a party to the SWK Agreement.

Our license rights to EyePoint’s proprietary insert technology could revert to EyePoint in certain instances, including failure to cure contractual breaches and filing for bankruptcy protection. We are not in breach of the New Collaboration Agreement as of the date of this report.



Ocumension License Agreement

On April 14, 2021, we entered into an exclusive license agreement (the License Agreement) with Ocumension (Hong Kong) Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Ocumension Therapeutics (Ocumension), for the development and commercialization under Ocumension’s own distinct trademark, of our 190 microgram FAc intravitreal implant (the Product, which is currently marketed elsewhere as ILUVIEN®) for the treatment and prevention of eye diseases in humans, other than uveitis, in China and other Western Pacific countries. 

We received a nonrefundable upfront payment of $10.0 million from Ocumension and may in the future receive additional sales-based milestone payments totaling up to $89.0 million upon the achievement by Ocumension of certain specified sales milestones during the term of the License Agreement. Our receipt of future milestone payments depends upon whether Ocumension is able to successfully complete product development and commercialization in the covered territory, which requires, among other things, obtaining necessary regulatory approvals and appropriate reimbursement pricing, which may take several years. 

The term of the license will continue until the later of (a) the 10th anniversary of the first commercial sale of the Product in Ocumension’s licensed territory or (b) as long as Ocumension is commercializing the Product in its licensed territory. The term is subject to our right to partially terminate the License Agreement beginning on the 10th anniversary of the License Agreement with respect to any country or jurisdiction in which Ocumension has not achieved a commercial sale at such time and is not continuing to commercialize the Product. Ocumension will purchase Product from us at a fixed transfer price without royalty obligations on future sale (other than milestone payments as described above). Ocumension is responsible for all costs of development and commercialization in the licensed territory. 

When we entered into the License Agreement, we also entered into a share purchase agreement, a voting and investor rights agreement (voting agreement) and a warrant subscription agreement. Under the terms of the voting agreement, Ocumension is required to vote its shares of common stock in favor of any proposals recommended by our Board of Directors at any meeting of the Company’s stockholders, subject to certain exceptions. The share purchase agreement and warrant subscription agreement are discussed in Note 11 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

Government Regulation

General Overview

Government authorities in the U.S. and other countries extensively regulate, among other things the research, development, testing, quality, efficacy, safety (pre- and post-marketing), manufacturing, labeling, storage, record-keeping, advertising, promotion, export, import, marketing and distribution of pharmaceutical products. In addition, although third parties manufacture ILUVIEN for us, these manufacturing operations and our research and development activities must follow applicable environmental laws and regulations. The cost to comply with these environmental laws and regulations is not currently significant, but in the future complying with these environmental laws and regulations could increase our costs for manufacturing, research and development.
U.S. FDA Approval

In the U.S., the FDA, under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) and other federal and local statutes and regulations, subjects pharmaceutical products to review. If we do not comply with applicable regulations, the government may refuse to approve or place our clinical studies on clinical hold, refuse to approve our marketing applications, refuse to allow us to manufacture or market our products, seize our products, impose injunctions and monetary fines on us, and prosecute us for criminal offenses.

To obtain approval of a new product from the FDA, we must, among other requirements, submit data supporting the safety and efficacy as well as detailed information on the manufacture and composition of the product and proposed labeling.

The testing and collection of data and the preparation of the necessary applications are expensive and time-consuming. The FDA may not act quickly or favorably in reviewing these applications, and we may encounter significant difficulties or costs in our efforts to obtain FDA approval that could delay or preclude us from marketing additional products. Once approved by the FDA, a drug requires an annual product and establishment fee, which was approximately $394,000 as of our last renewal in October 2022.

Post-Marketing Requirements

We are required to meet post-marketing safety surveillance requirements to continue marketing an approved product. We must report any adverse events with the product to the FDA, and the FDA could impose market restrictions through labeling changes or in product removal. The FDA may withdraw product approvals if we fail to maintain compliance with regulatory requirements or if problems concerning safety and/or efficacy of the product occur following approval. The FDA may, at its discretion, also require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the effects of approved products or place conditions 

 
on any approvals that could restrict the commercial applications of these products. The FDA did not require any post-marketing testing as part of its approval of ILUVIEN.

As part of the approval process in Europe, we completed a five-year, post-authorization, open label registry study in 562 patients treated with ILUVIEN. The results of the study confirmed existing safety information on ILUVIEN, and no new risks were identified.

Also, as part of the approval process in Europe, we are committed to conduct an open label trial in the pediatric population with NIU-PS. We have initiated this trial, and enrollment is expected to start in 2023.

U.S. FDA Regulations

With respect to product advertising and promotion of marketed products, the FDA imposes a number of complex regulations that include standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotions, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and Internet promotional activities. The FDA has very broad enforcement authority under the FD&C Act, and failure to abide by these regulations can result in (a) penalties, (b) the issuance of warning letters directing the sponsor to correct deviations from FDA standards, (c) a requirement that future advertising and promotional materials must be pre-cleared by the FDA, and (d) federal civil and criminal investigations and prosecutions (as well as state prosecutions).

The manufacturing facility that produces our product, as well as our corporate headquarters facility, must maintain compliance with the FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) and are subject to periodic inspections by the FDA. Failure to comply with statutory and regulatory requirements subjects a manufacturer to possible legal and regulatory action, including Warning Letters, seizure or recall of products, injunctions, consent decrees placing significant restrictions on or suspending manufacturing operations and civil and criminal penalties.

Foreign Regulations

Foreign regulatory systems, although varying from country to country, include risks similar to those associated with FDA regulations in the U.S.

Under the EU regulatory system, applications for drug approval may be submitted either in a centralized or decentralized procedure. Under the centralized procedure, a single application to the European Medicines Evaluation Agency, if approved, would permit marketing of the product throughout the EU (currently 27 member states) and to non-EU countries that are within the EEA. The decentralized procedure provides for applications to be submitted for marketing authorization in a select number of EEA countries. The process is managed by a Reference Member State that coordinates the review process with the other countries in the EEA in which the applicant has applied for marketing authorization.

A mutual recognition procedure of nationally approved decisions is available to pursue marketing authorizations for a product in the remaining EU countries. Under the mutual recognition procedure, the holders of national marketing authorization in one of the countries within the EU may submit further applications to other countries within the EU, who will be requested to recognize the original authorization.

We chose to pursue the decentralized procedure for ILUVIEN for DME and used the mutual recognition procedure due to our limited resources. Through this procedure, we obtained marketing authorizations in the 17 countries in the EEA discussed above. For ILUVIEN for NIU-PS, we filed a type II variation in these 17 countries in the EEA using the same procedure. In each instance, we received the Final Variation Assessment Report for ILUVIEN from the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency of the United Kingdom (the MHRA) based on our submission to the MHRA through the mutual recognition procedure. In light of Brexit, we have moved marketing authorizations for certain European approvals from our U.K. subsidiary to our Irish subsidiary. In addition, Ireland is now our Reference Member State, which is the European Union Member State that leads the review of an application in the decentralized process for ILUVIEN. The Irish Health Products Regulatory Authority is our key regulatory body with which to discuss any regulatory submissions pertinent to ILUVIEN in the EEA. 

Third-Party Reimbursement and Pricing Controls

In the U.S., the EEA and elsewhere, sales of pharmaceutical products depend in significant part on the availability of reimbursement to the consumer from third-party payers, such as government and private insurance plans. Third-party payers are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services.

The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010 (together, the ACA), significantly changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers. The provisions of the ACA became effective beginning in 2010, although some of its key provisions were altered through the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in December 2017. Through the date of this report, President Biden has enacted certain changes to Medicare reimbursement policies, and we cannot predict further changes that the Biden Administration may make to current federal reimbursement policies and whether those changes will affect us. We expect that additional federal and/or state healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts 

 
that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, and in turn could significantly reduce our profitability.

In many foreign markets, including the countries in the EEA, pricing of pharmaceutical products is subject to governmental control. While we cannot predict whether such legislative or regulatory proposals will be adopted, the adoption of those proposals could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and profitability.

Patents and Proprietary Rights

Our success depends in part on our and our licensor’s ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for ILUVIEN or any future products or product candidates, technology and know-how, to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. Because we license certain intellectual property relating to ILUVIEN from third parties, we depend on their ability to obtain and maintain such protection. Where we have conducted our own research, our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing U.S. and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development of our business. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position.

As of December 31, 2022, we owned or licensed two U.S. utility patents and one U.S. design patent as well as numerous foreign counterparts to many of these patents and patent applications relating to ILUVIEN or the ILUVIEN applicator. We licensed our one utility patent right relating to ILUVIEN from EyePoint. Pursuant to the New Collaboration Agreement with EyePoint, our ILUVIEN-related patent rights are only for diseases of the human eye in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, and for diseases of the human eye excluding uveitis in the rest of the world. In addition to the U.S. patents licensed from EyePoint, we also license two European patents from EyePoint. We have a U.S. utility patent directed to our applicator system for ILUVIEN. Our licensed patent portfolio includes U.S. patents (with no currently pending or issued corresponding European applications or patents) with claims directed to methods for administering a corticosteroid with an implantable sustained delivery device to deliver the corticosteroid to the vitreous of the eye wherein aqueous corticosteroid concentration is less than vitreous corticosteroid concentration during release.

U.S. utility patents generally have a term of 20 years from the date of filing. The utility patent rights relating to ILUVIEN that EyePoint licensed to us include one U.S. patent that will expire August 2027, two European patents that are directed to our low-dose device that expired in April 2021 and will expire in October 2024, respectively, and counterpart filings to these patents in a number of other jurisdictions. No patent term extension or supplementary protection certificate will be available for any of these U.S. or European patents or applications. 

The patent positions of companies like ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. Our ability to maintain and solidify our proprietary position for our technology will depend on our and our licensor’s success in obtaining effective claims and enforcing those claims once granted. We do not know whether any of our patent applications or those patent applications that we license will result in the issuance of any patents. Our issued patents and those that may issue in the future, or those licensed to us, may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing related products or the length of term of patent protection that we may have for our products. In addition, the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with proprietary protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar technology. Furthermore, our competitors may independently develop similar technologies or duplicate any technology we develop. Because of the extensive time required for development, testing and regulatory review of a potential product, it is possible that, before such product can be commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing any advantage of the patent.

We may rely, in some circumstances, on trade secrets to protect our technology. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors and other contractors. These agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our employees, consultants or contractors use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.
