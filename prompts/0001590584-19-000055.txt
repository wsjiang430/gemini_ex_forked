Our Company

We are a hospitality company servicing the natural resources industry in Canada, Australia and the U.S. We provide a full suite of hospitality services for our guests, including lodging, food service, housekeeping and maintenance at accommodation facilities that we or our customers own. In many cases, we provide services that support the day-to-day operations of accommodation facilities, such as laundry, facility management and maintenance, water and wastewater treatment, power generation, communication systems, security and group logistics. We also offer development activities for workforce accommodation facilities, including site selection, permitting, engineering and design, manufacturing management and site construction, along with providing hospitality services once the facility is constructed. We operate in some of the world’s most active oil, coal and iron ore producing regions, and our customers include major and independent oil companies, mining companies and oilfield and mining service companies. Our extensive suite of services enables us to meet the unique needs of each of our customers, while providing comfortable accommodations for their employees.
Our Company is built on the foundation of the following core values: Safety, Care, Excellence, Integrity and Collaboration. We put the safety of our employees and guests above all other concerns.  We care about our people, guests, customers, communities and the environment, and we deliver excellent service with passion and pride.  We act with integrity and collaborate with our people, communities, customers and partners.
 We provide hospitality services that span the lifecycle of customer projects, from the initial exploration and resource delineation to long-term production. Initially, as customers assess the resource potential and determine how they will develop it, they typically need our hospitality services for a limited number of employees for an uncertain duration of time. Our fleet of mobile accommodation assets is well-suited to support this initial exploratory stage as customers evaluate their development and construction plans. As development of the resource begins, we are able to serve their needs through either our fleet of mobile accommodation assets, particularly for shorter term projects such as pipeline construction and seasonal drilling programs, or our scalable lodge or village model, as well as serve guests in customer-owned facilities. As projects grow and headcount needs increase, we are able to meet our customers growing needs at our accommodations facilities or with our 
2

hospitality services. By providing infrastructure support and hospitality services early in the project lifecycle, we are well positioned to continue to service our customers throughout the production phase, which typically lasts decades.

Our scalable facilities provide workforce accommodations where, in many cases, traditional accommodations and related infrastructure are not accessible, sufficient or cost effective. Our hospitality services help facilitate efficient development and production of natural resources found in areas without sufficient housing, infrastructure or local labor. We support the development of these natural resources by providing hospitality services, including lodging, food service, housekeeping, recreation facilities, laundry and facilities management, as well as water and wastewater treatment, power generation, communications and group logistics. Our customers are able to outsource their accommodations needs to a single supplier, maintaining employee welfare and satisfaction while focusing their investment on their core resource production efforts. Our primary focus is on providing these hospitality services to leading natural resource companies at our major properties, which we refer to as lodges in Canada and villages in Australia, or at facilities owned by our customers. We own and operate 33 lodges and villages with an aggregate of more than 33,000 rooms. Additionally, in both Canada and the U.S., we also offer a fleet of mobile accommodation assets. We have long-standing relationships with many of our customers, many of whom are, or are affiliates of, large, investment-grade energy and mining companies. 
On April 2, 2018, we completed our acquisition of Noralta Lodge Ltd. (Noralta). Please see Note 7 - Acquisitions to the notes to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this annual report for further discussion.

Demand for our hospitality services is influenced by four primary factors: commodity prices, available infrastructure, headcount requirements and competition. Current commodity prices, and our customers’ expectations for future commodity prices, influence customers’ spending on current productive assets, maintenance on and expansion of existing assets and development of greenfield, brownfield or new assets. In addition to commodity prices, different types of customer activity require varying workforce sizes, influencing the demand for our services. Competing locations and services will also influence demand for our rooms and services. 
In the Canadian oil sands region, demand for our hospitality services is influenced by oil prices. Spending on the construction and development of new projects has historically decreased as the outlook for oil prices decreases. However, spending on current operations and maintenance has historically reacted less quickly to changes in oil prices, as customers consider their cash operating costs, rather than overall full-cycle returns. Likewise, construction and expansion projects underway have also been less sensitive to commodity price decreases, as customers generally focus on completion and incremental costs. Natural gas prices also influence oil sands activity as an input cost, so as natural gas prices fall, a significant component of our customers’ operating costs falls as well. 
Another factor that influences demand for our hospitality services is the type of customer project we are supporting. Generally, Canadian customers require larger workforces during construction and expansionary periods, and therefore have higher demand for our rooms and services. Operational and maintenance headcounts are typically a fraction, 20-25%, of the headcounts experienced during construction. 
In addition, proximity to customer activity and availability of customer-owned rooms influences the rental demand of our rooms. Typically, customers prefer to first utilize their own rooms on location, and if such customer-owned rooms are insufficient, customers prefer to avoid busing their workforces to housing more than 45 kilometers away. 
A number of multinational energy companies believe there is a potential to export liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Canada to meet the increasing global demand, particularly in Asia, for LNG. We expect that LNG activity in Western Canada will be influenced by the global prices for LNG, which are largely tied to global oil prices, global supply/demand dynamics for LNG and Western Canadian wellhead prices for natural gas. Should our customers or potential customers decide to invest in these LNG projects, demand for hospitality services over the next three years will be driven by (i) the construction of the LNG facilities on the coast of British Columbia and (ii) the construction of the related natural gas pipeline infrastructure across British Columbia. Facility construction will create demand for permanent lodge accommodations and services, while pipeline construction activity will drive demand for mobile camp accommodations. 
Currently, Western Canada does not have any operational LNG export facilities. However, on October 1, 2018, LNG Canada (LNGC), a large LNG export project proposed by a joint venture between Shell Canada Energy, an affiliate of Royal Dutch Shell plc (40 percent), and affiliates of PETRONAS, through its wholly-owned entity, North Montney LNG Limited Partnership (25 percent), PetroChina (15 percent), Korea Gas Corporation (5 percent) and Mitsubishi Corporation (15 percent), announced that a positive final investment decision (FID) was reached on the proposed Kitimat liquefaction and export facility in Kitimat, British Columbia (Kitimat LNG Facility). See "Canada-Canadian British Columbia Lodge" for more information.

Our Australian villages support similar activities as our Canadian lodges for the natural resources industry in Australia. Our customers are typically developing and producing metallurgical (met) coal and other minerals which have resource lives that are measured in decades. As such, their spending levels tend to react similarly to commodity prices as the spending levels of our Canadian customers. Spending on producing assets is less sensitive to commodity price decreases in the short and medium term, assuming the projects remain cash flow positive. However, new construction projects and expansionary projects are typically cancelled or deferred during periods of lower met coal prices. Similar to the Canadian market, new project construction activity typically requires larger workforces than day-to-day operations, where proximity and availability of customer-owned rooms influences the demand for our rooms and services. During the period from mid-year 2012 to mid-year 2016, much of the previous demand for our hospitality services from new construction activity had ceased. Subsequently, our customer service requirements were primarily driven by production, maintenance and operational activities. More recently, we have seen an increase in the number of significant maintenance projects, along with customers initiating projects to optimize their assets. This work has also included some small mine expansion projects. The rise in met coal prices since the fourth quarter of 2016 has improved market sentiment, and we are working closely with our existing and potential customers as they consider capital investment and expansion opportunities in the future. We expect that customers will assess the likelihood of a period of sustained higher prices before committing capital to new projects. 
Our U.S. operations are primarily tied to activity in the U.S. shale formations in West Texas, the Bakken, the mid Continent, and the Rockies, as well as activity in the Louisiana downstream and offshore Gulf of Mexico markets. Given the shorter investment horizon and decision cycle of our U.S. customers, typically on a well-by-well basis, spending activities of U.S. customers typically react more quickly to changes in oil and natural gas prices. These spending dynamics were clearly demonstrated over the past six years. With oil prices near $100 per barrel from 2012 to late 2014, drilling and completion activity levels grew. However, as oil prices fell beginning in August 2014, and remained at relatively low levels throughout 2015 and most of 2016, activity in the U.S. reacted swiftly, with the U.S. rig count falling over 50% in six months from its peak in the third quarter of 2014. After staging a significant recovery in 2017, the U.S. rig count was generally stable in 2018, finishing the year at 1,083 rigs. The Permian Basin remains the most active U.S. unconventional play, representing 45% of the rigs in the U.S. market at the end of 2018. Completion activity also grew, with the Permian Basin again seeing the majority of growth in the U.S. market. Unlike the Canadian and Australian markets, headcount requirements for drilling and completion activity are fairly uniform in the U.S. market. Given the U.S. market for accommodations is primarily supported by mobile camp assets, competition is primarily driven by the availability of assets and price.

For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we generated $466.7 million, $382.3 million and $397.2 million in revenues and $88.1 million, $98.0 million and $95.8 million in operating loss, respectively. The majority of our operations, assets and income are derived from the hospitality services provided at our lodges and villages that have historically been contracted by our customers on a take-or-pay basis for periods ranging from several months to three years. The hospitality services we provide at these facilities generate more than 85% of our revenue. Important performance metrics include revenue related to our major properties, aggregate billed rooms and average daily rate.

Our History

Our Canadian operations, founded in 1977, began by providing modular rental housing to energy customers, primarily supporting drilling rig crews in the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin. Over the next decade, we acquired a food service operation and a manufacturing facility, enabling us to provide a more comprehensive accommodation solution. Through our experience with Syncrude’s Mildred Lake Village, a 2,100 bed facility that we built and sold to Syncrude in 1990 and operated and managed for them for nearly 20 years, we recognized a need for a premium, and more permanent, solution for workforce accommodations and hospitality services in the Canadian oil sands region. Pursuing this strategy, we opened PTI Lodge in 1998, one of the first independent lodging facilities in the region.
Through our wide range of hospitality services, we are able to identify, solve and implement solutions and services that enhance the guests’ accommodations experience and reduce the customer’s total cost of housing a workforce in a remote operating location. Through our experiences and service delivery model, our hospitality services have evolved to include fitness centers, water and wastewater treatment, laundry service and many other advancements. As our experience in the region grew, we were the first to introduce to the Canadian oil sands market suite-style accommodations for middle and upper-level management working in the region, with our Beaver River Executive Lodge in 2005. Since then, we have continued to innovate our service offerings to meet our customers’ growing and evolving needs. On April 2, 2018, we acquired Noralta, which provides remote hospitality services in Alberta, Canada (the Noralta Acquisition).  With eleven lodges comprising of over 5,700 owned rooms and 7,900 total rooms, Noralta has the capacity to house large workforces and the flexibility to meet our clients’ rapidly changing needs. From our entrepreneurial beginning, we have developed into Canada’s largest third-party provider of accommodations and hospitality services in the oil sands region.
Today, we also support customers’ logistical efforts in managing the movement of large numbers of personnel efficiently. At our Wapasu Creek location, we have introduced services that improve efficiencies for customers in transporting personnel to mine sites on a daily basis, as well as in rotating personnel when crews change. 
During 2015, we entered the Canadian LNG market with our Sitka Lodge. Most of the Sitka Lodge’s 646 rooms were under contract through October 2017 to LNGC. On October 1, 2018, LNGC's participants announced that a positive FID had been reached on the Kitimat LNG Facility. With the project moving forward, British Columbia LNG activity and related pipeline projects could become a material driver of future activity for our Sitka Lodge, as well as for our mobile camp assets, which are well suited for the related pipeline construction activity. 
With the acquisition of our Australian business in December 2010, we began providing hospitality services to support the Australian natural resources industry through our villages located in Queensland, New South Wales and Western Australia. Like Canada, our Australian business has a long-history of taking care of customers in remote regions, beginning with its initial Moranbah Village in 1996, and has grown to become Australia’s largest independent provider of hospitality services for people working in remote locations.  Our Australian business was the first to introduce resort-style accommodations to the mining sector, adding landscaping, outdoor kitchens, pools, fitness centers and, in some cases, taverns. In all our operating regions, our business is built on a culture of continuous service improvement to enhance the guest experience and reduce customers' workforce housing costs.
We take an active role in minimizing the environmental impact of our operations through a number of sustainable initiatives. We also have a focus on water conservation and utilize alternative water supply options such as recycling and rainwater collection and use. By building infrastructure such as waste-water treatment and water treatment facilities to recycle grey and black water on some of our sites, we are able to gain cost efficiencies as well as reduce the use of trucks related to water and wastewater hauling, which in turn, reduces our carbon footprint. In our Australian villages, we utilize passive-solar-design principles and smart-switching systems to reduce the need for electricity related to heating and cooling.
Our Industry

We provide hospitality services for the natural resource industries. Our scalable facilities provide long-term and temporary workforce accommodations where traditional accommodations and related infrastructure often are not accessible, sufficient or cost effective.  Once facilities are deployed in the field, we also provide hospitality services such as lodging, food service, housekeeping, and maintenance, as well as day-to-day operations, such as laundry, water and wastewater treatment, power generation, communication systems, security and group logistics. Our hospitality services can be provided at accommodation facilities we own or at facilities owned by our customers. Demand for our services is cyclical and substantially dependent upon activity levels, particularly our customers’ willingness to spend capital on the exploration for, development and production of oil, coal, natural gas and other resource reserves.  Our customers’ spending plans generally are based on their 
6

view of commodity supply and demand dynamics, as well as the outlook for near-term and long-term commodity prices.  As a result, the demand for our services is sensitive to current and expected commodity prices.
We serve multiple projects and multiple customers at most of our sites, which allows those customers to share some of the costs associated with their peak construction accommodations needs. Our facilities provide customers with cost efficiencies as they are able to share the costs of accommodations related infrastructure (power, water, sewer and IT) and central dining and recreation facilities with other customers operating projects in the same vicinity.
Our business is significantly influenced by the level of production of oil sands deposits in Alberta, Canada, activity levels in support of extractive industries in Australia, LNG and related pipeline activity in Canada and oil production in Canada and the U.S. Our two primary activity drivers are development and production activity in the Canadian oil sands region in Western Canada and the met coal region of Australia’s Bowen Basin. 
Historically, oil sands developers and Australian mining companies built, owned and in some cases operated the accommodations necessary to house their personnel in these remote regions because local labor and third-party owned rooms were not available. Over the past 20 years, and increasingly over the past 10 years, some customers have moved away from the insourcing business model for some of their accommodations as they recognize that owning accommodations and providing the hospitality services are non-core investments for their business.
 We believe that our existing industry divides accommodations into two primary types: (1) lodges and villages and (2) mobile assets. Civeo is principally focused on hospitality services at lodges and villages. Lodges and villages typically contain a larger number of rooms and require more time and capital to develop. These facilities typically have dining areas, meeting rooms, recreational facilities, pubs and landscaped grounds where weather permits. Lodges and villages are generally supported by multi-year, take-or-pay contracts. These facilities are designed to serve the long-term needs of customers in constructing and operating their resource developments. Mobile camps are designed to follow customers’ activities and can be deployed rapidly to scale. They are often used to support conventional and in-situ drilling crews, as well as pipeline and seismic crews, and are contracted on a project-by-project, well-by-well or short-term basis. Oftentimes, customers will initially require mobile accommodations as they evaluate or initially develop a field or mine. Mobile camp projects can be dedicated and committed to a single customer or project or the camps can serve multiple customers. 
The accommodations market supporting the natural resource industry is segmented into competitors that serve components of the overall value chain, but very few offer the entire suite of hospitality services to customers. We estimate that customer-owned rooms represent over 50% of the market. Engineering firms such as Bechtel, Fluor and ColtAmec often design accommodations facilities. Many public and private firms, such as ATCO Structures & Logistics Ltd. (ATCO), Horizon North Logistics Inc. (Horizon North), Alta-Fab Structures Ltd. (Alta-Fab) and Northgate Industries Ltd. (Northgate), will build the modular accommodations for sale. Horizon North, Black Diamond Group Limited (Black Diamond), ATCO, Royal Camp Services Ltd. and Algeco Scotsman will primarily own and lease the units to customers and in some cases provide facility management services, usually on a shorter-term basis with a more limited number of rooms, similar to our mobile camp business. Facility service companies, such as Aramark Corporation (Aramark), Sodexo Inc. (Sodexo), Compass Group PLC (Compass Group), or Cater Care typically do not invest in and own the accommodations assets, but will provide hospitality services at third-party or customer-owned facilities. We believe our service model provides value to our customers by reducing project timing and counterparty risks. In addition, with our holistic approach to hospitality services, we are able to identify and execute on efficiency opportunities for our customers by being able to bundle our services to meet their specific needs. 

Canada

Overview

During the year ended December 31, 2018, we generated approximately 63% of our revenue from our Canadian operations.  We are Canada’s largest provider of hospitality services for people working in remote locations.  We provide our services through our lodges and mobile assets and at customer-owned locations. Our hospitality services support workforces in the Canadian oil sands and in a variety of oil and natural gas drilling, mining and related natural resource applications, as well as disaster relief efforts.
Canadian Market

Demand for our hospitality services in the Canadian oil sands region is primarily influenced by the longer-term outlook for crude oil prices rather than current energy prices, given the multi-year production phase of oil sands projects and the costs associated with development of such large scale projects.  Utilization of our existing Canadian capacity and our future 
7

expansions will largely depend on continued oil sands spending related to existing production efforts, maintenance thereon and potential future expansion of existing projects.
The Athabasca oil sands are located in northern Alberta, an area that is very remote, with a limited local labor supply. Of Canada’s approximately 37 million residents, nearly half of the population lives in ten cities, while approximately 12% of the population lives in Alberta and less than 1% of the population lives within 100 kilometers of the oil sands activity. The local municipalities, of which Fort McMurray is the largest, have grown rapidly over the last decade, stressing their infrastructures and challenging them to respond to large-scale changes in demand. As such, the workforce accommodations market provides a cost effective solution to the problem of staffing large oil sands projects by sourcing labor largely throughout Canada to work on a rotational basis.
Canadian Oil Sands Lodges

During the year ended December 31, 2018, activity in the Athabasca oil sands region generated over 85% of our Canadian revenue. The oil sands region of northern Alberta, Canada continues to represent one of the world’s largest reserves for heavy oil. Our McClelland Lake, Wapasu, Henday, Athabasca, Beaver River, Fort McMurray Village, Grey Wolf, Hudson, Borealis and Firebag lodges are focused on the northern region of the Athabasca oil sands, where customers primarily utilize surface mining to extract the bitumen, or oil sands. Oil sands mining operations are characterized by large capital requirements, large reserves, large personnel requirements, very low exploration or reserve risk and relatively lower cash operating costs per barrel of bitumen produced. Our Conklin, Mariana Lake, Anzac, Red Earth and Wabasca lodges, as well as a portion of our mobile camp assets, are focused in the southern portion of the region where we primarily serve in-situ operations and pipeline expansion activity. In-situ methods are used on reserves that are too deep for traditional mining methods. In-situ technology typically injects steam or solvents into the deep oil sands in place to separate the bitumen from the sand and pumps it to the surface where it undergoes the same upgrading treatment as the mined bitumen. Reserves requiring in situ techniques of extraction represent 80% of the established recoverable reserves in Alberta. In-situ operations generally require less capital and personnel and produce lower volumes of bitumen per development, with higher ongoing operating expense per barrel of bitumen produced.
Our oil sands lodges support construction and operating personnel for maintenance and expansionary projects, as well as ongoing operations associated with surface mining and in-situ oil sands projects, generally under short and medium-term contracts.  Most of our oil sands lodges are located on land with leases obtained from the province of Alberta, or subleased from the resource developer, with initial terms of ten years. Our leases have expiration dates that range from 2020 to 2028. Currently, none of our Canadian lodges are on land with leases expiring prior to December 31, 2019. In recent years, we have successfully renewed or extended all expiring land leases. Two of our oil sands properties are located on land which we own. 
In order to operate a lodge in Canada, we are required to obtain a development permit from the regional municipality in which the lodge resides. The development permits are granted for a term ranging from two to ten years. Our development permits have expiration dates that range from 2019 to 2023. In recent years, we have successfully renewed or extended all expiring development permits. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors-Risks related to our business-All but three of our major Canadian lodges are located on land subject to leases. If we are unable to renew a lease or obtain permits necessary to operate on such leased land, we could be materially and adversely affected.” of this annual report for further information.
We provide a range of hospitality services at our lodges, including reservation management, check in and check out, food service, housekeeping and facilities management. Our lodge guests receive amenities similar to a full-service hotel plus three meals a day.  During 2018, with the exception of the Noralta Acquisition, no further rooms were added (net of retirements) to our major oil sands lodges.  Our Wapasu Creek Lodge, with more than 5,000 rooms, is equivalent in size to the largest hotels in North America.
We provide our hospitality services at the lodges we own on a day rate or monthly rental basis, and our customers typically commit for short to medium-term contracts (from several months up to several years). Customers make a minimum nightly or monthly room commitment for the term of the contract, and the multi-year contracts typically provide for inflationary escalations in rates for increased food, labor and utilities costs.
Canadian British Columbia Lodge

The initial development of our Sitka Lodge, in Kitimat, British Columbia, included 646 rooms built in 2015. Most of these rooms were under contract through October 2017 to LNGC. The initial phase of this location featured food service and recreational facilities and the ability to expand should demand for rooms in the region warrant. 
8

On October 1, 2018, LNGC's participants announced a positive FID on the Kitimat LNG Facility. With the project moving forward, British Columbia LNG activity and related pipeline projects could become a material driver of future activity for our Sitka Lodge, as well as for our mobile camp assets, which are well suited for the related pipeline construction activity. We previously announced contract awards totaling C$100 million in revenues to supply mobile accommodations for four locations along the Coastal GasLink (CGL) pipeline project in British Columbia, Canada. This pipeline would provide the natural gas for the Kitimat LNG Facility. We expect to deploy approximately C$10 million in capital, primarily in 2019, across all four locations. We expect to begin recognizing revenue from these contracts beginning in 2019. In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2018, we were awarded room commitments from LNGC, CGL and LNGC’s engineering, procurement and construction firm to provide rooms and services from Sitka Lodge. The award covers expected room needs over an initial 18 month time period with a minimum room commitment and options for extension of up to 36 months. We began recognizing revenue from this award beginning in November 2018. Revenues for the room commitments are estimated to be approximately C$70 million over the initial 18 months. The actual timing of when revenue is realized from the CGL pipeline and Sitka Lodge contracts could be impacted by any delays in the construction of the Kitimat LNG Facility. We expect to spend approximately C$15 million in capital to expand the Sitka Lodge to 1,100 rooms.

Hospitality Services at Third-Party Owned Facilities
We provide hospitality services at facilities owned by our customers. Historically, this has been focused around natural resource production-related housing facilities that are owned by the natural resource owners. Currently, we operate camp facilities for third-party customers. The facilities we manage range anywhere from 200 to 1,500 rooms. We are able to customize our service offerings depending on our client’s needs. Hospitality services can be performed on an end-to-end basis with food service, maintenance and utility services included or in segments such as food service only. 
Recently, we have engaged in developing a related food service brand, Red Table. This diversification initiative targets food service and facility management opportunities outside of the natural resources industry, including educational, entertainment, healthcare and traditional catering events. Currently, Red Table operates more than ten facilities, and includes a food production facility, which began operations in the second quarter of 2018.
Canadian Mobile Accommodations
Our mobile accommodations consist of modular, skid-mounted accommodations and central facilities that can be quickly configured to serve a multitude of short to medium-term accommodation needs. The dormitory, kitchen and ancillary assets can be rapidly mobilized and demobilized and are scalable to support 200 to 800 people in a single location. In addition to asset rental, we provide hospitality services such as food service and housekeeping, as well as camp management services, including fresh water and sewage hauling services. Our mobile camps service the traditional oil and gas sector in Alberta and British Columbia and in-situ oil sands drilling and development operations in Alberta, as well as pipeline construction crews throughout Western Canada. The assets have also been used in the past in disaster relief efforts, the 2010 Vancouver Winter Olympic Games and a variety of other non-energy related projects.
10

Our mobile camp assets are rented on a per unit basis based on the number of days that a customer utilizes the asset. In cases where we provide food service or ancillary services, the contract can provide for per unit pricing or cost-plus pricing. Customers are also typically responsible for mobilization and demobilization costs. Our focus on hospitality service contracts has allowed us to successfully pursue food service only opportunities. Due to the business nature of servicing client-owned facilities, this business easily fits into our overall business. Aside from the traditional workforce accommodations, we are expanding our target markets to areas such as institutional, educational and entertainment facilities. 
Australia

Overview

During the year ended December 31, 2018, we generated 26% of our revenue from our Australian operations.  As of December 31, 2018, we had 9,346 rooms across ten villages, of which 7,392 rooms service the Bowen Basin region of Queensland, one of the premier met coal basins in the world. We provide hospitality services on a day rate basis to mining and related service companies (including construction contractors), typically under short and medium-term contracts (one to five years) with minimum nightly room commitments. During 2018, no further rooms were added to our Australian villages. 
Australian Market

As the largest contributor to exports and a major contributor to the country’s gross domestic product and government revenue, the Australian natural resources industry plays a vital role in the Australian economy.  Australia has broad natural resources, including met and thermal coal, conventional and coal seam gas, base metals, iron ore and precious metals such as gold. The growth of Australian natural resource commodity exports over the last decade has been largely driven by strong Asian demand for coal, iron ore and LNG. Australia’s resources are primarily located in remote regions of the country that lack infrastructure and resident labor forces to develop these resources, as the majority of Australia’s population is located on the east coast of the country. As a result, much of the natural resources labor force works on a rotational basis, which often requires a commute from a major city or the coast and a living arrangement near the resource projects. Consequently, there is substantial need for workforce accommodations and hospitality services to support resource production in the country. Workforce accommodations have historically been built and owned by the resource developer/owner, with third parties providing the hospitality and facility management services, typical of an insourcing business model. 
Since 1996, our Australian business has sought to change the insourcing business model through its hospitality services offering, allowing customers to outsource their accommodations needs and focus their investments on resource production operations. Our Australian villages are strategically located in proximity to long-lived, low-cost mines operated by investment-grade, international mining companies.  
During the year ended December 31, 2018, our five villages in the Bowen Basin of central Queensland generated 80% of our Australian revenue. The Bowen Basin contains one of the largest coal deposits in Australia and is renowned for its premium met coal. Met coal is used in the steel making process and demand has largely been driven by global demand for steel finished goods and steel construction materials. In recent years, growth in construction demand for steel products in emerging economies, particularly China, slowed significantly, negatively impacting demand for the commodity. However, the rebounding of steel demand in 2017 and 2018 led to improved pricing for met coal in 2017 and 2018. Australia is the largest exporter of met coal in the world, in addition to being in close proximity to the largest steel producing countries in the world. Our villages are focused on the mines in the central portion of the basin and are well positioned for the active mines in the region.
Beyond the Bowen Basin, we serve several markets with four additional villages. At the end of 2018, we had two villages with over 1,000 combined rooms in the Gunnedah Basin, a thermal and met coal region in New South Wales. In Western Australia, we serve workforces related to LNG facilities operations on the Northwest Shelf through our Karratha village and the gold fields through our Kambalda village.

Our Australian segment includes ten villages with 9,346 rooms as of December 31, 2018 and are strategically located near long-lived, low-cost mines operated by large mining companies.  Our Australian business provides hospitality services to mining and related service companies under short- and medium-term contracts.  Our growth plan for this part of our business continues to include enhanced occupancy and expansion of these properties where we believe there is durable long-term demand, as well as to provide hospitality services at customer owned assets.
Our Coppabella, Dysart, Moranbah, Middlemount and Nebo villages are located in the Bowen Basin. Coppabella, at over 3,000 rooms, is our largest village and provides rooms and related hospitality services to a variety of customers. Each of these villages supports both operational workforce needs and contractor needs with resort style amenities, including swimming pools, gyms, a walking track and a tavern. Our Nebo, Dysart, Moranbah and Middlemount Villages have a long history of providing service in the region.

Our Narrabri and Boggabri villages in New South Wales service met and thermal coal mines and coal seam gas in the Gunnedah Basin. Karratha village, in Western Australia, services workforces related to LNG facilities operations on the Northwest Shelf. Our Kambalda village supports gold and lithium mining in southern Western Australia. 
U.S.

Overview

During the year ended December 31, 2018, our U.S. business generated 11% of our revenue. Our U.S. business has operational exposure in the U.S. shale formations in West Texas, the Bakken, the mid Continent, and the Rockies and offshore Gulf of Mexico markets. The business provides accommodations facilities with hospitality services and highly mobile smaller camps that follow drilling rigs and completion crews as well as accommodations, office and storage modules that are placed on offshore drilling rigs and production platforms. Our U.S. business also provides lodging and hospitality services to the downstream industry through a 400-room facility near Lake Charles, Louisiana.

U.S. Market

Onshore oil and natural gas development in the U.S. has historically been supported by local workforces traveling short to moderate distances to the worksites. With the development of substantial resources in regions such as the Bakken, Rockies and Permian Basin, labor demand has exceeded the local labor supply and accommodations infrastructure to support the demand. Consequently, demand for remote, scalable accommodations and hospitality services has developed in the U.S. over the past several years. Demand for hospitality services in the U.S. has historically been tied to the level of oil and natural gas exploration and production activity, which is primarily driven by oil and natural gas prices. Activity levels have been, and we expect will continue to be, highly correlated with hydrocarbon commodity prices.

U.S. Mobile Camps

Our business in the U.S. consists primarily of mobile camp assets, both in the lower 48 states, including the Rocky Mountain corridor, the Bakken Shale region, the mid Continent region, the Permian Basin region of Texas, and in the Gulf of Mexico. We provide a variety of sizes and configurations to meet the needs of E&P companies, completion companies, infrastructure construction projects and offshore drilling and completion activity. We provide quality hospitality services such as food service and housekeeping services as well. 
Our mobile camps are rented on a per unit basis based on the number of days that a customer utilizes the asset. In cases where we provide food service or other hospitality services, the contract can provide for per unit pricing or cost-plus pricing. Customers are also typically responsible for mobilization and demobilization costs.

We had three lodges in the U.S. comprised of 1,025 rooms as of December 31, 2018. Our Killdeer Lodge, which we opened in October 2013, provides rooms to the Bakken Shale region in North Dakota. Our West Permian Lodge supports the Permian Basin in West Texas. Our Acadian Acres Lodge, which we acquired in February 2018, provides rooms near Lake Charles, Louisiana to support the Louisiana downstream market. 

Modular Construction 

The capability of our Canadian business includes the design, engineering, transportation and installation of a variety of modular buildings, predominately for our own use. As of December 31, 2018, we owned one modular construction and manufacturing plant near Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. During the fourth quarter of 2017, we made the decision to sell this plant due to changing geographic and market needs. In line with our Australian and U.S. strategy, we are now subcontracting modular construction from third-party manufacturers for our Canadian business. In Canada, we continue to retain a staff of experts who have designed and delivered large and small modular construction projects. We are capable of taking highly replicable and well-designed manufactured buildings and our expertise in site layout, combined with site-built components including landscaping, recreational facilities and certain common facilities, to create a comfortable community within a community. We design accommodations facilities to suit the climate, terrain and population of a specific project site.
Community Relations

With a focus on long-term Indigenous community participation, our Canadian operations continue to work closely with a number of First Nations to develop mutually beneficial partnerships focused on revenue sharing, capacity building, employment and community investment and support. For over a decade, our Canadian operations supported Buffalo Metis Catering, a partnership with three Metis communities in the Regional Municipality of Wood Buffalo. Through this partnership, food and housekeeping services were delivered to three of our lodges. Beyond these services, this partnership provided a business incubator environment for a number of Metis business ventures. Our Canadian operations also procure services from a number of other First Nations-owned and member-owned businesses to deliver water hauling, snow removal and security services. The annual value of these contracts exceeds C$10 million.
Our Indigenous partnership initiatives were recognized in 2011 and 2012 with awards from the Alberta Chamber of Commerce. In addition, in 2016, Civeo was awarded a Silver level PAR certification by the Canadian Council for Aboriginal Business (CCAB), demonstrating our commitment to the principles and practices established by the CCAB.
In 2018, Civeo entered into three new indigenous partnerships in the oil sands region and two new partnerships in British Columbia. Our partnerships in British Columbia are tied to accommodations contracts secured by Civeo for the Kitimat LNG Facility and for the Coastal Gas Link pipeline project that originates in the North Montney region of north east British Columbia. Beyond revenue sharing, these new arrangements provide employment, training, and ancillary business opportunities for indigenous owned businesses.
14

In Australia, our community relations program also aims to build and maintain a positive social license to operate by consulting and engaging with local regional communities from project inception, through development, construction and operations. This is a major advantage for our business model, as it facilitates consistent communication, engenders trust and builds relationships to last throughout the resource lifecycle. There is an emphasis on developing partnerships that create a long-term sustainable outcome to address specific community needs. To that end, we partner with local municipalities to improve and expand municipal infrastructure. These improvements provide necessary infrastructure, allowing the local communities an opportunity to expand and improve.
Customers and Competitors

Our customers primarily operate in oil sands mining and development, drilling, exploration and extraction of oil and natural gas and coal and other extractive industries. To a lesser extent, we also support other activities, including pipeline construction, forestry, humanitarian aid and disaster relief, and support for military operations.  Our largest customers in 2018 were Imperial Oil Limited (a company controlled by ExxonMobil Corporation), Fort Hills Energy LP (a partnership between Suncor Energy Inc., Total E&P Canada Ltd and Teck Resources Limited) and Suncor Energy Inc., who each accounted for more than 10% of our 2018 revenues.
Our primary competitors in Canada in lodge and mobile camp hospitality services include ATCO, Black Diamond, Horizon North and Clean Harbors, Inc. Some of these competitors have one or two locations similar to our oil sands lodges; however, based on our estimates, these competitors do not have the breadth or scale of our lodge operations. In Canada, we also compete against Aramark and Compass Group for third-party facility management and hospitality services.
Our primary competitors in Australia for our village hospitality services are Ausco Modular (a subsidiary of Algeco Scotsman) and Fleetwood Corporation.  We also compete against Sodexo and Compass Group for third-party facility management services.
In the U.S., we primarily offer our lodge and mobile camp hospitality services and compete against Peak Oilfield Services (a subsidiary of Select Energy Services), Stallion Oilfield Holdings, Inc., Target Hospitality, HB Rentals (a subsidiary of Superior Energy Services) and Black Diamond.
Historically, many customers have invested in their own accommodations.  We estimate that our existing and potential customers own approximately 50% of the rooms available in the Canadian oil sands and 50% of the rooms in the Australian coal mining regions.
Our Lodge and Village Contracts

During the year ended December 31, 2018, revenues from our lodges and villages represented over 80% of our consolidated revenues. Our customers typically contract for hospitality services under take-or-pay or exclusivity contracts with terms that most often range from several months to three years. Our contract terms generally provide for a rental rate for a reserved room and an occupied room rate that compensates us for hospitality services, including meals, utilities and maintenance for workers staying in the lodges and villages. In multi-year contracts, our rates typically have annual contractual escalation provisions to cover expected increases in labor and consumables costs over the contract term. Over the term of a take-or-pay contract, the customer commits to a minimum number of rooms over a determined period. Over the term of an exclusivity contract, rather than receiving a minimum room commitment, we are the exclusive hospitality service provider for the customer's employees working on a specific project or projects. In some contracts, customers have a contractual right to terminate rooms, for reasons other than a breach, in exchange for a termination fee. As of December 31, 2018, we had commitments for 24% of our rentable rooms for 2019 and 11% of our rentable rooms for 2020.
15

As of December 31, 2018, we had 5,472 rooms under contract. The table below details the expiration of those contracts: 

 | ContractedRoom Expiration

2020 | 3,613 
2021 | 318 
2022 | — 
2023 | — 
Thereafter | — 
Total | 5,472 


The contracts expire throughout the year, and for many of the near-term expirations, we are in the process of negotiating extensions or new commitments. We cannot assure that we can renew existing contracts or obtain new business on the same or better terms, if at all.

Seasonality of Operations

Our operations are directly affected by seasonal weather. A portion of our Canadian operations is conducted during the winter months when the winter freeze in remote regions is required for customers’ activity to occur. The spring thaw in these frontier regions restricts operations in the second quarter and adversely affects our operations and our ability to provide services. Customers’ maintenance activities in the oil sands region, such as shutdown and turnaround activity, are typically performed in the second and third quarters annually. Our Canadian operations have also been impacted by forest fires and flooding in the past five years. During the Australian rainy season between November and April, our operations in Queensland and the northern parts of Western Australia can be affected by cyclones, monsoons and resultant flooding.  In the U.S., winter weather in the first quarter and the resulting spring break up in the second quarter have historically negatively impacted our Bakken and Rocky Mountain operations. Our U.S. offshore operations have historically been impacted by the Gulf of Mexico hurricane season from July through November. 
Employees

As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 700 full-time employees and approximately 1,500 hourly employees on a consolidated basis, 73% of whom are located in Canada, 18% of whom are located in Australia and 9% of whom are located in the U.S.  We were party to collective bargaining agreements covering approximately 1,100 employees located in Canada and 140 employees located in Australia as of December 31, 2018.
Government Regulation

Our business is significantly affected by foreign and U.S. laws and regulations at the federal, provincial, state and local levels relating to the oil, natural gas and mining industries, worker safety and environmental protection. Changes in these laws, including more stringent regulations and increased levels of enforcement of these laws and regulations, and the development of new laws and regulations could significantly affect our business and result in:

• | increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions associated with our operations or our customers’ operations;


• | other increased costs to our business or our customers’ business;


• | reduced demand for oil, natural gas, and other natural resources that our customers produce; and


• | reduced demand for our services.


To the extent that these laws and regulations impose more stringent requirements or increased costs or delays upon our customers in the performance of their operations, the resulting demand for our services by those customers may be adversely affected, which impact could be significant and long-lasting. Moreover, climate change laws or regulations could increase the cost of consuming, and thereby reduce demand for, oil and natural gas, which could reduce our customers’ demand for our services. We cannot predict changes in the level of enforcement of existing laws and regulations, how these laws and regulations may be interpreted or the effect changes in these laws and regulations may have on us or our customers or on our 
16

future operations or earnings. We also are not able to predict the extent to which new laws and regulations will be adopted or whether such new laws and regulations may impose more stringent or costly restrictions on our customers or our operations.

Our operations and the operations of our customers are subject to numerous stringent and comprehensive foreign, federal, provincial, state and local environmental laws and regulations governing the release or discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. Numerous governmental agencies issue regulations to implement and enforce these laws, for which compliance is often costly yet critical. The violation of these laws and regulations may result in the denial or revocation of permits, issuance of corrective action orders, modification or cessation of operations, assessment of administrative and civil penalties, and even criminal prosecution. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations and we do not anticipate that future compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations will have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.  However, there can be no assurance that substantial costs for compliance or penalties for non-compliance with these existing requirements will not be incurred in the future by us or our customers. Moreover, it is possible that other developments, such as the adoption of stricter environmental laws, regulations and enforcement policies or more stringent enforcement of existing environmental laws and regulations, could result in additional costs or liabilities upon us or our customers that we cannot currently quantify. 

Canadian Environmental Regulations

In Canada, the federal, provincial and local governments have jurisdiction to regulate environmental matters. We or our customers may be subject to environmental regulations imposed by these three levels of government. The following addresses updates to Canadian environmental regulations in 2018 that may affect us or our customers. 
Air Quality Management
The Government of Alberta (Alberta) and the Government of Canada (Canada) each have frameworks for air quality management that may affect us and our customers. 
At the federal level, the Multi-Sector Air Pollutants Regulations impose mandatory air emissions standards that limit the amount of nitrogen oxides and sulphur dioxides that can be emitted from certain boilers, heaters and gaseous-fuel-fired engines used in industrial facilities as well as from cement kilns. These regulations may impact emission performance standards for compressors and boilers used by our customers in conventional and steam assisted gravity operations in the oil sands and may affect our customers’ operations. 
In addition to federal requirements, emissions from facilities in Alberta are subject to provincial regulation. The Alberta Energy Regulator (AER), which is responsible for regulating upstream oil and gas activity in the province, oversees compliance with Directive 60, which requires operators to eliminate or reduce flaring associated with a wide variety of energy development activities and operations. In December 2018, the AER finalized amendments to its Directive 60 and Directive 17 as part of its role in implementing commitments from the Alberta government to reduce methane emissions from upstream oil and gas operations by 45 per cent by 2025. These requirements, among other things, set limits on methane emissions from various facilities and require annual reporting of such emissions to the AER, with the first such report covering the 2019 calendar year and coming due on June 1, 2020. Meeting these regulatory requirements may result in additional costs or liabilities for our customers’ operations. 
Climate Change Regulation
Scientific studies have suggested that emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG), including carbon dioxide and methane, may be contributing to warming of the Earth’s atmosphere and other climatic changes.  On January 29, 2010, Canada affirmed its desire to be associated with the Copenhagen Accord that was negotiated in December 2009 as part of the international meetings on climate change regulation in Copenhagen.  The Copenhagen Accord, which is not legally binding, allows countries to commit to specific efforts to reduce GHG emissions, although how and when the commitments may be converted into binding emission reduction obligations, if ever, is currently uncertain.  Pursuant to the Copenhagen Accord process, Canada has indicated an economy-wide GHG emissions target that equates to a 17 percent reduction from 2005 levels by 2020, and the former Canadian Conservative federal government indicated an objective of reducing overall Canadian GHG emissions by 60 percent to 70 percent from 2006 levels by 2050.  However, with current climate change measures in place, Canada’s GHG emissions are forecast to be just under 6% below 2005 levels by 2020. 
In December 2015, 195 nations, including Canada, Australia, and the U.S., adopted the Paris Agreement at the 21st “Conference of the Parties” (COP 21). The Paris Agreement does not set legally binding emission reduction targets but does set 
17

a goal of limiting global temperature increases to less than 2° Celsius. Canada announced that it is in favor of the decision of the COP 21 to endeavor to take action to further limit global temperature increases to less than 1.5° Celsius. The Paris Agreement also requires parties to submit Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) which set out their emission reduction targets and to renew these INDCs, with the goal of increasing the reductions, every five years. The Paris Agreement does not legally bind the parties to reach their INDCs, nor does it prescribe the measures it must take to achieve them. These measures are left to each participating nation. In September 2016, the new federal government confirmed that it would not commit to a more ambitious INDC than the preceding Conservative federal government. The government maintained this approach in 2017 revisions to Canada’s INDC submission taking into account the federal Pan-Canadian Framework on Clean Growth and Climate Change (PCF) adopted in 2016. 
In March 2016, Canada and the Government of the United States jointly announced their intention to take action to reduce methane emissions from the oil and gas sector in an effort to meet their respective INDCs pursuant to the Paris Agreement. For its part, Canada announced its intention to reduce methane emissions from the oil and gas sector by 40-45 percent below 2012 levels by 2025. In 2018, the government introduced the Regulations Respecting Reduction in the Release of Methane and Certain Volatile Organic Compounds (Upstream Oil and Gas Sector) (“Federal Methane Regulations”) to implement its methane commitment. The Federal Methane Regulations impose various quantity-based limits on the venting of natural gas (or in the case of well completions involving hydraulic fracturing, a ban on such venting) and include associated conservation, measurement, inspection and corrective action requirements. Certain requirements of the Federal Methane Regulations come into effect January 1, 2020, with others deferred until January 1, 2023. These requirements may result in additional costs or liabilities for our customers’ operations.
In March 2016, as a further effort to meet Canada’s INDC, representatives of the federal and certain provincial governments committed to imposing a price on carbon pollution, beginning at $10 per tonne in 2018 and increasing at a rate of $10 annually to $50 per tonne in 2022. To implement its INDC and PCF commitments, the federal government introduced the Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act, which as of its assent in June 2018 implements a legislative carbon pricing “backstop” applying a benchmark carbon price in any province that does not establish an equivalent framework at or above the benchmark level. The backstop allows individual provinces to choose between an explicit price-based system (as exists in British Columbia) or a cap-and-trade system (as exists in Quebec). Features of the backstop come into effect at various points in 2019 in Ontario, New Brunswick, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Yukon, Nunavut and Prince Edward Island. Saskatchewan and Ontario are challenging the backstop in court on the basis that the federal government lacks the constitutional ability to implement the measure. The outcome of this litigation is uncertain and could affect our customers compliance requirements in provinces subject to the backstop or which may become subject to the backstop in the future.
Additionally, GHG regulation can take place at the provincial level. For example, Alberta’s Climate Change and Emissions Management Act provides a framework for managing GHG emissions by reducing specified gas emissions, relative to total production from facilities that emit over 100,000 tons of carbon dioxide equivalent per year. The details of this framework are set out in the Carbon Competitiveness Incentive Regulation (CCIR), which was issued in 2018 to replace the former Specified Gas Emitters Regulation, following changes announced as part of government’s Climate Leadership Plan (CLP) launched in November 2015. Like its predecessor, the CCIR incentivizes emissions reductions through the use of emissions intensity targets. A company can meet the applicable emissions limits by making emissions intensity improvements at regulated facilities, offsetting GHG emissions by purchasing offset credits or emission performance credits in the open market, or acquiring “fund credits” (akin to allowances) by making payments for each ton of GHG emissions over the required reduction target to the Alberta Climate Change and Emissions Management Fund.  
Between 2015 and 2017, the government of Alberta increased the price per fund credit from $15 to $30 per credit. There are financial penalties for non-compliance for every ton of carbon dioxide equivalent over a facility’s net emission intensity limit as well as for contraventions of other provisions contained in the CCIR. Further, the CCIR imposes GHG emissions reporting requirements on a company that has GHG emissions of 50,000 tons or more of carbon dioxide equivalent from a facility in a calendar year.  In addition, Alberta facilities must currently report emissions of industrial air pollutants and comply with obligations in approvals and under other environmental regulations. 
The implementation of the CCIR in 2018 largely maintained the preceding Specific Gas Emitters Regulation’s emissions reduction framework, but, as anticipated following the CLP’s announcement, introduced a number of changes that increase the regime’s stringency. Most notably, for the purposes of calculating emissions limits, the CCIR largely replaces the facility-specific baselines of its predecessor with product-specific benchmarks based on either 80% of production-weighted average emissions, best-in-class or top quartile production methodologies. Each of these benchmarks has a 1% tightening rate applicable to the 2020 compliance years and beyond that results in the benchmark becoming more stringent over time. The CCIR also imposes caps on the percentage of a facility’s emissions compliance obligation that can be met using emission 
18

performance credits and offsets, thereby requiring either greater fund credit purchases or emissions improvements from affected facilities. These changes, among others, may significantly increase the cost of compliance for some of our customers. 
The 2015 CLP also proposed introducing a broad economy-wide levy on GHG emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels, subject to limited exceptions. In May 2016, Alberta passed the Climate Leadership Act, implementing the broad economy-wide levy on GHG emissions contemplated in the CLP. Under that Act, all fuel consumption - including gasoline, diesel, and natural gas consumption - is subject to a carbon levy. The levy was set at $20 per ton in 2017 and rose to $30 per ton in 2018, adding to the cost of most fossil-based fuels. While the federal government’s backstop carbon price is set to rise from $30 per ton in 2020 to $40 per ton in 2021, the Alberta government declared in August 2018 that it would be pulling out of the federal PCF until its concerns with progress on the stalled Trans-Mountain Expansion Project pipeline are resolved. As such, further increases in the carbon levy affecting our customers are uncertain at this time. The carbon levy could also be affected by the result of an Alberta provincial election set to take place before May 31, 2019 and existing court challenges to the PCF’s carbon-pricing scheme. 
The CLP also targets a 45 percent reduction in methane emissions from oil and gas operations by 2025, consistent with the subsequently-issued Federal Methane Regulations described above. The AER was assigned the task of developing Alberta’s parallel regulatory framework. In December 2018, the AER released amended directives to require reporting of methane emissions on an annual basis, with annual recording of emissions beginning in the 2019 calendar year for a first report due to the AER on June 1, 2020, together with various facility-specific emissions limits. 
Further, as contemplated in the CLP, Alberta passed the Oil Sands Emissions Limit Act which caps oil sands emissions at 100 million tonnes annually. The CLP also targets the phasing out of coal-generated electricity (or the emissions therefrom) by 2030. The combination of the carbon levy and coal phase-out is expected to increase fuel and electricity prices, which could have an impact on our operating costs. The direct and indirect costs of these regulatory changes may adversely affect our operations and financial results as well as those of our customers with whom we conduct business. 
Finally, it should be noted that some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of GHGs in the Earth’s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as higher sea levels, increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts, floods and other climatic events. If any such effects were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
The Canadian Species at Risk Act is intended to prevent wildlife species in Canada from disappearing and to provide for the recovery of wildlife species that no longer exist in the wild in Canada, or that are endangered or threatened as a result of human activity, and to manage species of special concern to prevent them from becoming endangered or threatened. The designation of previously unprotected species as threatened or endangered in areas of Canada where our customers’ oil and natural gas exploration and production operations are conducted could cause them to incur increased costs arising from species protection measures or could result in limitations on their exploration and production activities, which could have an adverse impact on demand for our services.
Alberta’s Electricity Market
The CLP set a target of 30 per cent of Alberta’s electricity generation coming from renewables by 2030. Toward attaining this goal, on November 3, 2016, Alberta released the details of its Renewable Electricity Program (REP), which includes a procurement process for renewable generation. The first procurement process, REP Round 1, took place in 2017 and awarded long-term, indexed-price power contracts to approximately 596 MW of wind generation capacity. The second process, REP 2, took place in 2018 and awarded contracts to 363 MW of wind capacity in 2018, with eligible projects having a minimum of 25% Indigenous equity ownership. The third, REP 3, also in 2018, was structured similarly to REP 1 and awarded contracts to 400 MW of wind capacity. REP 1-procured capacity will come into commercial operation by the end of 2019, with REP 2 and REP 3-procured capacity coming online later, in mid-2021. Funding for the REP will come from the Climate Change and Emissions Management Fund described above, backstopped by the government’s General Revenue Fund, rather than from direct electricity charges to our customers.
Alberta further announced on November 23, 2016, that it would restructure its power market to include a parallel “capacity market” by 2021. The effect of this change will be to create two revenue streams for power generators in Alberta, one for energy produced (with payments structured similarly to the existing market) and the other for the provision of generating capacity itself (with payments based on outcomes in the new capacity market). The capacity market, managed by the Alberta Electric System Operator, will award rights to “capacity payments” to the lowest bidders in auctions to be held periodically in which all Alberta generation, excepting REP assets, will be eligible to participate. This reform is expected to increase revenue certainty in the sector and stimulate needed investment, while avoiding the risk of cost overruns associated with procuring all 
19

new capacity pursuant to centrally-managed government procurement processes. The details of the capacity market are currently the subject of Alberta Utilities Commission (AUC) proceedings that, pursuant to amendments to the province’s Electric Utilities Act, will take place between 2019 and 2021 in order to finalize new market rules ahead of the first capacity market-procured capacity coming online. However, provisional rules will be approved by the AUC to be in place ahead of the first capacity auctions scheduled for late 2019. 
There is still considerable uncertainty regarding the future of the REP and Alberta’s proposed two-market structure, both of which could potentially increase costs to our customers in the form of higher electricity prices. The REP’s funding structure currently limits that program’s direct impact on electricity prices. However, the coming-online of REP-subsidized generation could negatively affect the performance of Alberta’s current electricity market. This may be mitigated by the introduction of the capacity market, which the Alberta government expects to result in more stable power prices without sacrificing affordability to power consumers. However, capacity market outcomes depend on the details of the market’s rules framework, which are the subject of the above-noted AUC proceedings, and the results of numerous capacity auctions scheduled into the future. Both reforms may also be affected by the outcome of a provincial election scheduled for 2019.

Australian Environmental Regulations

Our Australian segment is regulated by general statutory environmental controls at both the state and federal level which may result in land use approval and compliance risk. These controls include: land use and urban design controls; the regulation of hard and liquid waste, including the requirement for tradewaste and/or wastewater permits or licenses; the regulation of water, noise, heat, and atmospheric gases emissions; the regulation of the production, transport and storage of dangerous and hazardous materials (including asbestos); and the regulation of pollution and site contamination. Some specified activities, for example, sewage treatment works, may require regulation at a state level by way of environmental protection licenses which also impose monitoring and reporting obligations on the holder. There is an increasing emphasis from state and federal regulators on sustainability and energy efficiency in business operations.  Federal requirements are now in place for the mandatory disclosure of energy performance under building rating schemes. These schemes require the tracking of specific environmental performance factors. Carbon reporting requirements currently exist for corporations which meet a reporting threshold for greenhouse gases or energy use or production for a reporting (financial) year under national legislation. 
U.S. Environmental Regulations

The Clean Water Act, as amended, and analogous state laws impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants into state waters or waters of the U.S. The discharge of pollutants into jurisdictional waters is prohibited unless the discharge is permitted by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or authorized state agencies.  The EPA published a final rule outlining its position on the federal jurisdictional reach over waters of the U.S. in June 2015, but in January 2018 released a final rule that delays implementation of the rule revising the WOTUS definition until 2020 to allow time for EPA to reconsider the definition of “waters of the United States.” In August 2018, the U.S. District Court for the District of South Carolina issued a nationwide injunction against EPA’s rule delaying implementation of the WOTUS definition. Pursuant to the court’s order, the 2015 Clean Water Rule is now in effect in 22 states, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. territories. Litigation surrounding this rule is ongoing. More recently, on December 11, 2018, the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers released a proposal to revise the 2015 Clean Water Rule so as to narrow the regulatory definition of waters of the U.S., with a 60-day comment period to follow. Many of our U.S. properties and operations require permits for discharges of wastewater and/or storm water, and we have developed a system for securing and maintaining these permits. The Clean Water Act and analogous state laws provide for administrative, civil and criminal penalties for unauthorized discharges and, together with the Oil Pollution Act of 1999, as amended, require the development and implementation of spill prevention and response plans and impose liability for the remedial costs and associated damages arising out of any unauthorized discharges.
The EPA has adopted rules requiring the monitoring and reporting of GHG emissions from specified large GHG emission sources in the U.S., including, offshore and onshore oil and natural gas production facilities, on an annual basis. In October 2015, the EPA finalized rules that added new sources to the scope of the GHG monitoring and reporting requirements. These new sources include gathering and boosting facilities as well as completions and workovers from hydraulically fractured oil wells. In addition, the EPA has finalized new regulations that would further restrict GHG emissions, such as new standards for methane and volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions from new and modified oil and gas sources, which the EPA published in June 2016. The EPA has also announced that it intends to impose methane emission standards for existing sources and has issued information collection requests for oil and natural gas facilities. The EPA is currently engaged in rulemaking to stay the effective date of these rules. In April 2018, a coalition of states filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia aiming to force the EPA to establish guidelines for limiting methane emissions from existing sources in the oil and natural gas sector; that lawsuit is pending. Additionally, in November 2016, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) issued new regulations to reduce “waste” of natural gas-of which methane is a primary constituent-from venting, flaring and leaks 
20

during oil and natural gas production activities on onshore federal and Indian lands, but then proposed a revised rule which scaled back the waste-prevention requirements of the 2016 rule. Environmental groups sued in federal district court a day later to challenge the legality of aspects of the revised rule, and the outcome of this litigation is currently uncertain. In October 2015, the EPA finalized the Clean Power Plan, which imposes additional obligations on the power generation sector to reduce GHG emissions. However, on February 9, 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court stayed implementation of the Clean Power Plan pending resolution of legal challenges to the rule, and in October 2017 the EPA proposed to repeal the rule before proposing a replacement rule, the Affordable Clean Energy Rule, which would scale back the obligations of the Clean Power Plan. While our operations are not directly affected by these actions, their impact on our oil and natural gas exploration and production customers could result in a decreased demand for the services that we provide.
While the U.S. Congress has from time to time considered legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs, there has not been significant activity in the form of adopted legislation to reduce GHG emissions at the federal level in recent years.  In the absence of federal climate legislation in the U.S., a number of state and regional efforts have emerged that are aimed at tracking and/or reducing GHG emissions, including cap and trade programs that typically require major sources of GHG emissions, such as electric power plants, to acquire and surrender emission allowances in return for emitting those GHGs.  The U.S. also participated in the creation of the Paris Agreement at COP 21 in December 2015 but has subsequently announced its intention to withdraw from the agreement. Although it is not possible at this time to predict how legislation or new regulations that may be adopted to address GHG emissions would impact our business, any such future laws and regulations could require us or our customers to incur increased operating costs, such as costs to purchase and operate emissions control systems, to acquire emission allowances or comply with new regulatory or reporting requirements.  Any such legislation or regulatory programs could also increase the cost of consuming, and thereby reduce demand for oil and natural gas, which could reduce our customers’ demand for our services.  Consequently, legislation and regulatory programs to reduce GHG emissions could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
Our operations as well as the operations of our customers are also subject to various laws and regulations addressing the management, disposal and releases of regulated substances. For example, in the U.S., the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended (RCRA) and comparable state statutes regulate the generation, storage, treatment, transportation, disposal and cleanup of hazardous and non-hazardous solid wastes. Under the auspices of the EPA, most states administer some or all of the provisions of RCRA, sometimes in conjunction with their own, more stringent requirements. Federal and state regulatory agencies can seek to impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for alleged non-compliance with RCRA and analogous state requirements. In the course of our operations, we generate some amounts of ordinary industrial wastes, such as paint wastes, waste solvents and waste oils that may be regulated as hazardous wastes. Moreover, the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, as amended (CERCLA), also known as the Superfund law, and comparable state laws impose liability, without regard to fault or legality of conduct, on classes of persons considered to be responsible for the release of a “hazardous substance” into the environment. These persons include the current and past owner or operator of the site where the release occurred and anyone who transported, disposed or arranged for the transport or disposal of a hazardous substance released at the site. Under CERCLA, such persons may be subject to joint and several strict liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies. CERCLA also authorizes the EPA and, in some instances, third parties to act in response to threats to the public health or the environment and to seek to recover from the responsible classes of persons the costs they incur. In addition, neighboring landowners and other third parties may file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment. We generate materials in the course of our operations that may qualify as hazardous substances. In the event of mismanagement or release of regulated substances upon properties where we conduct operations, we could become subject to liability and/or obligations under CERCLA, RCRA and/or analogous state laws. Under such laws, we could be required to undertake response or corrective measures, which could include removal of previously disposed substances and wastes, cleanup of contaminated property or performance of remedial operations to prevent future contamination.
The federal Endangered Species Act, as amended (ESA), restricts activities in the U.S. that may affect endangered or threatened species or their habitats. If endangered species are located in areas of the U.S. where our oil and natural gas exploration and production customers operate, such operations could be prohibited or delayed or expensive mitigation may be required. The designation of previously unprotected species as threatened or endangered in areas of the U.S. where our customers’ oil and natural gas exploration and production operations are conducted could cause them to incur increased costs arising from species protection measures or could result in limitations on their exploration and production activities, which could have an adverse impact on demand for our services.
Hydraulic fracturing is a process sometimes used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons from tight formations. The process involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into formations to fracture the surrounding rock and 
21

stimulate production. Hydraulic fracturing is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas regulators, but EPA has asserted federal regulatory authority pursuant to the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) over, and issued permitting guidance in February 2014 for, certain hydraulic fracturing activities involving the use of diesel fuels. In May 2014, EPA issued an advance notice of proposed rulemaking seeking comment on the development of regulations under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) to require companies to disclose information regarding the chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing. In March 2015, BLM issued a final rule that imposes requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities on federal and Indian lands, including new requirements relating to public disclosure, wellbore integrity and handling of flowback water; similar final rules were published in November 2016 for hydraulic fracturing activities on National Park and National Wildlife Refuge System lands. In June 2016, the U.S. District Court for the District of Wyoming struck down the BLM final rule, finding that BLM lacked authority to promulgate the rule, but this ruling was vacated on appeal in September 2017. Regardless, BLM rescinded this rule in December 2017. In January 24, 2018, California and a coalition of environmental groups each filed lawsuits in the Northern District of California to challenge BLM’s rescission of the 2015 rule. This litigation is pending. In addition, Congress has from time to time considered legislation to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing under the SDWA and to require disclosure of chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process. Some states and local governments also have adopted or are considering adopting regulations to restrict or ban hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances. Moreover, ongoing governmental reviews of the environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing by EPA and other agencies could lead to further regulation of hydraulic fracturing. For example, in December 2016, the EPA released its final report on the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources. The final report concluded that hydraulic fracturing activities can impact drinking water under some circumstances, including large volume spills and inadequate mechanical integrity of wells. While our operations are not directly affected by these actions, their impact on our oil and natural gas exploration and production customers could result in a decreased demand for the services that we provide.
