SBU reported revenue of $3.83 billion in 2019, $5.02 billion in 2018, and $4.51 billion in 2017. In 2019, we continued to ramp our 96-layer 3D NAND, enabling cost reductions as compared to our 64-layer 3D NAND. Our 3D NAND technologies utilize CMOS under the array ("CuA") technology to reduce die sizes and deliver improved performance when compared to competitive approaches.
 In 2019, we continued to make progress on our 128-layer 3D NAND, which uses replacement gate technology. Our first replacement gate node will be based on our 128-layer 3D NAND, but is expected to be used across a select set of products. With the high initial capital requirements of transitioning from floating gate to replacement gate technology, we don't expect meaningful cost reductions until 2021, when our second-generation replacement gate node is broadly deployed. We believe our replacement gate architecture will allow us to deliver performance improvements and provide an efficient path towards scaling multiple future generations of 3D NAND. Given a more limited initial deployment of our first node of replacement gate technology, we expect that our NAND bit supply growth in calendar 2020 will be below industry demand levels and plan to utilize our cost-effective floating gate inventory to meet growth in customer demand.
SSDs: SSD storage products incorporate NAND, a controller, and firmware and offer significant performance and features over HDDs, including a smaller form factor, faster read and write speeds, solid-state architecture, reliability, and lower power consumption. We offer SSD solutions utilizing our NAND technology to the enterprise and cloud, client, and consumer markets.
Enterprise and Cloud SSDs: SBU sales to the enterprise and cloud SSD markets in 2019 consisted primarily of our flagship SATA 5200 and 5100 series SSDs. In 2019, we continued offering our 5200 series SATA SSDs, which deliver best-in-class performance and capacity and achieved revenue crossover from our 5100 series SSDs. In 2019, we launched our 9300 Datacenter NVMe SSDs for enterprise and cloud markets. These 9300 NVMe SSDs feature industry-leading sequential write performance and latency, increased capacities, and nearly a 30% reduction in power consumption over the previous generation. Similar to trends in the memory market, the enterprise and cloud storage markets have been driven by intelligent edge devices capable of artificial intelligence, augmented reality, and other features that store, access, and analyze data in the cloud. Artificial intelligence servers require significantly higher SSD capacity and our 64-layer QLC NAND technology provides cost-optimized storage solutions with significantly lower total cost of ownership for read-intensive cloud workloads. By leveraging our advanced CuA NAND in enterprise and cloud SSDs, we deliver low-cost, high-density, high-performance storage solutions.
Client SSDs: SBU sales to the client SSD market in 2019 consisted primarily of our 1100 series 3D NAND SATA Client SSDs, which are targeted for leading personal computer OEMs as a replacement to HDDs. Our client SSDs, used in notebooks, desktops, workstations, and other consumer applications, deliver high performance, power efficiency, security, and capacity to our customers. In 2019, we introduced our next-generation 1300 series SATA SSD, which is one of the industry's first 96-layer TLC 3D NAND-based SSDs. Our 1300 series SATA SSD offers fast storage, device-level security, thermal management, and extended battery life for mobile, desktop, and workstation PCs.

Similar to the client SSD market, our consumer SSD solutions are replacing HDDs as end-users seek the higher performance, power savings, and reliability of our SSDs.
Components and Wafers: SBU sales of components in 2019 included NAND products and 3D XPoint technology. NAND products primarily consist of our 64-layer and 96-layer TLC and QLC NAND technology sold into storage markets. Sales of 3D XPoint technology includes wafers sold to Intel through our IMFT joint venture. 3D XPoint technology has higher chip density than DRAM, up to 1,000 times lower latency, and exponentially greater endurance than NAND. These specifications 
4

create a significant value opportunity for 3D XPoint technology in solutions between DRAM and NAND in the memory and storage hierarchy. We continue to develop products and solutions for 3D XPoint technology in the memory and storage hierarchies. Revenue from sales of 3D XPoint products are included within the business unit that most closely aligns to the memory or storage use of the end product. Trends in machine learning, big data analytics, and artificial intelligence are driving demand for the features offered by 3D XPoint technology.
Embedded Business Unit
EBU includes memory and storage products sold into automotive, industrial, and consumer markets and includes discrete and module DRAM, discrete NAND, managed NAND, and NOR. EBU reported revenue of $3.14 billion in 2019, $3.48 billion in 2018, and $2.70 billion in 2017. The embedded market has traditionally been characterized by long life-cycle DRAM and non-volatile products manufactured on mature process technologies. With strong trends of digitization, connectivity, and intelligence in every device, demand continues to grow for leading-edge products from newer process technologies emerging into the embedded market, which contributed to a fivefold increase in LPDDR4 bit-shipments to the automotive market in 2019 as compared to 2018. Our embedded products enable edge devices to store, connect, and share information in the growing internet of things ("IoT") and are utilized in a diverse set of applications in the automotive, industrial, and consumer markets.
Automotive: Our DDR3 DRAM, e.MMC managed NAND, and LPDDR4 DRAM automotive memory and storage products enable connected, large display infotainment systems and higher definition 4K displays and support improved voice and gesture control in automotive applications. Advancements in autonomous driving and advanced driver-assistance systems continue to increase the requirements for high-performing memory and storage products, with higher reliability requirements for leading-edge products. Our comprehensive and expanding portfolio of DRAM, NAND, and NOR solutions to the automotive market, as well as our extensive customer support network, enable us to maintain our strong leadership position in this market. In 2019, we introduced our UFS 2.1 managed NAND portfolio, based on our reliable automotive-grade 64-layer 3D TLC NAND, that features ultrafast boot-up time with up to three times the sequential read-performance of e.MMC-based products. We also introduced the industry's first 1TB TLC NVMe automotive SSD.

Industrial: Our industrial products, featuring DDR4 and DDR3 DRAM, SLC NAND, NAND MCPs, and NOR, enable applications in the growing industrial IoT market, including machine-to-machine communication, factory automation, transportation, surveillance, retail, and smart infrastructure. Our Authenta™ technology provides a new level of cyber protection for the lowest layers of IoT device software by leveraging existing flash memory sockets to enable IoT device health and identity without adding additional hardware components.

In 2019, we began offering high density 128GB to 1TB microSD card products for the consumer markets, leveraging our most advanced 96-layer 3D QLC NAND technology.
Manufacturing
In recent years, we have centralized certain key functions of our operations. These centers of excellence enable us to maximize yield and reduce cycle times by combining front and back-end manufacturing, product engineering, and specific technology development to most effectively transfer and ramp technology while driving efficient manufacturing. In 2019, we completed construction and began operating our new Singapore leading-edge 3D NAND clean room expansion. Our Singapore center of excellence enables us to transition to leading-edge technology nodes, which require substantially more clean room space than prior nodes, and maintain existing wafer capacity to meet market demand in our expanding storage business. In 2019, we also completed construction and opened our new Taiwan back-end assembly and test facility, which together with our existing Taiwan facilities, constitute our Taiwan DRAM center of excellence. The new facility enables us to integrate back-end processes into our manufacturing environment while benefitting from economies of scale.
5

We manufacture our products at our wholly-owned and joint venture facilities located in Taiwan, Singapore, Japan, the United States, China, and Malaysia and also utilize subcontractors to perform certain manufacturing processes. Nearly all our products are manufactured on 300mm wafers in facilities that generally operate 24 hours per day, seven days per week. Semiconductor manufacturing is extremely capital intensive, requiring large investments in sophisticated facilities and equipment. Our DRAM, NAND, 3D XPoint memory, and NOR products share a number of common manufacturing processes, enabling us to leverage much of our product and process technology and manufacturing infrastructure across these product lines.
Our process for manufacturing semiconductor products is complex and involves a number of precise steps, including wafer fabrication, assembly, and test. Efficient production of semiconductor products requires utilization of advanced semiconductor manufacturing techniques and effectively deploying those techniques across multiple facilities. The primary determinants of manufacturing cost are process line-width, 3D non-volatile layers, NAND cell levels, process complexity (including number of mask layers and fabrication steps) and manufacturing yield. Other factors include the cost and sophistication of manufacturing equipment, equipment utilization, process complexity, cost of raw materials, labor productivity, package type, cleanliness of our manufacturing environment, and utilization of subcontractors to perform certain manufacturing processes. We continuously enhance our production processes, increasing bits per wafer and transitioning to higher density products. As semiconductor memory technology has matured, the rate of increases in bits per wafer and product density has slowed. In 2019, we achieved bit shipment crossover to the 1Xnm process node for DRAM, significantly increased our production of the 1Ynm process node, and commenced volume production of 16Gb DDR4 products with 1Znm technology. In 2019, we also continued to ramp our 96-layer 3D NAND technology and make progress on our 128-layer 3D NAND, which uses replacement gate technology, that we expect to ramp in 2020.
Wafer fabrication occurs in a highly-controlled clean environment to minimize yield-limiting and quality contaminants. Despite stringent manufacturing controls, individual circuits may be nonfunctional or wafers may be scrapped due to equipment errors, minute impurities in materials, defects in photomasks, circuit design marginalities or defects, and airborne particle defects. Success of our manufacturing operations depends largely on minimizing defects to maximize yield of high-quality circuits. In this regard, we employ rigorous quality controls throughout the manufacturing, screening, and testing processes. We are able to recover certain devices by testing and grading them to their highest level of functionality.
Our products are manufactured and sold in both packaged and unpackaged bare die forms. Our packaged products include memory modules, SSDs, and managed NAND including MCPs and eMMCs. We assemble many products in-house and, in some cases, outsource assembly services for certain memory modules, SSDs, and MCPs. We test our products at various stages in the manufacturing process, conduct numerous quality control inspections throughout the entire production flow, and perform high temperature burn-in on finished products. In addition, we use our proprietary AMBYX™ line of intelligent test and burn-in systems to perform simultaneous circuit tests of semiconductor die during the burn-in process, capturing quality and reliability data and reducing testing time and cost.
In recent years, we have produced an increasingly broad portfolio of products and system solutions which enhances our ability to allocate resources to our most profitable products but also increases the complexity of our manufacturing and supply chain operations. Although our product lines generally use similar manufacturing processes, our costs can be affected by frequent conversions to new products, the allocation of manufacturing capacity to more complex, smaller-volume products, and the reallocation of manufacturing capacity across various product lines.
Arrangements with Intel
IMFT
Since 2006, we have owned 51% of IMFT, a joint venture between us and Intel. IMFT is governed by a Board of Managers, for which the number of managers appointed by each member varies based on the members' respective ownership interests. IMFT manufactures semiconductor products exclusively for its members under a long-term supply agreement at prices approximating cost. In 2018, IMFT discontinued production of NAND and subsequent to that time manufactured 3D XPoint memory. Members pay their proportionate share of fixed costs associated with IMFT's capacity.
In January 2019, we exercised our option to acquire Intel's interest in IMFT. Intel has set the closing date to occur on October 31, 2019. In connection with our acquisition, in the first quarter of 2020, we expect to pay Intel approximately $1.4 billion for Intel's interest in IMFT as well as IMFT member debt owed to Intel.
6

Until we complete our acquisition of Intel's noncontrolling interest in IMFT, the members have rights and obligations to the capacity of IMFT in proportion to their investment, including member debt financing. Any capital contribution or member debt financing results in a proportionate adjustment to the sharing of output on an eight-month lag. Intel provided member debt financing of $1.01 billion to IMFT in 2018 and IMFT repaid $316 million to Intel in 2019. As a result, as of August 29, 2019, current debt included $693 million of IMFT member debt.
R&D Arrangements
We have had agreements to jointly develop NAND and 3D XPoint technologies with Intel. In 2018, we and Intel agreed to independently develop subsequent generations of 3D NAND. We substantially completed our NAND development cost-sharing arrangement with Intel in the third quarter of 2019. In 2018, we also announced that we and Intel would no longer jointly develop 3D XPoint technology beyond the second generation. We substantially completed this cost-sharing arrangement in the first quarter of 2020.
Supply Chain, Materials, and Use of Third-Party Service Providers
Our supply chain and operations are dependent on the availability of materials that meet exacting standards and also on the use of third parties to provide us with components and services. We generally have multiple sources of supply for our materials and services; however, only a limited number of suppliers are capable of delivering certain materials and services that meet our standards. In some cases, materials, components, or services are provided by a single supplier. Various factors could reduce the availability of materials or components such as chemicals, silicon wafers, gases, photoresist, controllers, substrates, lead frames, printed circuit boards, targets, and reticle glass blanks. Shortages or increases in lead times may occur from time to time in the future. Our manufacturing processes are also dependent on our relationships with third-party manufacturers of controllers used in a number of our products and with outsourced semiconductor assembly and test providers, contract manufacturers, logistic carriers, and other service providers. We monitor and manage supply-chain activities to mitigate risks associated with raw materials and service providers. Certain materials are primarily available in certain countries, including rare earth elements, minerals, and metals available primarily from China. Trade disputes or other political or economic conditions may limit our availability to obtain such materials. Although these rare earth and other materials are generally available from multiple suppliers, China is the predominant producer of certain of these materials. In addition, we and/or our suppliers and service providers are, and may continue to be, affected by tariffs, embargoes or other trade restrictions, as well as laws and regulations enacted in response to concerns regarding climate change, conflict minerals, and responsible sourcing practices, which can limit the supply of our materials and/or increase the cost.
Marketing and Customers
We continue to transform how we interact with our customers from transactional opportunistic sales of standardized memory components to collaborative relationships where we work with our customers to understand their unique opportunities and challenges. Many of our customers require thorough review or qualification of our products. By engaging with our customers early in the product life-cycle to identify and design features and performance characteristics into our products, we are able to manufacture products that anticipate and address their changing needs. Collaborating with our customers on their design needs in a changing end market allows us to differentiate our memory and storage solutions, which provides greater value to our customers.
Our semiconductor memory and storage products are offered under our Micron, Crucial, and Ballistix brand names and through private labels. We market our semiconductor memory and storage products primarily through our own direct sales force and maintain sales or representative offices in our primary markets around the world. We sell our Crucial-branded products through a web-based customer direct sales channel as well as through channel and distribution partners. Our products are also offered through independent sales representatives, distributors, and retailers. Our independent sales representatives obtain orders subject to final acceptance by us, and we make shipments against the orders directly to our customers. Our distributors carry our products in inventory and typically sell a variety of other semiconductor products, including competitors' products. We maintain inventory at locations in close proximity to certain key customers to facilitate rapid delivery of products.
In each of the last three years, approximately one-half of our total net sales were to our top ten customers. For other information regarding our concentrations and customers, see "Part II – Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Certain Concentrations."

Backlog
Because of volatile industry conditions, customers are generally reluctant to enter into long-term, fixed-price contracts. Accordingly, new order volumes for our memory and storage products may fluctuate significantly. We typically accept orders with acknowledgment that the terms may be adjusted to reflect market conditions at the time of shipment. For these reasons, we do not believe that our order backlog as of any particular date is a reliable indicator of actual sales for any succeeding period.
Product Warranty
Because the design and manufacturing process for semiconductor products is highly complex, it is possible that we may produce products that do not comply with applicable specifications, contain defects, or are otherwise incompatible with end uses. In accordance with industry practice, we generally provide a limited warranty that our products comply with applicable specifications existing at the time of delivery and will operate to those specifications during a stated warranty period. Under our standard terms and conditions of sale, liability for certain failures of product during a stated warranty period is usually limited to repair or replacement of defective items or return of, or a credit with respect to, amounts paid for such items. Under certain circumstances, we provide more extensive limited warranty coverage than that provided under our standard terms and conditions.
Competition
We face intense competition in the semiconductor memory and storage markets from a number of companies, including Intel; Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd.; SK Hynix Inc.; Toshiba Memory Corporation; and Western Digital Corporation. Some of our competitors are large corporations or conglomerates that may have greater resources to invest in technology, capitalize on growth opportunities, and withstand downturns in the semiconductor markets in which we compete. Consolidation of industry competitors could put us at a competitive disadvantage. Our competitors generally seek to increase wafer capacity, improve yields, and reduce die size in their product designs which may result in significant increases in worldwide supply and downward pressure on prices. Increases in worldwide supply of semiconductor memory and storage also result from fabrication capacity expansions, either by way of new facilities, increased capacity utilization, or reallocation of other semiconductor production to semiconductor memory and storage production. Our competitors may increase capital expenditures resulting in future increases in worldwide supply. We and some of our competitors have plans to ramp, or are constructing or ramping, production at new fabrication facilities. If competitors are more successful at developing or implementing new product or process technology, their products could have cost or performance advantages. Certain of our memory and storage products are manufactured to industry standard specifications and, as such, have similar performance characteristics to those of our competitors. For these products, the principal competitive factors are generally price and performance characteristics including operating speed, power consumption, reliability, compatibility, size, and form factors.
Some governments have provided, and may continue to provide, significant assistance, financial or otherwise, to some of our competitors or to new entrants and may intervene in support of national industries and/or competitors. In particular, we face the threat of increasing competition as a result of significant investment in the semiconductor industry by the Chinese government and various state-owned or affiliated entities that is intended to advance China's stated national policy objectives. In addition, the Chinese government may restrict us from participating in the China market or may prevent us from competing effectively with Chinese companies. Some of our competitors may use aggressive pricing to obtain market share or take business of our key customers.

Research and Development
Our R&D efforts are focused primarily on development of product and process technology that enables continuous improvement to cost structures and performance enhancements for our future products. We are also focused on developing new fundamentally different memory structures, materials, and packages designed to facilitate our transition to next generation products. Additional R&D efforts focus on the enablement of advanced computing, storage, and mobile memory architectures and the investigation of new opportunities that leverage our core semiconductor expertise. Product design and development efforts include high-density DDR4, DDR5, LPDDR4, LPDDR5, and advanced graphics DRAM; 3D NAND (including 96-layer and 128-layer TLC and QLC technologies); 3D XPoint technology; HBM technology; SSDs (including firmware and controllers); managed NAND; specialty memory; and other memory technologies and systems.
To compete in the semiconductor memory and storage markets, we must continue to develop technologically advanced products and processes. The continued evolution of our semiconductor product offerings is necessary to meet expected market demand for memory and storage products and solutions. Our process, design, and package development efforts occur at multiple locations across the world. Our largest R&D center is located in Boise, Idaho and other product and process development centers are located in Japan, China, Germany, Italy, India, Singapore, Taiwan, and other sites in the United States.
R&D expenses vary with the number of development wafers processed and end-product solutions developed, the cost of advanced equipment dedicated to new product and process development, and personnel costs. Because of the lead times necessary to manufacture our products, we typically begin to process wafers before completion of performance and reliability testing. Development of a product is deemed complete when it is qualified through reviews and tests for performance and reliability. As a result, R&D expenses can vary significantly depending on the timing of product qualification.
We have had agreements to share the cost of certain product and process development activities under development agreements with partners, including agreements with Intel to jointly develop NAND and 3D XPoint technologies. Amounts received from our development partners for reimbursements under our cost-sharing arrangements are reflected as reductions of R&D expenses. We substantially completed our NAND technology cost-sharing arrangement with Intel in the third quarter of 2019 and our 3D XPoint arrangement in the first quarter of 2020.
Patents and Licenses
We are a recognized leader in per capita and quality of patents issued. As of August 29, 2019, we owned approximately 13,750 active U.S. patents and 5,500 active foreign patents. In addition, we have thousands of U.S. and foreign patent applications pending. Our patents have various terms expiring through 2039.
From time to time, we sell and/or license our technology to other parties and continue to pursue opportunities to monetize our investments in our intellectual property through partnering and other arrangements. We have also jointly developed memory and storage product and process technology with third parties on a limited basis.
We have a number of patent and intellectual property license agreements and have, from time to time, licensed or sold our intellectual property to third parties. Some of these license agreements require us to make one-time or periodic payments while others have resulted in us receiving payments. We may need to obtain additional licenses or renew existing license agreements in the future, and we may enter into additional sales or licenses of intellectual property and partnering arrangements. We are unable to predict whether these license agreements can be obtained or renewed on terms acceptable to us.
Employees
As of August 29, 2019, we had approximately 37,000 employees.

Environmental Compliance
We approach environmental stewardship and sustainability proactively to ensure we meet all government regulations regarding use of raw materials, discharges, emissions, and wastes from our manufacturing processes. Compliance with the law and other compliance obligations is considered a minimum environmental expectation at Micron. Our wafer fabrication facilities continued to conform to the requirements of the International Organization for Standardization ("ISO") 14001 environmental management systems standard to ensure we are continuously improving our performance. As part of the ISO 14001 framework, we have established a global environmental policy and meet requirements in terms of environmental aspects evaluation and control, compliance obligations, commitment, training, communication, control of documented information, operational control, emergency preparedness and response, and management review. While we have not experienced any material adverse effects to our operations from environmental regulations, changes in regulations could necessitate additional capital expenditures, modification of our operations, or other compliance actions.
