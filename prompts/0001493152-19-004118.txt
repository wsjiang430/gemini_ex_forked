The organizational structure of our companies is as follows:
 


Our Markets
 
The global education industry is undergoing a significant transition, as primary and secondary school districts, colleges and universities, as well as governments, corporations and individuals around the world are increasingly recognizing the importance of using technology to more effectively provide information to educate students and other users. In the United States, which is our primary market, we sell and distribute interactive educational products for K-12 to both public and private schools. The K-12 education sector represents one of the largest industry segments. The sector is comprised of approximately 15,600 public school districts across the 50 states and 132,000 public and private elementary and secondary schools. In addition to its size, the U.S. K-12 education market is highly decentralized and is characterized by complex content adoption processes. We believe this market structure underscores the importance of scale and industry relationships and the need for broad, diverse coverage across states, districts and schools. Even while we believe certain initiatives in the education sector, such as the Common Core State Standards, a set of shared math and literacy standards benchmarked to international standards, have increased standardization in K-12 education content, we believe significant state standard specific customization still exists, and we believe the need to address customization provides an ongoing need for companies in the sector to maintain relationships with individual state and district policymakers and expertise in state-varying academic standards.
 
According to “All Global Market Education & Learning”, an industry publication, the market for hardware products is growing due to increases in the use of interactive whiteboards and simulation-based learning hardware. Educational institutions have become more receptive to the implementation of hi-tech learning tools. The advent of technology in the classroom has enabled multi-modal training and varying curricula. In general, technology based tools help develop student performance when integrated with the curriculum. The constant progression of technology in education has helped educators to create classroom experiences that are interactive, developed and collaborative.

Our Opportunity
 
We believe that our patented products and software portfolios and the software and products we intend to develop either alone or in collaboration with other technology companies positions us to be a leading manufacturer and provider of interactive educational products in the global educational and learning market. We believe that increased consumer spending driven by the close connection between levels of educational attainment, evolving standards in curriculum, personal career prospects and economic growth will increase the demand for our interactive educational products. Some of the factors that we believe will impact our opportunity include:
 
Growth in U.S. K-12 Market Expenditures
 
 Significant resources are being devoted to primary and secondary education, both in the United States and abroad. As set forth in the Executive Office of the President, Council of Economic Advisers report, U.S. education expenditure has been estimated at approximately $1.3 trillion, with K-12 education accounting for close to half ($625 billion) of this spending. Global spending is roughly triple U.S. spending for K-12 education.
 
While the market has historically grown above the pace of inflation, averaging 7.2% growth annually since 1969, as expenditures by school districts and educational institutions are largely dependent upon state and local funding, the world-wide economic recession caused many states and school districts to defer spending on educational materials, which materially and adversely affected our historical revenues as well as those of many of our competitors. However, expenditures and growth in the U.S. K-12 market for educational content and services now appears to be rebounding in the wake of the U.S. economic recovery. Although, the economic recovery has been slower than anticipated, and there is no assurance that any further improvement will be significant, nonetheless, states such as Florida, California and Texas were all scheduled to adopt interactive educational materials for certain subjects, including reading and math, by 2016.
 
Increasing Focus on Accountability and the Quality of Student Education
 
U.S. K-12 education has come under significant political scrutiny in recent years, with findings that American students rank far behind other global leaders in international tests of literacy, math and science, with the resulting conclusion that the current state of U.S. education severely impairs the United States’ economic, military and diplomatic security as well as broader components of America’s global leadership.
 
Trends in Tech-Savvy Education
 
While industries from manufacturing to health care have adopted technology to improve their results, according to Stanford Business School, in its Trends in Tech-Savvy Education, the education field remains heavily reliant on “chalk and talk” instruction conducted in traditional settings; however, that is changing as schools and colleges adopt virtual classrooms, data analysis, online games, highly customized coursework, and other cutting-edge tools to help students learn.
 
New Technologies
 
The delivery of digital education content is also driving a substantial shift in the education market. In addition to whiteboards, interactive projectors and interactive flat panels, other technologies are being adapted for educational uses on the Internet, mobile devices and through cloud-computing, which permits the sharing of digital files and programs among multiple computers or other devices at the same time through a virtual network. We intend to be a leader in the development and implementation of these additional technologies to create effective digital learning environments.
 
Demand for Interactive Projectors is on the Rise
 
As a complete system, interactive projectors are considerably less expensive than interactive whiteboards or interactive flat panel displays, placing them at a distinct advantage in price sensitive markets. According to FutureSource, an industry publication, “sales of interactive projectors are expected to grow steadily from 2014 to 2017 with a CAGR at 10.3% worldwide.”
 
International Catalysts Driving Adoption of Learning Technology
 
According to Ambient Insights 2012 Snapshot of the Worldwide and US Academic Digital Learning Market, substantial growth in revenues for e-learning products in the academic market segment are anticipated throughout the world due to several convergent catalysts, including population demographics such as significant growth in numbers of 15-17 year old students and women in education in emerging markets; government-funded education policies mandating country-wide deployment of digital learning infrastructures; large scale digitization efforts in government and academic markets; significant increases in the amount of digital learning content; migration to digital formats by major educational publishers and content providers; mass purchases of personal learning devices and strong demand for learning platforms, content and technology services; and rapid growth of part-time and fulltime online student enrollments.

Growth in the E-learning Market
 
According to the “E-learning Market – Global Outlook and Forecast 2018-2023”
 
The introduction of technology-enabled learning that helps organizations train human resource is driving the growth of the global e-learning market. These training modules offer continuous and effective learning at an optimal cost and provide customized course content that meets the specific requirements of end-users. The advent of cloud infrastructure, peer-to-peer problem solving, and open content creation will help to expand business opportunities for service providers in the global e-learning market.
 
Vendors are also focusing on offering choices on the course content at competitive prices to gain the share in the global e-learning market. The exponential growth in the number of smartphone users and internet connectivity across emerging markets is driving the e-learning market in these regions. The introduction of cloud-based learning and AR/VR mobile-based learning is likely to revolutionize the e-learning market during the forecast period.
 
Major vendors are introducing technology-enabled tools that can facilitate the user engagement, motivate learners, and help in collaborations, thereby increasing the market share and attracting new consumers to the market. The growing popularity of blended learning that enhances the efficiency of learners will drive the growth of the e-learning market. The e-learning market is expected to generate revenue of $65.41 billion by 2023, growing at a CAGR of 7.07% during the forecast period.
 
Demand for Interactive Projectors is on the Rise
 
As a complete system, interactive projectors are considerably less expensive than interactive whiteboards or interactive flat panel displays, placing them at a distinct advantage in price sensitive markets. According to FutureSource, an industry publication, “sales of interactive projectors are expected to grow steadily from 2014 to 2017 with a CAGR at 10.3% worldwide.” 
 
Handheld Device Adoption
 
Handheld devices, including smartphones, tablets, e-readers and digital video technologies, are now fundamental to the way students communicate. A 2010 FCC survey provides evidence that the rates of handheld use will increase dramatically. It reported that while 50% of respondents currently use handhelds for administrative purposes, 14% of schools and 24% of districts use such devices for academic or educational purposes. Furthermore, 45% of respondents plan to start using such devices for academic and educational purposes within the next 2 to 3 years. The survey stated that, “The use of digital video technologies to support curriculum is becoming increasingly popular as a way to improve student engagement.”
Natural User Interfaces (NUIs)
 
Tablets and the new class of “smart TVs” are part of a growing list of other devices built with natural user interfaces that accept input in the form of taps, swipes, and other ways of touching; hand and arm motions; body movement; and increasingly, natural language. Natural user interfaces allow users to engage in virtual activities with movements similar to what they would use in the real world, manipulating content intuitively. The idea of being able to have a completely natural interaction with a device is not new, but neither has its full potential been realized. For example, medical students increasingly rely on simulators employing natural user interfaces to practice precise manipulations, such as catheter insertions, that would be far less productive if they had to try to simulate sensitive movements with a mouse and keyboard. NUIs make devices seem easier to use and more accessible, and interactions are far more intuitive, which promotes exploration and engagement.

ProColor’s built-in speakers add room filling sound to the display’s vivid colors. The interactive LED panels feature anti-glare safety glass with optical coatings that are highly scratch resistant, improve viewing angles, and reduce ambient light interference.
Boxlight ProColor Interactive Projectors
 
We offer a suite of patented, award-winning interactive projectors with a wide variety of features and specifications to suit the varying needs of instructors, teachers and presenters around the world. With an interactive projector any wall, whiteboard or other flat surface can become an interactive surface and enable computer control. A user can utilize a pen stylus or finger as a mouse or to write or draw images displayed on the screen. As with interactive whiteboards, the interactive projector accommodates multiple users simultaneously. Images that have been created through the projectors can be saved as computer files. Except for the ProjectorWrite 12 series, all the Boxlight Group interactive projectors use LCD or DLP technology.
 
We offer interactive projectors using lamp and laser illumination technologies. Each ultra-short throw model is available with pen-based interactivity using infra-red emitting pens or touch-based technology using an emitter that generates a laser curtain over the entire surface of an associated whiteboard.
 
The pen versions of these interactive projectors can display images as large as 130” diagonally in 16:10 aspect ratio. The touch-based versions can display images as large as 100” in the same 16:10 aspect ratio. All models support up to ten simultaneous interactions meaning multiple students can simultaneously work. The projectors come with high quality audio and appropriate wall mounting hardware.
 
The ProjectoWrite 9 series provides wired interactivity and features 60 frames per second. These projectors have built-in storage of up to 1.5 GB for on-the-go display; a USB or EZ WiFi LAN connection from the PC, Mac or mobile device to the interactive projector is required for interactivity with the projected images. The ProjectoWrite 9 interactive projector series allows for a maximum of ten interactive pens working simultaneously. Utilizing its patented embedded interactive CMOS camera at 60 frames per second, response time is less than 12 minutes, and accuracy is within 3 pixels.
 
The ProjectoWrite 12 series is first in the Boxlight Group’s line of patented finger-touch interactive projectors to offer a driverless installation. With the addition of a laser module, a moderator or student can use a finger, or any solid object, to interact and control the computer at the projected image. With 10-point touch, a user can capitalize on the new touch features of Microsoft Windows 10, emulating a tablet computer.
 
Boxlight’s MimioTeach Interactive Whiteboard
 
Boxlight’s MimioTeach is one of our best known and longest-lived products. Hundreds of thousands of MimioTeach interactive whiteboards and its predecessor models are used in classrooms around the world. MimioTeach can turn any whiteboard (retrofit) into an interactive whiteboard in as little as 30 seconds. This portable product fits into a tote bag with room for a small desktop projector, which is attractive to teachers who move from classroom to classroom. For schools where “change is our normal,” MimioTeach eliminates the high cost of moving fixed-mount implementations.
ProColor Display 490 Interactive Touch Table
 
The ProColor Display 490 Interactive Touch Table enables up to four students to work collaboratively or individually on a horizontal surface, which is particularly well-suited to younger students or those with motor skill limitations.

Boxlight’s MimioBoard Touch interactive whiteboards
 
Boxlight’s Interactive Touch Boards are available in 78” 4:3 aspect ratio and 87” 16:10 aspect ratio. These boards provide sophisticated interactivity with any projector because the touch interactivity is built into the board. Unlike many competitive products, Boxlight’s touch boards are suited for use with dry erase markers. Many competitive products advise against using dry erase markers because their boards stain. Boxlight’s touch boards use a porcelain-on-steel surface for durability and dry erase compatibility. The Boxlight Touch Boards are also much lighter weight than most competitive products which results in faster, easier and a lower cost installation process.
 
MimioStudio Interactive Instructional Software
 
MimioStudio Interactive Instructional Software enables the creation, editing, and presentation of interactive instructional lessons and activities. These lessons and activities can be presented and managed from the front of the classroom using any of Boxlight’s front of classroom display systems including MimioTeach + our non-interactive projectors, ProColor Interactive LED panels, MimioBoard Touch + our non-interactive projectors, MimioFrame + our non-interactive projectors or ProjectoWrite “P” Series interactive projectors in either pen or touch controlled versions. MimioStudio can also be operated using MimioPad as a full-featured remote control or a mobile device such as an iPad or tablet which includes a display screen that fully replicates the front-of-classroom display generated by MimioStudio. Operation with a mobile device is enabled via the three-user license for MimioMobile, see next, provided with the MimioStudio license that accompanies all front-of-classroom devices from Mimio.
 
MimioMobile Collaboration and Assessment Application
 
The introduction of MimioMobile, a software accessory for MimioStudio, in 2014 introduced a new era of fully interactive student activities that are able to be directly and immediately displayed on the front-of-classroom interactive displays through MimioStudio.
 
MimioMobile allows fully interactive activities to be pushed to student classroom devices. The students can manipulate objects within the activities, annotate “on top” of them, and even create completely new content on their own handheld devices. MimioMobile also enables assessment using the mobile devices. The teacher can create multiple choice, true\false, yes\no, and text entry assessment questions. The students can respond at their own speed and their answers are stored within MimioStudio from which the teacher can display graphs showing student results. This “continuous assessment” allows formative assessment that can help guide the teacher as to whether to re-teach the material if understanding is low or move forward in the lesson. We believe that this interactive and student dependent instructional model can dramatically enhance student outcomes.
 
Boxlight Front-of-Classroom Interactive Displays
 
Boxlight offers the broadest line of interactive displays, each of which provides large image size and interactive technology that complements the capabilities of MimioStudio and MimioMobile.
 
Boxlight’s MimioSpace ultra-wide 135” TouchBoard System
 
MimioSpace combines an eleven-foot-wide 32-touch interactive whiteboard with a 16:6 aspect ratio ultra-wide projector to produce an extraordinary combination of digital classroom technology and the extremely wide working surface of classical blackboard-based classrooms.
 

Peripherals and accessories
 
We offer a line of peripherals and accessories, including amplified speaker systems, mobile carts, installation accessories and adjustable wall-mount accessories that complement our entire line of interactive projectors, LED flat panels and standard projectors. The height and tilt adjustable DeskBoard mobile cart, which won the Best of ISTE in June 2014 for Best Hardware product, can be used as an interactive screen or interactive desktop with the ProjectoWrite 8 ultra-short throw interactive projectors.

Boxlight’s MimioVote Student Assessment System
 
Boxlight’s MimioVote is a handheld “clicker” that enables student assessment with essentially zero training. MimioVote is so simple it genuinely qualifies as intuitive, an elusive and often proclaimed attribute that is actually merited by MimioVote. MimioVote fully integrates into the MimioMobile environment and offers everything from attendance to fully immersive and on-the-fly student assessment. The MimioVote was specifically designed to survive the rigors of even kindergarten and elementary classrooms where being dropped, stepped on, and kicked are all part of a normal day. The handset’s non-slip coating helps keep it from sliding off desktops or out of little hands. Should they take “flight”, the rugged construction keeps them working.
 
Boxlight’s MimioPad wireless pen tablet
 
MimioPad is a lightweight, rechargeable, wireless tablet used as a remote control for the MimioStudio running on a teacher’s Windows, Mac, or Linux computer. MimioPad enables the teacher to roam the classroom which significantly aids classroom management. MimioPad is a classroom management tool which can be handed off to enable a student to be part of the interactive experience – all without leaving their seat to go to the front of the room.
 
Boxlight’s MimioView document camera
 
Boxlight’s MimioView is a document camera that is integrated with MimioStudio to make the combination easy to use with a single cable connection that carries power, video, and control. MimioView is fully integrated into our MimioStudio software solution and is controlled through MimioStudio’s applications menu.

Competition
 
The interactive education industry is highly competitive and characterized by frequent product introductions and rapid technological advances that have substantially increased the capabilities and use of interactive projectors and interactive whiteboards. Interactive whiteboards, since first introduced, have evolved from a high-cost technology that involves multiple components, requiring professional installers, to a one-piece technology that is available at increasingly reduced price points and affords simple installations. With lowered technology entry barriers, we face heated competition from other interactive whiteboard developers, manufacturers and distributors. We compete with other developers, manufacturers and distributors of interactive projectors and personal computer technologies, tablets, television screens, smart phones, such as Smart Technologies, Promethean, ViewSonic, Dell Computers, Samsung, Panasonic and ClearTouch.

However, the market presents new opportunities in responding to demands to replace outdated and failing interactive whiteboards with more affordable and simpler solution interactive whiteboards. Our ability to integrate our technologies and remain innovative and develop new technologies desired by our current and potential new contract manufacturing customers will determine our ability to grow our contract manufacturing divisions. In addition, we have begun to see expansion in the market to sales of complementary products that work in conjunction with the interactive technology, including software, audio solutions, data capture, and tablets.
