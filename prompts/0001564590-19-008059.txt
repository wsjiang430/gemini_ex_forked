Item 1. Business. 
General 
 Byline Bancorp, Inc., headquartered in Chicago, Illinois, is a bank holding company and we conduct all our business activities through our subsidiary, Byline Bank, a full service commercial bank, and Byline Bank’s subsidiaries. The words “the Company,” “we,” “Byline,” “our” and “us” refer to Byline Bancorp, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, unless we indicate otherwise.
 Through Byline Bank, we offer a broad range of banking products and services to small and medium sized businesses, commercial real estate and financial sponsors and to consumers who generally live or work near our branches. In addition to our traditional commercial banking business, we provide small ticket equipment leasing solutions through Byline Financial Group, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Byline Bank, headquartered in Bannockburn, Illinois with sales offices in Illinois and New York, and sales representatives in Illinois, Michigan, New Jersey, and New York. Following our acquisition of Ridgestone Financial Services, Inc. (“Ridgestone”) in October 2016, we also participate in U.S. government guaranteed lending programs and originate U.S. government guaranteed loans. Byline Bank was the fifth most active originator of SBA loans in the country and the most active SBA lender in Illinois and Wisconsin, as reported by the SBA for the quarter ended December 31, 2018. Following our acquisition of First Evanston Bancorp, Inc. (“First Evanston”) and its subsidiary bank, First Bank & Trust, at the end of May 2018, we also provide trust and wealth management services to our customers. As of December 31, 2018, we had consolidated total assets of $4.9 billion, total gross loans and leases outstanding of $3.5 billion, total deposits of $3.7 billion, and total stockholders’ equity of $650.7 million.
 Ridgestone acquisition
 On October 14, 2016, we completed the acquisition of Ridgestone Financial Services, Inc., under the terms of a definitive merger agreement. As of the acquisition date, Ridgestone had $447.4 million in assets, including $347.3 million of loans, $14.7 million of loans held for sale, $27.2 million of securities, $21.5 million of servicing assets and total deposits of $358.7 million. Ridgestone’s loan portfolio was primarily comprised of the retained unguaranteed portion of U.S. government guaranteed loans as a participant in the SBA and USDA (together, “U.S. government guaranteed”) lending programs.
 First Evanston acquisition
 On May 31, 2018, we completed the acquisition of First Evanston, under the terms of a definitive merger agreement. As a result of the merger, First Evanston’s wholly owned bank subsidiary, First Bank & Trust, was merged with and into Byline Bank. As of the acquisition date, First Evanston had $1.1 billion in assets, including $932.4 million of loans, $128.1 million of securities, and total deposits of $1.0 billion.
 At the effective time of the merger (the “Effective Time”), each share of First Evanston’s common stock (the “First Evanston Common Stock”) was converted into the right to receive: (1) 3.994 shares of Byline’s common stock, and (2) an amount in cash equal to $27.0 million divided by the number of outstanding shares of First Evanston Common Stock as of the closing date, with cash paid in lieu of any fractional shares. Options to acquire First Evanston Common Stock that were outstanding at the Effective Time were converted into options of substantially equivalent value to acquire Byline common stock. In the aggregate, Byline paid $27.0 million in cash and issued 6,682,850 shares of its common stock in respect of the outstanding shares of First Evanston Common Stock. The value of the total merger consideration at closing was approximately $179.1 million.
 Oak Park River Forest acquisition
 On October 17, 2018, we entered a definitive merger agreement with Oak Park River Forest Bankshares, Inc. (“Oak Park River Forest”), the parent company of Community Bank of Oak Park River Forest, pursuant to which we will acquire Oak Park River Forest through the merger of Oak Park River Forest with and into us, followed immediately by the merger of Community Bank of Oak Park River Forest with and into Byline Bank. As of December 31, 2018, Oak Park River Forest had $327.6 million in assets, including $31.2 million of securities, $269.5 million of loans, $2.5 million of loans held for sale, and $287.1 million of total deposits. Completion of the transaction is subject to the approval of Oak Park River Forest’s stockholders, and other customary closing conditions. We expect the acquisition to close during the first half of 2019.
 Strategic branch consolidation
 We continually perform strategic reviews of our existing banking footprint. With technology improvements and changes to customers’ banking preferences, we examine branch growth potential, customer usage, branch profitability, services provided, markets served and proximity to other locations with a goal of minimizing customer impact and deposit runoff. Since our recapitalization which occurred in June 2013, our branch network has been reduced from 88 to 58, including eight branches added through the First Evanston acquisition. During 2018, we consolidated six branches and two other facilities within our current network that had a minimal impact on our customer service levels, convenience, and business development capabilities. We will continue to strategically evaluate our locations based on our growth and profitability standards.

We plan to continue to leverage our seasoned management team, the attractive market opportunity in the Chicago metropolitan area, our diversified lending approach and our track record of successfully integrating acquisitions to drive future growth. We believe that having a deep understanding of customers, longstanding ties to the communities in which we operate, a strong market position and exceptional employees allows us to provide the attention, responsiveness and customized service our clients seek while offering a diverse range of products to serve a variety of needs.
 Segments
 We have one reportable segment. Our chief operating decision maker, our Chief Executive Officer, evaluates the operations of the Company using consolidated information for purposes of allocating resources and assessing performance.
Our Products and Services
 We are a full service, commercial bank offering a broad range of deposit products and lending services to small and medium sized businesses, commercial real estate and financial sponsors, and consumers around our 57 branch locations in the Chicago metropolitan area and one branch in Brookfield, Wisconsin. The products and services we offer are described below.
 Retail deposits
 We offer customers traditional retail deposit products through our branch network and the ability to access their accounts through online and mobile banking platforms. The wide variety of deposit products we offer include non-interest-bearing accounts, money market demand accounts, savings accounts, interest-bearing checking accounts and time deposits with maturities ranging from seven days to five years. We consider our core deposits, defined as all deposits except for time deposits exceeding $100,000, to be our primary and most valuable funding source, and as of December 31, 2018, core deposits represented 81.7% of our total deposits. We strive to retain an attractive deposit mix from both large and small customers as well as a broad market reach, which has resulted in our top 50 customers accounting for only 9.7% of all deposits, as of December 31, 2018. Our bankers are incentivized to acquire and maintain quality core deposits as we depend on these deposits to fund the majority of our loans and leases. Our incentive compensation plans are designed so that those arrangements appropriately balance risk and financial rewards, are compatible with effective risk management practices and are supported by effective governance. We believe that our long standing and high quality relationships with our depositors who provide us with long term funding are due to the convenience and dedicated service we offer. We leverage our expansive branch locations and deep network of customer relationships in the Chicago metropolitan area to provide both low cost funding sources for our lending business and deposit related fee income. We had $3.7 billion of deposits at December 31, 2018, and our average cost of deposits was 0.60% for the year ended December 31, 2018.
 Commercial banking
 Commercial banking is a fundamental component of our business. We define commercial banking as lending to small and medium sized businesses, real estate and financial sponsors. We offer a comprehensive range of commercial loan, deposit and cash management products. Our primary commercial lending groups are described below:
 Commercial & industrial.  Our commercial and industrial (“C&I”) group focuses on small and lower middle market businesses with up to $50 million of annual revenue and seek to establish long term relationships. We believe this customer segment is underserved by larger institutions that do not focus on this space, as well as by smaller institutions that lack product sophistication and capabilities. We offer a broad range of lending products including term loans, revolving lines of credit, and cash management products and services. As of December 31, 2018, the C&I group managed a portfolio of $1.4 billion in loans outstanding.
 Commercial real estate.  Our commercial real estate (“CRE”) business focuses on experienced real estate professionals with long track records of performance and access to ample equity capital sources. We believe our specialized expertise and efficient decision making process differentiate us from our competitors. We offer fixed and floating rate term loans, construction financing and revolving lines of credit with a wide range of term options. Our CRE portfolio is broadly diversified by property type including loans secured by multi family, retail, industrial and office properties. As of December 31, 2018, the CRE group had $538.2 million in loans outstanding.
 Sponsor finance.  Our sponsor finance group provides senior secured financing solutions to private equity backed lower middle market companies throughout the U.S. with earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization generally between $2.0 million and $10.0 million. We support the acquisition, recapitalization and growth investment efforts of private equity firms operating in the lower middle market, and we believe our expertise in this niche is unique for a bank our size. As of December 31, 2018, we had $217.7 million in sponsor finance loans outstanding.
 Syndications.  From time to time, our syndications group seeks to deploy excess liquidity by opportunistically participating in syndicated loans, acquiring whole loans, or purchasing participations from lead banks that have existing relationships with well capitalized and experienced sponsors. We employed this strategy extensively following our recapitalization by leveraging our relationships with local, regional and national lenders as we developed our own lending capabilities and had excess liquidity. Now, 
 5

with developed lending capabilities, our participation in syndications has decreased and represents a smaller piece of our portfolio. The syndications group targets transactions in the home mortgage, commercial real estate and C&I categories that provide attractive risk/reward characteristics, and we continue to maintain the ability to sell loan positions to manage credit and specific customer and industry concentrations. As of December 31, 2018, the group had $390.8 million in loan syndications outstanding.
 Commercial deposits and cash management.  We also support our business clients with a variety of deposit and cash management products, along with business transaction accounts. Our comprehensive suite of products includes treasury services, information reporting, fraud management, cash collection and interest rate derivative products. We believe these tailored products allow us to provide a robust service offering to our clients and to support their day to day funding and risk management needs. These services are provided through multiple points of contact including branch, online and mobile interfaces.
 Small Business Capital
 We launched our U.S. government guaranteed lending business with the acquisition of Ridgestone in October 2016. This business serves small businesses in need of, and qualifying for, U.S. government guaranteed loans. We also provide SBA lending services throughout the country, with a primary focus on the Midwest, Tennessee and California. We generally sell the government guaranteed portion of SBA and USDA loans into the secondary market while retaining the non-guaranteed portion of the loan and the servicing rights. This allows us to realize one time gain on sale income along with a recurring servicing and interest revenue stream. In addition to the business development officers that we rely on to generate new business, we also have a dedicated servicing, portfolio management and workout staff with specialized expertise in U.S. government guaranteed loans. As of December 31, 2018, total loans and leases included the guaranteed amount of U.S. government guaranteed loans of $108.7 million. The total unpaid principal balances of loans serviced for others was $1.3 billion at December 31, 2018.
 Small ticket equipment leasing
 Through our Bank’s subsidiary, Byline Financial Group (“BFG”), we provide financing solutions for equipment vendors and their end users. The vertical markets served by our equipment vendors specialize primarily in healthcare, manufacturing, technology, specialty vehicles and energy efficiency. The end users (i.e., our lessees and borrowers) are primarily physician group practices, other healthcare related entities, manufacturers, retailers, veterinarians, wholesalers and automotive related industries. The average lease size at origination for BFG for the year ended December 31, 2018 was approximately $51,000. Our sales team originates leases throughout the country, and we have lessees in nearly every state. As of December 31, 2018, BFG had $191.3 million in leases outstanding with a weighted average life of approximately 1.8 years.
 Wealth management and trust
 We launched our trust and wealth management services with the acquisition of First Evanston in May 2018. This business provides investment, trust and wealth management services to our clients, including foundations and endowments and high net worth individuals. Services include fiduciary and executor services, financial planning solutions, investment advisory services, and private banking services. These services are provided through credentialed investment, legal, tax, and wealth management professionals who identify opportunities and provide services tailored to our customers’ goals and objectives. Assets under management were $571.5 million as of December 31, 2018.
 Distribution channels
 The primary market in which we operate is the Chicago metropolitan area, and our 57 branch network in this area is our core distribution channel. We operate the largest branch network in the city of Chicago of any Illinois-based bank, and we take advantage of our focused footprint and deep rooted relationships to target local customers with a diversified product offering.
 Our expansive local branch network enables us to gather low cost deposits, promote the Byline brand and customer loyalty, originate loans, leases and other products and maintain relationships with our customers through regular community involvement. We believe our branch network is fundamental to our ability to achieve successful customer outreach in line with our culture, which promotes high touch engagement with our customers and proactive solutions.
 While our branch network will continue to be our primary delivery channel, we understand the evolving banking environment requires digital interaction to keep pace with our customers’ needs. We have rationalized our branch network to increase efficiency while at the same time investing in our product development, particularly our online and mobile banking platforms that allow customers to transact via the digital channel, including bill payments, mobile deposits and peer to peer payment options. 
 When we deem it advisable, we launch marketing campaigns through our branches and online platform to advertise new products or promotional services. We view these two channels as key touchpoints with our customers and frequently strategize how we can best utilize these distribution networks.

Competition
 The financial services industry is highly competitive as we compete for loans, leases, deposits and customer relationships in our market. Competition involves efforts to retain current clients, make new loans and obtain new deposits, increase the scope and sophistication of services offered and offer competitive interest rates paid on deposits and charged on loans. Within our branch footprint, we face competition primarily from national, regional and other local banks that have established branch networks throughout the Chicago metropolitan area, giving them visible retail presence to customers.
 In providing wealth management services, we also compete with retail and discount stockbrokers, investment advisors, mutual funds, insurance companies, and other financial institutions for wealth management customers. Competition is generally based on the variety of products and services offered to customers and the performance of funds under management. Our main competitors are financial service providers both within and outside of the geographic areas in which we maintain offices.
 We believe our ability to provide a flexible, sophisticated product offering and an efficient process to our customers allows us to stay competitive in the financial services environment. Our local presence and hands-on approach enable us to provide a high level of service that our customers value.
 We face competition in attracting and retaining qualified employees. Our ability to continue to compete effectively depends on our ability to attract new employees and retain and motivate existing employees. 
 Intellectual Property
 In the highly competitive banking industry in which we operate, intellectual property is important to the success of our business. We registered the “Byline Bank” and “Byline Bancorp, Inc.” trademarks with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, along with various other trademarks, logos, and tag lines and we intend to protect the use of our trademarks and other intellectual property nationwide.
Employees
 As of December 31, 2018, we had 943 full time equivalent employees. None of our employees are parties to a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
Corporate Information
 Our principal executive offices are located at 180 North LaSalle Street, Suite 300, Chicago, Illinois 60601, and our telephone number at that address is (773) 244-7000. Our website address is www.bylinebancorp.com. We make available at this address, under the “Investor Relations” tab, free of charge, our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with, or furnished to, the SEC. There filings are also available on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov. The contents of our website are not incorporated by reference into this report.
 Supervision and Regulation
 We and our subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulation under federal and state banking laws that establish a comprehensive framework for our operations. This framework may materially affect our growth potential and financial performance and is intended primarily for the protection of depositors, customers, federal deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole, not for the protection of our stockholders and creditors. Significant elements of the statutes, regulations and policies applicable to us and our subsidiaries are described below.
Regulatory Agencies
 We are a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company (“BHC”) Act. Consequently, we and our subsidiaries are subject to supervision, regulation and examination by the Federal Reserve. The BHC Act provides generally for “umbrella” regulation of bank holding companies and functional regulation of holding company subsidiaries by applicable regulatory agencies. Byline Bank, our bank subsidiary, is a Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) insured commercial bank chartered under the laws of Illinois. Our bank is not a member of the Federal Reserve System. Consequently, the FDIC and the Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation (“IDFPR”) are the primary regulators of our bank and also regulate our bank’s subsidiaries. As the owner of an Illinois-chartered bank, we are also subject to supervision and examination by the IDFPR. We are also subject to the disclosure and regulatory requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act as administered by the SEC, and the rules adopted by the New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”) applicable to NYSE listed companies.
 7

Permissible Activities for Bank Holding Companies
 In general, the BHC Act limits the business of bank holding companies to banking, managing or controlling banks and other activities that the Federal Reserve has determined to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto, which include certain activities relating to extending credit or acting as an investment or financial advisor. We currently do not conduct any non-banking activities through any non-bank subsidiaries.
 Bank holding companies that qualify and elect to be treated as “financial holding companies” may engage in a broader range of additional activities than bank holding companies that are not financial holding companies. In particular, financial holding companies may engage in activities that are (i) financial in nature or incidental to such financial activities or (ii) complementary to a financial activity and do not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally. These activities include securities underwriting and dealing, insurance underwriting and making merchant banking investments. We have not elected to be treated as a financial holding company and currently have no plans to make a financial holding company election.
 The Federal Reserve has the power to order any bank holding company or any of its subsidiaries to terminate any activity or to terminate its ownership or control of any subsidiary when the Federal Reserve has reasonable grounds to believe that continuing such activity, ownership or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial soundness, safety or stability of any bank subsidiary of the bank holding company.
 Permissible Activities for Banks
 As an Illinois-chartered commercial bank, our bank’s business is subject to extensive supervision and regulation by state and federal bank regulatory agencies. Our business is generally limited to activities permitted by Illinois law and any applicable federal laws. Under the Illinois Banking Act, our bank may generally engage in all usual banking activities, including, among other things, accepting deposits; lending money on personal and real estate security; issuing letters of credit; buying, discounting, and negotiating promissory notes and other forms of indebtedness; buying and selling foreign currency and, subject to certain limitations, certain investment securities; engaging in certain insurance activities and maintaining safe deposit boxes on premises.
 Illinois law also imposes restrictions on Byline Bank’s activities intended to ensure the safety and soundness of our bank. For example, Byline Bank is restricted under the Illinois Banking Act from investing in certain types of investment securities and is generally limited in the amount of money it can lend to a single borrower or invest in securities issued by a single issuer.
 Acquisitions by Bank Holding Companies
 The BHC Act, Section 18(c) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, popularly known as the “Bank Merger Act”, the Illinois Banking Act, the Illinois Bank Holding Company Act and other federal and state statutes regulate acquisitions of commercial banks and other FDIC-insured depository institutions. We must obtain the prior approval of the Federal Reserve under the BHC Act before (i) acquiring more than 5% of the voting stock of any FDIC-insured depository institution or other bank holding company (other than directly through our bank), (ii) acquiring all or substantially all of the assets of any bank or bank holding company or (iii) merging or consolidating with any other bank holding company. Under the Bank Merger Act, the prior approval of the FDIC is required for our bank to merge with another bank or purchase all or substantially all of the assets or assume any of the deposits of another FDIC- insured depository institution or to assume certain liabilities of non-banks. In reviewing applications seeking approval of merger and acquisition transactions, banking regulators consider, among other things, the competitive effect and public benefits of the transactions, the capital position and managerial resources of the combined organization, the risks to the stability of the U.S. banking or financial system, the applicant’s performance record under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (“CRA”), the applicant’s compliance with fair housing and other consumer protection laws and the effectiveness of all organizations involved in combating money laundering activities. In addition, failure to implement or maintain adequate compliance programs could cause banking regulators not to approve an acquisition where regulatory approval is required or to prohibit an acquisition even if approval is not required.
Dividends; Stress Testing
 We are a legal entity separate and distinct from Byline Bank and other subsidiaries. As a bank holding company, we are subject to certain restrictions on our ability to pay dividends under applicable banking laws and regulations.
 Federal banking regulators are authorized to determine under certain circumstances relating to the financial condition of a bank holding company or a bank that the payment of dividends would be an unsafe or unsound practice and to prohibit payment thereof. In particular, federal banking regulators have stated that paying dividends that deplete a banking organization’s capital base to an inadequate level would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice and that banking organizations should generally pay dividends only out of current operating earnings. In addition, in the current financial and economic environment, the Federal Reserve has indicated that bank holding companies should carefully review their dividend policy and has discouraged payment ratios that are at maximum allowable levels unless both asset quality and capital are very strong. Under the capital rules defined below, institutions that seek to pay dividends must maintain 2.5% in Common Equity Tier 1 capital attributable to the capital conservation buffer, which was phased in over a three year period that began on January 1, 2016. For more information on these financial measures at the Company and Byline Bank, see Note 21 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this report.
 8

A significant portion of our income, on a stand-alone basis, comes from dividends from our bank, which is also the primary source of our liquidity. In addition to the restrictions discussed above, our bank is subject to limitations under Illinois law regarding the level of dividends that it may pay to us. Under the Illinois Banking Act, Byline Bank generally may not pay dividends in excess of its net profits. Under these restrictions, Byline Bank could pay aggregate dividends of approximately $134.7 million to us without obtaining affirmative regulatory approvals as of December 31, 2018.
 As required by the Dodd-Frank Act, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC have implemented final rules regarding company-run stress testing. These rules require bank holding companies and banks with average total consolidated assets greater than $10 billion to conduct an annual company-run stress test of capital, consolidated earnings and losses under one base and at least two stress scenarios provided by the federal banking regulators. Neither we nor our bank is currently subject to the stress testing requirements, but we expect that if we become subject to those requirements, the Federal Reserve, the FDIC and the IDFPR will consider our results and those of our bank as an important factor in evaluating our and our bank’s capital adequacy, any proposed acquisitions by us or by our bank and whether any proposed dividends or stock repurchases by us or by our bank may be an unsafe or unsound practice.
 Transactions with Affiliates and Insiders
 Transactions between our bank and its subsidiaries, on the one hand, and us or any other subsidiary, on the other hand, are regulated under Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act. The Federal Reserve Act imposes quantitative and qualitative requirements and collateral requirements on covered transactions by Byline Bank with, or for the benefit of, its affiliates. Generally, Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act limits the extent to which our bank or its subsidiaries may engage in “covered transactions” with any one affiliate to an amount equal to 10% of our bank’s capital stock and surplus, limits the aggregate amount of all such transactions with all affiliates to an amount equal to 20% of such capital stock and surplus, and requires those transactions to be on terms at least as favorable to our bank as if the transaction were conducted with an unaffiliated third-party. Covered transactions are defined by statute to include a loan or extension of credit, as well as a purchase of securities issued by an affiliate, a purchase of assets (unless otherwise exempted by the Federal Reserve) from the affiliate, certain derivative transactions with an affiliate, the acceptance of securities issued by the affiliate as collateral for a loan, and the issuance of a guarantee, acceptance or letter of credit on behalf of an affiliate. In addition, any credit transactions with any affiliate must be secured by designated amounts of specified collateral.
 Federal law also limits our bank’s authority to extend credit to its insiders, which is defined under applicable law to include its directors, executive officers and 10% stockholders, as well as to entities controlled by such persons. Among other things, extensions of credit to insiders are required to be made on terms that are substantially the same as, and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than, those prevailing for comparable transactions with unaffiliated persons. Also, the terms of such extensions of credit may not involve more than the normal risk of non-repayment or present other unfavorable features and may not exceed certain limitations on the amount of credit extended to such persons individually and in the aggregate. In addition, certain of our stockholders are foreign nationals, and we and certain of these foreign national stockholders have entered into commitments with the Federal Reserve that restrict our ability to engage in certain business transactions without the consent of the Federal Reserve. Certain of our stockholders have also entered into passivity commitments with the Federal Reserve that generally restrict these stockholders from entering into banking or nonbanking transactions with us.
 Source of Strength
 Federal Reserve policy and federal law require bank holding companies to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to their subsidiary banks. Under this requirement, we are expected to commit resources to support Byline Bank, including at times when we may not be in a financial position to provide such resources, and it may not be in our, or our stockholders’ or creditors’, best interests to do so. In addition, any capital loans we make to our bank are subordinate in right of payment to depositors and to certain other indebtedness of our bank. In the event of our bankruptcy, any commitment by us to a federal banking regulatory agency to maintain the capital of our bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to priority of payment.
Regulatory Capital Requirements
 The Federal Reserve monitors the capital adequacy of our holding company on a consolidated basis, and the FDIC and the IDFPR monitor the capital adequacy of our bank. The banking regulators use a combination of risk-based guidelines and a leverage ratio to evaluate capital adequacy. The risk-based capital guidelines applicable to us and our bank are based on the Basel Committee’s December 2010 final capital framework for strengthening international capital standards, known as Basel III, as implemented by the federal banking regulators. The risk-based guidelines are intended to make regulatory capital requirements sensitive to differences in credit and market risk profiles among banks and bank holding companies, to account for off-balance sheet exposure and to minimize disincentives for holding liquid assets.
 Basel III and the Capital Rules. In July 2013, the federal banking regulators approved final rules, or the Capital Rules, implementing Basel III and various provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. The Capital Rules substantially revise the risk-based capital requirements applicable to bank holding companies and banks, including us and our bank, compared to the previous risk-based capital rules. The Capital Rules revise the components of capital and address other issues affecting the numerator in regulatory capital ratio calculations. The Capital Rules, among other things, (i) include a new capital measure called “Common Equity Tier 1” (“CET1”), (ii) 
 9

specify that Tier 1 capital consists of CET1 and “Additional Tier 1 capital” instruments meeting certain revised requirements, (iii) define CET1 narrowly by requiring that most deductions/adjustments to regulatory capital measures be made to CET1 and not to the other components of capital, and (iv) expand the scope of the deductions/adjustments to capital as compared to prior regulations. The Capital Rules also address risk weights and other issues affecting the denominator in regulatory capital ratio calculations, including replacing the existing risk-weighting approach derived from Basel I with a more risk-sensitive approach based, in part, on the standardized approach adopted by the Basel Committee in its 2004 capital accords, known as Basel II. The Capital Rules also implement the requirements of Section 939A of the Dodd-Frank Act to remove references to credit ratings from the federal banking regulators’ rules. Subject to a phase-in period for various provisions, the Capital Rules became effective for us and for our bank on January 1, 2015.
 Under the Basel III Capital Rules, the minimum capital ratios are (i) 4.5% CET1 to risk-weighted assets, (ii) 6% Tier 1 capital (that is, CET1 plus Additional Tier 1 capital) to risk-weighted assets, (iii) 8% total capital (that is, Tier 1 capital plus Tier 2 capital) to risk-weighted assets and (iv) 4% Tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets as reported on consolidated financial statements (known as the “leverage ratio”).
 The current Capital Rules also include a capital conservation buffer designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. The capital conservation buffer is composed entirely of CET1, on top of these minimum risk-weighted asset ratios. The implementation of the capital conservation buffer began on January 1, 2016 at the 0.625% level and was phased in over a three-year period (increasing by 0.625% on each subsequent January 1) until it reached 2.5% on January 1, 2019. In addition, the Capital Rules provide for a countercyclical capital buffer applicable only to certain covered institutions. We do not expect the countercyclical capital buffer to be applicable to us or our bank. Banking institutions with a ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets above the minimum but below the capital conservation buffer (or below the combined capital conservation buffer and countercyclical capital buffer, when the latter is applied) will face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall.
 Beginning on January 1 2019, as a result of the now fully phased-in Capital Rules, we and our bank are required to maintain an additional capital conservation buffer of 2.5% of CET1, effectively resulting in minimum ratios of (i) 7% CET1 to risk-weighted assets, (ii) 8.5% Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets, (iii) 10.5% total capital to risk-weighted assets and (iv) a minimum leverage ratio of 4%.
 The Capital Rules provide for a number of deductions from and adjustments to CET1. These include, for example, the requirement that mortgage servicing rights, certain deferred tax assets and significant investments in non-consolidated financial entities be deducted from CET1 to the extent that any one such category exceeds 10% of CET1 or all such categories in the aggregate exceed 15% of CET1. Implementation of the deductions and other adjustments to CET1 began on January 1, 2015 and were to be phased in over a four-year period (beginning at 40% on January 1, 2015 and an additional 20% per year thereafter). On November 21, 2017, the federal banking regulators finalized rules that otherwise maintain the Capital Rules’ 2017 adjustments for the year 2018. These changes to the Capital Rules became effective beginning on January 1, 2018. On September 27, 2017, the federal banking regulators proposed a rule to simplify the current regulatory capital treatment of mortgage servicing rights, certain deferred tax assets and significant investments in non-consolidated financial entities; however, it is uncertain if this rule will be finalized since Congress passed the Economic Growth Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act (the “Consumer Protection Act”) in May 2018. As discussed below, the Consumer Protection Act included a provision intended to simplify capital rules for certain qualifying community banks. The Capital Rules also generally preclude certain hybrid securities, such as trust preferred securities, from being counted as Tier 1 capital for most bank holding companies. Bank holding companies such as us who had less than $15 billion in assets as of December 31, 2009 (and who continue to have less than $15 billion in assets) are permitted to include qualifying trust preferred securities issued prior to May 19, 2010 as Additional Tier 1 capital under the Capital Rules, however.
 In addition, under the general risk-based Capital Rules, the effects of accumulated other comprehensive income items included in capital were excluded for the purposes of determining regulatory capital ratios. Under the Capital Rules, the effects of certain accumulated other comprehensive income items are not excluded; however, non-advanced approaches banking organizations, including us and Byline Bank, were able to make a one-time permanent election to continue to exclude these items.
 The Capital Rules also prescribed a new standardized approach for risk weightings that expanded the risk-weighting categories from the current four Basel I derived categories (0%, 20%, 50% and 100%) to a much larger and more risk-sensitive number of categories, depending on the nature of the assets, generally ranging from 0%, for U.S. government and agency securities, to 600%, for certain equity exposures, and resulting in higher risk weights for a variety of asset categories.
 With respect to our bank, the Capital Rules also revised the prompt corrective action regulations pursuant to Section 38 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (the “FDIA”). 
 10

On November 20, 2018, pursuant to the Consumer Protection Act, the federal banking regulators issued a proposed rule meant to simplify the capital rules for community banks. Under the proposal, most depository institutions and depository institution holding companies that have less than $10 billion in total consolidated assets, that meet risk-based qualifying criteria, and that have a community bank leverage ratio of greater than 9% would be eligible to opt into a community bank leverage ratio framework. Under the proposal, should a qualified community bank or its holding company elect to use the community bank leverage ratio and maintain a community bank leverage ratio of greater than 9% then it would not be subject to other risk-based and leverage capital requirements, including the risk-based capital rules relating to high volatility commercial real estate, mortgage servicing rights, certain deferred tax assets and significant investments in non-consolidated financial entities, and would be considered to have met the well capitalized ratio requirements for purposes of Section 38 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and the generally applicable capital requirements under the federal banking regulators’ capital rules.
 Liquidity Regulations
 Historically, the regulation and monitoring of bank and bank holding company liquidity has been addressed as a supervisory matter, without required formulaic measures. The Basel III final framework requires banks and bank holding companies to measure their liquidity against specific liquidity tests that, although similar in some respects to liquidity measures historically applied by banks and regulators for management and supervisory purposes, going forward would be required by regulation. One test, referred to as the liquidity coverage ratio, or LCR, is designed to ensure that the banking entity maintains an adequate level of unencumbered high-quality liquid assets equal to the entity’s expected net cash outflow for a 30 day time horizon (or, if greater, 25% of its expected total cash outflow) under an acute liquidity stress scenario. The other test, referred to as the net stable funding ratio, or NSFR, is designed to promote more medium- and long-term funding of the assets and activities of banking entities over a one-year time horizon. These requirements will incentivize banking entities to increase their holdings of U.S. Treasury securities and other sovereign debt as a component of assets and increase the use of long-term debt as a funding source.
 In September 2014, the federal banking regulators approved final rules implementing the LCR for advanced approaches banking organizations (i.e., banking organizations with $250 billion or more in total consolidated assets or $10 billion or more in total on-balance sheet foreign exposure) and a modified version of the LCR for bank holding companies with at least $50 billion in total consolidated assets that are not advanced approaches banking organizations. Neither of these final versions of the LCR apply to us or our bank. In the second quarter of 2016, the federal banking regulators issued a proposed rule that would implement the NSFR for certain U.S. banking organizations. The proposed rule would require certain U.S. banking organizations to ensure they have access to stable funding over a one-year time horizon and has an effective date of January 1, 2018. The proposed rule has yet to be finalized. The proposed rule would not apply to U.S. banking organizations with less than $50 billion in total consolidated assets such as us and Byline Bank.
 Prompt Corrective Action Framework
 The FDIA also requires the federal banking regulators to take prompt corrective action in respect of depository institutions that fail to meet specified capital requirements. The FDIA establishes five capital categories: “well-capitalized”, “adequately capitalized”, “undercapitalized”, “significantly undercapitalized”, and “critically undercapitalized”. The federal banking regulators are required to take certain mandatory supervisory actions, and are authorized to take other discretionary actions, with respect to institutions that are undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized. The severity of these mandatory and discretionary supervisory actions depends upon the capital category in which the institution is placed. The relevant capital measures, which reflect changes under the Capital Rules that became effective on January 1, 2015, are the total capital ratio, the CET1 capital ratio, the Tier 1 capital ratio and the leverage ratio.
 A bank will be (i) “well capitalized” if the institution has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10% or greater, a CET1 capital ratio of 6.5% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8% or greater and a leverage ratio of 5% or greater, and is not subject to any order or written directive by any such regulatory authority to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure; (ii) “adequately capitalized” if the institution has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8% or greater, a CET1 capital ratio of 4.5% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6% or greater and a leverage ratio of 4% or greater and is not “well capitalized”; (iii) “undercapitalized” if the institution has a total risk-based capital ratio that is less than 8%, a CET1 capital ratio less than 4.5%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 6% or a leverage ratio of less than 4%; (iv) “significantly undercapitalized” if the institution has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6%, a CET1 capital ratio less than 3%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4% or a leverage ratio of less than 3%; and (v) “critically undercapitalized” if the institution’s tangible equity is equal to or less than 2% of average quarterly tangible assets. A bank’s capital category is determined solely for the purpose of applying prompt corrective action regulations, and the capital category may not constitute an accurate representation of Byline Bank’s overall financial condition or prospects for other purposes.
 11

The FDIA generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital distributions (including payment of a dividend) or paying any management fee to its parent holding company if the depository institution would thereafter be “undercapitalized”. An institution that is categorized as undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized is required to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan to its appropriate federal banking regulator. Under the FDIA, in order for the capital restoration plan to be accepted by the appropriate federal banking agency, a bank holding company must guarantee that a subsidiary depository institution will comply with its capital restoration plan, subject to certain limitations. The bank holding company must also provide appropriate assurances of performance. The obligation of a controlling bank holding company under the FDIA to fund a capital restoration plan is limited to the lesser of 5% of an undercapitalized subsidiary’s assets or the amount required to meet regulatory capital requirements. An undercapitalized institution is also generally prohibited from increasing its average total assets, making acquisitions and capital distributions, establishing any branches or engaging in any new line of business, except in accordance with an accepted capital restoration plan or with the approval of the FDIC. Institutions that are undercapitalized and either fail to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan or fail to implement an approved capital restoration plan may be subject to a number of requirements and restrictions, including orders to sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized, requirements to reduce total assets and cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent banks.
 Significantly undercapitalized depository institutions may be subject to a number of requirements and restrictions, including orders to sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized, requirements to reduce total assets, and cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent banks. Critically undercapitalized depository institutions are subject to appointment of a receiver or conservator.
 The appropriate federal banking agency may, under certain circumstances, reclassify a well-capitalized insured depository institution as adequately capitalized. The FDIA provides that an institution may be reclassified if the appropriate federal banking agency determines (after notice and opportunity for hearing) that the institution is in an unsafe or unsound condition or deems the institution to be engaging in an unsafe or unsound practice. The appropriate agency is also permitted to require an adequately capitalized or undercapitalized institution to comply with the supervisory provisions as if the institution were in the next lower category (but not treat a significantly undercapitalized institution as critically undercapitalized) based on supervisory information other than the capital levels of the institution. An institution may be downgraded to, or deemed to be in, a capital category that is lower than indicated by its capital ratios if it is determined to be in an unsafe or unsound condition or if it receives an unsatisfactory examination rating with respect to certain matters.
 As of December 31, 2018, our bank was considered “well capitalized” with a Tier 1 capital ratio of 12.71%, total capital ratio of 13.40%, Tier 1 leverage ratio of 10.56%, and a CET1 capital ratio of 12.71%, as calculated under Basel III. For more information on these financial measures at the Company and Byline Bank, see Note 21 of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this report.
 Safety and Soundness Standards
 The FDIA requires the federal banking agencies to prescribe standards, by regulations or guidelines, relating to internal controls, information systems and internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate risk exposure, asset growth, asset quality, earnings, stock valuation and compensation, fees and benefits, and such other operational and managerial standards as the agencies deem appropriate. The federal banking agencies have adopted the Interagency Guidelines for Establishing Standards for Safety and Soundness. The guidelines establish general standards relating to internal controls and information systems, internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth, asset quality, earnings and compensation, fees and benefits. In general, these guidelines require, among other things, appropriate systems and practices to identify and manage the risk and exposures specified in the guidelines. These guidelines also prohibit excessive compensation as an unsafe and unsound practice and describe compensation as excessive when the amounts paid are unreasonable or disproportionate to the services performed by an executive officer, employee, director or principal stockholder. In addition, the agencies adopted regulations that authorize, but do not require, an agency to order an institution that has been given notice by an agency that it is not satisfying any of such safety and soundness standards to submit a compliance plan. If, after being so notified, an institution fails to submit an acceptable compliance plan or fails in any material respect to implement an acceptable compliance plan, the banking regulator must issue an order directing action to correct the deficiency and may issue an order directing other actions of the types to which an undercapitalized institution may be subject under the FDIA. See Item 1. “Business—Supervision and Regulation—Prompt Corrective Action Framework”. If an institution fails to comply with such an order, the banking regulator may seek to enforce such order in judicial proceedings and to impose civil money penalties.

Deposit Insurance
 FDIC insurance assessments
 As an FDIC-insured bank, our bank must pay deposit insurance assessments to the FDIC based on its average total assets minus its average tangible equity. Deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the FDIC and such insurance is backed by the full faith and credit of the United States Government.
 As an institution with less than $10 billion in assets, our bank’s assessment rates are based on the level of risk it poses to the FDIC’s deposit insurance fund (“DIF”). Pursuant to changes adopted by the FDIC that were effective July 1, 2016, the initial base rate for deposit insurance is between three and 30 basis points. Total base assessment after possible adjustments now ranges between 1.5 and 40 basis points. For established smaller institutions, like Byline Bank, supervisory ratings are used along with (i) an initial base assessment rate, (ii) an unsecured debt adjustment (which can be positive or negative), and (iii) a brokered deposit adjustment, to calculate a total base assessment rate.
 Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the limit on FDIC deposit insurance was increased to $250,000. The coverage limit is per depositor, per insured depository institution for each account ownership category. The Dodd-Frank Act also set a new minimum DIF reserve ratio at 1.35% of estimated insured deposits. In October 2010, the FDIC adopted a new DIF restoration plan to ensure that the fund reserve ratio reaches 1.35% by September 30, 2020, as required by the Dodd-Frank Act. In September 2018, the FDIC announced that the DIF reserve ratio had surpassed 1.35% ahead of the September 30, 2020 deadline.
 Under the FDIA, the FDIC may terminate deposit insurance upon a finding that an institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC.
 Other assessments
 In addition, the Deposit Insurance Funds Act of 1996 authorized the Financing Corporation (“FICO”) to impose assessments on certain deposits in order to service the interest on the FICO’s bond obligations from deposit insurance fund assessments. The amount assessed on individual institutions is in addition to the amount, if any, paid for deposit insurance according to the FDIC’s risk-related assessment rate schedules. Assessment rates may be adjusted quarterly to reflect changes in the assessment base. It is currently anticipated that final assessments will be made in 2019.
 All Illinois state-chartered banks are required to pay supervisory assessments to the IDFPR to fund the operations of that agency. The amount of the assessment is calculated on the basis of Byline Bank’s total assets.
 The Volcker Rule
 The Dodd-Frank Act, pursuant to a statutory provision commonly called the “Volcker Rule”, prohibits banks and their affiliates from engaging in proprietary trading and investing in and sponsoring hedge funds and private equity funds. The Volcker Rule became effective in July 2015, and on May 30, 2018, the federal banking regulators proposed revisions to the Volcker Rule which would, among other things, tailor compliance requirements to a covered institution based on a banking entity’s level of trading activity. The Volcker Rule does not significantly affect the operations of us and our subsidiaries, as we do not have any significant engagement in the businesses prohibited by the Volcker Rule.
Depositor Preference
 The FDIA provides that, in the event of the “liquidation or other resolution” of an insured depository institution, the claims of depositors of the institution, including the claims of the FDIC as subrogee of insured depositors, and certain claims for administrative expenses of the FDIC as a receiver, will have priority over other general unsecured claims against the institution. If an insured depository institution fails, insured and uninsured depositors, along with the FDIC, will have priority in payment ahead of unsecured, non-deposit creditors, including depositors whose deposits are payable only outside of the United States and the parent bank holding company, with respect to any extensions of credit they have made to such insured depository institution.
Interstate Branching
 Illinois state-chartered banks, such as Byline Bank, have the authority under Illinois law to establish branches anywhere in the State of Illinois, subject to receipt of all required regulatory approvals.
 Federal law permits state and national banks to merge with banks in other states subject to: (i) regulatory approval; (ii) federal and state deposit concentration limits; and (iii) any state law limitations requiring the merging bank to have been in existence for a minimum period of time (not to exceed five years) prior to the merger. The establishment of new interstate branches or the acquisition of individual branches of a bank in another state (rather than the acquisition of an out-of-state bank in its entirety) has historically been permitted only in those states the laws of which expressly authorize such expansion. However, the Dodd-Frank Act permits well-capitalized and well-managed banks to establish new branches across state lines without these impediments.
 13

Consumer Financial Protection
 We are subject to a number of federal and state consumer protection laws that extensively govern our relationship with our customers. These laws include the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (“ECOA”), the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Truth in Lending Act (“TILA”), the Truth in Savings Act, the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, the Expedited Funds Availability Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Service Members Civil Relief Act, the Right to Financial Privacy Act, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, the CAN-SPAM Act, and these laws’ respective state-law counterparts, as well as state usury laws and laws regarding unfair and deceptive acts and practices. These and other federal laws, among other things, require disclosures of the cost of credit and terms of deposit accounts, provide substantive consumer rights, prohibit discrimination in credit transactions, regulate the use of credit report information, provide financial privacy protections, restrict our ability to raise interest rates on extensions of credit and subject us to substantial regulatory oversight. Violations of applicable consumer protection laws can result in significant potential liability from litigation brought by customers, including actual damages, restitution and attorneys’ fees. Federal banking regulators, state attorneys general and state and local consumer protection agencies may also seek to enforce consumer protection requirements and obtain these and other remedies, including regulatory sanctions, customer rescission rights, action by the state and local attorneys general in each jurisdiction in which we operate and civil money penalties. Failure to comply with consumer protection requirements may also result in our failure to obtain any required bank regulatory approval for merger or acquisition transactions we may wish to pursue or our prohibition from engaging in such transactions even if approval is not required.
 The Dodd-Frank Act created a new, independent federal agency, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”), which was granted broad rulemaking, supervisory and enforcement powers under various federal consumer financial protection laws with respect to certain consumer financial products and services, including the ability to require reimbursements and other payments to customers for alleged legal violations. The CFPB has the authority to impose significant penalties, as well as injunctive relief that prohibits lenders from engaging in allegedly unlawful practices. The CFPB is also authorized to engage in consumer financial education, track consumer complaints, request data and promote the availability of financial services to underserved consumers and communities. Although all institutions are subject to rules adopted by the CFPB and examination by the CFPB in conjunction with examinations by the institution’s primary federal regulator, the CFPB has primary examination and enforcement authority over banks with assets of $10 billion or more. The FDIC has primary responsibility for examination of our bank and enforcement with respect to various federal consumer protection laws so long as our bank has total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion, and state authorities are responsible for monitoring our compliance with all state consumer laws. The CFPB also has the authority to require reports from institutions with less than $10 billion in assets, such as our bank, to support the CFPB in implementing federal consumer protection laws, supporting examination activities, and assessing and detecting risks to consumers and financial markets.
 The consumer protection provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and the examination, supervision and enforcement of those laws and implementing regulations by the CFPB have created a more intense and complex environment for consumer finance regulation. The CFPB has significant authority to implement and enforce federal consumer finance laws, including the TILA, the ECOA and new requirements for financial services products provided for in the Dodd-Frank Act.
 The CFPB has broad rulemaking authority for a wide range of consumer financial laws that apply to all banks including, among other things, the authority to prohibit “unfair, deceptive, or abusive” acts and practices. Abusive acts or practices are defined in the Dodd-Frank Act as those that (1) materially interfere with a consumer’s ability to understand a term or condition of a consumer financial product or service, or (2) take unreasonable advantage of a consumer’s (a) lack of financial savvy, (b) inability to protect herself or himself in the selection or use of consumer financial products or services, or (c) reasonable reliance on a covered entity to act in the consumer’s interests. The review of products and practices to prevent such acts and practices is a continuing focus of the CFPB, and of banking regulators more broadly. The ultimate impact of this heightened scrutiny is uncertain but it could result in changes to pricing, practices, products and procedures. It could also result in increased costs related to regulatory oversight, supervision and examination, additional remediation efforts and possible penalties. The Dodd-Frank Act does not prevent states from adopting stricter consumer protection standards. State regulation of financial products and potential enforcement actions could also adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
 Federal Home Loan Bank Membership
 Byline Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago (“FHLB”), which serves as a central credit facility for its members. The FHLB is funded primarily from proceeds from the sale of obligations of the FHLB system. It makes loans to member banks in the form of FHLB advances. All advances from the FHLB are required to be fully collateralized as determined by the FHLB.
 Ability-To-Pay Rules and Qualified Mortgages
 As required by the Dodd-Frank Act, the CFPB issued a series of final rules in January 2013 amending Regulation Z, implementing TILA, which requires mortgage lenders to make a reasonable and good faith determination, based on verified and documented information, that a consumer applying for a residential mortgage loan has a reasonable ability to repay the loan according to its terms. These final rules prohibit creditors, such as Byline Bank, from extending residential mortgage loans without regard for the consumer’s ability to repay and add restrictions and requirements to residential mortgage origination and servicing practices. In addition, these rules restrict the imposition of prepayment penalties and restrict compensation practices relating to residential mortgage loan origination. Mortgage lenders are required to determine consumers’ ability-to-repay in one of two ways. The first 
 14

alternative requires the mortgage lender to consider eight underwriting factors when making the credit decision. Alternatively, the mortgage lender can originate “qualified mortgages”, which are entitled to a presumption that the creditor making the loan satisfied the ability to repay requirements. In general, a qualified mortgage is a residential mortgage loan that does not have certain high risk features, such as negative amortization, interest-only payments, balloon payments, or a term exceeding 30 years. In addition, to be a qualified mortgage, the points and fees paid by a consumer cannot exceed 3% of the total loan amount and the borrower’s total debt-to-income ratio must be no higher than 43% (subject to certain limited exceptions for loans eligible for purchase, guarantee or insurance by a government sponsored enterprise or a federal agency).
 Commercial Real Estate Guidance
 In December 2015, the federal banking regulators released a statement entitled “Interagency Statement on Prudent Risk Management for Commercial Real Estate Lending” (the “CRE Guidance”). In the CRE Guidance, the federal banking regulators (i) expressed concerns with institutions that ease commercial real estate underwriting standards, (ii) directed financial institutions to maintain underwriting discipline and exercise risk management practices to identify, measure and monitor lending risks, and (iii) indicated that they will continue to pay special attention to commercial real estate lending activities and concentrations going forward. The federal banking regulators previously issued guidance in December 2006, entitled “Interagency Guidance on Concentrations in Commercial Real Estate Lending, Sound Risk Management Practices”, which stated that an institution is potentially exposed to significant commercial real estate concentration risk, and should employ enhanced risk management practices, where (1) total commercial real estate loans represent 300% or more of its total capital and (2) the outstanding balance of such institution’s commercial real estate loan portfolio has increased by 50% or more during the prior 36 months.
Leveraged Lending Guidance
 In March 2013, the federal banking regulators jointly issued guidance on leveraged lending that updates and replaces the guidance for leveraged finance activities issued by the federal banking regulators in April 2001. The revised leveraged lending guidance describes regulatory expectations for the sound risk management of leveraged lending activities, including the importance for institutions to maintain, among other things, (i) a credit limit and concentration framework consistent with the institution’s risk appetite, (ii) underwriting standards that define acceptable leverage levels, (iii) strong pipeline management policies and procedures and (iv) guidelines for conducting periodic portfolio and pipeline stress tests.
Community Reinvestment Act of 1977
 Under the CRA, our bank has an obligation, consistent with safe and sound operations, to help meet the credit needs of the market areas where it operates, which includes providing credit to low- and moderate-income individuals and communities. In connection with its examination of our bank, the FDIC is required to assess our bank’s compliance with the CRA. Our bank’s failure to comply with the CRA could, among other things, result in the denial or delay of certain corporate applications filed by us or our bank, including applications for branch openings or relocations and applications to acquire, merge or consolidate with another banking institution or holding company. Our bank received a rating of “Satisfactory” in its most recently completed CRA examination which is dated February 17, 2016.
Financial Privacy
 The federal banking regulators have adopted rules limiting the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose non-public information about consumers to unaffiliated third parties. These limitations require disclosure of privacy policies to consumers and, in some circumstances, allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to an unaffiliated third party. These regulations affect how consumer information is transmitted through diversified financial companies and conveyed to outside vendors.
 Anti-Money Laundering and the USA PATRIOT Act
 A major focus of governmental policy on financial institutions in recent years has been combating money laundering and terrorist financing. The Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001, or the USA PATRIOT Act, substantially broadened the scope of United States anti money laundering laws and regulations by imposing significant new compliance and due diligence obligations, creating new crimes and penalties and expanding the extra-territorial jurisdiction of the United States in these areas: customer identification programs, money laundering, terrorist financing, identifying and reporting suspicious activities and currency transactions, currency crimes, and cooperation between financial institutions and law enforcement authorities. The U.S. Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, among other federal agencies, also promulgates rules and regulations regarding the USA PATRIOT Act with which financial institutions are required to comply. Financial institutions are prohibited from entering into specified financial transactions and account relationships and must use enhanced due diligence procedures in their dealings with certain types of high-risk customers and implement a written customer identification program. Financial institutions must take certain steps to assist government agencies in detecting and preventing money laundering and report certain types of suspicious transactions. Regulatory authorities routinely examine financial institutions for compliance with these obligations, and failure of a financial institution to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, or to comply with all of the relevant laws or regulations, could have serious legal and reputational consequences for the institution, including causing applicable bank regulatory authorities not to 
 15

approve merger or acquisition transactions when regulatory approval is required or to prohibit such transactions even if approval is not required. Regulatory authorities have imposed cease and desist orders and significant civil money penalties against institutions found to be violating these obligations and have in some cases brought criminal actions against some institutions for these types of violations.
 Office of Foreign Assets Control Regulation
 The U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC, under authority of various laws, administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions against targeted foreign countries and regimes, including designated foreign countries, nationals and others. OFAC publishes lists of specially designated targets and countries. We and our bank are responsible for, among other things, blocking accounts of, and transactions with, such targets and countries, prohibiting unlicensed trade and financial transactions with them and reporting blocked transactions after their occurrence. Failure to comply with these sanctions could have serious legal and reputational consequences and could result in civil money penalties imposed on the institution by OFAC. Failure to comply with these sanctions could also cause applicable bank regulatory authorities not to approve merger or acquisition transactions when regulatory approval is required or to prohibit such transactions even if approval is not required.
Incentive Compensation
 The Federal Reserve will review, as part of the regular, risk-focused examination process, the incentive compensation arrangements of banking organizations, such as us, that are not “large, complex banking organizations.” These reviews will be tailored to each organization based on the scope and complexity of the organization’s activities and the prevalence of incentive compensation arrangements. The findings of the supervisory initiatives will be included in reports of examination. Deficiencies will be incorporated into the organization’s supervisory ratings, which can affect the organization’s ability to make acquisitions and take other actions. Enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements, or related risk management control or governance processes, pose a risk to the organization’s safety and soundness and the organization is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies.
 In June 2010, the federal banking regulators issued comprehensive final guidance on incentive compensation policies intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness of such organizations by encouraging excessive risk-taking. The guidance, which covers all employees that have the ability to materially affect the risk profile of an organization, either individually or as part of a group, is based upon the key principles that a banking organization’s incentive compensation arrangements should (1) provide incentives that appropriately balance risk and financial results in a manner that does not encourage employees to expose their organizations to imprudent risk, (2) be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management and (3) be supported by strong corporate governance, including active and effective oversight by the organization’s board of directors.
 During the second quarter of 2016, certain U.S. regulators, including the Federal Reserve, the FDIC and the SEC, proposed revised rules on incentive-based payment arrangements at specified regulated entities having at least $1 billion in total assets (including us and Byline Bank). The proposed revised rules would establish general qualitative requirements applicable to all covered entities, which would include: (i) prohibiting incentive arrangements that encourage inappropriate risks by providing excessive compensation; (ii) prohibiting incentive arrangements that encourage inappropriate risks that could lead to a material financial loss; (iii) establishing requirements for performance measures to appropriately balance risk and reward; (iv) requiring board of director oversight of incentive arrangements; and (v) mandating appropriate record-keeping.
 Pursuant to rules adopted by the stock exchanges and approved by the SEC in January 2013 under the Dodd-Frank Act, public company compensation committee members must meet heightened independence requirements and consider the independence of compensation consultants, legal counsel and other advisors to the compensation committee. A compensation committee must have the authority to hire advisors and to have the public company fund reasonable compensation of such advisors.
 Public companies will be required, once stock exchanges impose additional listing requirements under the Dodd-Frank Act, to implement “clawback” procedures for incentive compensation payments and to disclose the details of the procedures which allow recovery of incentive compensation that was paid on the basis of erroneous financial information necessitating a restatement due to material noncompliance with financial reporting requirements. This clawback policy is intended to apply to compensation paid within a three-year look-back window of the restatement and would cover all executives who received incentive awards.
 16

Cybersecurity
 In March 2015, federal regulators issued two related statements regarding cybersecurity. One statement indicates that financial institutions should design multiple layers of security controls to establish lines of defense and to ensure that their risk management processes also address the risk posed by compromised customer credentials, including security measures to reliably authenticate customers accessing internet-based services of the financial institution. The other statement indicates that a financial institution’s management is expected to maintain sufficient business continuity planning processes to ensure the rapid recovery, resumption and maintenance of the institution’s operations after a cyber-attack involving destructive malware. A financial institution is also expected to develop appropriate processes to enable recovery of data and business operations and address rebuilding network capabilities and restoring data if the institution or its critical service providers fall victim to this type of cyber-attack. If we fail to observe the regulatory guidance, we could be subject to various regulatory sanctions, including financial penalties.
 In the ordinary course of business, we rely on electronic communications and information systems to conduct our operations and to store sensitive data. We employ an in-depth, layered, defensive approach that leverages people, processes and technology to manage and maintain cybersecurity controls. We employ a variety of preventative and detective tools to monitor, block, and provide alerts regarding suspicious activity, as well as to report on any suspected advanced persistent threats. Notwithstanding the strength of our defensive measures, the threat from cyberattacks is severe, attacks are sophisticated and increasing in volume, and attackers respond rapidly to changes in defensive measures. While to-date we have not experienced a significant compromise, significant data loss or any material financial losses related to cybersecurity attacks, our systems and those of our customers and third party service providers are under constant threat and it is possible that we could experience a significant event in the future. Risks and exposures related to cybersecurity attacks are expected to remain high for the foreseeable future due to the rapidly evolving nature and sophistication of these threats, as well as due to the expanding use of internet banking, mobile banking and other technology-based products and services by us and our customers.
 Future Legislation and Regulation
 Congress may enact legislation from time to time that affects the regulation of the financial services industry, and state legislatures may enact legislation from time to time affecting the regulation of financial institutions chartered by or operating in those states. Federal and state regulatory agencies also periodically propose and adopt changes to their regulations or change the manner in which existing regulations are applied. The substance or impact of pending or future legislation or regulation, or the application thereof, cannot be predicted, although enactment of the proposed legislation could affect the regulatory structure under which we operate and may significantly increase our costs, impede the efficiency of our internal business processes, require us to increase our regulatory capital or modify our business strategy, or limit our ability to pursue business opportunities in an efficient manner. Our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects may be adversely affected, perhaps materially, as a result.
