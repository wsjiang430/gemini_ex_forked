Item 1. Business
 
Creative Learning Corporation, operating under the trade names of Bricks 4 Kidz® and Sew Fun Studios®, offers educational and enrichment programs to children ages 3 to 13+ through its franchisees. The Company’s business model is to sell franchise territories and collect a one-time franchise fee, renewal fees and monthly royalty fees from each territory. Through the Company’s franchise business model, which includes a proprietary curriculum and marketing strategy plus a proprietary franchise management tool, the Company provides a wide variety of programs designed to enhance students’ problem solving and critical thinking skills. At September 30, 2018, the Company had 526 Bricks 4 Kidz® and Sew Fun Studios® franchise locations and 31 Bricks 4 Kidz® master franchises which operate 124 Bricks 4 Kidz® sub-franchises in 45 countries.
 
Company Background
 
The Company was formed in March 2006 under the name B2 Health, Inc. to design, manufacture and sell chiropractic tables and beds. The Company generated only limited revenue and essentially abandoned its business plan in March 2008. In July 2010, the Company’s name was changed to Creative Learning Corporation.
 
On July 2, 2010, the Company acquired BFK Franchise Company, LLC (“BFK”), a Nevada limited liability company formed in May 2009, under a Stock Exchange Agreement with the members of BFK for 9,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock. BFK offers a franchise concept known as Bricks 4 Kidz®, a mobile business operated by franchisees within a specific geographic territory offering project-based programs designed to teach principles and methods of engineering to children ages 3-13+. BFK began selling franchises in July 2009.
 
On January 26, 2015 the Company formed SF Franchise Company, LLC (“SF”) for the purpose of offering a third franchise concept known as Sew Fun Studios®. Sew Fun Studios® is a mobile business operated by franchisees within a specific geographic territory offering creative project-based activities, classes, and programs in fashion and interior design and sewing to children and adults.
 
BFK 
 
BFK franchises, which conduct business under the trade name BRICKS 4 KIDZ®, offer programs designed to teach principles and methods of engineering to children between the ages of 3 and 13 using LEGO® plastic bricks and other LEGO® products through classes, field trips, and other organized activities that are designed to enhance and enrich the traditional school curriculum, trigger young children’s lively imaginations and build self-confidence. BFK’s programs foster creativity and provide a unique atmosphere for students to develop problem-solving and critical-thinking skills by designing and building machines, catapults, pyramids, race cars, buildings and numerous other systems and devices using LEGO® bricks and other LEGO® products. The Company may provide training and corporate franchisee support to all franchisees and recognizes revenue from the sale of its franchises when all initial training, pursuant to the terms of the franchise agreements, is completed.
 
BFK franchises are mobile models, with activities scheduled in locations such as preschools, elementary and middle schools, camps, birthday parties, community centers and churches.

BFK Franchise Program
 
BKF sells franchises both domestically and internationally. International sales can be a single franchise or a master franchise, where the master franchisee operates a franchise in the territory, and is also able to develop, sell and manage sub-franchises in the territory under the master franchise agreement. BFK does not offer master franchises in the United States.
 
Under a franchise agreement, a franchisee pays a one-time, non-refundable franchise fee upon the execution of the franchise agreement. Domestically, there can be variations on the franchise fees depending on the size or territories being purchased, and other factors of the territory. The typical-sized, domestic, single territory franchise fee is $25,900. If the franchisee is granted an additional geographic area to increase the size of their territory, then the franchisee must pay an additional fee in the amount of $10,000. If the franchisee is in good standing and is granted a second or additional franchise, then the franchisee must pay a franchise fee in the amount of $18,000 for each additional franchise.

International franchise fees vary and are set relative to the potential of the franchised territories. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018, BFK sold one master franchise for $36,000. In the case of a master franchise, BFK receives a percentage of the franchise fee paid to the master franchisee by any sub-franchisee operating in the master franchisee’s territory.
 
The Company uses a network of franchise advertising and promotion media to contact prospective franchisees. When a potential contact is received, the initial information relating to a buyer is passed to a franchise sales broker or director of business development to initiate contact with the potential new franchisees. The responsibility of the sales broker and/or director of business development is to vet the potential franchisee for compatibility with the franchise concept, among other things. As part of the process of vetting potential franchisees, the Company requires all prospective franchisees to complete a Request for Consideration form. Upon completion of the process the sales broker is paid a commission typically ranging from 20% to 30% of the franchise fee while the director of business development commission ranges between 5% to 7% and the Marketing Director earns 1%.
 
The franchisee is granted a limited exclusive territory and a license to use the “Bricks 4 Kidz®” name, trademarks and course materials in the franchised territory. The franchisee is required to conform to certain standards of business practices and comply with all applicable laws. Each franchise is run as an independent business and, as such, is responsible for its operation, including employment of adequate staff.
 
The term of the franchise is for ten years. Subject to any applicable laws, BFK has the right to terminate any franchisee in the event of the franchisee’s bankruptcy, a default under the franchise agreement, or other events. The franchisee has the right to renew the franchise for an additional ten years if, at the time of renewal, the franchisee is in good standing and pays a renewal fee in the amount of $5,000. During FY2018, the Company, in accordance to FTC Franchise Rule 436.7(a), suspended sales of new franchises in the United States as the Company awaited the completion of its audited financial statements.
 
Franchise Disclosure Document
 
Under federal law, the Company is required to (a) prepare a franchise disclosure document (“FDD”) including federally mandated information, (b) provide each prospective franchisee with a copy of the FDD, and (c) wait 14 calendar days before entering into a binding agreement with the prospective franchisee or collecting any payment from any prospective franchisee. Federal law does not regulate the franchise relationship or require any filing or registration of the FDD on the part of a franchisor. The Company is also required to comply with certain state regulations in connection with the offer and sale of franchises, including the requirement to submit the FDD for registration with a number of states before offering or selling franchises within those states. The states requiring registration of the FDD are:  California, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, North Dakota, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Virginia, Washington and Wisconsin. In these states, state regulatory agencies review the FDD to confirm compliance with state statutory requirements. These state agencies can deny registration of the FDD if they determine that the FDD fails to meet state statutory requirements. If a state denies the issuance of an effective registration, a franchisor is prohibited from offering or selling franchises in that state. See "Government Regulation" below for more information.
Royalty and Marketing Fees
 
The Company invoices all applicable franchisees a royalty fee on a monthly basis. Every U.S. franchisee, upon signing a franchise agreement, has authorized and provided the required banking information to allow the electronic collection of all fees. Approximately three days after the invoice has been issued to the franchisee, an ACH draft (automatic deduction from the franchisee bank account) for the royalty fee withdrawal is processed through the Company’s banking system. When the Company changes its royalty structure, existing franchisees maintain their contractual franchise royalty rate unless they agree to amend those rates.

Based upon the number of franchise territories owned and the length of time the franchisee has been in operation, historically, domestic and international franchisees were required to pay BFK a royalty fee amounting to 7% of gross receipts reported in the Franchise Management Tool (“FMT”). BFK also received a percentage of royalty payments received by master franchisees from their sub-franchisees. Franchisees were billed monthly for their 7% royalty payments, based upon gross receipts, due to the Company. The franchisees were required to pay the Company a minimum royalty fee per each franchise territory they own. Billing of the minimum royalty fee amount to each franchisee took place every 12 weeks and the minimum amount was calculated by comparing the amounts between the regular royalties billed for the prior 12 weeks to the 12 week minimum royalty payment due to the Company, per the franchise agreement. The 12-week minimum royalty payment due to the Company was $1,500 for the first franchise territory owned (equating to a minimum average fee of $500 per month) and $750 for the second franchise territory owned (equating to a minimum average fee of $250 per month). The minimum amount due for the third franchise territory was $1,500 and the fourth franchise territory was $750. After the end of each 12-week period, franchisees are required to pay to the Company the amount, if any, by which the minimum royalty exceeds the sum of the royalties paid over the 12-week period, per the franchise agreements prior to October 1, 2015.
 
Beginning October 1, 2015, the Company adopted a flat-fee approach, eliminating the previous approach based upon revenue collections by the franchisee. The Company made the change to a flat-fee approach for a variety of reasons, including without limitation: to better enable franchisees to manage their cash flow; to enrich relations with our franchisees by being responsive to their needs; to facilitate the Company’s ability to collect minimum fees across the board; and to make the Company’s fee structure more attractive to new potential franchisees.
 
The following is the royalty fee structure:
 

Time Period During the Initial Term of Franchise Agreement | Royalty Fees Amount (U.S. Dollars) (per month) | 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------
October 1, 2015 through September 30, 2016 | $ | 400 USD 
October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2017 | $ | 425 USD 
October 1, 2017 through September 30, 2018 | $ | 450 USD 
October 1, 2018 through September 30, 2019 | $ | 475 USD 
October 1, 2019 and for the remainder of the initial term of the Franchise Agreement | $ | 500 USD 

 
If any franchisee owns and operates more than one territory, the royalty fees payable to the Company for the second territory and each additional territory shall be as follows:
 

Time Period During the Initial Term of Franchise Agreement | Royalty Fees Amount (U.S. Dollars) (per month) | 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------
October 1, 2015 through September 30, 2016 | $ | 200 USD 
October 1, 2016 through September 30, 2017 | $ | 225 USD 
October 1, 2017 and for the remainder of the initial term of the Franchise Agreement | $ | 250 USD 

 
On September 30, 2016, the Company implemented a new royalty fee structure for all new franchise sales. Sales in progress were grandfathered in under the previous royalty structure. The new royalty structure is the greater of 7% of gross sales or $500 per month.
 
Each franchisee has been given the option to amend their franchise agreement contract and elect this new royalty fee structure. Less than 2% of franchisees did not agree to amend their franchise agreements to the new program. Any franchisees which did not elect the new royalty fee structure will remain subject to the historic royalty structure described above.

BFK administers a marketing fund for domestic and Canadian franchisees for the purpose of building brand awareness in their respective countries. The marketing fund expenditures are funded by BFK collecting a 2% marketing fee, based upon gross receipts reported in the Franchise Management Tool (“FMT”), from domestic and Canadian franchisees. The respective franchisees are typically invoiced the middle of each month for the prior month’s receipts. These marketing fee receipts and expenses are accounted for separately and are not reported as revenue or expenses for BFK. The collections of these funds are done using the Company’s ACH program, as agreed to by each franchisee in their Franchise Agreement. The Marketing Fund is segregated into a separate bank account. In April 2018, the third party provider of the FMT restricted the Company’s access to the software. As a result, franchisees were instructed to self report their marketing fees, however many franchisees did not comply with this request. The Company is actively working with these franchisees in the current period to acquire accurate reporting and to bring their accounts to a current status. The Company has built its own software and franchisees are migrating to the new software. Collection and reconciliation of marketing fees will be streamlined with the new software.
 
BFK Competition
 
Although BFK pioneered the LEGO® modeling-based curriculum for after school programs, we believe there are at least two other companies franchising a model similar to that of Bricks 4 Kidz®, Engineering 4 Kids and Snapology. Play-Well Teknologies offers after-school classes, camps and birthday parties using LEGO® bricks. Vision Education and Media offers after school classes using LEGO® bricks in the New York metropolitan area. In addition, several other small businesses around the country offer after-school classes and vacation camps using LEGO® bricks. These classes and camps are typically held in elementary schools, middle schools and community colleges.
 
Sew Fun Studios
 
The Company is in the process of revising SF’s form of franchise agreement to address common franchise issues consistent with best practices. SF filed state-required initial, amended or renewal franchise materials during the 2nd quarter of fiscal year 2018. Franchises sold under this franchise concept operate businesses offering creative project-based activities, classes and programs in fashion and interior design and sewing to children and adults at locations such as elementary and middle schools, camps, social events, community centers and churches. At September 30, 2018, SF had 4 franchise territories in locations and states that do not require registration. The franchises are in two states and Puerto Rico, as well as one franchisee in Ireland. The FDD has been completed and has been filed; the Company has begun sales activities in states that do not require additional registrations.
Franchising Process
 
Initial contact between a potential franchisee and the Company may result from a potential franchisee contacting the Company, either by phone or electronically. Potential franchisees may also be introduced to the Company by brokers and/or other parties, and the Company may pay commissions and consulting fees to the brokers. The Company has discontinued its previous practice of introducing franchisee candidates to third party financing sources to cover franchising expenses, as well as, paying commissions and consulting fees to the Company’s directors and officers. See Item 11, “Executive Compensation — Summary Compensation Table” and Item 13, “Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence.”
 
After initial contact, one of the Company’s franchise consultants and/or internal sales personnel interviews each prospective franchisee (the “candidate”) to determine whether the candidate may make a successful franchisee. If the franchise consultant determines that the candidate may make a successful franchisee, the candidate submits a request for consideration (“RFC”). The Company reviews the RFC, and if the RFC is approved, the franchise consultant continues the vetting process, which focuses on financial and other factors.
 
5

 

Upon receipt of the RFC, the candidate is emailed a copy of the Company’s franchise disclosure document. The franchise consultant reviews the franchise disclosure document with the candidate and answers any questions concerning the franchise and the franchise agreement. The Company does not provide projections of a franchise’s financial model or performance to prospective franchisees
 
Assuming the candidate has cleared the initial vetting process and remains interested in operating one of the Company’s franchises, the candidate is invited to attend a “discovery day” held at the Company’s headquarters, or in some instances at another location, during which representatives of the Company and the candidate meet face to face. If the Company decides that the candidate meets its objectives for the franchise, the required disclosure waiting period has expired and the candidate wants to move forward and become a franchisee, the parties execute a franchise agreement.
 
The Company will sell a franchise for a particular territory only when the Company has a reasonable belief that the potential franchisee meets the Company minimum criteria. If a franchisee is not successful, the Company may terminate the franchise agreement by providing notice to the franchisee or repurchasing the franchise from the franchisee. Until the Company provides a notice of termination or repurchases the franchise and terminates the franchise by mutual agreement, the Company considers the franchise to be active.
 
Government Regulation 
 
The offer and sale of franchises is regulated by the Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”) and some state governments.
 
In 1979, the FTC promulgated what became known as the FTC Franchise Rule. The FTC Franchise Rule requires that the franchisor provide a FDD to each prospective franchisee prior to execution of a binding franchise agreement or payment of money by the prospective franchisee. The FTC Franchise Rule does not regulate the franchise relationship or require any filing or registration on the part of a franchisor.
 
However, the FTC Franchise Rule does not preempt state law and, as a result, states may (and, some have) impose additional requirements on franchisors. For example, the following states require franchisors (i) to register their franchise offerings (or qualify for an exemption) with the state prior to the offer and sale of franchises in the state, and (ii) subject to certain exemptions, to provide all prospective franchisees with a registered FDD prior to the offer and sale of a franchise in the state: California, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, North Dakota, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Virginia, Washington and Wisconsin (the “Franchise Registration States”). The registration process is not uniform in each Franchise Registration State. Most Franchise Registration States require the franchisor to submit an application, which includes a FDD, in order to register to sell franchises within that state. Many, but not all, of the state regulatory agencies in the Franchise Registration States review the franchisor’s registration application, the FDD, the proposed franchise agreement and any other agreements franchisees must sign, the financial condition of the franchisor, and other material information provided by the franchisor in its application. These state agencies have the authority to deny a franchisor’s application for registration and prohibit the franchisor from offering or selling franchises in the state.
 
In addition, there are numerous states that have laws that regulate the relationship between a franchisor and a franchisee after the sale of the franchise.
 
Under the FTC Franchise Rule, the FTC has the authority to seek civil penalties against a franchisor for violations of the FTC Franchise Rule. Each of the Franchise Registration States has similar authority to seek penalties for violations of their state franchise registration and disclosure laws. Violations may include offering or selling an unregistered franchise, failing to timely provide the disclosure document to a prospective franchisee or making misrepresentations in the FDDs. Additionally, officers, directors and individuals with management responsibility for the franchisor may have personal liability for violations of franchise laws if they had knowledge of (or should have had knowledge of) or participated in the violations.
 
There is no direct, private right of action for a violation of the FTC Franchise Rule. However, most of the Franchise Registration States provide for a private right of action for a violation of the state’s franchise registration and disclosure law. Remedies available under these laws typically include damages, rescission of the franchise agreement and attorneys’ fees.

On January 29, 2016, the Company temporarily suspended domestic franchise offers and sales of Bricks 4 Kidz® and Sew Fun Studios® franchises in compliance with FTC Franchise Rule, Section 436.7(a) due to delay in completion of the Company’s fiscal year 2015 consolidated audited financial statements. In turn, this delayed completion of the Company’s 2016 FDDs for the Bricks 4 Kidz® and Sew Fun Studios® franchise offerings. The Company restarted selling efforts of Bricks 4 Kidz in September of 2016. This temporary suspension of domestic franchise offer and sales did not affect the Company’s international franchise offer and sales activity or its royalty fee collections from existing franchisees. The Company has also currently temporarily suspended domestic franchise offers and sales of Bricks 4 Kidz® and Sew Fun Studios® franchises in compliance with FTC Franchise Rule, Section 436.7(a) due to delay in completion of the Company’s fiscal year 2018 consolidated audited financial statements. In turn, this delayed completion of the Company’s 2018 and 2019 FDDs for the Bricks 4 Kidz® and Sew Fun Studios® franchise offerings.
 
Going Concern
 
The Company had losses of $218,833 in the current year. The Company had incurred accumulated losses of $2,391,525 as of September 30, 2018. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. 
 
Based on the Company’s cash balance at September 30, 2018 and projected cash needs for the next 12 months from the issuance date of these financial statements, management believes that the Company will need to increase revenues, reduce costs and/or pursue other transactions to be able to continue to fund operating and capital requirements. The Company plans to implement cost cutting measures, including reducing personnel, reducing legal and professional expenses, moving the company’s central location to Boise, ID, selling Company owned real estate, and incorporating technology where economic opportunity presents. The Company plans to expand its offerings to allow current franchisees to operate in unoccupied territories for a yearly fee plus a monthly percentage of revenue (see Note 10). However, should the current legal issues or unforeseen legal actions prevail against the Company, or a drastic downturn in the economy become actual, the Company expects that profitability would be affected. At such time, the Company would need to secure loans, lines of credit or other means to raise operating capital. The Company cannot be sure that it will be able to obtain any such additional funds by any of the foregoing or other means, and any such funds it may obtain may not be sufficient. If the Company is unable to obtain sufficient funds, it may be unable to continue as a going concern.
 
General
 
The Company’s offices, consisting of approximately 4,500 square feet, are located in an office/condo complex at 701 Market, Suite 113, St. Augustine, FL 32095. The Company owns three of the office condominiums and rents one additional unit.
 
Subsequent to year end, the Company sold one of its office condominiums in Florida and transitioned to a Boise, Idaho location for which a new month-to-month office lease was signed.
 
At September 30, 2018, the Company had 8 employees on a full time basis.
