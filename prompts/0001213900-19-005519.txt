ITEM 1. BUSINESS
CORPORATE HISTORY
 
Western Uranium & Vanadium Corp. (formerly known as Western Uranium Corporation) was incorporated in December 2006 under the Ontario Business Corporations Act and was formerly a non-listed reporting issuer subject to the rules and regulations of the Ontario Securities Commission. On November 20, 2014, the Company completed a listing process on the Canadian Securities Exchange (“CSE”). As part of that process, the Company acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of Pinon Ridge Mining LLC (“PRM”), a Delaware limited liability company. The transaction constituted a reverse takeover of Western by PRM. After obtaining appropriate shareholder approvals, the Company subsequently reconstituted its Board of Directors and senior management team.
 
On August 18, 2014, the Company closed on the purchase of certain mining properties in Colorado and Utah from Energy Fuels Holding Corp. Assets purchased included both owned and leased lands in Utah and Colorado and all represent properties that have been previously mined for uranium to varying degrees in the past. The acquisition included the purchase of the Sunday Mine Complex. The Sunday Mine Complex is located in western San Miguel County, Colorado. The complex consists of the following five individual mines: the Sunday mine, the Carnation mine, the Saint Jude mine, the West Sunday mine and the Topaz mine. The operation of each of these mines requires a separate permit and all such permits have been obtained by Western and are currently valid. In addition, each of the mines has good access to a paved highway, electric power to existing mine workings, office/storage/shop and change buildings, and extensive underground haulage development with multiple vent shafts complete with exhaust fans. The Sunday Mine Complex is where the Company anticipates it would start mining operations.
 
On September 16, 2015, Western completed its acquisition of Black Range, an Australian company that was listed on the Australian Securities Exchange until the acquisition was completed. The acquisition terms were pursuant to a definitive Merger Implementation Agreement entered into between Western and Black Range. Pursuant to the agreement, Western acquired all of the issued shares of Black Range by way of Scheme of Arrangement (“the Scheme”) under the Australian Corporation Act 2001 (Cth) (the “Black Range Transaction”), with Black Range shareholders being issued common shares of Western on a 1 for 750 basis. On August 25, 2015, the Scheme was approved by the shareholders of Black Range and on September 4, 2015, Black Range received approval by the Federal Court of Australia. In addition, Western issued to certain employees, directors and consultants options to purchase Western common shares. Such stock options were intended to replace Black Range stock options outstanding prior to the Black Range Transaction on the same 1 for 750 basis.
 
In connection with the Black Range Transaction, Western acquired the net assets of Black Range. These net assets consist principally of interests in a large uranium resource located in Colorado (the “Hansen-Taylor Complex”) and a 100% interest in a 25 year license for ablation mining technologies (“Ablation”) and related patents from Ablation Technologies, LLC. The Hansen-Taylor Complex is principally a sandstone-hosted deposit that was discovered in 1977.
 
Furthermore, related to Ablation in connection with the acquisition of Black Range Minerals Ltd. (“Black Range”), the Company assumed a call option agreement between Black Range and Mr. George Glasier. Prior to the Black Range Transaction, George Glasier, the Company’s CEO, who is also a director (“Seller”), transferred his interest in a former joint venture with Ablation Technologies, LLC to Black Range. In connection with the transfer, Black Range issued 25 million shares of Black Range common stock to Seller and committed to pay $500,000 AUD ($352,361 USD as of December 31, 2018) to Seller within 60 days of the first commercial application of the Ablation technology. Western assumed this contingent payment obligation in connection with the Black Range Transaction.
 
The Ablation mining process is dramatically different from conventional mining techniques. Subject to regulatory approvals, the benefits of Ablation are as follows:
 

● | Mining, crushing, and separation of waste from minerals (uranium and vanadium), used most effectively, occurs underground (inside the mine). Under this approach the costs of moving material to the surface are less as 85%-90% of the mined material remains underground and is never brought outside the mine. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Less radiometric exposure throughout the process due to reduced waste rock on the surface and after the milling process less tailings. Overall surface waste material is reduced and the time duration of material handling is reduced. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Lower costs for transportation of post-ablated material from the mine site to the mill site because 85-90% of the mined material would not be taken to the mill. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Once the ablated material reaches the mill, the acid consumption at the mill and power is much less due to the lower quantity but more concentrated material moving through the milling process. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ablation mining technology can be used on legacy uranium stockpiles in the western United States. WUC would ablate these stockpiles, removing 85-90% of the uranium. This is an application through which ablation mining technology could positively contribute to the ’greening of the environment’. According to a study there are approximately 4,225 legacy uranium mines from the 1940-1970 period throughout the Western United States, most of which have waste stockpiles.
 
In the estimation of management, Ablation mining allows the cost of production of uranium to be reduced by 44-53%.
 
Our common shares are listed on the Canadian Securities Exchange, also known as the “CSE,” under the symbol “WUC”, and are also quoted in the United States on the OTCQX Best Market under the symbol “WSTRF.” We are headquartered in Ontario, Canada with mining operations in the two U.S. states of Utah and Colorado. We have two full-time employees and one part-time employee. The mailing address of our headquarters is 330 Bay Street, Suite 1400, Toronto, Ontario, M5H2S8, Canada, and the telephone number is (970) 864-2125. Our corporate website is located at http://www.western-uranium.com/.
 
We are an “emerging growth company” as that term is defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the “JOBS Act”). The JOBS Act defines an “emerging growth company” as one that had total annual gross revenues of less than $1,000,000,000 during the last fiscal year. Section 102(b) (1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Securities Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standard. The JOBS Act also provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period provided by Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable.
 
Our wholly-owned subsidiaries are Western Uranium Corp., Pinon Ridge Mining LLC, Black Range Minerals Limited, Black Range Copper Inc., Ranger Resources Inc., Black Range Minerals Inc., Black Range Minerals Colorado LLC, Black Range Minerals Wyoming LLC, Haggerty Resources LLC, Ranger Alaska LLC, Black Range Minerals Utah LLC, Black Range Minerals Ablation Holdings Inc. and Black Range Development Utah LLC.
 
OUR COMPANY
 
Western is in the business of exploring, developing, mining and production of its uranium and vanadium resource properties.
 
Western is an exploration stage company for purposes of Industry Guide 7 of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Industry Guide 7 states that mining companies like ours can be classified into three stages: exploration, development, or production. Exploration stage includes all companies engaged in the search for mineral deposits, which are not in either the development or production stage. In order to be classified as a development or production stage company, the Company must have already established reserves. The Company has not established reserves for purposes of Industry Guide 7.
 
Our mineral properties are located in Western Colorado and Eastern Utah and adjacent areas of the Western United States. Our primary focus is bringing the fully permitted Sunday Mine Complex into production, permitting the San Rafael Project and the commercialization of the Ablation mining technology.
 
The Sunday Mine Complex is located in western San Miguel County, Colorado. The complex consists of the following five individual mines: the Sunday mine, the Carnation mine, the Saint Jude mine, the West Sunday mine and the Topaz mine. The operation of each of these mines requires a separate permit and all such permits have been obtained by Western and are currently valid. In addition, each of the mines has good access to a paved highway, electric power to existing mine workings, office/storage/shop and change buildings, and extensive underground haulage development with multiple vent shafts complete with exhaust fans.
 
We have acquired a license (“Ablation”), which provides a low cost, purely physical, method of separating uranium and vanadium mineralization from waste. No chemicals are added in the process, yet very high mineral recoveries can be achieved with considerable mass reduction; facilitating the separation of a high-value, high-grade ore product from a coarse-grained barren “clean sand” product.
 
Application of Ablation is expected to have a very positive effect on the development of not only our Sunday Mine Complex, but also most of our and others’ deposits, because it significantly reduces both capital and operating costs. Extensive test work has shown that from amenable sandstone-hosted ore types, typically more than 90% of the mineralization can be separated into 10-20% of the initial sample mass.

OUR STRATEGY
 
Our vision is to become a leading uranium and vanadium developer and producer. Our strategy is to build value for stockholders by advancing our projects towards production. The recent increase in the price of vanadium has increased the relative importance of this resource to the Company. Hence, Western is increasingly able to baseload mine production on the basis of price improvement in vanadium markets. Given the strong appreciation in the price of vanadium, Western has planned a mine re-opening project at the Sunday Mine Complexes to identify high-grade vanadium ore, followed by bulk sampling and sample deliveries to prospective customers for testing within their vanadium recovery processing plants. Thereafter, Western would continue defining an increased vanadium resource. The Company holds an exclusive 25-year license to use Ablation, a proven technology that we anticipate will improve the efficiency of the sandstone-hosted vanadium mining process. The license agreement was entered into on March 17, 2015 and expires on March 16, 2040. There are no remaining license fee obligations and there are no future royalties due under the agreement. The Company has the right to sub-license the technology to third parties. The Company may not sell or assign the Ablation license; however, it could be transferred in the sale of Western or the subsidiary holding the license.
 
At any time we may have acquisition or partnering opportunities in various stages of active review, including, for example, our engagement of consultants and advisors to analyze particular opportunities, analysis of technical, financial and other confidential information, submission of indications of interest, participation in preliminary discussions and negotiations and involvement as a bidder in competitive processes.
 
Capital Raising
 
On May 4, 2018, the Company completed a private placement of 909,622 units at a price of CAD $0.68 (USD $0.53) per unit for gross proceeds of CAD $618,543 (USD $481,560). Each unit consisted of one common share and a warrant to purchase one-half of one common share. Each warrant is exercisable at a price of CAD $1.15 and expires two years from the date of issuance.
 
On July 27, 2018, the Company completed a private placement of 2,525,526 units at a price of CAD $0.68 (USD $0.52) per unit for gross proceeds of CAD $1,717,358 (USD $1,319,096). Each unit consisted of one common share and a warrant to purchase one-half of one common share. Each warrant is exercisable at a price of CAD $1.15 and expires two years from the date of issuance.
 
On August 9, 2018, the Company completed a private placement of 1,907,088 units at a price of CAD $0.68 (USD $0.52) per unit for gross proceeds of CAD $1,296,820 (USD $1,000,000). Each unit consisted of one common share and a warrant to purchase one-half of one common share. Each warrant is exercisable at a price of CAD $1.15 and expires two years from the date of issuance.
 
During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company issued an aggregate of 5,342,236 common shares in connection with these private placements.
 
Uranium Production
 
The timing for commencement of production is uncertain. Western continues to position itself for flexibility with the goal of beginning production as expeditiously as possible once market conditions for production of U308 and/or vanadium are favorable. There are multiple variables that will drive the Company’s production strategy which will most likely be dependent upon the increase of term uranium prices. In order to minimize costs, Western plans to commence production at the Sunday Mine Complex due to the substantial existing infrastructure from years of previous production.
Vanadium Production
 
In October 2018, Western announced plans to re-open the Sunday Mine Complex for a vanadium evaluation. The current price continues to represent an attractive price level for Western vanadium sales when coupled with the expectations of a continued tight vanadium market. Western is in discussions with a number of large offshore companies who have existing facilities to recover vanadium. The worldwide shortage of vanadium is impacting many companies around the world and thus making attractive offtake agreements increasingly available for ore production. When the Sunday Mine Complex is opened, ore samples will be sent to the various interested parties for testing in their facilities with goal of negotiating offtake agreements to base load commercial vanadium production.

As of April 1, 2019, Western has completed preliminary mine planning and budgeting, evaluation of equipment and personnel requirements and availability, is pursuing project funding options, and expanding vanadium marketing opportunities. The Sunday Mine Complex Vanadium Project will be commenced within weeks of satisfactory project funding.
 
The primary project goals to be completed during the six to nine months following commencement are: identification of high-grade vanadium zones measured by X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF), technology and sample assay analysis, long-hole drilling and bulk sampling from the extensive underground mine workings of the Sunday Mine Complex, expand resource estimates with new defined high-grade vanadium resource, delivery of samples to various vanadium processors and end-users for analysis, and negotiation of vanadium term contracts to catalyze mine production.
 
Western believes that its mineral resources have a reasonable prospect for economic extraction. However, the Company has not yet completed a Preliminary Economic Assessment (“PEA”).
 
URANIUM MARKET OUTLOOK
 
World demand for clean, reliable, and affordable electricity is growing. Given the expected construction of nuclear reactors and the expected growth of nuclear energy, we believe that the future for uranium is positive. Further, recently announced production cuts by the largest uranium producer in world and the largest uranium producer in North America have signaled a decrease in future supply. The section 232 petition that was filed with the United States Department of Commerce has the potential to increase U.S. domestic uranium production and create economic pricing levels for U.S. domestic producers. We believe these factors will provide the price levels needed to support the additional production and supply that will be required. Currently, excess (secondary) supplies are being drawn down, and additional primary production will be needed to meet long-term demand.
 
Once prices rise, it may be difficult for most suppliers to respond in a timely manner, as it can require many years of permitting and development to bring new mines into production. These lead times will put further upward pressure on prices.
 
Western has a competitive advantage, as our mining properties are permitted and ready to be brought back into production.
 
Despite current market uncertainty and depressed prices, we believe we have begun to see certain early signs of a market recovery; the spot uranium price increased from $22 to almost $28 during 2018. Japanese utilities have restarted 5 nuclear reactors and have a further 21 in the process of restarting (according to the World Nuclear Association (“WNA”)). According to data from the WNA, Chinese utilities continue to aggressively build new reactors and buy uranium, with the goal of having more nuclear capacity than any country except the USA and France by 2020. In total, according to the WNA, there are about 50 new reactors under construction in 13 countries and in all there are about 160 reactors on order or being planned, and over 300 more are proposed.
 
However, in the short- and medium-terms, market challenges remain. The world continues to be oversupplied with uranium, mainly due to large quantities of secondary uranium supplies, high levels of excess inventories, premature reactor shutdowns, delays in new reactor construction, and decreased demand due to Japanese reactors remaining offline for longer than expected. In addition, there is a great deal of uncertainty in uranium prices regarding the timing and level of the recovery, as fundamental, political, technical, and other factors could cause prices to be significantly above or below currently expected ranges.
 
A Section 232 petition was filed on January 17, 2018, requesting the initiation of a Section 232 investigation into whether uranium imports threaten to impair U.S. national security. On July 18, 2018, United States Department of Commerce (“Commerce”) announced the initiation of an investigation to study the national security impact of uranium imports. By statute, Commerce must deliver a report to President Trump to meet a 270-day deadline, thereafter the President has an additional 90 days to make a final determination. It does not appear that the U.S. government shutdown will result in a deadline extension and the investigation will be completed and the report containing the findings and a proposed remedy (if any) will be delivered to President Trump on or before April 15, 2019. Commerce has conducted site visits and is currently evaluating the results of its extensive U.S. Front-End Nuclear Fuel Cycle Survey. While there is no guarantee as to outcome, we believe the petition is compelling given the dynamics of uranium markets, the participation of state-owned and state-subsidized entities which has caused the shutdown of nearly all U.S. uranium production. Further, the question of U.S. national security now hinges upon the degree that counterparties in Russia, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and China have infiltrated the U.S. nuclear fuel cycle. A positive outcome would provide relief for the U.S. uranium industry whereby U.S. domestic uranium production would likely be afforded the opportunity to be sold at a price above production cost and afford a profit. The Section 232 petition sought a remedy effectively setting a quota reserving 25% of the U.S. nuclear market for U.S. uranium production. Western would be among the handful of companies able to generate near-term U.S. uranium production and is able to scale-up production quickly by restarting previously producing mines which are already permitted and developed.
 
OVERVIEW OF THE URANIUM INDUSTRY
 
Spot prices rose from $21 per pound in January 2005 to a high of $136 per pound in June 2007 in anticipation of sharply higher projected demand as a result of a resurgence in nuclear power and the depletion of secondary supplies. Secondary supplies are inventories of uranium not publicly available for sale, they are primarily held by utility companies and governments. The sharp price increase was driven in part by high levels of buying by utility companies, which resulted in most utilities covering their requirements through 2009. A decrease in near-term utility demand coupled with rising levels of supplies from producers and traders led to downward pressure on uranium prices since the third quarter of 2007. A rebound in uranium prices in conjunction with a recovery in commodities in 2010 was curtailed by the Fukushima disaster in Japan.

Since the Fukushima disaster in 2011, uranium prices entered a steady decline until June 2014, when they rebounded slightly and peaked again in March 2015 at $39 per pound. After that peak, prices again began to fall steadily reaching their lowest point of $18 per pound in November 2016 before moving upward in 2017 and completing the year at the higher year over year level of $22 per pound. Uranium prices continue to rebound in 2018 completing the year at $28 per pound.
 
The only significant commercial use for uranium is as a fuel for nuclear power plants for the generation of electricity. According to the WNA, at the end of February 2018, there were 448 nuclear reactors operable worldwide, with annual requirements of about 143.3 million pounds of uranium.
 
From the reports of leading investment banks, the macroeconomic conditions driving uranium prices are as follows:
 

● | WNA reports 57 nuclear reactors under construction with most projects in China, India, Russia, and South Korea.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The restart of Japan’s nuclear reactors – 5 in 2018 and 20 are in the process of being re-activated
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Decrease in primary supply due to leading producers shutting down mining operations that aren’t profitable at current pricing levels (Kazatomprom and Cameco)
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Decreasing secondary supplies (excess reserves and supplies generally held by governments and utilities).
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The U.S. Department of Commerce’s consideration of the Section 232 Uranium Investigation
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Increasing uncovered future uranium demand as nuclear utilities have decreased their contracting
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Across the ten banks and analysts most active in the sector, a term structure of rising uranium spot prices which are significantly above today’s prices are forecast almost across the board from 2019 to 2023. These increases are primarily due to two factors. The first is expected reduction in uranium production due to the currently low prices. The second is continued growth in nuclear energy, fueled primarily by new plants with the greatest number located in China, Russia, and India over the next 5 years. Further recommissioning of nuclear power plants in Japan will add to the total. This should lead to excess reserves and inventories drying up, causing multiple analysts to project a shortage, in the coming years, as historical contracts roll-off.
 
Based upon recent uranium pricing forecasts from leading bankers, we believe that uranium prices will improve enough over the coming years for Western to initiate production. 
 
Vanadium
 
With the exception of the Hansen/Taylor Deposit, most of the Company’s mining assets, including the Sunday Mine Complex, contain vanadium either as a stand-alone product or a co-product to uranium.
 
Conventional and new vanadium applications include steelmaking, grid scale renewable energy storage, high performance batteries, and chemicals.
 
When a very small amount of vanadium is added to steel the hardening effect greatly increases its strength. And while steelmaking accounts for roughly 90% of all vanadium currently consumed, it’s estimated that vanadium is only used in about 9% of all steels today.
 
In a research piece, BMO Capital Markets identified a structural change in the vanadium markets. China, the largest vanadium producer in the world, has seen supply disrupted by environmental monitoring and rules while domestic demand was increasing. During 2017, BMO observed ferrovanadium exports falling by 30% year over year and projected that China would become a net importer of ferrovanadium. In 2018, this forecast was validated as China which had been a net vanadium exporter became a net vanadium importer. On the demand side, China announced a new high strength rebar standard to increase earthquake resistance in February 2018 that became effective on November 1, 2018. On the supply side, in its efforts to fight pollution, Chinese environmental inspections which resulted in the closing of dirty processes in which vanadium recovery was a byproduct. These policy changes were very positive for vanadium prices pushing them to an all-time highs.
 
After steelmaking, the second largest market for vanadium is that of catalysts and chemical applications. Significant new sources of demand for vanadium are also expected to originate from vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFB).
     5

 

The current vanadium market price is $15.25 per pound as of March 29, 2019 which is a decrease from the December 31, 2018 price when the price was $27.75 per pound. Both are significantly higher than the December 31, 2017 price of $9.70 per pound. As a result of structural changes in the market, several market participants are reporting that vanadium demand exceeds vanadium supply and the market is in deficit.
 
Given the substantial appreciation in vanadium prices, the Company is moving forward to monetize its stand-alone vanadium resource rather than as a by-product that provides a co-credit against uranium production.
 
COMPETITION
 
There is global competition for uranium properties, capital, customers and the employment and retention of qualified personnel. We compete with multiple exploration companies for both properties as well as skilled personnel. In the production and marketing of uranium, there are a number of producing entities globally, some of which are government controlled and several of which are significantly larger and better capitalized than we are. Several of these organizations also have substantially greater financial, technical, manufacturing and distribution resources than we have.
 
Our future uranium production will also compete with uranium from secondary supplies, including the sale of uranium inventory held by the U.S. Department of Energy. In addition, there are numerous entities in the market that compete with us for properties and operate in situ recovery (“ISR”) facilities. If we are unable to successfully compete for properties, capital, customers or employees or with alternative uranium sources, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
 
With respect to sales of uranium, the Company competes primarily based on price. We will market uranium to utilities and commodity brokers. We are in direct competition with supplies available from various sources worldwide. We believe we compete with multiple operating uranium companies.
 
With respect to sales of vanadium, the Company will compete primarily based upon availability and secondarily on price. The market is currently in structural deficit which is projected to continue for a period of years. There will be direct competition with primary production, secondary production, and co-production from various companies and processors worldwide as individual entities come online or increase production to address the supply deficit.
 
ENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS AND PERMITTING
 
United States
 
Uranium extraction is regulated by the federal government, states and, in some cases, by Indian tribes. Compliance with such regulation has a material effect on the economics of our operations and the timing of project development. Our primary regulatory costs have been related to obtaining licenses and permits from federal and state agencies before the commencement of production activities. The current environmental regulatory requirements for the ISR industry are well established. Many ISR projects have gone a full life cycle without any significant environmental impact. However, the process can make environmental permitting difficult and timing unpredictable. Western does not plan to utilize an ISR mining process on its properties.
 
Mining Permits are disclosed on a per mine basis in the “Properties” section, below.
 
Reclamation and Restoration Costs and Bonding Requirements
 
At the conclusion of conventional mining, a site is decommissioned and reclaimed. Reclamation involves removing evidence of surface disturbance. The reclamation liabilities of the US mines are subject to legal and regulatory requirements. Estimates of the costs of reclamation are reviewed periodically by the applicable regulatory authorities. The reclamation liability represents the Company’s best estimate of the present value of future reclamation costs in connection with the mineral properties. The Company determined the gross reclamation liabilities at December 31, 2018 of the mineral properties to be approximately $887,400.
 
The Company is required by State regulatory agencies to obtain financial surety relating to certain of its future restoration and reclamation obligations. The Company has provided performance bonds issued for the benefit of the Company in the amount of $887,400 to satisfy such regulatory requirements.
