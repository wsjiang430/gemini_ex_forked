Nebula Genomics
Nebula Genomics focuses on genomics testing technologies, a comprehensive method for analyzing entire genomes, including the genes and chromosomes in DNA. The data obtained from genomic sequencing may help to identify inherited disorders and tendencies, help predict disease risk, help identify expected drug response, and characterize genetic mutations, including those that drive cancer progression. We currently offer Nebula Genomics whole genome sequencing products direct-to-consumers online with plans to sell in food, drug and mass (FDM) retail stores and to provide testing for universities conducting genomic research.
Nebula Genomics provides consumers access to affordable and secure whole genome sequencing. It also provides customers with access to over 300 personalized reports based on their genomic profile. These reports are created utilizing the latest scientific research and provide individual genetic commentary on a broad range of traits and characteristics. Customers can access their reports via Nebula Genomic’s secure online portal. As new scientific discoveries are made, 
customers receive new reports, as well as regular updates to their existing reports, through Nebula Genomic’s subscription model. In addition to the personalized reports, Nebula Genomics provides customers with access to a suite of exploration tools including a gene browser and a gene analysis tool. These tools allow customers to browse their data, search for genetic variants, and analyze their genes.
Nebula Genomic’s solution is powered by the innovations of George Church, Ph.D., Professor of Genetics at Harvard Medical School and Chairman of Nebula Genomic’s Scientific Advisory Board. Dr. Church has pioneered the development of multiple DNA sequencing methods, including molecular multiplexing approaches that enable next generation sequencing (NGS) as well as nanopore sequencing.
Nebula’s whole genome sequencing DNA test decodes approximately 6.4 billion base pairs of the human genome, generating significant amounts of data, which exceeds the amount and quality of data widely offered by most competing services. Through the use of additional tools, the data that is generated can help identify rare genetic mutations and provide consumers other valuable insights into their genes and overall health and wellness. Nebula Genomics also provides consumers with weekly educational content to further their knowledge about the use of their genetic data.
Nebula Genomics was the first company to bring the cost of sequencing a human genome below $300 and became one of the largest direct-to-consumer whole genome sequencing companies. Our goal is to dramatically increase Nebula Genomic’s sales by decreasing price, decreasing turnaround times and increasing distribution to both businesses and consumers, including universities conducting genetic research. We plan to accomplish this by integrating Nebula Genomics’ genomic sequencing into our CLIA-certified labs. 
We are also actively collaborating with G42 Healthcare, a leading Abu Dhabi-based artificial intelligence (AI) health-tech company, to explore several collaborative opportunities including, but not limited to, genomic sequencing, artificial intelligence, sharing of genomic data insights, and obtaining certain advanced certifications. 
ProPhase BioPharma
We formed PBIO in June 2022 for the licensing, development and commercialization of novel drugs, dietary supplements and compounds. Licensed compounds under development currently include Equivir (dietary supplement) and Equivir G (Rx), two broad-based anti-virals, and Linebacker LB-1 and LB-2, two small molecule PIM kinase inhibitors. We also own the exclusive rights to the BE-Smart Esophageal Pre-Cancer Diagnostic Screening test and related IP assets. 
Equivir (dietary supplement) and Equivir G (Rx)
We have exclusive worldwide rights to develop and commercialize Equivir (dietary supplement) and Equivir G (Rx) pursuant to a license agreement with Global BioLife, Inc. (“Global BioLife”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of DSS, Inc. 
Equivir is a blend of polyphenols, which are substances found in many nuts, vegetables and berries. The composition, which contains polyphenols that we believe are Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS), is projected to come in capsule form and be taken much like a multivitamin. The composition is believed to work by helping to improve proper immune function. We plan to pursue commercialization of Equivir as a dietary supplement, leveraging our distribution in over 40,000 food, drug and mass (FDM) retail stores and online direct to consumers. 
 In March 2023, we commenced patient enrollment in a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial of Equivir to evaluate its effect on upper respiratory tract infections. Vedic Lifesciences, a leading clinical research organization, is contracted to conduct the combination prophylactic and therapeutic study, which will be conducted at 12 sites. We currently anticipate trial completion in the third quarter of 2023 and anticipate launching Equivir (dietary supplement) in the United States toward the end of 2023.
Equivir G is a blend of polyphenols similar to Equivir (dietary supplement) with the addition of Gallic acid. We are in the process of formulating its composition and preparing clinical studies. We are pursuing the development of Equivir G as a prescription based antiviral treatment based on data related to the polyphenol formulation in Equivir. Evidence suggests that the blend of polyphenols in Equivir has the potential to block the entry of a virus into host cells, thereby preventing infection and replication in those host cells. Through our development of Equivir G, we believe a similar polyphenol formulation can be developed for the treatment of infection caused by various serotypes of influenza and Rhinovirus, a common viral infectious agent predominantly associated with the common cold in humans. We believe this formulation may also have the potential to block the entry of Ebola virus into host cells, which could prevent Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) and Ebola Hemorrhagic fever (EHF). These diseases are rare, but severe and often fatal in humans, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. Ebola has a 90% death rate, according to the World Health Organization. Equivir has 
also shown in in-vitro studies to combat SARS-COV2. We plan to apply for an Investigational New Drug Application (“IND”) for Equivir G as a prescription-based antiviral treatment. Planned antiviral applications include SARS-COV2, Influenza and Ebola, among others. 
Linebacker (LB-1 and LB-2)
We have exclusive worldwide rights to develop and commercialize LB-1 and LB-2 for the treatment of cancer, inflammatory diseases or symptoms and memory-related syndromes, diseases or symptoms, including dementia and Alzheimer’s disease, pursuant to a license agreement with Global BioLife.
LB-1 and LB-2 were initially developed by Global BioLife in partnership with Global Research and Development Group Sciences (“GRDG”). GRDG and Global BioLife created Linebacker, a multi-faceted therapeutic platform targeting metabolic, neurologic, cancer, and infectious diseases, to mirror the Panacea Project, a U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) program that provides novel, multi-target therapeutics for unmet physiological needs. Linebacker is a modified polyphenol. Linebacker compounds are modified Myricetin, which is a common plant-derived flavonoid. Myricetin exhibits a wide range of activities that include strong antioxidant, anticancer, antidiabetic and anti-inflammatory activities. It displays activities that are related to the central nervous system. Anecdotal evidence suggests that it may be beneficial to protect against diseases such as Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s.
LB-1 is being developed as a potential co-therapy to down-regulate PIM (proviral integration site for moloney murine leukemia virus) kinase, which plays a key role as an oncogene in various cancers including myeloma, leukemia, prostate and breast cancers. In preclinical laboratory studies, LB-1 inhibited PIM, which could potentially slow the growth of the cancer and allow for better efficacy of the co-therapy drug or treatment being used. 
Chemotherapy drugs alone, like TAXOL® (paclitaxel) injection, kill healthy cells alongside tumorous ones. LB-1 is being developed to focus directly on the PIM expressions potentially rendering the cancer cell transcription and replication significantly less effective, so that chemotherapy drugs such as paclitaxel can effectively kill the existing tumor cells. LB-1 may also be developed as a potential standalone post therapy to ensure cancer cells do not regenerate. 
Our initial focus for LB-1 is as a potential co-therapy for the following four drugs:
•Paclitaxel: a drug used to treat breast, ovarian, lung, bladder, prostate, melanoma, esophageal, as well as other types of solid tumor cancers.
•Doxorubicin: a drug used to treat used to treat various forms of cancer, including breast cancer, bladder cancer, Kaposi's sarcoma, lymphoma, and acute lymphocytic leukemia.
•Topotecan: a drug used to treat ovarian cancer.
•Cisplatin: a drug used to treat testicular, ovarian, bladder, head and neck, lung and cervical cancer.
In vitro studies from the initial LB-1 cell line demonstrated the following findings:
•LB-1 Co-Therapy with Paclitaxel 
◦LB-1 alone inhibited cell proliferation at 69.94% at 100uM
◦TAXOL alone inhibited cell proliferation at 41.96% at 200nM
◦LB-1 and TAXOL combined inhibited cell proliferation at 75.5% (100uM of LB1 + 200nM Taxol)
•LB-1 Co-Therapy with Doxorubicin
◦LB-1 alone inhibited cell proliferation at 69.66% at 100uM
◦Doxorubicin alone inhibited cell proliferation at 51.6% at 2000nM
◦LB-1 and Doxorubicin combined inhibited cell proliferation at 86.95% (100uM of LB1 + 2000nM Doxorubicin)
•LB-1 Co-Therapy with Topotecan
◦LB-1 alone inhibited cell proliferation at 69.54% at 100uM
◦Topotecan alone inhibited cell proliferation at 58.27% at 2000nM
◦LB-1 and Topotecan combined inhibited cell proliferation at 97.18% (100uM of LB1 + 2000nM Topotecan)
•LB-1 Co-Therapy with Cisplatin
◦LB-1 alone inhibited cell proliferation at 72.33% at 100uM
◦Cisplatin alone inhibited cell proliferation at 22.74% at 30uM
◦LB-1 and Cisplatin combined inhibited cell proliferation at 82.48% (100uM of LB1 + 30uM Cisplatin)
Additional preclinical studies of the Linebacker portfolio with each of the four drugs described above is currently being conducted by a major U.S. university. 
In January 2023, REPROCELL completed an independent review of LB-1, which included testing of 25 cell lines with LB-1, and confirmed previous in vitro studies conducted by Charles River. These cell lines confirmed efficacy of LB-1 on ovarian, kidney, colon and lung adenocarcinoma/small cells.
PBIO is also party to a two-year collaborative agreement with Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School to further the research LB-1. This collaboration provides for year 1 and year 2 research plans. The ongoing studies are focused on identifying the most effective combination of cancer cell lines and agents with LB-1. Initial focus areas include hepatic, colon and breast cancer, and initial therapy agents include Topotecan and Doxorubicin. 
Additionally, selection has been confirmed for animal studies. Dana-Farber/Harvard will deploy two animal xenograft models, with and without radiation. The current goal for completion of the animal studies is the end of second quarter of 2023, with data expected to be published in the third quarter of 2023. Initial Good Manufacturing Practices (“GMP”) for LB-1 is expected to commence in the third quarter of 2023, in tandem with toxicology studies.
We currently anticipate initiating the preclinical requirements for an IND application submission for LB-1 in the fourth quarter of 2023. These requirements include:
•Study Protocol Design: select optimized co-therapy combo from animal study and complete the protocol design for IND submission;
•Toxicity Testing: toxicological studies on small animals according to study protocol;
•Dosing Studies: dosing studies on small animals according to study protocol; and 
•Large Animal Studies: combined therapy studies on large animals according to study protocol.
We aim to submit our IND application for LB-1 in mid-2024. We plan to operate our own Phase 1 safety study for LB-1 and will seek a strategic partner for future development following Phase 1. 
ProPhase BioPharma has formed an advisory board with Daryl Thompson as its founding member. Daryl Thompson is President and Director of Scientific Initiatives at GRDG and is a biochemist twice nominated for the Nobel Prize in 2015 and 2016 for his work in cutting-edge organic and carbohydrate chemistry.
BE-Smart Esophageal Pre-Cancer Diagnostics Screening Test 
We also own the worldwide exclusive rights to the BE-Smart Esophageal Pre-Cancer diagnostics screening test and related intellectual property assets. The BE-Smart test is aimed at early detection of esophageal cancer. It remains under development but has already been tested by an independent test lab, mProbe, Inc. (“mProbe”), on over 200 human samples and has shown greater than 99% sensitivity and specificity to detect protein expressions in cells that are at high risk of becoming cancerous. mProbe, Inc., a precision health and medicine company utilizing clinical proteomics in the oncology space in conjunction with Dr. Christopher Hartley of the prestigious Mayo Clinic, has been utilizing a small sample of tissue collected during endoscopies to help us confirm and optimize the BE-Smart Test. The initial data appears to demonstrate accuracy and reproducibility as well as identification of potential biomarkers for therapeutic drug discovery to treat esophageal cancer. 
In March 2023, we announced a collaboration with mProbe and Dr. Christopher Hartley of Mayo Clinic for the continued development of its BE-Smart Esophageal Pre-Cancer diagnostic screening test. We are pursuing initial commercialization of the BE-Smart test as an LDT (Laboratory Developed Test) and RUO (Research Use Only) for the third quarter of 2023 with full commercialization backed by insurance expected by mid-2024.
According to the National Institute of Health, over 20 million endoscopies are performed every year in the United States; approximately 2 million of these procedures are done on patients with Barret’s Esophagus, which is a condition in 
which the flat pink lining of the swallowing tube that connects the mouth to the stomach (esophagus) becomes damaged by acid reflux, which causes the lining to thicken and become red. In patients with Barrett’s Esophagus, one in two hundred will develop esophageal adenocarcinoma. Esophageal cancer is highly lethal and deemed as the sixth cause of cancer death worldwide. The overall five-year survival rate is less than 20%.
The BE-Smart test is being developed to provide health care providers and patients with data to help determine treatment options, including whether patients not believed to be at risk for esophageal cancer should continue to be monitored or, alternatively, to provide patients who might otherwise have been undiagnosed early treatment before esophageal cells become cancerous. The goal of widespread adoption of the BE-Smart test would allow health care providers to initiate potentially lifesaving early treatment processes such as an ablation procedure to remove the precancerous cells. This diagnostic test, once fully validated, could also significantly reduce unnecessary endoscopies as well as offer peace of mind to patients who are suffering with Barret’s syndrome who are at greater risk of esophageal cancer.
Pharmaloz Contract Manufacturing 
Our wholly-owned subsidiary, PMI, is a full-service contract manufacturer and private label developer of a broad range of non-GMO, organic and natural-based cough drops and lozenges and OTC drug and dietary supplement products. PMI provides consumer product development, pre-commercialization services, production, warehousing and distribution services for its customers. Our manufacturing facility, which is located in Lebanon, Pennsylvania, is registered with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) and is certified organic and kosher.
As part of the sale of our former Cold-EEZE® business in March 2017, PMI entered into a manufacturing agreement with Mylan Consumer Healthcare Inc. (formerly known as Meda Consumer Healthcare Inc.) (“MCH”) and Mylan Inc. (together with MCH, “Mylan”) to supply various Cold-EEZE® lozenge products to Mylan following the sale for a period of five years with annual renewal options. Pursuant to the terms of the manufacturing agreement, Mylan (or an affiliate or designee) purchased the inventory of the Company’s Cold-EEZE® brand and product line, and PMI agreed to manufacture certain products for Mylan, as described in the manufacturing agreement, at prices that reflect current market conditions for such products and include an agreed upon mark-up on our costs. On May 1, 2021, the manufacturing agreement was assigned by Mylan to Meda Consumer Healthcare, Inc. (“Meda”) in connection with Meda’s acquisitions of certain assets from Mylan, including the Cold-EEZE® brand and product line. In November 2022, Meda provided a notice to extend the original agreement for another year through March 2024.
In February 2023, we announced the acquisition of new equipment, which is expected to double our current capacity for pouch packaging by the second quarter of 2023, to meet the growing demand for our products and services. PMI is also planning for expansion of its lozenge manufacturing business. PMI had two new customers enter full production in 2022, resulting in the addition of over 3.5 million units, mostly in the fourth quarter of 2022. PMI formulated and launched seven new products for new and existing customers, totaling 1.75 million units in 2022. Additionally, PMI added three new customers, which are expected to enter full production in 2023, representing an estimated 1.0 million additional units.
TK Supplements
Our TK Supplements® product line is dedicated to promoting better health, energy and sexual vitality. Each of our herbal supplements is researched to determine the optimum blend of ingredients to ensure our customers receive premium quality products. To achieve this, we formulate with the highest quality ingredients derived from nature and ingredients enhanced by science. Our TK Supplements® product line includes Legendz XL®, a male sexual enhancement and Triple Edge XL®, an energy and stamina booster.
Legendz XL® has distribution in Rite Aid, Walgreens and other retailers, and via ecommerce, and is now achieving broader distribution at CVS and Walmart. Triple Edge XL®, is now gaining retailer acceptance as well.
In 2022 we restaged Triple Edge XL from a 56ct to a 20ct at CVS making the retail price more in line with competition. The result has been a double digit increase in consumer sales and a 40% expansion increase in the number of stores carrying the item. Based on performance Triple Edge XL is being reviewed for authorization in other major pharmacies.
Fluctuations in our Business
Our diagnostic services revenues are subject to fluctuations in COVID-19 testing demand. The demand for COVID-19 tests has been, and ProPhase expects it to continue to be, highly volatile, primarily driven by the emergence and severity of new variants, which are unpredictable.
Our personal genomics kit sales are impacted by seasonal holiday demand. We expect to generate greater revenues from this business during the first quarter of our fiscal year. While kits sales increase during the holiday season (fourth quarter), we will generally recognize revenue when the customer sends in their kit to our laboratory for processing and a genetic report is delivered, which we expect will occur in the following fiscal quarter.
Our contract manufacturing revenues are subject to seasonal fluctuations. As the majority of products that we manufacture for our customers are OTC healthcare and cold remedy products, our revenues tend to be higher in the first, third and fourth quarters during the cold season. Generally, a cold season is defined as the period from September to March when the incidence of the common cold rises as a consequence of the change in weather and other factors. Revenues are generally at their lowest levels during the second quarter when contract manufacturing demand generally declines.
Intellectual Property
We do not currently own any patents. We maintain various trademarks for our TK Supplements® products including Legendz XL® and Triple Edge XL®. We maintain a trademark for our genomic testing, Nebula Genomics®.

Government Regulation
Our business is subject to extensive governmental regulation by various federal, state, and local agencies as described below.
U.S. Food and Drug Administration
Diagnostic Testing Services
The FDA has regulatory responsibility for diagnostic testing instruments, test kits, reagents and other devices used by clinical laboratories. The FDA enforces laws and regulations that govern the development, testing, manufacturing, performance, labeling, advertising, marketing, distribution and surveillance of diagnostic products, including COVID-19 diagnostics authorized by the FDA under and EUA, and it regularly inspects and reviews the manufacturing processes and product performance of diagnostic products.
Since 2014, there have been ongoing discussions and advocacy between stakeholders, including the clinical laboratory industry, the FDA, and Congress, about potential FDA regulation of laboratory-developed tests (LDTs), which are assays developed and performed in-house by clinical laboratories that can be made available to the public without pre-market review by the FDA (although COVID-19 LDTs are currently subject to FDA pre-market requirements, as a consequence of the national health emergency). Various regulatory and legislative proposals are under consideration, including some that could increase general FDA oversight of clinical laboratories and LDTs. The outcome and ultimate impact of such proposals on our business is difficult to predict at this time.
Pharmaceutical Regulation
The manufacturing and distribution of pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the federal government, primarily through the FDA and the Drug Enforcement Administration (“DEA”), and to a lesser extent by state and local government agencies. The Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FFDCA”) and other federal statutes and regulations govern or influence the manufacture, labeling, testing, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion of OTC pharmaceutical products.
Facilities used in the manufacture, packaging, labeling and repackaging of drug products, including OTC drug products, must be registered with the FDA and are subject to FDA inspection to ensure that drug products are manufactured in accordance with current Good Manufacturing Practice (“cGMPs”).
FDA approval is required before any “new drug” may be marketed, including new formulations, strengths, dosage forms and generic versions of previously approved drugs. Generally, to obtain FDA approval of a “new drug” a company must file a NDA or Abbreviated New Drug Application (“ANDA”).
Under the OTC monograph system, selected OTC drugs are generally recognized as safe and effective and do not require the submission and approval of an NDA or ANDA prior to marketing.
The FDA OTC monographs include well-known ingredients and specify requirements for permitted indications, required warnings and precautions, allowable combinations of ingredients and dosage levels. Drug products marketed under the OTC monograph system must conform to specific quality, formula and labeling requirements; however, these products can be developed and marketed without prior FDA approval unlike products requiring a submission and approval of an ANDA or NDA. In general, it is less costly to develop and bring to market a product regulated under the OTC monograph system. From time to time, adequate information may become available to the FDA regarding certain prescription drug products that will allow the reclassification of those products as no longer requiring the approval of an ANDA or NDA prior to marketing. For this reason, there may be increased competition and lower profitability related to a particular OTC-switch product should it be reclassified to the OTC monograph system.
Noncompliance with applicable requirements can result in product recalls, seizure of products, injunctions, suspension of production and/or distribution, refusal of the government or third parties to enter into contracts with us, withdrawal or suspension of the applicable regulator’s review of our drug applications, civil penalties and criminal fines, and disgorgement of profits.
Dietary Supplement Regulation
The FDA regulates dietary supplements under a different set of regulations than those covering “conventional” foods and drug products (prescription and OTC). Under the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (the “DSHEA”), which was passed in 1994, dietary supplements that were in commerce prior to 1994 are broadly presumed safe. For these supplements, manufacturers do not need to register their products with the FDA nor get FDA approval before producing or selling them. Manufacturers must make sure that product label information is truthful and not misleading. For these products, the FDA is responsible for taking action against any unsafe or misbranded dietary supplement product after it reaches the market. All new ingredients marketed within dietary supplements after 1994 that are not found in food must meet a stricter set of regulations and notification prior to release in the marketplace.
In June 2007, pursuant to the authority granted by the FFDCA as amended by DSHEA, the FDA published detailed cGMP regulations that govern the manufacturing, packaging, labeling, and holding operations of dietary supplement manufacturers. The cGMP regulations, among other things, impose significant recordkeeping requirements on manufacturers. The cGMP requirements are in effect for all manufacturers, and the FDA is conducting inspections of dietary supplement manufacturers pursuant to these requirements. The failure of a manufacturing facility to comply with the cGMP regulations renders products manufactured in such facility “adulterated” and subjects such products and the manufacturer to a variety of potential FDA enforcement actions.
In addition, under the Food Safety Modernization Act, (the “FSMA”), which was enacted on January 2, 2011, the manufacturing of dietary ingredients contained in dietary supplements are subject to similar or even more burdensome manufacturing requirements. The FSMA requires importers of food, including dietary supplements and dietary ingredients, to conduct verification activities to ensure that the food they might import meets applicable domestic requirements. The FSMA also expands the reach and regulatory powers of the FDA with respect to the production and importation of food, including dietary supplements. The expanded reach and regulatory powers include the FDA’s ability to order mandatory recalls, administratively detain domestic products, require certification of compliance with domestic requirements for imported foods associated with safety issues and administratively revoke manufacturing facility registrations, effectively enjoining manufacturing of dietary ingredients and dietary supplements without judicial process. The regulation of dietary supplements may increase or become more restrictive in the future.
Under FFDCA, dietary supplements are subject to both adulteration and misbranding provisions. Adulterated products are those that contain unlisted ingredients or are not prepared or packaged under the FDA cGMPs for dietary supplements and misbranded products are those with false or misleading labels. Adulterated or misbranded products are subject to the full range of civil and criminal enforcement measures under the FFDCA and all violations of FFDCA are subject to criminal enforcement at the FDA’s discretion.
We are also subject to the Dietary Supplement and Nonprescription Drug Consumer Protection Act, which was passed in 2006 to amend the FFDCA with respect to serious adverse event reporting for dietary supplements and nonprescription drugs, among other things. The law requires that the manufacturer, packer or distributor of a dietary supplement or OTC drug notify the FDA of all serious adverse events it receives associated with their dietary supplement or OTC product within 15 business days. Serious adverse events are defined as those that result in death, a life-threatening experience, in-patient hospitalization, a persistent or significant disability or incapacity, congenital anomaly or birth defect, as well as situations where medical/surgical intervention is required to prevent the previously listed events.
Consumer Product Safety Commission
Under the Poison Prevention Packaging Act (“PPPA”), the Consumer Product Safety Commission (“CPSC”) has authority to require that certain dietary supplements and certain pharmaceuticals have child-resistant packaging to help reduce the incidence of accidental poisonings. The CPSC has published regulations requiring iron-containing dietary supplements and various pharmaceuticals to have child resistant packaging and has established rules for testing the effectiveness of child-resistant packaging and for ensuring senior adult effectiveness.  The manufacturer of any product that is subject to any CPSC rule, ban, standard or regulation must also certify that, based on a reasonable testing program, the product complies with CPSC requirements.
Federal Trade Commission
Advertising of our products in the United States is subject to regulation by the Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”) under the Federal Trade Commission Act (the “FTC Act”). Under the FTC’s Substantiation Doctrine, an advertiser is required to have a “reasonable basis” for all objective product claims before the claims are made. Failure to adequately substantiate claims may be considered either deceptive or unfair practices. Pursuant to this FTC requirement, we are required to have adequate substantiation for all material advertising claims that we make for any products sold in the United States.
In recent years, the FTC has initiated numerous investigations of and actions against companies that sell dietary supplements. The FTC has issued guidance to assist companies in understanding and complying with its substantiation requirement. We believe that we have adequate substantiation for all material advertising claims that we make for our products in the United States, and we believe that we have organized the documentation to support our advertising and promotional practices in compliance with these guidelines. However, no assurance can be given that the FTC would reach the same conclusion if it were to review or question our substantiation for our advertising claims in the United States.
The FTC may enforce compliance with the law in a variety of ways, both administratively and judicially, using compulsory process, cease and desist orders, and injunctions. FTC enforcement can result in orders requiring, among other things, limits on advertising, corrective advertising, consumer redress, divestiture of assets, rescission of contracts, and such other relief as the agency deems necessary to protect the public. Violation of these orders could result in substantial financial or other penalties. Although we have not been the subject of any action by the FTC, no assurance can be given that the FTC will not question our advertising or other operations in the United States in the future. Any action in the future by the FTC could materially and adversely affect our ability to successfully market our products in the United States.
Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act of 1967 and the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA)
The performance of laboratory diagnostic services is subject to extensive U.S. regulation, and many of these statutes and regulations have not been interpreted by the courts. CLIA extends federal oversight to virtually all physician practices performing clinical laboratory testing and to clinical laboratories operating in the United States by requiring that they be certified by the federal government or, in the case of clinical laboratories, by a federally approved accreditation agency. Standards for testing under CLIA are based on the complexity of the tests performed by the laboratory, with tests classified as “high complexity,” “moderate complexity,” or “waived.” Laboratories performing high-complexity testing are required to meet more stringent requirements than moderate-complexity laboratories. The sanction for failure to comply with CLIA requirements may be suspension, revocation or limitation of a laboratory’s CLIA certificate, which is necessary to conduct business, as well as significant fines and/or criminal penalties.
State and Laboratory Licensure 
We are subject to regulation under state law. State laws, including those of New Jersey and New York, require that laboratories and/or laboratory personnel meet certain qualifications, specify certain quality controls or require maintenance of certain records. For example, New York laws and regulations establish standards for: quality management systems; qualifications, responsibilities, and training; facility design and resource management; pre-analytic, analytic (including validation and quality control), and post-analytic systems; and quality assessments and improvements. The New York state laboratory laws and regulations are more stringent than CLIA. New York law mandates proficiency testing for laboratories licensed under New York law, regardless of whether such laboratories are located in New York. If a laboratory is out of compliance with New York statutory or regulatory standards, the New York State Department of Health, or NYSDOH, may suspend, limit, revoke or annul the laboratory’s New York license, censure the holder of the license or assess civil money penalties. Statutory or regulatory noncompliance may result in a laboratory’s operator being found guilty of a misdemeanor under New York law. NYSDOH also must approve laboratory developed tests before the test is offered in New York. Should we be found out of compliance with New York or any other applicable laboratory standards of practice, we could be subject to such sanctions, which could harm our business. Applicable statutes and regulations could also be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that would adversely affect our business. Potential sanctions for violation of these statutes and regulations include significant fines and the suspension or loss of various licenses, certificates and authorizations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, compliance with future legislation could impose additional requirements on us, which may be costly.
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”) was designed to address issues related to the security and confidentiality of health information and to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the healthcare system by facilitating the electronic exchange of information in certain financial and administrative transactions. These regulations apply to health plans and healthcare providers that conduct standard transactions electronically and healthcare clearinghouses (covered entities). Six such regulations include: (i) the Transactions and Code Sets Rule; (ii) the Privacy Rule; (iii) the Security Rule; (iv) the Standard Unique Employer Identifier Rule, which requires the use of a unique employer identifier in connection with certain electronic transactions; (v) the National Provider Identifier Rule, which requires the use of a unique healthcare provider identifier in connection with certain electronic transactions; and (vi) the Health Plan Identifier Rule, which required the use of a unique health plan identifier in connection with certain electronic transactions. We believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with each of the HIPAA Rules identified above.
The Privacy Rule regulates the use and disclosure of protected health information (“PHI”) by covered entities. It also sets forth certain rights that an individual has with respect to his or her PHI maintained by a covered entity, such as the right to access or amend certain records containing PHI or to request restrictions on the use or disclosure of PHI. The Privacy Rule requires covered entities to contractually bind third parties, known as business associates, in the event that they perform an activity or service for or on behalf of the covered entity that involves the creation, receipt, maintenance, or transmission of PHI. We believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with the requirements of the HIPAA Privacy Rule.
On December 12, 2018, HHS issued a request for information (RFI) seeking input from the public on how the HIPAA regulations and the Privacy Rule, in particular, could be modified to amend existing, or impose additional, obligations relating to the processing of PHI. Subsequent to the RFI, on January 21, 2021, HHS published a notice of proposed rulemaking (“NPRM”) containing potential modifications to the Privacy Rule addressing standards that may impede the transition to value-based health care. We are monitoring the NPRM process. If modifications to the Privacy Rule are adopted, they may impact our compliance obligations under HIPAA.
The U.S. Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”), which was enacted in February 2009, with regulations effective on September 23, 2013, strengthened and expanded the HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules and their restrictions on use and disclosure of PHI. HITECH includes, but is not limited to, prohibitions on exchanging PHI for remuneration and additional restrictions on the use of PHI for marketing. HITECH also fundamentally changes a business associate’s obligations by imposing a number of Privacy Rule requirements and a majority of Security Rule provisions directly on business associates that were previously only directly applicable to covered entities. Moreover, HITECH requires covered entities to provide notice to individuals, HHS, and, as applicable, the media when unsecured PHI is breached, as that term is defined by HITECH. Business associates are similarly required to notify covered entities of 
a breach. We believe our policies and procedures are fully compliant with HIPAA as modified by the HITECH requirements.
The administrative simplification provisions of HIPAA mandate the adoption of standard unique identifiers for healthcare providers. The intent of these provisions is to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the electronic transmission of health information. The National Provider Identifier Rule requires that all HIPAA-covered healthcare providers, whether they are individuals or organizations, must obtain an NPI to identify themselves in standard HIPAA transactions. NPI replaces the unique provider identification number and other provider numbers previously assigned by payers and other entities for the purpose of identifying healthcare providers in standard electronic transactions. The Company believes that it is in compliance with the HIPAA National Provider Identifier Rule in all material respects.
The Health Plan Identifier (“HPID”) is a unique identifier designed to furnish a standard way to identify health plans in electronic transactions. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) published the final rule adopting the HPID for health plans required by HIPAA on September 12, 2012. Effective October 31, 2014, CMS announced a delay, until further notice, in enforcement of regulations pertaining to health plan enumeration and use of the HPID in HIPAA transactions adopted in the HPID final rule. On October 28, 2019, CMS published a final rule rescinding the adopted standard unique HPID and implementation specifications and requirements for its use and other entity identifier and implementation specifications for its use, effective December 27, 2019. This delay remains in effect. We will continue to monitor future developments related to the HPID and respond accordingly.
Violations of the HIPAA provisions could result in civil and/or criminal penalties, including significant fines and up to 10 years in prison. HITECH also significantly strengthened HIPAA enforcement by increasing the civil penalty amounts that may be imposed, requiring HHS to conduct periodic audits to confirm compliance and authorizing state attorneys general to bring civil actions seeking either injunctions or damages in response to violations of the HIPAA privacy and security regulations that affect the privacy of state residents.
The total cost associated with meeting the ongoing requirements of HIPAA and HITECH is not expected to be material to our operations or cash flows. However, future regulations and interpretations of HIPAA and HITECH could impose significant costs on us.
In addition to the HIPAA regulations described above, numerous other data protection, privacy and similar laws govern the confidentiality, security, use, and disclosure of personal information. These laws vary by jurisdiction, but they most commonly regulate or restrict the collection, use, and disclosure of medical and financial information and other personal information. In the U.S., some state laws are more restrictive and, therefore, are not preempted by HIPAA. Penalties for violation of these laws may include sanctions against a laboratory’s licensure, as well as civil and/or criminal penalties.
Congress and state legislatures also have been considering new legislation relating to privacy and data protection. For example, on June 28, 2018, the California legislature passed the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), which became effective January 1, 2020. The CCPA created new transparency requirements and granted California residents several new rights with regard to their personal information. In addition, in November 2020, California voters approved the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”) ballot initiative, which introduced significant amendments to the CCPA and established and funded a dedicated California privacy regulator, the CPPA. The amendments introduced by the CPRA went into effect on January 1, 2023, and new implementing regulations are expected to be introduced by the CPPA. Failure to comply with the CCPA may result in, among other things, significant civil penalties and injunctive relief, or potential statutory or actual damages. In addition, California residents have the right to bring a private right of action in connection with certain types of incidents. These claims may result in significant liability and potential damages. We have implemented processes to manage compliance with the CCPA and continue to assess the impact of the CPRA on our business as additional information and guidance becomes available.
Effective August 14, 2020, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration of HHS (“SAMHSA”) announced the finalization of proposed changes to the Confidentiality of Substance Use Disorder Patient Records regulation, 42 Code of Federal Regulations Part 2. This regulation protects the confidentiality of patient records relating to the identity, diagnosis, prognosis, or treatment that are maintained in connection with the performance of any federally assisted program or activity relating to substance use disorder education, prevention, training, treatment, rehabilitation, or research. Under the regulation, patient identifying information may only be released with the individual’s written consent, subject to certain limited exceptions. The latest changes to this regulation seek to better facilitate care coordination, while maintaining more stringent confidentiality of substance use disorder information. We have adopted changes to our policies and procedures necessary for compliance.
Genetic Privacy and Testing Laws
We are subject to myriad laws designed to establish safeguards regarding the conduct of genomic testing and analysis and to protect against the misuse of genetic information and human biological specimens, collectively, “samples”, from which genetic information can be derived. These laws vary in their scope and in the nature of their requirements and restrictions. For example, certain genetic privacy laws prohibit the retention of samples after performing a genomic analysis in addition to prohibiting the use or disclosure of genetic information for certain purposes, such as research, without appropriate informed consent from the individual or without sufficient anonymization. The applicability of such informed consent requirements may also depend on the identifiability of the genetic information or sample and the purposes of which it is used. Other laws may impose additional requirements, including requirements regarding institutional review board review and approval for certain research uses of genetic information or samples requirements to implement certain security controls in connection with the transfer of genetic information. We must comply with such genetic privacy and testing laws in our collection, use, disclosure, and retention of genetic information and samples.
Other Regulatory Oversight
We are also subject to regulation under various state, local, and international laws that include provisions governing, among other things, the formulation, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, advertising, and distribution of dietary supplements and OTC drugs. For example, Proposition 65 in the State of California is a list of substances deemed to pose a risk of carcinogenicity or birth defects at or above certain levels. If any such ingredient exceeds the permissible levels in a dietary supplement, cosmetic, or drug, the product may be lawfully sold in California only if accompanied by a prominent warning label alerting consumers that the product contains an ingredient linked to cancer or birth defect risk. Private attorney general actions as well as California attorney general actions may be brought against non-compliant parties and can result in substantial costs and fines.
Reimbursement 
Billing for diagnostic services is complex and subject to extensive and non-uniform rules and administrative requirements. Depending on the billing arrangement and applicable law, we bill various payers, such as patients, insurance companies, Medicare, Medicaid, other government agencies and employer groups. Failure to accurately bill for our services could have a material adverse effect on our business.
We bill third-party payors, both commercial and government, using Current Procedural Terminology (“CPT”) codes, which are published by the American Medical Association (“AMA”). In April 2014, Congress passed the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 (“PAMA”), which included substantial changes to the way in which clinical laboratory services are priced and paid under Medicare. On June 23, 2016, CMS published the final rule implementing the reporting and rate-setting requirements. Under PAMA, laboratories that receive the majority of their Medicare revenue from payments made under the CLFS or the Physician Fee Schedule are required to report to CMS, beginning in 2017 and every three years thereafter (or annually for an advanced diagnostic laboratory test (“ADLT")), private payor payment rates and volumes for clinical diagnostic laboratory tests, or CDLTs. Laboratories that fail to report the required payment information may be subject to substantial civil monetary penalties. We do not believe that any of our tests meet the current definition of ADLTs. We therefore report private payor rates for our tests every three years.
As required under PAMA, CMS uses the data reported by laboratories to develop Medicare payment rates for laboratory tests equal to the volume-weighted median of the private payor payment rates. For tests furnished on or after January 1, 2019, Medicare payments for CDLTs are based upon reported private payor rates. For a CDLT that is assigned a new or substantially revised CPT code, the initial payment rate is assigned using the gap-fill methodology, as under prior law.
On December 20, 2019, President Trump signed the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, which included the Laboratory Access for Beneficiaries Act (“LAB Act”). The LAB Act delayed by one year the reporting of payment data under PAMA for CDLTs that are not ADLTs until the first quarter of 2021. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”), which was signed into law on March 27, 2020, delayed the reporting period by an additional year, until the first quarter of 2022. On December 10, 2021, the Protecting Medicare and American Farmers from Sequester Cuts Act (S. 610) further delayed the reporting requirement. On December 29, 2022, Section 4114 of Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023 again delayed the next data reporting period for CDLTs that are not ADLTs. The next data reporting period of January 1, 2024 through March 31, 2024, will be based on the original data collection period of January 1, 2019 through June 30, 2019.
In addition, under PAMA, as amended by the LAB Act, any reduction to a particular payment rate resulting from the new methodology is limited to 10% per test per year in 2020 and to 15% per test per year in each of the years 2021 through 2023. The CARES Act delayed the 15% cut scheduled to take effect on January 1, 2021, for one year.
Fraud and Abuse Laws and Regulations
Existing U.S. laws governing federal healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, as well as similar state laws, impose a variety of broadly described fraud and abuse prohibitions on healthcare providers, including clinical laboratories. These laws are interpreted liberally and enforced aggressively by multiple government agencies, including the U.S. Department of Justice, OIG and various state agencies. Historically, the clinical laboratory industry has been the focus of major governmental enforcement initiatives. The U.S. government’s enforcement efforts have been conducted under regulations such as HIPAA, which includes several provisions related to fraud and abuse enforcement, including the establishment of a program to coordinate and fund U.S., state and local law enforcement efforts, and the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, which includes requirements directed at Medicaid fraud, including increased spending on enforcement and financial incentives for states to adopt false claims act provisions similar to the U.S. False Claims Act. Amendments to the False Claims Act, and other enhancements to the U.S. fraud and abuse laws enacted as part of the ACA, have further increased fraud and abuse enforcement efforts and compliance risks. For example, the ACA established an obligation to report and refund overpayments from Medicare or Medicaid within 60 days of identification (whether or not paid through any fault of the recipient); failure to comply with this requirement can give rise to additional liability under the False Claims Act and Civil Monetary Penalties statute.
The U.S. Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits knowingly providing anything of value in return for, or to induce the referral of, Medicare, Medicaid or other U.S. healthcare program business. Violations can result in imprisonment, fines, penalties, and/or exclusion from participation in U.S. healthcare programs. The OIG has published “safe harbor” regulations that specify certain arrangements that are protected from prosecution under the Anti-Kickback Statute if all conditions of the relevant safe harbor are met. Failure to fit within a safe harbor does not necessarily constitute a violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute; rather, the arrangement would be subject to scrutiny by regulators and prosecutors and would be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Many states have their own Medicaid anti-kickback laws, and several states also have anti-kickback laws that apply to all payers (i.e., not just government healthcare programs).
From time to time, the OIG issues alerts and other guidance on certain practices in the healthcare industry that implicate the Anti-Kickback Statute or other fraud and abuse laws. OIG Special Fraud Alerts and Advisory Opinions relevant to the Company set forth a number of practices allegedly engaged in by some clinical laboratories and healthcare providers that raise issues under the U.S. fraud and abuse laws, including the Anti-Kickback Statute. These practices include: (i) providing employees to furnish valuable services for physicians (other than collecting patient specimens for testing) that are typically the responsibility of the physicians’ staff; (ii) offering certain laboratory services at prices below fair market value in return for referrals of other tests that are billed to Medicare at higher rates; (iii) providing free testing to physicians’ managed care patients in situations where the referring physicians benefit from such reduced laboratory utilization; (iv) providing free pickup and disposal of biohazardous waste for physicians for items unrelated to a laboratory’s testing services; (v) providing general-use facsimile machines or computers to physicians that are not exclusively used in connection with the laboratory services; (vi) providing free testing for healthcare providers, their families and their employees (i.e., so-called “professional courtesy” testing); (vii) compensation paid by laboratories to physicians for blood specimen processing and for submitting patient data to registries; and (viii) the provision of discounts on laboratory services billed to customers in return for the referral of U.S. healthcare program business.
In addition to the Anti-Kickback Statute, in October 2018, the U.S. enacted the Eliminating Kickbacks in Recovery Act of 2018 (“EKRA”), as part of the Substance Use-Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment for Patients and Communities Act (the “SUPPORT Act”). EKRA is an all-payer anti-kickback law that makes it a criminal offense to pay any remuneration to induce referrals to, or in exchange for, patients using the services of a recovery home, a substance use clinical treatment facility, or laboratory. Although it appears that EKRA was intended to reach patient brokering and similar arrangements to induce patronage of substance use recovery and treatment, the language in EKRA is broadly written. As drafted, an EKRA prohibition on incentive compensation to sales employees is inconsistent with the federal anti-kickback statute and regulations, which permit payment of employee incentive compensation, a practice that is common in the industry. Only one court has addressed the application of EKRA. That case was decided by the United States District Court of Hawaii and involved a lawsuit between a laboratory and an employee. The Court ruled that the commission-based compensation provisions of the laboratory employee’s contract did not violate EKRA. Although this may be a favorable interpretation of EKRA for laboratory compensation structures, we cannot be 
assured that courts in our jurisdiction will reach the same conclusion or that the decision will not be overturned if there is an appeal. Significantly, EKRA permits the U.S. Department of Justice to issue regulations clarifying EKRA’s exceptions or adding additional exceptions, but such regulations have not yet been issued. We are working through our trade association to address the scope of EKRA and are seeking clarification or correction.
Enrollment and re-enrollment in U.S. healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, are subject to certain program integrity requirements intended to protect the programs from fraud, waste, and abuse. In September 2019, CMS published a final rule implementing program integrity enhancements to provider enrollment requiring Medicare, Medicaid, and Children’s Health Insurance Program (“CHIP”) providers and suppliers to disclose on an enrollment application or a revalidation application any current or previous direct or indirect affiliation with a provider or supplier that (1) has uncollected debt; (2) has been or is subject to a payment suspension under a federal health care program; (3) has been or is excluded by the OIG from Medicare, Medicaid, or CHIP; or (4) has had its Medicare, Medicaid, or CHIP billing privileges denied or revoked. This rule permits CMS to deny enrollment based on such an affiliation when CMS determines that the affiliation poses an undue risk of fraud, waste, or abuse. CMS is phasing in this new affiliation disclosure requirement.
Under another U.S. statute, known as the Stark Law or “physician self-referral” prohibition, physicians who have a financial or a compensation relationship with a commercial laboratory may not, unless an exception applies, refer Medicare or Medicaid patients for testing to the laboratory, regardless of the intent of the parties. Similarly, laboratories may not bill Medicare or Medicaid for services furnished pursuant to a prohibited self-referral. There are several Stark Law exceptions that are relevant to arrangements involving clinical laboratories, including: (i) fair market value compensation for the provision of items or services; (ii) payments by physicians to a laboratory for commercial laboratory services; (iii) ancillary services (including laboratory services) provided within the referring physician’s own office, if certain criteria are satisfied; (iv) physician investment in a company whose stock is traded on a public exchange and has stockholder equity exceeding $75.0 million; and (v) certain space and equipment rental arrangements that are set at a fair market value rate and satisfy other requirements. Many states have their own self-referral laws as well, which in some cases apply to all patient referrals, not just government reimbursement programs.
In December 2020, the OIG and CMS published final rules to amend the regulations implementing the Anti-Kickback Statute and the Stark Law, respectively. The amendments are primarily intended to alleviate perceived impediments to coordinated care and value-based compensation arrangements through new safe harbors to the Anti-Kickback Statute and new exceptions to the Stark Law and have varying degrees of applicability to laboratories. The CMS final rule incorporates laboratories and permits support for value-based arrangements, under certain conditions for purposes of the Stark Law. However, the OIG final rule excludes laboratories from protection under the Anti-Kickback Statute safe harbors for value-based arrangements.
There are a variety of other types of U.S. and state fraud and abuse laws, including laws prohibiting submission of false or fraudulent claims. We seek to conduct our business in compliance with all U.S. and state fraud and abuse laws. We are unable to predict how these laws will be applied in the future, and no assurances can be given that our arrangements will not be subject to scrutiny under such laws. Sanctions for violations of these laws may include exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid, and other U.S. or state healthcare programs, significant criminal and civil fines and penalties, and loss of licensure. Any exclusion from participation in a U.S. healthcare program, or material loss of licensure, arising from any action by any federal or state regulatory or enforcement authority, would likely have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, any significant criminal or civil penalty resulting from such proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business.
Competition
Our principal competition for our lab diagnostic services are commercial laboratories, such as Quest Diagnostics Incorporated and Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings, both of which have significant infrastructures and resources to support their diagnostic processing services. In addition, we compete with large, multispecialty group medical clinics and health systems. Academic medical university-based clinics may also provide in-house clinical laboratories offering COVID-19 and other RPP Molecular tests. Additionally, we compete against regional clinical laboratories providing diagnostic services, including Interpace Biosciences, Inc. 
The number of companies entering the personal genomics market has increased in recent years. We face competition from other companies attempting to capitalize on the same, or similar, opportunities as we are, including those with existing diagnostic, laboratory services and other companies entering the personal genetics market with new offerings 
such as direct access and/or consumer self-pay tests and genetic interpretation services. Some of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories and greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we do. These factors may allow our competitors to respond more quickly or efficiently than we can to new or emerging technologies. These competitors may engage in more extensive research and development efforts, undertake more far-reaching marketing campaigns and adopt more aggressive pricing policies, which may allow them to build larger customer bases than we will be able to achieve. Our competitors may develop products or services that are similar to our products and services or that achieve greater market acceptance than our products and services. This could attract customers away from our services and reduce our market share.
The pharmaceutical industry is characterized by intense competition and rapid innovation. Our potential competitors include major multi-national pharmaceutical established biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies, and universities and other research institutions. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, and other resources, such as larger research and development staffs, established manufacturing capabilities and facilities, and experienced marketing organizations with well-established sales forces. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large, established companies that have greater resources. Mergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated on our competitors. Competition may increase further as a result of advances in the commercial applicability of genome editing or other new technologies and greater availability of capital for investment in these industries. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient enrollment for participation in clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our development programs. Our commercial opportunities could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient to administer, have broader acceptance and higher rates of reimbursement by third-party payors, or are less expensive than any product candidates that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. Additionally, new technologies developed by our competitors may render our product candidates uneconomical or obsolete, and we may not be successful in marketing any product candidates we may develop against competitor products. The key competitive factors affecting the success of our product candidates are likely to be their efficacy, safety, and availability of reimbursement.
We compete with other contract manufacturers of OTC drug and dietary supplement products. These suppliers range widely in size. We compete primarily on the basis of price, quality and service. Management believes that our manufacturing capacity and abilities offer a significant advantage over many of our competitors in the full-service contract development and manufacturing industry. We have over 20 years of manufacturing experience and industry know how in large scale batch production of OTC lozenge products. To the extent that any of our competitors are able to offer better prices, quality and/or services, however, we could lose customers and our sales and margins may decline.
The OTC healthcare products and dietary supplements industries are highly competitive. Many of the participants in these industries have substantially greater capital resources, technical staffs, facilities, marketing resources, product development, and distribution experience than we do. We believe that our ability to continue to compete in these industries will depend on a number of factors, including product quality and price, availability, speed to market, consumer marketing, reliability, credit terms, brand name recognition, delivery time and post-sale service and support. However, our failure to appropriately and timely respond to consumer preferences and demand for new products could significantly harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, unfavorable publicity or consumer perception of products we develop and commercialize could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations. 
Human Capital Management
We consider talent attraction, development, engagement and retention a key driver to our business success. We are committed to developing a comprehensive, cohesive and positive company culture and employee experience. At December 31, 2022, we employed 129 full-time employees, of which 47 were engaged in our contract manufacturing operations and 82 employees were providing diagnostic services.
We emphasize a number of measures and objectives in managing our human capital assets, including, among others, employee safety and wellness, talent acquisition and retention, employee engagement, development and training, diversity and inclusion, and compensation. None of our employees are represented by a labor organization or under any collective-bargaining arrangements. We consider our employee relations to be good.
We are committed to fostering an environment where all employees can grow and thrive. A diverse workforce results in a broader range of perspectives, helping drive our commitment to innovation. Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and new employees, advisors and consultants. The principal purposes of our cash and equity incentive plans are to attract, retain and reward personnel through the granting of cash-based and stock-based compensation awards, in order to increase stockholder value and the success of our Company by motivating such individuals to perform to the best of their abilities and achieve our objectives.
The success of our business is fundamentally connected to the well-being of our employees. We understand that good health leads to better performance. We provide our employees and their families with access to a variety of flexible and convenient health and wellness programs, health reimbursement accounts and retirement savings plan Our health and wellness programs include benefits that provide support to manage events that may require time away from work or that impact their financial well-being and that support their physical and mental health by providing tools and resources to help them improve or maintain their health status and encourage engagement in healthy behaviors. We regularly evaluate our benefits package to make modifications that are aligned with the competitive landscape, legislative changes, and the unique needs of our business and culture.
