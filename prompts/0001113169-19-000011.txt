Item 1. | Business.

T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. is a financial services holding company that provides global investment management services through its subsidiaries to investors worldwide. We provide an array of U.S. mutual funds, separately managed accounts, subadvised funds, and other T. Rowe Price products. The other T. Rowe Price products include: collective investment trusts, target date retirement trusts, open-ended investment products offered to investors outside the U.S., and products offered through variable annuity life insurance plans in the U.S. We also provide certain investment advisory clients with related administrative services, including distribution, mutual fund transfer agent, accounting, and shareholder services; participant recordkeeping and transfer agent services for defined contribution retirement plans; brokerage; and trust services. We are focused on delivering global investment management excellence to help clients around the world achieve their long-term investment goals. 
The late Thomas Rowe Price, Jr., founded our firm in 1937, and the common stock of T. Rowe Price Associates, Inc. was first offered to the public in 1986. The T. Rowe Price Group corporate holding company structure was established in 2000.
Our core capabilities have enabled us to deliver excellent operating results since our initial public offering in 1986. We maintain a client-centric culture that is focused on delivering strong long-term investment performance and world-class service to our clients. We have distributed our broad array of active investment strategies through a diverse set of distribution channels and vehicles to meet the needs of our global clients. Our ongoing financial strength has allowed us to take advantage of attractive growth opportunities and invest in key capabilities. These include adding to our client-facing associates and investment professionals across the globe, enhancing our technologies, introducing new product offerings, and, most importantly, providing our global clients with strong investment management expertise and service.
The market in which we operate has been evolving quickly and a number of headwinds have arisen over the last few years, including passive and alternative investments taking market share from traditional active strategies; 
a shifting demand from equities to income-oriented solutions as the population ages; pricing pressure; demand for new vehicles to meet client needs; an accelerating regulatory landscape; and a shifting demand from equities to income-oriented solutions as the population ages.
Despite the headwinds, we believe there are significant opportunities that align to our core capabilities. As such, we are responding with several multi-year initiatives that are designed to strengthen our long-term competitive position and to:

• | Maintain our position as a premier active asset manager, delivering durable value to clients.


• | Become an ever more integrated investment solutions provider, leveraging firmwide investment capabilities to meet changing client needs.


• | Build T. Rowe Price into a more globally diversified asset manager.


• | Become a more recognized global partner for retirement-oriented investors.


• | Remain a destination of choice for top talent, with a culture of accountability and collaboration.


• | Become a more agile company that stays ahead of and capitalizes on disruption.


• | Deliver attractive financial results and balance sheet strength for our stockholders over the long term.

Financial Overview / Assets Under Management
We derive the vast majority of our consolidated net revenue and net income from investment advisory services provided by our subsidiaries, primarily T. Rowe Price Associates and T. Rowe Price International Ltd. Our revenues depend largely on the total value and composition of assets under our management. Accordingly, fluctuations in financial markets and in the composition of assets under management impact our revenues and results of operations. 
Page  2

            
At December 31, 2018, we had $962.3 billion in assets under management, including $564.5 billion in the U.S. mutual funds and $397.8 billion in separately managed accounts, subadvised funds, and other T. Rowe Price products. While assets under management decreased $28.8 billion from the end of 2017, we had net cash inflows of $13.2 billion for 2018, but market depreciation and losses, including distributions not reinvested, lowered our assets under management by $42.0 billion. In 2018, our net cash inflows included $12.0 billion in our target date retirement products, which provide shareholders with a single, diversified portfolio that invests in underlying U.S. mutual funds or collective investment trusts. The assets under management in these products totaled $230.4 billion at December 31, 2018, or 23.9% of our managed assets at December 31, 2018, compared with 23.6% at the end of 2017.

Distribution Channels and Products
We distribute our products in countries located within three broad geographical regions: Americas, Europe Middle East and Africa ("EMEA"), and Asia Pacific ("APAC"). We accumulate our assets under management from a diversified client base across five primary distribution channels: Americas financial intermediaries; EMEA and APAC financial intermediaries; individual U.S. investors on a direct basis; U.S. retirement plan sponsors for which we provide recordkeeping services; and institutional investors globally. Investors domiciled outside the U.S. represent about 6% of total assets under management at the end of 2018. We service clients in 48 countries around the world. The following table outlines the types of products within each distribution channel through which our assets under management as of December 31, 2018, are sourced.

Investment Capabilities
We manage a broad range of investment strategies in equity, fixed income, and multi-asset across sectors, styles and regions. Our strategies are designed to meet the varied and changing needs and objectives of investors and are delivered across a range of vehicles. We also offer specialized advisory services, including management of stable value investment contracts, modeled multi-asset solutions, and a distribution management service for the disposition of equity securities our clients receive from third-party venture capital investment pools.

The following table sets forth our broad investment capabilities as of December 31, 2018.

Equity | Fixed income | Multi-Asset 
U.S. | International / Global | U.S. | International / Global | U.S. / International / Global 
Large-Cap: Growth, Core, Value | Global: All-Cap, Growth, Value | Core Bond | Global Aggregate | Target Date/Custom Target Date
Mid-Cap: Growth, Core, Value | International Developed: Growth, Core, Value | Credit Opportunities | Global Multi-Sector | Target Allocation 
Small-Cap: Growth, Core, Value | International Small-Cap | Corporate | Global Dynamic Bond | Global Allocation 
Quantitative Equity: Multi-Cap, Style Index | Emerging Markets Global: Growth, Value | Bank Loan | Global High Income | Managed Volatility

 | Frontier Markets | Treasury | Global High Yield | Alternatives 
 | Quantitative Equity: Global | Short Duration | Global Government | 
 | Sectors | Municipal | Asia | 
 | | Quantitative Fixed: Style Index | | 

We employ fundamental and quantitative security analysis in the performance of the investment advisory function through substantial internal equity and fixed income investment research capabilities. We perform original industry and company research using such sources as inspection of corporate activities, management interviews, company-published financial and other information, and field checks with suppliers and competitors in the same industry and particular business sector. Our dedicated, in-house research analysts consider tangible investment factors such as financial information, valuation, and macroeconomics in tandem with intangible environmental, social, and corporate governance investment factors.
Our research staff operates primarily from offices located in the U.S. and U.K. with additional staff based in Australia, Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore, and Switzerland. We also use research provided by brokerage firms and security analysts in a supportive capacity and information received from private economists, political observers, commentators, government experts, and market analysts. Our securities selection process for some investment portfolios is based on quantitative analysis using computerized data modeling. 
From time to time, we introduce new strategies, investment vehicles, and other products to complement and expand our investment offerings, respond to competitive developments in the financial marketplace, and meet the changing needs of our investment advisory clients. We will introduce a new investment strategy if we believe that we have the appropriate investment management expertise and that its objective will be useful to investors over a long period. In 2018, we introduced four new strategies and several new vehicles and share classes of existing strategies.
We typically provide seed capital for new investment products to enable the portfolio manager to begin building an investment performance history in advance of the portfolio receiving sustainable client assets. The length of time we hold our seed capital investment will vary for each new investment product as it is highly dependent on how long it takes to generate cash flows into the product from unrelated investors. We attempt to ensure that the new investment product has a sustainable level of assets from unrelated shareholders before we consider redemption of our seed capital investment in order to not negatively impact the new investment product's net asset value or its investment performance record. At December 31, 2018, we had seed capital investments of $1.1 billion in our products. 
Page  5

            
Conversely, we may also close or limit new investments across all T. Rowe Price investment products in order to maintain the integrity of the investment strategy and to protect the interests of its existing shareholders and investors. At present, the following strategies, which represent about 20% of total assets under management at December 31, 2018, are generally closed to new investors: 

Strategy | Year closed
U.S. Mid-Cap Growth | 2010 
U.S. Mid-Cap Value | 2010 
High Yield Bond | 2012 
U.S. Small-Cap Growth | 2013 
U.S. Small-Cap Core | 2013 
Capital Appreciation | 2014 
Global Technology | 2017 
Emerging Markets Growth | 2018 
International Small-Cap Growth | 2018 

Investment Advisory Fees
We provide investment advisory services through our subsidiaries to the U.S. mutual funds; clients on a separately managed or subadvised account basis; and other T. Rowe Price products, including collective investment trusts, target date retirement trusts, funds offered to investors outside the U.S., and portfolios offered through variable annuity life insurance plans in the U.S.
Ten of our 179 U.S. mutual funds - Growth Stock, Blue Chip Growth, Mid-Cap Growth, Capital Appreciation, Value, New Horizons, New Income, Equity Income, Overseas Stock, and Emerging Markets Stock - accounted for approximately 35% of our investment advisory revenues in 2018, and approximately 28% of our assets under management at December 31, 2018. Our largest client account relationship, apart from the U.S. mutual funds, is with a third-party financial intermediary that accounted for about 6% of our investment advisory revenues in 2018. 
U.S. Mutual Funds
At December 31, 2018, assets under our management in the U.S. mutual funds aggregated $564.5 billion, a decrease of 6.9% or $41.8 billion from the beginning of the year. Investment advisory services are provided to each U.S. mutual fund under individual investment management agreements that grant the fund the right to use the T. Rowe Price name. The Boards of the respective funds, including a majority of directors who are not interested persons of the funds or of T. Rowe Price Group (as defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940), must approve the investment management agreements annually. Fund shareholders approve material changes to these investment management agreements. Each agreement automatically terminates in the event of its assignment (as defined in the Investment Company Act) and, generally, either party may terminate the agreement without penalty after a 60-day notice. The termination of one or more of these agreements could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Independent directors and trustees of the U.S. mutual funds regularly review our fee structures. 
The advisory fee paid monthly by each of the U.S. mutual funds is computed on a daily basis by multiplying a fund’s net assets by its effective fee rate. For the majority of the U.S. mutual funds, the fee rate is equal to the sum of a tiered group fee rate plus an individual fund rate. The tiered group rate is based on the combined net assets of nearly all of the U.S. mutual funds. If the combined net assets of these U.S. mutual funds exceed $650 billion, the weighted-average fee across pricing tiers is 28.6 basis points for the first $650 billion of net assets plus 26.5 basis points for net assets in excess of $650 billion. To the extent that the combined net assets of the funds included in the group rate calculation increase, the group charge component of a fund's advisory fee rate and the resulting advisory fee rate paid by each fund will decrease. 
The individual fund rates are generally flat rates that are set based on the fund’s specific investment objective. Several funds including; the Blue Chip Growth, Equity Income, Growth Stock, and Mid-Cap Growth funds, have an effective tiered individual fund rate in which their base individual flat rate is reduced by about 15% on net assets in excess of $15 billion. The New Income and Value funds have their base individual flat rate reduced by about 15% 
Page  6

            
on net assets in excess of $20 billion. The Capital Appreciation Fund has its base individual flat rate reduced by 10% on net assets in excess of $27.5 billion. The effective fee rates for each of the stock and bond funds on which we earned annual advisory fees of approximately $6.0 million or greater in 2018, varied from a low of 15 basis points for the U.S Treasury Long-Term fund to a high of 104 basis points for the Emerging Markets Stock and International Discovery funds.
The fee rate of several of the U.S. mutual funds, including the Index and Summit funds as well as specific funds offered solely to institutional investors, does not include a group fee component but rather an individual fund fee or an all-inclusive fee. An all-inclusive fee covers both the investment management fee and ordinary operating expenses incurred by the fund and, as a result, our management fee varies with the level of operating expenses a fund incurs. Each of the funds in the Spectrum Funds series and in the multiple target date retirement funds series that we offer invests in a diversified portfolio of other U.S. mutual funds and has no separate investment advisory fee; rather, they indirectly bear the expenses of the funds in which they invest.
Each U.S. mutual fund typically bears all expenses associated with its operation and the issuance and redemption of its securities. In particular, each fund pays investment advisory fees; shareholder servicing fees and expenses; fund accounting fees and expenses; transfer and sub-transfer agent fees; custodian fees and expenses; legal and auditing fees; expenses of preparing, printing and mailing prospectuses and shareholder reports to existing shareholders; registration fees and expenses; proxy and annual meeting expenses; and independent trustee or director fees and expenses.
We usually provide that a newly organized fund’s expenses will not exceed a specified percentage of its net assets during an initial operating period. Generally, during the earlier portion of the period, we will waive advisory fees and absorb other fund expenses, such as those described above, in excess of these self-imposed limits. During the latter portion of the period, we may recover some or all of the waived fees and absorbed costs, but such recovery is not assured. Beginning in 2017, we implemented new contractual management fee waivers for certain U.S mutual funds, including nearly all money market funds, which unlike traditional expense limits for newly organized funds, these waivers will not be recovered by T. Rowe Price in the future. 
Subadvised and separate accounts and other investment products
Our subadvised and separate accounts and other investment products had assets under management of $397.8 billion at December 31, 2018, an increase of $13.0 billion from the beginning of the year. We charge fees for investment management to these clients based on, among other things, the specific investment services to be provided. Our standard form of investment advisory agreement with other T. Rowe Price products that pay management fees on a daily basis normally provides for termination with thirty days notice. Our standard separately managed account agreements provide for termination at any time and the refunding of any unearned fees paid in advance. Our standard subadvised client account agreement typically provides for termination with sixty days notice.
Our subsidiaries, T. Rowe Price (Luxembourg) Management Sàrl and T. Rowe Price Australia, provide management company and investment management services, respectively, to our Luxembourg-based SICAVs and FCPs, and AUTs. T. Rowe Price (Luxembourg) Management Sàrl and T. Rowe Price International, provide authorized corporate depositor and investment management services, respectively, to our UK-based OEICs. T. Rowe Price (Canada) provides investment management services to our Canadian Pooled Funds. T. Rowe Price Japan, provides investment management services to our Japan Investment Trust. Our subsidiaries, T. Rowe Price Associates and T. Rowe Price Hong Kong may also provide subadvised investment management services to these global investment products. We distribute several of these products outside the U.S. through distribution agents and other financial intermediaries. The fees we earn for distributing and marketing these products are part of our overall investment management fees for managing the product assets. We currently recognize any related distribution fees paid to these financial intermediaries in distribution and servicing costs.
In addition to providing investment management services to the U.S. mutual funds, our subsidiaries, T. Rowe Price Associates and T. Rowe Price International, offer separately managed institutional investment management and subadvised investment management services to global intermediaries. Our subsidiary, T. Rowe Price Trust Company, offers and provides investment management services to our T. Rowe Price collective investment trusts, which are used in the investment portfolios of certain qualified U.S. retirement plans. 
Page  7

            
Our fees for managing these subadvised and separate accounts and other investment products are computed using the value of assets under our management at a contracted annual fee rate. The value of assets under management billed is generally based on daily valuations, end of billing period valuations, or month-end average valuations. In 2018, approximately 78% of our advisory fees were recognized based on daily portfolio valuations, 14% were based on end of billing period valuations, and 8% were based on month-end averages.
ADMINISTRATIVE, DISTRIBUTION, AND SERVICING FEES.
Administrative Services
We also provide certain administrative services as ancillary services to our investment advisory clients. These administrative services are provided by several of our subsidiaries and include mutual fund transfer agent, accounting, distribution, and shareholder services; participant recordkeeping and transfer agent services for defined contribution retirement plans investing in U.S. mutual funds; recordkeeping services for defined contribution retirement plans investing in mutual funds outside the T. Rowe Price complex; brokerage; and trust services. 
T. Rowe Price Services provides the U.S. mutual funds transfer agency and shareholder services, including the staff, facilities, technology, and other equipment to respond to inquiries from fund shareholders. The U.S. mutual funds contract directly with BNY Mellon to provide mutual fund accounting services, including maintenance of financial records, preparation of financial statements and reports, daily valuation of portfolio securities, and computation of each mutual fund's daily net asset values per share.
T. Rowe Price Retirement Plan Services provides participant accounting and plan administration for defined contribution retirement plans that invest in the U.S. mutual funds, the T. Rowe Price collective investment trusts, and funds outside the T. Rowe Price complex. T. Rowe Price Retirement Plan Services also provides transfer agent services to the U.S. mutual funds. Plan sponsors and participants compensate us for some of the administrative services while the U.S. mutual funds and outside fund families compensate us for maintaining and administering the individual participant accounts for those plans that invest in the respective funds. As of December 31, 2018, we provided recordkeeping services for $171 billion in assets under administration, of which $108 billion are assets we manage. 
T. Rowe Price Trust Company provides administrative trustee services. Through this entity, which is a Maryland-chartered limited service trust company, we serve as trustee for employer sponsored retirement plans and other retirement products. T. Rowe Price Trust Company may not accept deposits and cannot make personal or commercial loans. 
We also provide non-discretionary advisory planning services to fund shareholders and potential investors through our subsidiary T. Rowe Price Advisory Services. These services are limited in scope and include retirement planning services, such as saving for retirement, transitioning into retirement, and income in retirement. An investment portfolio evaluation service is an integral part of these services. An ongoing checkup service is also available to assist investors in staying on track to achieve their financial goals.
Distribution and Servicing
The Investor Class of all U.S. mutual funds can be purchased in the U.S. on a no-load basis, without a sales commission or 12b-1 fee. No-load mutual fund shares offer investors a low-cost and relatively easy method of directly investing in a variety of equity, fixed income, and multi-asset products. The I Class of certain U.S. mutual funds is designed to meet the needs of institutionally oriented clients who seek investment products with lower shareholder servicing costs and lower expense ratios. This share class limits ordinary operating expenses (other than interest; expenses related to borrowings, taxes, and brokerage; and any non-extraordinary expenses) at 5 basis points for a period of time and there are no external payments for 12b-1 or administrative fee payments. 
Certain of the U.S. mutual funds also offer Advisor Class and R Class shares that are distributed to investors and defined contribution retirement plans, respectively. These share classes pay 12b-1 fees of 25 and 50 basis points, respectively, for distribution, administration, and personal services. Our subsidiary, T. Rowe Price Investment Services ("TRPIS"), is the principal distributor of the U.S. mutual funds and contracts with third-party financial intermediaries who distribute these share classes. TRPIS enters into agreements with each intermediary under which each fund is responsible to pay the distribution and service fees directly to the applicable intermediaries. In addition, those U.S. mutual funds offered to investors through variable annuity life insurance plans have a share class that pays a 12b-1 fee of 25 basis points.
Page  8

            
In accounting for 12b-1 fees, the applicable mutual fund share classes incur the related expense and we recognize the corresponding distribution and servicing fee revenue in the administrative, distribution, and servicing fees line of
our consolidated statements of income. We also recognize the corresponding cost paid to the third-party financial intermediaries who distribute these funds' share classes within the distribution and servicing costs line of the consolidated statements of income, The fee revenue that we recognize from the funds and the expense that we recognize for the fees paid to third-party intermediaries are equal in amount and, therefore, do not impact our net operating income.
We believe that our lower fund cost structure, distribution methods, and fund shareholder and administrative services help promote the stability of our fund assets under management through market cycles.
Except as noted above for 12b-1 fees earned from the mutual funds, we bear all advertising and promotion expenses associated with the distribution of our investment products. These costs are recognized when incurred and include advertising and direct mail communications to potential shareholders, as well as substantial staff and communications capabilities to respond to investor inquiries. Marketing and promotional efforts are focused in print media, television, and digital and social media. In addition, we direct considerable marketing efforts to defined contribution plans that invest in mutual funds. Advertising and promotion expenditures vary over time based on investor interest, market conditions, new and existing investment offerings, and the development and expansion of new marketing initiatives, including the enhancement of our digital capabilities.
REGULATION.
All aspects of our business are subject to extensive federal, state, and foreign laws and regulations. These laws and regulations are primarily intended to benefit or protect our clients and T. Rowe Price product shareholders. They generally grant supervisory agencies and bodies broad administrative powers, including the power to limit or restrict the conduct of our business in the event that we fail to comply with laws and regulations. Possible sanctions that may be imposed on us, in the event that we fail to comply, include the suspension of individual employees, limitations on engaging in certain business activities for specified periods of time, revocation of our investment adviser and other registrations, censures, and fines.

T. Rowe Price International is also regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority ("FCA") in the United Kingdom and, in certain cases, by other foreign regulators in countries in which we have a license to conduct business. The Securities and Futures Commission ("SFC") and Monetary Authority of Singapore ("MAS") also regulate T. Rowe Price Hong Kong and T. Rowe Price Singapore, respectively. T. Rowe Price (Canada) is also registered with several of the provincial securities commissions in Canada. T. Rowe Price (Luxembourg) Management Sàrl, the management company of our Luxembourg-based FCP ("Fonds Commun de Placement") and SICAV funds is regulated by the Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier ("CSSF"). Our branch offices operated outside the U.S. are also registered with and regulated by the local financial authorities. 
Our subsidiaries providing transfer agent services are registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and our trust company is regulated by the State of Maryland, Commissioner of Financial Regulation. 
T. Rowe Price Investment Services is a registered broker-dealer and member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ("FINRA") and the Securities Investor Protection Corporation.

For further discussion of the potential impact of current or proposed legal or regulatory requirements, please see the Legal and Regulatory risk factors included in Item 1A of this Form 10-K. 
COMPETITION.
As a member of the financial services industry, we are subject to substantial competition in all aspects of our business. A significant number of proprietary and other sponsors’ mutual funds are sold to the public by other investment management firms, broker-dealers, mutual fund companies, banks, and insurance companies. We compete with brokerage and investment banking firms, insurance companies, banks, mutual fund companies, hedge funds, and other financial institutions and funds in all aspects of our business and in every country in which we offer our advisory services. Many of these financial institutions have substantially greater resources than we do. We compete with other providers of investment advisory services primarily based on the availability and objectives of the investment products offered, investment performance, fees and related expenses, and the scope and quality of investment advice and other client services. 
In recent years, we have faced significant competition from passive oriented investment strategies. As a result, such products have taken market share from active managers. While we cannot predict how much market share these competitors will gain, we believe there will always be demand for good active management. 
In order to maintain and enhance our competitive position, we may review acquisition and venture opportunities and, if appropriate, engage in discussions and negotiations that could lead to the acquisition of a new equity or other financial relationship.
EMPLOYEES.
At December 31, 2018, we employed 7,022 associates, up 2.0% from the 6,881 associates employed at the end of 2017. We may add temporary and part-time personnel to our staff from time to time to meet periodic and special project demands, primarily for technology and mutual fund administrative services.
