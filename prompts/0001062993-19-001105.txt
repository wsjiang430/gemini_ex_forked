ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 It is the Company’s belief that the United States, along with most parts of the world are in the very early stages of a significant spike in the growth curve for “less-lethal” products. Most law enforcement agencies do not have a proper working knowledge of a less-lethal program in place. Rather they are using an assortment of less-lethal devices out of necessity for varying degrees of effectiveness with little coordination or approved tactical plans for their deployment. Law enforcement budget constraints usually play a role in this behavior. It is for this reason that unintended deaths of unarmed suspects at the hands of police departments throughout the country (and in fact throughout the world) continue to happen.
 With a rise in social and civil unrest both here and abroad and with more and more of these incidents being caught on video and posted on social media, the pressure on law enforcement and governments to find reasonable and effective alternatives to lethal force is mounting daily. As a result, it is management’s opinion that the less-lethal market will be one of the faster growing segment in the law enforcement, correctional services, crowd control and security services markets over the next decade.
 Less-lethal weapons include a wide variety of products designed to disorient, slow down and stop would be assailants, rioters and other malfeasants. In the Company’s opinion, the less-lethal weapon that is growing the fastest in popularity and adoption is the 40mm launcher along with the various less-lethal munitions that can be fired from these launchers. These munitions include both impact rounds designed to stop an individual without causing permanent injury to payload rounds carrying a variety of powders and liquids including tear gas, pepper spray, DNA marking liquids, mal-odorants and other marking liquids and powders designed to identify instigators in a riot situation.
 Historically, these munitions were fired from 37mm launchers, however, the industry has been moving to 40mm launchers due to the fact that the 40mm launcher barrel is rifled (while the 37mm is a smooth bore barrel less accurate munition) which allows the operator to more accurately fire the rounds at distances in excess of 100’. This makes the 40mm launcher an effective tool in a wide range of situations.
 Additional less lethal munitions include 12 gauge and .68 caliber impact and chemical irritant projectiles. The 12 gauge has been a long-standing tool for law enforcement and correctional services, as almost all domestic patrol cars carry a shotgun to fire the 12 gauge munitions when required. The .68 caliber projectiles are fired from an air gun system for close range incidents where impact force is not the main objective with a subject, but chemical irritant munitions are necessary to stop an assailant.

History 
 Security Devices International Inc. (“SDI”), the “Company” or the “Corporation”) was incorporated on March 1, 2005. The Company began as a research and development company focused on the development of 40mm less-lethal ammunition.
 The Company initiated with the development of a Wireless Electric Projectile (the “WEP”), named the Lektrox. The Company hired a ballistics engineering firm to collaborate in the development of the WEP.
 Commencing in December 2008, the Joint Non-Lethal Weapons Directorate (“JNLWD”) of the US Department of Defense, an organization responsible for the development and coordination of non-lethal weapons activities within the United States, tested the WEP through its evaluation facility at Penn State University. An executive summary was released to the Company indicating a positive outcome.
 In the fall of 2010, the Company underwent a change in the board of directors and management. This precipitated a change in the direction of the company as development of the WEP was discontinued and the company shifted its focus to a new product – the 40mm Blunt Impact Projectile (BIP). The Company concluded that the cost and time required to complete development and testing of the BIP were significantly less than that required to complete development and testing of the WEP. The goal was to develop a product that it could bring to market more quickly. The Company was able to exploit some of the patent pending technology of the WEP into the BIP. In 2011, the Company moved its engineering, intellectual property and production facilities to the Operator (the “BIP Manufacturer”) of an injection molding facility outside of Boston, Massachusetts.
 The Blunt Impact Projectile (BIP) – A Transformative Technology 
 When the less-lethal industry was dominated by the 37mm launcher, a number of less-lethal companies developed “impact munition rounds” designed to “stop” an assailant. These rounds were nothing more than a piece of plastic, wood baton, rubber baton, or a piece of plastic with a piece of sponge rubber or foam rubber affixed to the head of the round.
 There were several problems with these 37mm rounds. First, they were inaccurate due to the lack of barrel rifling. Since most SWAT teams carry single shot launchers, a round that cannot be shot accurately is of little value. Second, because of their lightweight, they did not have much stopping power. Suspects that were “committed” would often “shake off” a direct hit. Finally, the rounds would bounce off walls or other hard surfaces which made them dangerous to use in confined areas such as a jail cell. Numerous corrections officers have been hurt by impact rounds ricocheting off of jail cell walls.
 Security Devices International solved all three issues with the development of its “Blunt Impact Projectile” (BIP). The BIP was developed as an outgrowth of a research and development project to create a conductive electric device bullet (project name WEP – Wireless Electric Projectile).
 In order to ensure that the projectile did not injure the targeted individual, SDI needed to develop a way to cushion the impact of the round upon contact with the target. The solution was a collapsible head that compressed upon impact. (See below). When it became clear that SDI did not have sufficient funds to complete development of the WEP, it was decided to use the collapsible head design to create an impact round. The hope was that with this new, state-of-the-art impact round, SDI could generate enough profitability that it would be able to complete development of the WEP.

This collapsible head technology allowed SDI to build a heavier projectile that did not require a rubber or foam tip. This meant that it could take advantage of the rifling of the 40mm launcher. This made the BIP by far the most accurate round on the market in comparison to previous 37mm projectiles. The target for an impact round is to be a large muscle group such as the thigh muscle.
 The gel collapsible head of the BIP spreads out upon impact, dispersing the energy over a larger area thus reducing blunt trauma to the subject. This allows the BIP round to be fired at close range on a target.
 The Company believes that its patented collapsible head technology will transform the industry as law enforcement agencies recognize the tactical advantages of a less-lethal weapon that can be safely, accurately and effectively deployed at close range distances between 10 to 100 feet. SDI has been in discussions several industry players about licensing SDI’s technology.

 Q1 2018 
  During the quarter the Company held its annual general meeting (AGM) at its head office in Wakefield, MA on December 19, 2017. Results of the AGM were filed in an 8K on December 21, 2017.
  On March 28, 2018 the Company filed an S-1 Registration Statement (S-1). The S-1 relates to the registration of certain securities issued by the Company on November 28, 2017. The notice of effectiveness of the S-1 was received on April 6, 2018. 
  On April 8-9, 2018, the Company attended the MicroCap Conference in New York City to garner market awareness. The conference is an exclusive event dedicated to connecting small and micro-cap companies with high-level, institutional and retail investors. The response of the event was positive towards the Companys market space, product offerings, and growth prospects. 
  On March 1, 2018, the Company purchased all the shares of a South African entity Rephit (Pty) Ltd., an inactive Company, for $300 (South African Rand 4,000) and subsequently changed the name of the subsidiary to Byrna South Africa (Pty) Ltd.
 Q2 2018 
 During the quarter, the Company had sales of $138,742 as compared to $97,172 for the second quarter last year (+43%). Growth was driven primarily by adoption of our rounds by local and provincial authorities in Montreal for security operations surrounding the G7 Summit held on June 7-9, in La Malbaie, Quebec, Canada, increased activity on our e-commerce platform (signed up over 50 agencies since it went live in the fourth quarter of last year) and general market recognition of the superiority of SDI’s Blunt Impact Projectile (BIP ).
 On April 16, 2018, the Company announced the signing of a Definitive Agreement with André Buys of South Africa to purchase certain registered patents and designs, provisional patents and designs, drawings, testing results, molds, prototype products and other intellectual property in exchange for cash and/or stock in the Company, as well as a stream of royalty payments to Mr. Buys. As part of the agreement, Mr. Buys joined the Company as Chief Technology Officer (“CTO”) and will head up our Product Development & Test Center in South Africa.
 These patents and related Intellectual Property (“IP”) focus on a new less lethal delivery system that delivers chemical irritants from handgun-like ‘Personal Security Devices (PSDs)’. Employing a shaped (finned) projectile, rather than a round ball, SDI expects to offer less lethal security devices that have the same or better accuracy than comparable conventional firearms. These new products will bring the same kind of less lethal options currently available only to the military, corrections and law enforcement agencies to a much broader range of users, including homeowners, private security guards and potentially schools. Management feels that there is significant market potential for these types of products in home defense and private security.
 During the quarter, the Company received an additional patent for the payload carrying arrangement for a non-lethal projectile. This brings the total patents under the portfolio to seven.

b) | The Company is developing the Byrna HD, a disruptive new non-lethal device aimed at the home defense and personal security markets. The Byrna fires .68 caliber projectiles containing chemical irritants designed to burn an assailant’s eyes and respiratory system upon contact. It will also be able to hold inert rounds and impact rounds that can be used for training purposes. 

Subsequent Events
 On December 4-6, 2018, the Company presented at the 11th Annual LD Micro Main Event, at the Luxe Sunset Boulevard Hotel in Los Angeles, California. During SDI’s presentation, management showcased the newly introduced Byrna HD non-lethal device aimed at the home defense and personal security markets.
 On December 20, 2018, the Company issued a progress update on the Byrna HD non-lethal personal security device development timeline, and new 2019 commercial launch initiatives.
 After conducting development testing using 3D printed prototypes, the Company began the process of validation testing of the Byrna HD using production parts. Development testing led to modifications to enhance the performance and life of the personal security device. Additionally, the Company decided to offer the Byrna in three more colors: black, desert tan and camouflage in addition to the original safety orange. The final phase of validation testing that commenced in December 2018 required factory production parts, availability of which was delayed by the holiday calendar and a key supplier advising that several custom part deliveries expected in December 2018 would not be available until January 2019, pushing back the final validation testing phase by several weeks.
 The Company showcased the Byrna HD during DAYTONA Speedweeks at the Daytona International Speedway in Daytona Beach, Florida on February 9 to 17, 2019.
 On February 4, 2019, the Company announced its launch pricing for the Byrna HD. The Company announced that it would accept pre-orders at Daytona and on its upcoming Byrna online store. The Company will offer the Byrna HD kit as a standalone product in either Byrna Orange, Black, or Desert Tan. A Digital Camouflage version will also be available at an additional charge. The basic Byrna kit will be offered at an MSRP of $349.99 but special package deals will be offered in conjunction with the launch of the product during Speedweeks.
