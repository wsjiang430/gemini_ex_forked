Corporate History
 
The Company was incorporated in the State of Nevada on March 2, 2010, under the name Port of Call Online, Inc. to create a web-based service that would offer boaters an easy, convenient, fun, easy to use, online resource to help them plan and organize their boating trips. Pursuant to a corporate reorganization consummated on December 23, 2014 (“Corporate Reorganization”), the Company changed its business focus to the identification, acquisition, development and full-scale exploitation of industrial and natural mineral properties in the United States for the development of products for the construction and agriculture markets. In line with this business focus, the Company changed its name to PureBase Corporation in January 2015.
 
The Company is headquartered in Ione, California.
 
Business Overview
 
We are an industrial mineral and natural resource company that provides solutions to the agriculture and construction materials markets in the United States, through our two subsidiaries, Purebase AG, and Purebase SCM, respectively. The Company has not yet commenced mining operations and relies on US Mine LLC. for its raw materials.
 
We utilize the services of US Mine Corporation (“USMC”), a Nevada corporation and a significant shareholder of the Company, for the development and contract mining of industrial mineral and metal projects, exploration drilling, preparation of feasibility studies, mine modeling, on-site construction, production, site reclamation and for product fulfillment. Exploration services include securing necessary permits, environmental compliance, and reclamation plans. In addition, a substantial portion of the minerals used by the Company are obtained from properties owned or controlled by USMC. A. Scott Dockter, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and a director, and John Bremer, a director, are also officers, directors and owners of USMC.

We obtain certain raw clay materials from US Mine LLC through a materials extraction agreement. US Mine LLC is a mining and exploration company that provides contract services to the global mining industries. US Mine LLC owns the mining property which USMC leases and pays US Mine LLC a royalty. A Scott Dockter, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and a director, and John Bremer, a director, are each 33% owners of US Mine LLC.
 
Agricultural Sector
 
We develop specialized fertilizers, sun protectants, soil amendments and bio-stimulants for organic and non-organic sustainable agriculture. We have developed and will seek to develop additional products derived from mineralized materials of leonardite, kaolin clay, laterite, and other natural minerals. These mineral and soil amendments are used to protect crops, plants and fruits from the sun and winter damage, to provide nutrients to plants, and to improve dormancy and soil ecology to help farmers increase the yields of their harvests. We are building a brand family under the parent trade name “Purebase,” consisting of our Purebase Shade Advantage WP product, a kaolin-clay based sun protectant for crops and Humic Advantage a humic acid product derived from leonardite.
 
PureBase Shade Advantage WP
 
Shade Advantage WP is a natural mineral plant protectant that reduces sunburn damage to plant tissue (including fruits, such as watermelons, citrus, tomatoes, apples and cherries and walnuts) exposed to UV and infrared radiation through the absorption and dissipation of ultraviolet and infrared radiation, which protects and reduces the stress on plants.
 
The anticipated benefits of this product include:
 

● | Adherences to plant tissue, fruit, and wood bark without the need for surfactants (stickers) 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Protection against sunburn of plant tissue and sun scalding of fruits, nuts, and vegetables 
● | Designed for application on organic and sustainable crops 
● | When sprayed on dormant trees, Shade Advantage WP has the potential of mitigating weather induced dormancy interference. 

 
Shade Advantage WP is available in 25 lb. bags.
 
Humic Advantage
 
In 2021, the Company hired a chemist to further develop a humic acid product derived from leonardite. The Company began field trials in the spring and fall of 2021 with produce and fruit growers, in Arizona and California. Data evaluation from these trials is ongoing, however, anecdotal evidence suggests increased growth in wine grapes on depleted soil profiles with low organic matter. The Company sold its first batch of humic acid to a produce grower in Arizona in April 2022.
 
The Company is currently expanding field trials into both wine grapes and produce.
 
Humic Advantage is a humic acid product derived from leonardite, locally sourced in Ione, California. Humic acid is a group of molecules heterogenous in nature, consisting of both aliphatic and aromatic carbons. We believe that humic acids are an important medium for soil health, water retention, and positive interactions with the soil microbiome. Humic acids can act as a chelator, interacting with other molecules in the soil profile, leading to a decrease in the leaching of metals and nutrients in some cases. Furthermore, some scientific publications have shown that the application of humic acid can increase plant dry mass, particularly in forage crops, due to increases in root matter and nodulation.

According to the California Department of Food and Agriculture (“CDFA”), California’s agricultural abundance includes more than 400 commodities and over a third of the country’s vegetables and two-thirds of the country’s fruits and nuts are grown in California. California’s top-10 valued commodities for the 2021 crop year are:
 

● | Dairy Products, Milk — $7.57 billion 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Grapes — $5.23 billion 
● | Almonds — $5.03 billion 
● | Cattle and Calves — $3.02 billion 
● | Pistachios — $2.91 billion 
● | Lettuce — $2.03 billion 
● | Tomatoes — $1.02 billion 
● | Walnuts — $1.02 billion 
● | Rice — $1.00 billion 

 
According to the CDFA in 2020 California’s farms and ranches received $51.1 billion in cash receipts for their output. This represents a 3.6% increase in cash receipts compared to the previous year.
 
According to the CDFA, California agricultural exports totaled $20.8 billion in 2020, a decrease of 4.1% from 2019. Top commodities for export included almonds, dairy and dairy products, pistachios, walnuts and wine. California’s agricultural export statistics are produced by the University of California, Davis, Agricultural Issues Center. California organic product sales totaled more than $11.9 billion in 2020, an increase of 14.4% from the prior year, according to the CDFA. Organic production encompasses over 2.19 million acres in the state and California is the only state in the U.S. with a United States Department of Agriculture (“USDA”) National Organic Program according to the CDFA.
 
North America humic acid market size was valued above $200 million in 2021 and is expected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate over 11% from 2022 to 2028 according to data included in the North America Humic Acid Market Forecast released by the USDA.
 
In 2021, as per the USDA, the estimated number of farms in the U.S. were 2,012,050, representing a decline of 6,950 farms from 2020. The total land in farms decreased by 1,300,000 acres in the same period. We believe that this decline will drive farmers to improve crop yields within more limited space. We believe that humic acid can improve yield rates by enhancing soil texture, nutrient buffering capacity, water retention characteristics, and plant growth by enabling efficient uptake of nutrients from soil. We believe that humic acid aids in fighting soil erosion by increasing the ability of soil colloids to combine and by enhancing root system and plant development and can also reduce water salination issues raised in the use of water-soluble mineral fertilizers.
 
In 2020, according to the CDFA, the horticultural segment held around 20% share in the North America humic acid market. We believe a positive outlook of floriculture, pomology, and olericulture will pave the way for product growth as humic acid is widely used as a biostimulant within these sectors. Humic acid helps in altering primary and secondary plant metabolism, improving root growth, and enhancing crop tolerance to environmental stresses. Humic acid is widely used in foliar applications along with fulvic acid to increase cell wall permeability and enable easy movement of nutrients through plants.
 
Distribution
 
The Company distributes its Shade Advantage WP product through several large agricultural distribution companies and co-ops including Helena Agri-Enterprises, LLC, Brandt, and Aligned Ag Distributors. Through this network of distribution companies, our products reach farmers and growers in the agricultural industry. The Company also private labels product for other agricultural companies. The Company has also exported limited product to Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia, and trials are being conducted in Peru to determine the effectiveness of Shade Advantage WP on bananas.

Competition in the Agricultural Sector
 
Major competitors with our agricultural products include:
 

● | PureShade with Calcium Carbonate: manufactured by Novasource, a division of Tessenderlo Kerley, Inc. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Surround: A kaolin-clay-based sun protectant manufactured by Novasource, a division of Tessenderlo Kerley, Inc. 
● | BioFlora: a comprehensive agricultural products company based in Arizona. 
● | Mesa Verde Humates, a division of Bio Huma Netics, a manufacturer of humate-based products based in New Mexico. 
● | The Andersons Humic Solutions: A humic based products mining and manufacturing firm focused in the US Midwest, which produces highly competitive organic products which are sold and distributed throughout the United States. 
● | Wilbur Ellis: one of the largest family-owned agricultural companies in the world. 

Construction Sector
 
The Company has been developing and testing a kaolin-based product that it believes will help create a lower CO2-emitting concrete through the use of high-quality supplementary cementitious materials (“SCMs”). We are developing a SCMs for the construction material markets, particularly the cement markets. that we believe can potentially replace up to 40% of cement, the most polluting part of concrete. As government agencies continue to enact stricter requirements for less-polluting forms of concrete, we believe there are significant opportunities for high-quality SCM products in the construction-materials sector.
Industry Overview
 
Domestic Production and Use
 
Most portland cement is used to make concrete, mortars, or stuccos, and competes in the construction sector with concrete substitutes, such as aluminum, asphalt, clay brick, fiberglass, glass, gypsum (plaster), steel, stone, and wood. Certain materials, especially fly ash and ground granulated blast furnace slag, develop good hydraulic cementitious properties by reacting with lime, such as that released by the hydration of portland cement. Where readily available (including as imports), these SCMs are increasingly being used as partial substitutes for portland cement in many concrete applications and are components of finished blended cements. Clay-based SCM’s may also offer high strength in addition to being able to replace more cement than traditional fly ash.
 
The Portland Cement Association (“PCA”) reports that cement consumption rose by 0.3% year-on-year in the first 11 months of 2022. According to the PCA, the U.S. is also set to spend $1 trillion on new and rehabilitated infrastructure projects which we believe would consume 46 Metric Tons of cement over a five-year program. Over a quarter of this amount would be used on roads, bridges and resiliency structures.
 
We believe that production and use of cement will increase in the upcoming years due to President Biden’s signing a $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill into law in November 2021, which is anticipated to provide $550 billion of new federal investments in America’s infrastructure over five years, including bridges, roads, broadband, water and energy systems. We believe that funds are needed for safe travel, as well as the efficient transport of goods and produce across the country. The nation’s infrastructure system earned a C- score from the American Society of Civil Engineers in 2021.
 
As per the PCA, the current infrastructure legislation provides for a $110 billion investment in roads, bridges and major infrastructure projects. Included is $40 billion for bridge repair, replacement and rehabilitation and $16 billion for major projects that would be too large or complex for traditional funding programs. It is believed that 173,000 miles of the nation’s highways and major roads are in poor condition, as are 45,000 bridges.

Competition in the Construction Sector
 
Potential competitors in the SCM space include other kaolin producers that are located in the eastern U.S. (predominantly Georgia), including BASF Corporation, Thiele Kaolin Company, Active Minerals International, LLC, Burgess Pigment Company, IMERYS, and KaMin LLC. Other potential competitors include fly ash distributors, notably Boral Industries, Inc. and Waste Management, Inc., and existing coal burning power plants (which produce fly ash as a byproduct of energy production.)
 
Currently in the western U.S., there are coal burning plants in Nevada, Utah, Oregon, and Washington. There are coal burning plants in Mexico and India from which fly ash can be imported. Other potential competitors are steel mills from which slag is produced as a byproduct of production (which is also a material that can replace fly ash.)
 
Newer technology could produce further competition, such as CO2-entrained concrete products that are produced by companies like Climeworks, a direct air capture company that vacuums carbon out of the air. Carbon entrainment companies include Carbon Engineering Ltd, and Carbon Cure Technologies, which has received significant investments by Bill Gates, Microsoft, Amazon, and others.
 
Many of our competitors have greater exploration, production, and capital resources than we do, and may be able to compete more effectively in any of these areas. For example, these competitors may be able to spend greater amounts on acquisition of desirable mineral properties, on exploration of their mineral properties and on development of their mineral properties. This competition could result in competitors having mineral properties of greater quality and interest to prospective investors who may finance the exploration and development of their mineral properties.
 
Government Controls and Regulations
 
Natural resource exploration, mining and processing operations are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations governing prospecting, exploration, development, production, labor standards, occupational health, mine safety, control of toxic substances, and other matters involving environmental protection and employment. United States environmental protection laws address the maintenance of air and water quality standards, the preservation of threatened and endangered species of wildlife and vegetation, the preservation of certain archaeological sites, reclamation, and limitations on the generation, transportation, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes, among other things. There can be no assurance that all the required permits and governmental approvals necessary for any mining project with which we may be associated can be obtained on a timely basis, or maintained in good standing. Delays in obtaining or failure to obtain necessary government permits and approvals may adversely impact our operations. The regulatory environment in which we operate could change in ways that would substantially increase costs to achieve compliance. In addition, significant changes in regulations could have a material adverse effect on our operations and ability to timely and effectively implement our drilling/mapping programs and develop our mining properties.
 
The following governmental controls and regulations materially affect the mining properties we, or our third party mineral suppliers, will seek to explore and develop.
 
Federal Regulation of Mining Activity
 
Mining operations are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations. At the federal level, mining properties are subject to inspection and regulation by the Division of Mine Safety and Health Administration of the Department of Labor (“MSHA”) under provisions of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977. The Occupation and Safety Health Administration (“OSHA”) also has jurisdiction over certain safety and health standards not covered by MSHA. Mining operations and all proposed exploration and development will require a variety of permits. In addition, any mining operations occurring on federal property are subject to regulation and inspection by the Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”).. We currently own mining rights in several properties having existing permits in place or properties where existing permitting requirements and other applicable environmental protection laws and regulations would not pose a material hindrance to our ability to explore and develop such properties. As part of our initial evaluation of suitable projects, we ascertain a property’s regulatory compliance status and any issues affecting current or future permitting requirements.

All of our current rights are to mining projects governed by the BLM and the US Forest Service. The Federal Land Policy and Management Act (1976) established the BLM’s multiple-use mandate to manage the public lands “in a manner that will protect the quality of scientific, scenic, historical, ecological, environmental, air and atmospheric, water resource, and archeological values; that, where appropriate, will preserve and protect certain public lands in their natural condition”. The Lands, Minerals & Water Rights branch coordinates with BLM planning and resource specialists to manage surface resources, minerals and water rights to ensure that authorized uses of public lands.
 
Mining Environmental Regulations
 
Mining activities, including drilling, mapping and development and production activities are subject to environmental laws, policies and regulations. These laws, policies and regulations affect, among other matters, emissions to the air, discharges to water, management of waste, management of hazardous substances, protection of natural resources, protection of endangered species, protection of antiquities and reclamation of mined land. Legislation and implementation of regulations adopted or proposed by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), the BLM and by comparable agencies in various states, directly and indirectly affect the mining industry in the United States. These laws and regulations address the environmental impact of mining and mineral processing, including potential contamination of soil and water from tailings, discharges and other wastes generated by the mining process. In particular, legislation such as the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act, the Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”), and the National Environmental Policy Act require analysis and/or impose effluent standards, new source performance standards, air quality standards and other design or operational requirements for various components of mining and mineral processing, including natural resource mining and processing of the type presently or to be conducted by the Company, through USMC. Such statutes also may impose liability on mine developers for remediation of waste they have created.
 
Mining projects also are subject to regulations under (i) the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (“CERCLA” or “Superfund”) which regulates and establishes liability for the release of hazardous substances and (ii) the Endangered Species Act (“ESA”) which identifies endangered species of plants and animals and regulates activities to protect these species and their habitats. Any potential future amendment to CERLA or ESA may impact our business.
 
The Clean Air Act, as amended, mandates the establishment of a federal air permitting program, identifies a list of hazardous air pollutants, including various metals and pollutants, and establishes new EPA enforcement authority. The EPA has published final regulations establishing the minimum elements of state operating permit programs. We will be required to comply with these EPA standards to the extent adopted by the State in which development projects are located.
 
Future regulations are unknown but expected to occur. The new U.S. Administration has rejoined the Paris Climate Accord and placed further restrictions on carbon-emitting activities. Future restrictions and higher standards could negatively impact our ability to bring new products to market, as well as bring new opportunities for products that can reduce CO2 emissions.
 
In addition, developing mining sites requires mitigation of long-term environmental impacts by stabilizing, contouring, re-sloping, and revegetating various portions of a site. While a portion of the required work can be performed concurrently with developing the property, completion of the environmental mitigation occurs once removal of all materials and facilities has been completed. These reclamation efforts are conducted in accordance with detailed plans which have been reviewed and approved by the appropriate regulatory agencies. The mining developer must ensure that all necessary cash deposits and financial resources to cover the estimated costs of such reclamation as required by permit are made.
 
We intend that any exploration and development of mining projects by the Company will be conducted in substantial compliance with federal and state regulations and be consistent with the need to remediate any environmental impact.

Agricultural Products Certifications
 
All sales of agricultural products have to be registered in order to be sold, distributed and /or applied in farming operations. Standards for registration are set and regulated by the USDA at the federal level. All state agencies must also comply with federal guidelines. There are guidelines for the registration and labelling of the products for agriculture use, some of which are federal, others are State. Our organic product, PureBase Shade Advantage WP, must meet several additional qualifications in order to become registered.
 
In California, for example, the task of regulating the registration processes is carried out by the CDFA. There are some activities within the regulatory process that are executed by recognized and licensed private entities such as chemical laboratories and certifying laboratories. In some instances, in accordance with various international treaties, some of bilateral and some by regional structures (European Union, etc.) and some governmental and private organizations are recognized and licensed to play particular roles in certifying and/or in the certifying processes.
 
Currently we have one product fully registered as an organic plant protectant, PureBase Shade Advantage WP. The WP stands for Wettable Powder which means the powder goes into suspension when mixed with water. We have registration certificates for this product in several states including California and Washington. Our product is currently registered in the US and California as an agricultural product.
 
Our newest product, Humic Advantage, has received an Organic Materials Review Institute certification and is currently approved for sale in Arizona and is under review with the CDFA for approval to sell Humic Advantage in California as a soil amendment.
 
Employees
 
The Company currently has four full-time employees and one part time employees. We currently anticipate hiring additional employees for the Company’s production operations, subject to sufficient funding, if our product development and distribution programs continue to expand.
 
Outside services, relating primarily to agricultural market research and product development, and the development and application of SCMs, as well as other technical matters related to product development and branding activities, will be provided by various independent contractors.
