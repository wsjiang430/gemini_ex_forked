Item 1. Business
Overview
Exelixis, Inc. (Exelixis, we, our or us) is an oncology-focused biotechnology company that aims to accelerate the discovery, development and commercialization of new medicines for difficult-to-treat cancers. Our drug discovery and development capabilities and commercialization platform are the foundations upon which we intend to bring to market novel, effective and tolerable therapies to provide cancer patients with additional treatment options.
Since we were founded in 1994, four products resulting from our discovery efforts have progressed through clinical development and received regulatory approval; three have a growing commercial presence worldwide, and we expect that the fourth will soon enter the marketplace in Japan. Two are derived from cabozantinib, our flagship molecule, an inhibitor of multiple tyrosine kinases including MET, AXL, VEGF receptors and RET. These are: CABOMETYX® (cabozantinib) tablets approved for advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and previously treated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); and COMETRIQ® (cabozantinib) capsules approved for progressive, metastatic medullary thyroid cancer (MTC). For these types of cancer, cabozantinib has become or is becoming a standard of care. Beyond its approved indications, cabozantinib is currently the focus of a broad clinical development program, and is being investigated both alone and in combination with other therapies in a wide variety of cancers. The growth that we have experienced in recent years is largely attributable to cabozantinib’s clinical and commercial success; consistent with our values and legal obligations, we are committed to ensuring that all patients who are prescribed cabozantinib are able to access this essential medicine.
The other two products resulting from our discovery efforts are: COTELLIC® (cobimetinib), an inhibitor of MEK approved as part of a combination regimen to treat advanced melanoma and marketed under a collaboration with Genentech, Inc. (a member of the Roche Group) (Genentech); and MINNEBRO™ (esaxerenone), an oral, non-steroidal, selective blocker of the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) approved for the treatment of hypertension in Japan and licensed to Daiichi Sankyo Company, Limited (Daiichi Sankyo).
Over the course of 2018, revenues from the sales of CABOMETYX and COMETRIQ and from the royalties and milestone payments received pursuant to collaboration agreements with our partners, coupled with disciplined expense management, have fueled the growth of our organization. We believe we can continue to grow in a sustainable manner, supported by a healthy cash position and profitability over the past two fiscal years. We are utilizing our cash and investments to enable future success by expanding the development program for cabozantinib and by building a pipeline of new drug candidates through reinitiated internal drug discovery efforts and the execution of strategic transactions that align with our oncology drug development and commercialization expertise. The following report details the progress we made executing our growth strategy in 2018.

Exelixis Marketed Products: CABOMETYX and COMETRIQ
CABOMETYX was first approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on April 25, 2016, for the treatment of patients with advanced RCC who have received prior anti-angiogenic therapy and by the European Commission (EC) on September 9, 2016, similarly for the treatment of advanced RCC in adults in the European Union (EU) following prior VEGF-targeted therapy. On December 19, 2017, the FDA approved the expanded indication for CABOMETYX to include previously untreated patients with advanced RCC, and the EC approved CABOMETYX on May 17, 2018 as a first-line treatment for adults with intermediate- or poor-risk advanced RCC. Most recently, CABOMETYX was approved by the FDA on January 14, 2019, for the treatment of patients with HCC who have been previously treated with sorafenib, which followed the EC’s earlier approval of CABOMETYX on November 15, 2018, for the treatment of HCC in adults previously treated with sorafenib. COMETRIQ, our first marketed product, was approved by the FDA on November 29, 2012, for the treatment of patients with progressive, metastatic MTC, and in March 2014, the EC granted COMETRIQ a conditional marketing authorization for the treatment of adult patients with progressive, unresectable locally advanced or metastatic MTC. In 2018 and 2017, we generated $619.3 million and $349.0 million, respectively, in net product revenues from sales of CABOMETYX and COMETRIQ in the U.S. 
Outside the U.S. and Japan, CABOMETYX and COMETRIQ are marketed by our collaboration partner Ipsen Pharma SAS (Ipsen). Should CABOMETYX and COMETRIQ be approved in Japan, they will be marketed by our collaboration partner Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (Takeda). In 2018 and 2017, we earned $32.3 million and $3.8 million, respectively, of gross royalties for net sales of products incorporating cabozantinib outside of the U.S. For additional information on the terms of our collaboration agreements with Ipsen and Takeda, see “—Collaborations—Cabozantinib Commercial Collaborations.”
Renal Cell Carcinoma - CABOMETYX is Now the Leading Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor (TKI) Treatment Option for Patients with Advanced RCC
Kidney cancer is among the top ten most commonly diagnosed forms of cancer among both men and women in the U.S., with approximately 30,000 patients requiring systemic treatment. Globally, approximately 68,000 patients require systemic treatment for kidney cancer. A growing number of these patients with RCC have been or will be treated with CABOMETYX, which has become a new standard of care for the treatment of patients suffering from this difficult-to-treat disease; in fact, as of December 2018, CABOMETYX was the TKI of choice among physicians treating these patients in terms of new prescriptions.
Since CABOMETYX was first approved, our promotional and medical affairs teams have been focused on educating physicians about CABOMETYX’s unique clinical profile. We believe that the success of CABOMETYX is attributable to this clinical profile, derived from the results of our clinical trials, METEOR and CABOSUN. CABOMETYX is the first and only single-agent therapy approved for previously treated advanced RCC to demonstrate statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in three key efficacy parameters in a global pivotal trial: overall survival (OS); progression-free survival (PFS); and objective response rate (ORR). In addition, in previously untreated patients with advanced RCC, CABOMETYX is the only approved single-agent therapy to improve PFS and ORR compared with sunitinib, a first-generation TKI that was the previous standard of care. It is also noteworthy that on September 7, 2018, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), the nation’s foremost non-profit alliance of leading cancer centers, updated its Clinical Practice Guidelines to recommend CABOMETYX as the only TKI with preferred status for advanced RCC patients who have progressed on prior therapy and for the treatment of advanced RCC regardless of patient risk status (favorable-, intermediate-, and poor risk). These updated recommendations strengthened the differentiation of CABOMETYX from other TKIs approved for this indication, leading many physicians to consider CABOMETYX a preferred therapeutic option, despite numerous competing products approved to treat advanced RCC. For additional information about CABOMETYX’s profile as expressed in the METEOR and CABOSUN clinical trial data, see “—Cabozantinib Development Program—Clinical Trials Supporting Regulatory Approvals.”
In markets outside the U.S. in 2018, we continued to work closely with our partner Ipsen in support of its regulatory strategy and commercialization efforts for CABOMETYX as a treatment for advanced RCC. As a result of the approvals of CABOMETYX for RCC indications in more than ten territories outside of the U.S., including the EU, Canada, Brazil, Taiwan, South Korea and Australia, CABOMETYX has continued to grow both in sales revenue and the number of RCC patients benefiting from its clinical effect. Additionally, with respect to the Japanese market, our partner Takeda is advancing its clinical development activities in Japan support of potential future regulatory filings for CABOMETYX in both RCC and HCC.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma - the CABOMETYX Label Expanded to Include Previously Treated HCC
According to published studies, liver cancer is a leading cause of cancer death worldwide, accounting for more than 700,000 deaths and 800,000 new cases each year. In the U.S., the incidence of liver cancer has more than tripled since 1980. Although HCC is the most common form of liver cancer, making up about three-fourths of the estimated nearly 42,000 new 
3


cases of liver cancer in the U.S. during 2018, this patient population was long underserved. Prior to 2017, there was only one approved systemic therapy for the treatment of HCC. Then, in 2017 and 2018, four new therapies were approved in the U.S. for HCC, one for previously untreated patients and three for patients previously treated with sorafenib. Given the introduction of new and more effective therapies, we believe the second- and later-line HCC market has the potential to grow significantly in coming years, as the new treatment options are expected to result in an increasing number of patients receiving multiple lines of therapy. With the recent approval of CABOMETYX in January 2019 for HCC patients previously treated with sorafenib, we aim to play a key role in the advancement of therapeutic options for these patients.
The FDA’s approval of CABOMETYX for this HCC indication was based on our phase 3 pivotal study, CELESTIAL. The CELESTIAL study met its primary endpoint, demonstrating that cabozantinib significantly improved OS, as compared to placebo. For additional information on CELESTIAL, see “—Cabozantinib Development Program—Clinical Trials Supporting Regulatory Approvals—HCC - CELESTIAL.” Upon FDA approval, we were immediately prepared to offer CABOMETYX to all eligible HCC patients in the U.S. who may benefit from this treatment option. We were able to take action so quickly due to the strength of our existing commercial and medical affairs organizations, in addition to our well-established distribution network and our ability to leverage our RCC commercialization experience. The NCCN’s inclusion of CABOMETYX in its Clinical Practice Guidelines for Hepatobiliary Cancers as a Category 1 option for the treatment of patients with HCC (Child-Pugh Class A only) who have been previously treated with sorafenib further supports CABOMETYX as an important new treatment option for eligible HCC patients.
Outside the U.S., the EC’s approval of CABOMETYX provided physicians in the EU with a second approved therapy for the second-line treatment of this aggressive and difficult-to-treat cancer.
Medullary Thyroid Cancer - COMETRIQ, the First Commercial Approval of Cabozantinib
We estimate that there are between 500 and 700 first-line and second-line patients in the U.S. who will be eligible for COMETRIQ. The FDA’s approval of COMETRIQ for this MTC indication was based on our phase 3 trial, EXAM. The EXAM trial met its primary endpoint, demonstrating a statistically significant and clinically meaningful prolongation in PFS for cabozantinib, as compared to placebo. For additional information on EXAM, see “—Cabozantinib Development Program—Clinical Trials Supporting Regulatory Approvals—MTC - EXAM.” In 2018 and 2017, we generated $19.3 million and $25.0 million, respectively, in net product revenues from sales of COMETRIQ in the U.S.
Cabozantinib Development Program
Cabozantinib inhibits the activity of tyrosine kinases, including MET, AXL, VEGF receptors, and RET. These receptor tyrosine kinases are involved in both normal cellular function and in pathologic processes such as oncogenesis, metastasis, tumor angiogenesis, drug resistance and maintenance of the tumor microenvironment. Objective tumor responses have been observed in patients treated with cabozantinib in more than 20 individual tumor types investigated in phase 1 and 2 clinical trials to date, reflecting the medicine’s broad clinical potential. We are currently evaluating cabozantinib, both as a single agent and in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), in a broad development program comprising over 75 ongoing or planned clinical trials across multiple indications. We, along with our clinical and commercial collaboration partners, sponsor some of those trials, and independent investigators conduct the remaining trials through our Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with the National Cancer Institute’s Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (NCI-CTEP) or our investigator sponsored trial (IST) program. In addition to co-sponsoring trials with us, our commercial collaboration partners Ipsen and Takeda also conduct trials in their territories through similar independently-sponsored programs.

Clinical Trials Supporting Regulatory Approvals
RCC - METEOR
In July 2015, we announced positive results of METEOR, a phase 3 pivotal trial comparing CABOMETYX to everolimus in patients with advanced RCC who have experienced disease progression following treatment with at least one prior VEGF receptor inhibitor. METEOR met its primary endpoint, demonstrating a statistically significant and clinically 
6


meaningful increase in PFS for CABOMETYX. The median PFS was 7.4 months for the CABOMETYX arm versus 3.8 months for the everolimus arm. CABOMETYX also significantly improved ORR, a secondary endpoint, compared with everolimus. In September 2015, The New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) published the complete, detailed positive results from the primary analysis of METEOR, and these results were also presented at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) 2015 Congress. After additional follow up, METEOR also met its other secondary endpoint of OS, as presented in June 2016 at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) 2016 Annual Meeting and published in Lancet Oncology. The median OS was 21.4 months for patients receiving CABOMETYX versus 16.5 months for those receiving everolimus. The safety profile in the study and in later analyses was consistent with the established profile of cabozantinib and other TKIs.
On the basis of the data from the METEOR trial, the FDA approved CABOMETYX for the treatment of patients with advanced RCC following prior antiangiogenic therapy, and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) approved CABOMETYX for the treatment of advanced RCC in adults following prior VEGF-targeted therapy.
RCC - CABOSUN
In October 2016, we announced positive results from CABOSUN, a randomized, open-label, active-controlled phase 2 trial comparing cabozantinib with sunitinib in patients with previously untreated advanced RCC with intermediate- or poor-risk disease conducted by The Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology under our CRADA with NCI-CTEP. These results were presented at the ESMO 2016 Congress in October 2016 and subsequently published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology in November 2016. CABOSUN met its primary endpoint, demonstrating a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in investigator-assessed PFS compared with sunitinib. The median PFS for cabozantinib was 8.2 months versus 5.6 months for sunitinib. Investigator-assessed ORR, a secondary endpoint, was also significantly improved, at 33% for cabozantinib versus 12% for sunitinib, and median OS, another secondary endpoint, showed a trend favoring cabozantinib with 30.3 months versus 21.8 months for sunitinib. Updated results from CABOSUN were presented at the ESMO 2017 Congress in September 2017 and subsequently published in the European Journal of Cancer in May 2018. The updated results included the analysis from a blinded independent radiology review committee (IRRC), which confirmed the primary efficacy endpoint results of investigator-assessed PFS, as well as an updated investigator-assessed analysis. Per the IRRC analysis, the median PFS for cabozantinib was 8.6 months versus 5.3 months for sunitinib, and both the updated investigator assessment and IRRC analysis demonstrated consistent and statistically significant improvement of PFS with cabozantinib as compared to sunitinib. The updated OS analysis had a data cut-off of July 1, 2017, and showed a favorable trend for patients randomized to cabozantinib compared to sunitinib that was not statistically significant. Median OS was 26.6 months for patients receiving cabozantinib versus 21.2 months for those receiving sunitinib. The safety profile in the study and in later analyses was consistent with the established profile of cabozantinib and other TKIs.
On the basis of the data from the CABOSUN trial, the FDA approved CABOMETYX for the treatment of patients with previously untreated, advanced or metastatic RCC on December 19, 2017, and we commenced our commercial launch of CABOMETYX for this new indication immediately upon such approval. Additionally, on May 17, 2018, the EC approved cabozantinib as a first-line treatment for adults with intermediate- or poor-risk advanced RCC.
RCC - Retrospective Analyses of CABOSUN and METEOR
As the advanced RCC treatment landscape continues to evolve and include multiple ICI treatment options, biomarker analyses are of increasing importance to help select for advanced RCC patients who would potentially derive the most clinical benefit from CABOMETYX. Two relevant retrospective analyses were presented at the ESMO 2018 Congress in October 2018 that described the potential utility of CABOMETYX in patients with advanced RCC regardless of their PD-L1 status, as well as in those patients with advanced RCC who progressed on previous ICI monotherapy or combination treatment.
The first analysis of data from the CABOSUN and METEOR trials evaluated the effect of PD-L1 expression on clinical outcomes with cabozantinib in advanced RCC and demonstrated that cabozantinib improved clinical outcomes regardless of PD-L1 status, relative to sunitinib or everolimus, the respective comparator arms for each trial. The findings showed that PD-L1 expression was associated with shorter median PFS and OS in both METEOR and CABOSUN. Treatment with cabozantinib, however, improved PFS and OS compared with everolimus (METEOR) and sunitinib (CABOSUN) in both PD-L1 positive and PD-L1 negative patients. An additional retrospective analysis found that cabozantinib was active in patients previously treated with ICIs, either alone or in combination with anti-VEGF or other therapies. At a median follow-up of 12 months, ORR was 33%, disease control rate (DCR) was 79% and the one-year OS rate was 53%. Together, these analyses evaluating data from the CABOSUN and METEOR clinical trials contribute to cabozantinib’s unique product profile, as well as its value as a treatment option for patients with advanced RCC within an evolving and competitive treatment landscape that includes multiple ICI treatment options.

HCC - CELESTIAL
In October 2017, we announced positive results of CELESTIAL, our phase 3 pivotal trial comparing cabozantinib to placebo in patients with HCC who had received previous treatment with sorafenib. The CELESTIAL trial, which we initiated in September 2013, was designed to enroll 760 patients who had received prior systemic therapy with sorafenib, could have received up to two prior systemic therapies for HCC, and must have progressed following at least one prior therapy. The CELESTIAL trial was conducted at more than 100 sites globally in 19 countries and enrollment was completed in September 2017. Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive 60 mg of cabozantinib daily or placebo and were stratified based on etiology of the disease (hepatitis C, hepatitis B or other), geographic region (Asia or other regions) and presence of extrahepatic spread and/or macrovascular invasion (yes or no). No cross-over was allowed between the study arms.
In October 16, 2017, we announced that CELESTIAL had met its primary endpoint, with cabozantinib providing a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement versus placebo in OS, and that the independent data monitoring committee (IDMC), recommended CELESTIAL be stopped for efficacy. In January 2018, statistically significant and clinically meaningful positive results from the second interim analysis of CELESTIAL were presented during an oral session at the 2018 ASCO’s Gastrointestinal Cancers Symposium. In July 2018, the NEJM also published the complete, detailed positive results from CELESTIAL. In the total population of second- and third-line patients, median OS was 10.2 months with cabozantinib versus 8.0 months with placebo (hazard ratio (HR) 0.76; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.63-0.92; p=0.0049). Median PFS was more than doubled, at 5.2 months with cabozantinib and 1.9 months with placebo (HR 0.44; 95% CI 0.36-0.52; p<0.0001). ORR was 4% with cabozantinib and 0.4% with placebo (p=0.0086). Disease control (partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD)) was achieved by 64% of patients in the cabozantinib group compared with 33% in the placebo group. In a subgroup analysis of patients whose only prior therapy for HCC was sorafenib (70% of patients in the study), median OS was 11.3 months with cabozantinib versus 7.2 months with placebo (HR 0.70; 95% CI 0.55-0.88). PFS in the subgroup was 5.5 months with cabozantinib versus 1.9 months with placebo (HR 0.40; 95% CI 0.32-0.50). The safety profile of cabozantinib observed in the study was consistent with the established profile of cabozantinib and other TKIs.
On the basis of the data from the CELESTIAL trial, the FDA approved CABOMETYX on January 14, 2019 for the treatment of patients with HCC who have been previously treated with sorafenib, and we commenced our commercial launch of CABOMETYX for this new indication immediately upon such approval. Additionally, on November 15, 2018, our partner Ipsen received EC approval of CABOMETYX as a monotherapy for HCC in adults who have previously been treated with sorafenib.
MTC - EXAM
In October 2011, we announced positive results from EXAM, a phase 3 international, multi-center, randomized double-blinded controlled trial of COMETRIQ in patients with progressive, metastatic MTC. EXAM met its primary endpoint, demonstrating a statistically significant and clinically meaningful prolongation in PFS for COMETRIQ-treated patients compared to those receiving placebo, with median PFS of 11.2 months in the COMETRIQ arm versus 4.0 months in the placebo arm. In addition, the ORR was 27% with PRs observed only among patients in the COMETRIQ arm, and the median duration of objective response was 14.7 months for patients treated with COMETRIQ. These primary results were presented at the ASCO 2012 Annual Meeting in June 2012 and subsequently published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology in October 2013. In November 2014, we announced completion of the OS analysis, a secondary endpoint of the study. Consistent with an earlier interim analysis, there was no statistically significant difference in OS between the treatment arms. The median OS was 26.6 months for the COMETRIQ arm and 21.1 months for the placebo arm. We presented the final results at the ASCO 2015 Annual Meeting and submitted the results to regulatory authorities to satisfy post-marketing commitments. The safety profile in the study was consistent with the established profile of cabozantinib and other TKIs.
On the basis of the data from the EXAM trial, the FDA approved COMETRIQ on November 29, 2012, for the treatment of patients with progressive, metastatic MTC. In March 2014, the EC granted COMETRIQ a conditional marketing authorization for the treatment of adult patients with progressive, unresectable locally advanced or metastatic MTC. COMETRIQ is marketed and commercialized in the EU by Ipsen. In connection with the approval of COMETRIQ for the treatment of progressive, metastatic MTC, we were subject to post-marketing requirements, all of which have been satisfied, other than a requirement to conduct the EXAMINER clinical study, comparing a lower dose of cabozantinib with the labeled dose of 140 mg. EXAMINER is evaluating safety and PFS in progressive, metastatic MTC patients and is ongoing.
Late-Stage Exelixis Sponsored Trials Evaluating Cabozantinib as a Monotherapy
DTC - COSMIC-311
Published studies indicate that approximately 54,000 new cases of thyroid cancer will be diagnosed in the U.S. in 2019. With the incidence of thyroid cancer increasing more rapidly than any other type of cancer in the U.S., and limited 
8


options available to patients whose disease has progressed following treatment with radioiodine (RAI) and anti-VEGFR therapy, we believe there is an urgent need for new treatment options.
Informed by cabozantinib’s encouraging clinical activity in phase 1 and 2 studies in patients with RAI-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC), in October 2018 we initiated COSMIC-311, a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 pivotal trial evaluating cabozantinib in patients with RAI-refractory DTC who have progressed after up to two prior VEGFR-targeted therapies. The co-primary endpoints for the trial are PFS and ORR. The trial aims to enroll approximately 300 patients at approximately 150 sites globally. Patients will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either cabozantinib 60 mg or placebo once daily.
Trials Conducted Under our Clinical Collaboration Agreements
Cabozantinib has shown clinical anti-tumor activity with objective responses observed in more than 20 forms of cancer in phase 1 and 2 evaluation; we are, therefore, focused on advancing a broad cabozantinib clinical development program to fully investigate its therapeutic potential, both alone and in combination with other therapies. In particular, given that clinical observations from early-stage clinical trials evaluating cabozantinib in combination with ICIs have shown preliminary promising activity across a diverse range of tumors, and that patients have been able to tolerate these drug combinations, we are focused on exploring the potential of cabozantinib in combination with ICI’s in later-stage settings. 
Combination Studies with Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMS)
Preclinical data and clinical observations from an ongoing phase 1 trial evaluating cabozantinib in combination with nivolumab, with or without ipilimumab, in patients with previously treated genitourinary tumors suggest that cabozantinib may result in a more immune-permissive tumor environment. In consideration of those results, in February 2017, we entered into a clinical collaboration agreement with BMS for the purpose of conducting clinical studies combining cabozantinib with BMS’ PD-1 ICI, nivolumab, both with or without BMS’ CTLA-4 ICI, ipilimumab.
As part of the collaboration, we are evaluating these combinations in a phase 3 pivotal trial in previously untreated or metastatic advanced RCC and in a phase 1/2 trial in both previously treated and previously untreated advanced HCC. We also intend to evaluate these combinations in other phase 3 pivotal trials in various other tumor types, including UC. Pursuant to our agreements with BMS, each party will be responsible for supplying finished drug product for the applicable clinical trial, and responsibility for the payment of costs for each trial will be determined on a trial-by-trial basis. For additional information on the terms of the clinical trial collaboration agreement, see “—Collaborations—Cabozantinib Development Collaborations—BMS.”
RCC - CheckMate 9ER
CheckMate 9ER is an open-label, randomized, multi-national phase 3 pivotal trial evaluating nivolumab in combination with cabozantinib versus sunitinib in patients with previously untreated, advanced or metastatic RCC. The original trial protocol required patients to be randomized 1:1:1 to one of three arms: cabozantinib and nivolumab; cabozantinib, nivolumab and ipilimumab; or sunitinib. However, following the positive results of CheckMate 214, BMS’s phase 3 trial evaluating nivolumab combined with ipilimumab versus sunitinib monotherapy in patients with previously untreated metastatic RCC and in an effort to accelerate the development of the cabozantinib and nivolumab combination, the trial protocol was amended to remove the triplet combination. The modified protocol for the trial aims to enroll approximately 580 patients with previously untreated, advanced or metastatic RCC of all risk groups. Patients are being randomized 1:1 to receive either 40 mg of cabozantinib daily and 240 mg of nivolumab every 2 weeks, or 50 mg of sunitinib daily on a 4-weeks-on/2-weeks-off schedule. The primary endpoint for the trial is PFS and the secondary endpoint is OS. The triplet combination continues to be evaluated in an ongoing phase 1b trial in patients with advanced genitourinary malignancies and a separate phase 3 trial evaluating the triplet combination versus nivolumab and ipilimumab is in preparation.
HCC - Checkmate 040
CheckMate 040 is a large, multi-cohort phase 1/2 trial in patients with previously treated and previously untreated advanced HCC, including a cohort evaluating treatment regimens that include cabozantinib in combination with nivolumab or in combination with both nivolumab and ipilimumab. This cohort containing the cabozantinib combination treatment regimens enrolled approximately 30 patients into each of two groups in accordance with the trial protocol, with one group receiving 40 mg of cabozantinib daily and 3 mg of nivolumab every two weeks, and the other group receiving 40 mg of cabozantinib daily, 3 mg of nivolumab every two weeks and 1 mg ipilimumab every six weeks. The primary objectives for the cohorts are safety and tolerability, ORR and duration of response (DOR) and the secondary objectives include time to progression (TTP), PFS and OS.

Combination Studies with the Roche Group (Roche)
Diversifying our exploration of cabozantinib combinations with ICIs, in February 2017, we entered into a master clinical supply agreement with Roche for the purpose of evaluating cabozantinib and Roche’s anti-PD-L1 ICI, atezolizumab, in locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors. As part of the collaboration, we are evaluating this combination in a phase 1b trial in locally advanced or metastatic tumors and a phase 3 pivotal trial in previously untreated advanced HCC. Depending on results from the phase 1b trial, COSMIC-021, we may also evaluate this combination in various other tumor types, including NSCLC. For additional information on the terms of the master clinical supply agreement, see “—Collaborations—Cabozantinib Development Collaborations—Roche.”
Locally Advanced or Metastatic Solid Tumors - COSMIC-021
In June 2017, we initiated COSMIC-021, a phase 1b dose escalation study that is evaluating the safety and tolerability of cabozantinib in combination with Roche’s atezolizumab in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors. We are the trial sponsor of COSMIC-021, and Roche is providing atezolizumab free of charge. 
The study is divided into two parts: a dose-escalation phase, which was completed in 2018; and an expansion cohort phase, which is ongoing. The dose-escalation phase of the trial enrolled 12 patients with advanced RCC, and results were presented at the ESMO 2018 Congress. The primary objective was to determine the optimal dose and schedule of daily oral administration of cabozantinib when given in combination with atezolizumab to inform the trial’s subsequent expansion stage. Cabozantinib doses of 40 mg daily and 60 mg daily were evaluated. All patients received the standard atezolizumab dosing regimen of 1200 mg infusion once every 3 weeks. The dose-escalation phase of the study determined the optimal dose of cabozantinib as 40 mg daily when given in combination with the standard atezolizumab dosing regimen of 1200 mg infusion once every 3 weeks. No dose-limiting toxicities or serious adverse events (AEs) were noted. Dose reductions and higher grade AEs were less frequent with the 40 mg cabozantinib dosing cohort. Encouraging clinical activity was also observed. The safety profile for the combination in the dose-escalation phase of the trial was consistent with the established profile of each combination agent, and no new safety signals have emerged.
 Enrollment in the expansion stage of this study, which is currently ongoing, includes the following eighteen combination tumor expansion cohorts:

• | patients with advanced non-squamous NSCLC without a defined tumor genetic alteration (EGFR, ALK, ROS1, or BRAF) who have not received prior therapy with an ICI;


• | patients with NSCLC without a defined tumor genetic alteration who have progressed following treatment with an ICI;


• | patients with NSCLC with an EGFR mutation who have progressed following treatment with an EGFR-targeting TKI for metastatic disease;


• | patients with UC who have progressed following treatment with an ICI;


• | patients with CRPC who have previously received enzalutamide and/or abiraterone acetate and experienced radiographic disease progression in soft tissue;


• | patients with RCC with clear cell histology who have not had prior systemic anticancer therapy;


• | patients with RCC with non-clear cell histology who have not had prior systemic anticancer therapy for inoperable, locally advanced, recurrent or metastatic disease;


• | patients with UC who have progressed on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy;


• | patients with UC who are ineligible for cisplatin-based chemotherapy and have not received prior systemic chemotherapy for inoperable, locally advanced or metastatic disease;


• | patients with UC who are eligible for cisplatin-based chemotherapy and have not received prior systemic chemotherapy for inoperable, locally advanced or metastatic disease;


• | patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) who have progressed following treatment with at least one prior systemic therapy for inoperable, locally advanced, recurrent or metastatic disease;


• | patients with epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) who have platinum-resistant or refractory disease;


• | patients with endometrial cancer who have progressed following treatment with at least one prior systemic therapy for inoperable, locally advanced, recurrent or metastatic disease;


• | patients with advanced HCC who have a Child-Pugh score of A and have not had prior systemic anticancer therapy for inoperable, locally advanced, recurrent or metastatic disease;

10



• | patients with gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma who have progressed following treatment with platinum-containing or fluoropyrimidine-containing chemotherapy for inoperable locally advanced, recurrent or metastatic disease;


• | patients with colorectal adenocarcinoma who have progressed following treatment with systemic chemotherapy that contained fluoropyrimidine in combination with oxaliplatin or irinotecan for metastatic disease;


• | patients with head and neck cancer of squamous cell histology who have progressed following treatment with platinum-containing chemotherapy for inoperable locally advanced, recurrent or metastatic disease; and


• | patients with DTC who are radio-refractory or deemed ineligible for treatment with iodine-131.

Each expansion cohort will initially enroll approximately 30 patients, and cohorts may be further expanded, including the cohorts of patients with UC or NSCLC who have been previously treated with an ICI, for a total of up to 1,000 patients. In addition, there are two exploratory cohorts that will evaluate cabozantinib as a single-agent therapy in patients with NSCLC without a defined tumor genetic alteration and in patients with UC, in each case who have progressed following treatment with an ICI.
HCC - COSMIC-312
In December 2018, we initiated COSMIC-312, a multicenter, randomized, controlled phase 3 pivotal trial evaluating cabozantinib in combination with atezolizumab versus sorafenib in previously untreated advanced HCC. The co-primary endpoints of the trial are PFS and OS. An exploratory arm will also evaluate cabozantinib monotherapy in this first-line setting. The study aims to enroll approximately 640 patients at up to 200 sites globally. Patients will be randomized to one of three arms: cabozantinib and atezolizumab (40 mg); sorafenib; or cabozantinib (60 mg). The co-primary endpoints for the trial are PFS and OS.
We are sponsoring COSMIC-312, and Ipsen will co-fund the trial. Ipsen will have access to the results to support potential future regulatory submissions outside of the U.S. and Japan. Roche is providing atezolizumab free of charge.
Trials Conducted through our CRADA with NCI-CTEP and our IST Program
In October 2011, we entered into a CRADA with NCI-CTEP for the clinical development of cabozantinib. Through our CRADA with NCI-CTEP and our IST program we have been able to expand the cabozantinib development program while avoiding over-burdening our internal development resources. Our CRADA reflects a major commitment by NCI-CTEP to support the broad exploration of cabozantinib’s potential in a wide variety of cancers, each representing a substantial unmet medical need. Through this mechanism, NCI-CTEP provides funding for as many as 20 active clinical trials of cabozantinib each year for a five-year period. The term of the CRADA was extended in October 2016 for an additional five-year period through October 2021, provided that both parties maintain the right to terminate the CRADA for any reason upon sixty days’ notice, for an uncured material breach upon thirty days’ notice and immediately for safety concerns. Investigational New Drug (IND) applications for trials under the CRADA are held by NCI-CTEP. NCI-CTEP also retains rights to any inventions made in whole or in part by NCI-CTEP investigators. However, for inventions that claim the use and/or the composition of cabozantinib, we have an automatic option to elect a worldwide, non-exclusive license to cabozantinib inventions for commercial purposes, with the right to sublicense to affiliates or collaborators working on our behalf, as well as an additional, separate option to negotiate an exclusive license to cabozantinib inventions. Further, before any trial proposed under the CRADA may commence, the protocol is subject to our review and approval, and the satisfaction of certain other conditions. We believe our CRADA with NCI-CTEP has and will enable us to continue to expand the cabozantinib development program broadly in a cost-efficient manner.
Advanced Genitourinary Tumors
Results from a phase 1 trial evaluating cabozantinib in combination with nivolumab in patients with previously treated genitourinary tumors being conducted under our CRADA with NCI-CTEP were first presented at the ESMO 2016 Congress in October 2016 and most recently updated at the 2018 ASCO Genitourinary Cancers Symposium in February 2018. The updated data reported results from 78 patients treated with either cabozantinib and nivolumab with or without ipilimumab. Forty-nine patients were treated with the doublet combination of cabozantinib and nivolumab and 29 patients were treated with the triplet combination of cabozantinib, nivolumab and ipilimumab. Among the nineteen patients with metastatic UC who were evaluable for response, the ORR across all treatment groups was 42% (2 complete responses (CRs) and 6 PRs of 19 patients) and the DCR (DCR = CR, PR and SD) was 84%. Seven of eight (88%) metastatic UC patients with an objective response had not progressed at the time of the data cut-off. Median PFS in this patient population was 12.8 months and the OS rate at 12 months was 77%. Among the 13 patients with metastatic RCC who were evaluable for response, ORR was 54 percent (7 PRs of 13 patients) and the DCR was 100%. In the overall study the ORR in 64 evaluable patients was 36% (3 CRs and 20 PRs) with a median DOR of 24 months. 78 patients were included in the safety analysis. No dose-limiting 
11


toxicity was observed in the study. Based on general tolerability, the recommended cabozantinib dose for the expanded dose cohorts and for future late stage evaluation was determined as cabozantinib at 40 mg daily oral dose combined with nivolumab at 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks and ipilimumab at 1 mg/kg every 3 weeks for 4 doses. The safety profile for the combination in the trial was consistent with the established profile of each combination agent, and no new safety signals have emerged. This phase 1b study supported the choice of dose for the ongoing CheckMate 9ER trial in previously untreated advanced RCC.
DTC
Results from a phase 2 single-arm, open-label trial evaluating cabozantinib for the first-line treatment of metastatic RAI-refractory DTC, an IST conducted by the Center for Rare Cancers and Personalized Therapy at the Abramson Cancer Center of the University of Pennsylvania, were presented at the 2018 Multidisciplinary Head and Neck Cancers Symposium in February 2018. The primary endpoint of the trial was ORR. Patients were administered oral cabozantinib 60 mg once daily. Among the 35 patients who were evaluable for response, PR was achieved by 54% of patients (n=19), and SD was reported in 43 percent of patients (n=15) per RECIST 1.1. All but one evaluated patient experienced a decrease in tumor target lesions. Secondary endpoints of the trial included PFS, TTP, DOR and clinical benefit rate (CBR), defined as the number of patients achieving an objective response or stable disease for at least 6 months. The CBR at six months was 80% (n=28). With a median follow up for the study of 35 weeks, the median PFS had not been reached. The median TTP among those patients who progressed was 35 weeks. The safety profile in the study was consistent with the established profile of cabozantinib and other TKIs. It was on the basis of these encouraging trial results and results from earlier phase 1 and 2 trials in RAI-refractory DTC patients who had received prior systemic therapies that we initiated COSMIC-311.
NSCLC
In November 2014, we announced positive top-line results from a randomized phase 2 trial of cabozantinib and erlotinib alone or in combination as second- or third-line therapy in patients with stage IV EGFR wild-type NSCLC. This trial (Study E1512) was sponsored through our CRADA with NCI-CTEP and was conducted by the ECOG-ACRIN Cancer Research Group. The positive results from this trial were reported at the ASCO 2015 Annual Meeting in May 2015 and subsequently published online in Lancet Oncology in November 2016. The study met its primary endpoint, demonstrating significant increases in PFS for cabozantinib and the combination of cabozantinib plus erlotinib when individually compared to the erlotinib arm. The safety profile for the combination in the trial was consistent with the established profile of other TKI/TKI combination therapies. Informed by these clinical results, we are working with clinical collaborators to explore cabozantinib’s further development in NSCLC, including potential combination approaches with ICIs, such as within one of the expansion cohorts of COSMIC-021, our phase 1b study with Roche evaluating the combination of cabozantinib and atezolizumab.
Other Cancer Indications
There are 46 ongoing and 30 planned externally sponsored trials evaluating the clinical and therapeutic potential of cabozantinib, including those administered through our CRADA with NCI-CTEP and our IST program. Like our CRADA with NCI-CTEP, our IST program helps us to continue to evaluate cabozantinib across a broad range of tumor types. 
These externally sponsored trials include signal seeking studies of single-agent cabozantinib, novel combinations, and randomized trials. The monotherapy trials are focused on solid tumors including genitourinary neoplasms, gastrointestinal malignancies, lung cancer and a variety of less common tumor types. The combination studies include trials combining cabozantinib with several different ICIs, as well as studies adding cabozantinib to monoclonal antibodies and small molecules which target specific cellular pathways. Randomized trials within the CRADA include a phase 3 study in neuroendocrine tumors and phase 2 trials in both endometrial cancer in combination with checkpoint inhibitors and in prostate cancer in combination with docetaxel.
A complete listing of all ongoing cabozantinib trials can be found at www.ClinicalTrials.gov.
XL092 Development Program
XL092 is the first internally-discovered Exelixis compound to enter the clinic following the company’s reinitiation of drug discovery activities. XL092 is a next-generation oral TKI that targets VEGF receptors, MET, and other kinases implicated in cancer’s growth and spread. The molecule is the subject of an active IND that we submitted to the FDA in December 2018, and that the FDA accepted in January 2019. XL092 will initially be studied in a multi-center phase 1 clinical trial designed to evaluate its pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability. The trial is divided into dose-escalation and expansion phases. The dose-escalation phase of the trial will enroll patients with advanced solid tumors, with the primary objective of determining a dose for daily oral administration of XL092 suitable for further evaluation. Assuming positive data from the initial phase of 
12


the trial, the expansion phase is designed to further explore the selected dose of XL092 in individual tumor cohorts, where safety, tolerability, and initial clinical activity would be evaluated.
Expansion of the Exelixis Pipeline: Drug Discovery and Business Development Programs
We are actively focused on expanding our pipeline through internal drug discovery and targeted business development activities. 
Drug Discovery
As we continue to work to maximize the clinical, therapeutic and commercial potential of cabozantinib, we are also working to rebuild our product pipeline by discovering and developing new cancer therapies for patients. From 2000 until 2012, we had an active discovery group that advanced 22 compounds to the IND stage, either independently or with collaboration partners, including cabozantinib and cobimetinib. We built significant infrastructure, including a library of 4.6 million compounds, and gained extensive experience in the identification and optimization of drug candidates against multiple target classes for oncology, inflammation and metabolic diseases.
In 2016, we resumed internal drug discovery efforts with the goal of identifying novel and promising therapeutic candidates to advance into clinical trials. Furthest along in these efforts is XL092. For additional information on XL092, see “—XL092 Development Program.”
Our new discovery organization is leveraging that history in a focused and measured manner. We are concentrating our in-house work on the most demanding and time-sensitive aspects of lead optimization and use contract research organizations to support more routine activities, thereby minimizing our internal footprint while still maintaining an agile, competitive approach. We are and will continue to be judicious in the selection of targets, focusing on those with robust preclinical validation datasets. We remain focused on oncology as a therapeutic area, and prioritize those targets that we believe, for example, are key components of signaling pathways frequently deregulated in human cancers or are components of mechanisms that contribute to tumor-mediated immune suppression. We anticipate that our experience identifying high quality lead compounds against a variety of target classes through use of our propriety compound library, coupled with our expertise in medicinal chemistry, tumor biology and pharmacology, will permit us to prosecute competitive and productive discovery programs in areas of high potential.
Business Development
We are also focused on augmenting our pipeline by entering into collaborative relationships or in-licensing agreements for attractive, early-stage oncology assets and then further developing them utilizing our established and validated clinical development infrastructure. As part of this strategy, in January 2018, we entered into an exclusive collaboration and license agreement with StemSynergy Therapeutics, Inc. (StemSynergy) for the discovery and development of novel oncology compounds aimed to inhibit tumor growth by targeting Casein Kinase 1 alpha (CK1α), a component of the Wnt signaling pathway implicated in key oncogenic processes. Additionally, in May 2018, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Invenra, Inc. (Invenra) which is focused on developing next-generation biologics, to discover and develop multispecific antibodies for the treatment of cancer. We have already made considerable progress under our collaborations with both StemSynergy and Invenra and believe we will continue to do so in 2019. For additional information on our collaboration with StemSynergy, see “—Collaborations—StemSynergy Collaboration,” and for additional information on our collaboration with Invenra, see “—Collaborations—Invenra Collaboration.”
We are seeking additional, external collaborative relationships around assets and technologies that complement our in-house drug discovery and development efforts. These collaborative relationships are aimed at expanding our ability to discover, develop and commercialize novel therapies with the goal of providing new treatment options for cancer patients and their physicians.
Collaborations
We have established multiple collaborations with leading pharmaceutical companies for the commercialization and further development of cabozantinib, as well as with smaller, discovery-focused biotechnology companies to expand our product pipeline. Additionally, in line with our business strategy prior to the commercialization of our first product, COMETRIQ, we entered into other collaborations with leading pharmaceutical companies including Genentech, Daiichi Sankyo and BMS for other compounds and programs in our portfolio. Under each of our collaborations, we are entitled to receive milestones and royalties or, in the case of cobimetinib, royalties from sales outside the U.S. and a share of profits (or losses) from commercialization in the U.S.

Cabozantinib Commercial Collaborations
Ipsen Collaboration
In February 2016, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Ipsen for the commercialization and further development of cabozantinib. Pursuant to the terms of the collaboration agreement, Ipsen received exclusive commercialization rights for current and potential future cabozantinib indications outside of the U.S., Canada and Japan. The collaboration agreement was subsequently amended in December 2016 to include commercialization rights in Canada. We have also agreed to collaborate with Ipsen on the development of cabozantinib for current and potential future indications. The parties’ efforts are governed through a joint steering committee and appropriate subcommittees established to guide and oversee the collaboration’s operation and strategic direction; provided, however, that we retain final decision-making authority with respect to cabozantinib’s ongoing development. 
 In consideration for the exclusive license and other rights contained in the collaboration agreement, including commercialization rights in Canada, Ipsen paid us aggregate upfront payments of $210.0 million. As of December 31, 2018, we achieved aggregate milestone payments of $275.0 million related to regulatory and commercial progress by Ipsen since the inception of the collaboration agreement, including milestone payments during 2018 of (i) $50.0 million upon the EMA filing and the approval of cabozantinib as a treatment for patients with previously untreated RCC, (ii) $25.0 million upon Ipsen’s achievement of $100.0 million of net sales cumulatively over four consecutive fiscal quarters, (iii) $50.0 million upon EMA filing and the approval of cabozantinib as a treatment for patients with previously treated HCC, (iv) $5.0 million upon the approval by Health Canada of cabozantinib for the treatment of adults with advanced RCC who have received prior VEGF-targeted therapy and (v) $20.0 million upon the initiation of COSMIC-312.
We are also eligible to receive future development and regulatory milestone payments from Ipsen, totaling an aggregate of $84.0 million upon additional approvals of cabozantinib in future indications and/or jurisdictions, as well as contingent payments of up to $519.5 million associated with future sales volume milestones. We will further receive royalties on net sales of cabozantinib by Ipsen outside of the U.S. and Japan. We were initially entitled to receive a tiered royalty of 2% to 12% on the initial $150.0 million of net sales; this amount was reached in the second quarter of 2018. As of December 31, 2018 and going forward, we are entitled to receive a tiered royalty of 22% to 26% on annual net sales (with separate tiers for Canada); these 22% to 26% royalty tiers reset each calendar year. In Canada, we are entitled to receive a tiered royalty of 22% on the first CAD$30.0 million of annual net sales and a tiered royalty thereafter to 26% on annual net sales; these 22% to 26% royalty tiers for Canada will also reset each calendar year. As of December 31, 2018, we have earned royalties of $36.3 million on net sales of cabozantinib by Ipsen since the inception of the collaboration agreement. 
Consistent with our historical agreement with GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), we are required to pay a 3% royalty to GSK on all net sales of any product incorporating cabozantinib, including net sales by Ipsen.
We are responsible for funding cabozantinib-related development costs for those trials in existence at the time we entered into the collaboration agreement with Ipsen; global development costs for additional trials are shared between the parties, with Ipsen reimbursing us for 35% of such costs, provided Ipsen chooses to opt into such trials. In accordance with the collaboration agreement, Ipsen has opted into and is co-funding: CheckMate 9ER; CheckMate 040 (though Ipsen will not be co-funding the triplet arm of the study evaluating cabozantinib with nivolumab and ipilimumab); the dose escalation phase and first eight expansion cohorts of COSMIC-021; and COSMIC-312.
We remain responsible for manufacturing and supply of cabozantinib for all development and commercialization activities under the collaboration agreement. In connection with the collaboration agreement, we entered into a supply agreement with Ipsen to supply finished and labeled drug product to Ipsen for distribution in the territories outside of the U.S. and Japan for the term of the collaboration agreement, as well as a quality agreement that provides respective quality responsibilities for the aforementioned supply. Furthermore, at the time we entered into the collaboration agreement, the parties also entered into a pharmacovigilance agreement, which defines each partner’s responsibilities for safety reporting. The pharmacovigilance agreement also requires us to maintain the global safety database for cabozantinib. To meet our obligations to regulatory authorities for the reporting of safety data from territories outside of the U.S. and Japan from sources other than our sponsored global clinical development trials, we rely on data collected and reported to us by Ipsen.
Unless terminated earlier, the collaboration agreement has a term that continues, on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, until the latter of (i) the expiration of patent claims related to cabozantinib, (ii) the expiration of regulatory exclusivity covering cabozantinib or (iii) ten years after the first commercial sale of cabozantinib, other than COMETRIQ. The supply agreement will continue in effect until expiration or termination of the collaboration agreement. The collaboration agreement may be terminated for cause by either party based on uncured material breach of either the collaboration agreement or the supply agreement by the other party, bankruptcy of the other party or for safety reasons. We may terminate the collaboration agreement if Ipsen challenges or opposes any patent covered by the collaboration 
14


agreement. Ipsen may terminate the collaboration agreement if the FDA or EMA orders or requires substantially all cabozantinib clinical trials to be terminated. Ipsen also has the right to terminate the collaboration agreement on a region-by-region basis after the first commercial sale of cabozantinib in advanced RCC in the given region. Upon termination by either party, all licenses granted by us to Ipsen will automatically terminate, and, except in the event of a termination by Ipsen for our material breach, the licenses granted by Ipsen to us shall survive such termination and shall automatically become worldwide, or, if Ipsen were to terminate only for a particular region, then for the terminated region. Following termination by us for Ipsen’s material breach, or termination by Ipsen without cause or because we undergo a change of control by a party engaged in a competing program, Ipsen is prohibited from competing with us for a period of time.
Takeda Collaboration
In January 2017, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Takeda. Pursuant to this collaboration agreement, Takeda has exclusive commercialization rights for current and potential future cabozantinib indications in Japan, and the parties have agreed to collaborate on the clinical development of cabozantinib in Japan. The operation and strategic direction of the parties’ collaboration is governed through a joint executive committee and appropriate subcommittees.
In consideration for the exclusive license and other rights contained in the collaboration agreement, we received a $50.0 million upfront nonrefundable payment from Takeda. Effective March 2018, we amended the collaboration agreement to modify the milestones we are eligible to receive under this agreement, and as of December 31, 2018, we are eligible to receive development, regulatory and first-sale milestone payments of up to $90.0 million related to both previously treated and previously untreated RCC and previously treated HCC, as well as additional development, regulatory and first-sale milestone payments for potential future indications. The collaboration agreement also provides that we are eligible to receive pre-specified payments of up to $83.0 million associated with sales volume milestones and royalties on net sales of cabozantinib in Japan. We are entitled to receive a tiered royalty of 15% to 24% on the initial $300.0 million of net sales, and following this initial $300.0 million of net sales, we are then entitled to receive a tiered royalty of 20% to 30% on annual net sales thereafter; these 20% to 30% royalty tiers will reset each calendar year. 
Consistent with our historical agreement with GSK, we are required to pay a 3% royalty to GSK on all net sales of any product incorporating cabozantinib, including net sales by Takeda. 
Takeda is responsible for 20% of the costs associated with the global cabozantinib development plan’s current and future trials, provided Takeda opts into such trials, and 100% of costs associated with the cabozantinib development activities that are exclusively for the benefit of Japan. In accordance with the collaboration agreement, Takeda has opted into and is co-funding CheckMate 9ER.
Pursuant to the terms of the collaboration agreement, we are responsible for the manufacturing and supply of cabozantinib for all development and commercialization activities under the collaboration agreement. In connection with the collaboration agreement, we entered into a clinical supply agreement covering the supply of cabozantinib to Takeda for the term of the collaboration agreement, as well as a quality agreement that provides respective quality responsibilities for the aforementioned supply. Furthermore, at the time we entered into the collaboration agreement, the parties also entered into a safety data exchange agreement, which defines each partner’s responsibility for safety reporting. This agreement also requires us to maintain the global safety database for cabozantinib. To meet our obligations to regulatory authorities for the reporting of safety data from Japan from sources other than our sponsored global clinical development trials, we rely on data collected and reported to us by Takeda.
Unless earlier terminated, the collaboration agreement has a term that continues, on a product-by-product basis, until the earlier of (i) two years after first generic entry with respect to such product in Japan or (ii) the later of (A) the expiration of patent claims related to cabozantinib and (B) the expiration of regulatory exclusivity covering cabozantinib in Japan. The collaboration agreement may be terminated for cause by either party based on uncured material breach by the other party, bankruptcy of the other party or for safety reasons. For clarity, Takeda’s failure to achieve specified levels of commercial performance, based upon sales volume and/or promotional effort, during the first six years of the collaboration will constitute a material breach of the collaboration agreement. We may terminate the agreement if Takeda challenges or opposes any patent covered by the collaboration agreement. At any time prior to August 1, 2023, the parties may mutually agree to terminate the collaboration agreement if Japan’s Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency is unlikely to grant any approval of the marketing authorization application (MAA) in any cancer indication in Japan. After the commercial launch of cabozantinib in Japan, Takeda may terminate the collaboration agreement upon twelve months’ prior written notice following the third anniversary of the first commercial sale of cabozantinib in Japan. Upon termination by either party, all licenses granted by us to Takeda will automatically terminate, and the licenses granted by Takeda to us shall survive such termination and shall automatically become worldwide.

Cabozantinib Development Collaborations 
BMS
In February 2017, we entered into a clinical trial collaboration agreement with BMS for the purpose of exploring the therapeutic potential of cabozantinib in combination with BMS’s ICIs, nivolumab and/or ipilimumab, to treat a variety of types of cancer. As part of the collaboration, we are evaluating these combinations as treatment options for RCC and HCC in the CheckMate 9ER and CheckMate 040 trials, respectively. We also intend to evaluate these combinations in other phase 3 pivotal trials in various other tumor types, including UC. For descriptions of the Checkmate 9ER and Checkmate 040 trials, see “—Cabozantinib Development Program—Trials Conducted Under our Clinical Collaboration Agreements—Combination Studies with BMS.”
Pursuant to the terms of the collaboration agreement with BMS, each party granted to the other a non-exclusive, worldwide (within the collaboration territory as defined in the collaboration agreement and its supplemental agreements), non-transferable, royalty-free license to use the other party’s compounds in the conduct of each clinical trial. The parties’ efforts are governed through a joint development committee established to guide and oversee the collaboration’s operation. Each trial will be conducted under a combination IND application, unless otherwise required by a regulatory authority. Each party will be responsible for supplying finished drug product for the applicable clinical trial and unless otherwise agreed between the parties, costs for each such trial will be shared equally between the parties, unless two BMS compounds will be utilized in such trial, in which case BMS will bear two-thirds of the costs for such study treatment arms and we will bear one-third of the costs. Unless earlier terminated, the collaboration agreement will remain in effect until the completion of all clinical trials under the collaboration, all related trial data has been delivered to both parties and the completion of any then agreed upon analysis. The collaboration agreement may be terminated for cause by either party based on uncured material breach by the other party, bankruptcy of the other party or for safety reasons. Upon termination by either party, the licenses granted to each party to conduct a combined therapy trial will terminate.
Roche
In February 2017, we entered into a master clinical supply agreement with Roche for the purpose of evaluating cabozantinib and Roche’s ICI, atezolizumab, in locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors. Pursuant to the terms of this agreement with Roche, in June 2017, we initiated COSMIC-021 and in December 2018, we initiated COSMIC-312. We are the trial sponsor, and Roche is providing atezolizumab free of charge. For descriptions of the COSMIC-021 and COSMIC-312 trials, see “—Cabozantinib Development Program—Trials Conducted Under our Clinical Collaboration Agreements—Combination Studies with Roche.”
StemSynergy Collaboration
In January 2018, we entered into an exclusive collaboration and license agreement with StemSynergy for the discovery and development of novel oncology compounds targeting CK1α, a component of the Wnt signaling pathway implicated in key oncogenic processes. Activation of β-catenin, a key downstream component of the pathway, is increased in multiple tumors, including a majority of colorectal cancers, where mutations in the APC gene that result in β-catenin stabilization are prevalent. Compounds targeting CK1α have also been shown to induce degradation of β-catenin and pygopus, another member of the pathway, in preclinical CRC models, and to inhibit the growth of tumors. Importantly, their GI-sparing qualities may help overcome limitations of other approaches targeting the Wnt pathway. Under the terms of the agreement, we will partner with StemSynergy to conduct preclinical and clinical studies with compounds targeting CK1α. We paid StemSynergy an upfront payment of $3.0 million in initial research and development funding, and we plan to provide StemSynergy with additional research and development funding of up to $1.2 million during 2019 on an as needed basis. StemSynergy will also be eligible for up to $56.5 million in milestones for the first product to emerge from the collaboration, including preclinical and clinical development and regulatory milestone payments, commercial milestones, as well as single-digit royalties on worldwide sales. We will be solely responsible for the commercialization of products that arise from the collaboration.
Invenra Collaboration
In May 2018, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Invenra, which is focused on developing next-generation biologics, to discover and develop multispecific antibodies for the treatment of cancer. Invenra is responsible for antibody lead discovery and generation while we will lead IND-enabling studies, manufacturing, clinical development in single-agent and combination therapy regimens, and future regulatory and commercialization activities. The collaboration agreement also provides that we will receive an exclusive, worldwide license to one preclinical asset, and that we will pursue up to six additional discovery projects during the term of the collaboration, which in total are directed to three discovery programs.
16


In consideration for the exclusive worldwide license and other rights contained in the collaboration agreement, we paid Invenra an upfront payment of $2.0 million and a project initiation fee of $2.0 million. In January 2019, we initiated our second discovery project, for which we paid an additional project initiation fee of $2.0 million. Invenra is eligible to receive payments of up to $131.5 million based on the achievement of specific development and regulatory milestones for a product containing the lead preclinical asset in the first indication. Upon successful commercialization of a product, Invenra is eligible to receive global milestone payments up to $325.0 million if certain sales thresholds are achieved as well as single-digit tiered royalties on net sales of the approved product. We also have the right to initiate four additional discovery projects for development subject to an upfront payment of $2.0 million for each project, as well as additional global milestone payments and royalties for any products that arise from these discovery efforts.
Unless earlier terminated, the collaboration agreement has a term that continues, on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, until the later of (i) ten years after the first commercial sale of such product in such country or (ii) expiration of patent claims covering the product in such country. We may terminate the collaboration agreement in its entirety or on a project-by-project basis at any time prior to commercialization, for any or no reason, upon thirty days’ written notice to Invenra. The collaboration agreement also may be terminated by either party for a material breach by the other, subject to notice and cure provisions.
Other Collaborations
Prior to the commercialization of our first product, COMETRIQ, our primary business strategy was focused on the development and out-license of compounds to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies under collaboration agreements that allowed us to retain economic participation in compounds and support additional development of our proprietary products. Our collaboration agreements with Genentech, Daiichi Sankyo and BMS described below are representative of this historical strategy. We have since evolved and are now a fully-integrated biopharmaceutical company focused on driving the expansion and depth of our product offerings through the continued development of cabozantinib, internal drug discovery and execution of strategic transactions that align with our oncology drug development and commercialization expertise, all to improve care and outcomes for people with cancer around the world. While the historical collaboration agreements described below have the potential to provide future revenue, and while we have already received some collaboration revenues from these arrangements, we do not expect to receive significant revenues from these historical collaboration agreements unless and until our partnered compounds generate substantial sales in the territories and indications where they are approved, or if not yet approved, enter late-stage clinical development. If these events occur, then the milestone payments, royalties or other rights and benefits under our historical collaboration agreements could become substantial.
Genentech - Cobimetinib
In December 2006, we out-licensed the further development and commercialization of cobimetinib to Genentech pursuant to a worldwide collaboration agreement. Cobimetinib is a reversible inhibitor of MEK, a kinase that is a component of the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway. This pathway mediates signaling downstream of growth factor receptors, and is prominently activated in a wide variety of human tumors. Under the terms of the collaboration agreement, we developed cobimetinib through the determination of the maximum tolerated dose in a phase 1 clinical trial, and Genentech had the option to co-develop cobimetinib, an option that Genentech exercised, and in March 2009, we granted to Genentech an exclusive worldwide revenue-bearing license to cobimetinib, at which point Genentech became responsible for completing the phase 1 clinical trial and subsequent clinical development. We received aggregate upfront and milestone payments of $50.0 million under our collaboration agreement with Genentech and are not eligible for any additional milestone payments.
On November 10, 2015, the FDA approved cobimetinib, under the brand name COTELLIC, in combination with Genentech’s Zelboraf (vemurafenib) as a treatment for patients with BRAF V600E or V600K mutation-positive advanced melanoma. COTELLIC in combination with Zelboraf has also been approved in Switzerland, the EU, Canada, Australia, Brazil and multiple additional countries for use in the same indication. Prior to the FDA’s approval of COTELLIC, in November 2013, we exercised an option under the collaboration agreement to co-promote COTELLIC in the U.S., which allows for us to provide up to 25% of the total sales force for approved cobimetinib indications in the U.S. Between November 2015 and December 2017, we fielded 25% of the sales force promoting COTELLIC in combination with Zelboraf as a treatment for patients with BRAF mutation-positive advanced melanoma in the U.S. However, following a review of the commercial landscape, commencing in January 2018, we and Genentech scaled back the personal promotion of COTELLIC in this indication in the U.S. This decision is not indicative of any change in our intention to promote COTELLIC for other therapeutic indications for which it may be approved in the future. 
17


Cobimetinib Profit Sharing and Royalty Revenues
Under the terms of our collaboration agreement, as amended in July 2017, we share in the profits and losses received or incurred in connection with COTELLIC’s commercialization in the U.S. This profit and loss share has multiple tiers: we receive 50% of profits and losses from the first $200.0 million of U.S. actual sales, decreasing to 30% of profits and losses from U.S. actual sales in excess of $400.0 million. These tiers will reset each calendar year. The revenue for each sale of COTELLIC applied to the profit and loss statement for the collaboration agreement (Genentech Collaboration P&L) is calculated using the average of the quarterly net selling prices of COTELLIC and any additional branded Genentech product(s) prescribed with COTELLIC in such sale. U.S. commercialization costs for COTELLIC are then applied to the Genentech Collaboration P&L, subject to reduction based on the number of Genentech products in any given combination including COTELLIC. In addition to our profit share in the U.S., under the terms of the collaboration agreement, we are entitled to low double-digit royalties on net sales of COTELLIC outside the U.S. During 2018, we earned royalties of $5.6 million on net sales of COTELLIC outside the U.S. and a $8.1 million profit on the profit and loss sharing of U.S. actual sales which are recorded in Collaboration revenues.
Unless earlier terminated, the collaboration agreement has a term that continues until the expiration of the last payment obligation with respect to the licensed products under the collaboration. Genentech has the right to terminate the collaboration agreement without cause at any time. If Genentech terminates the collaboration agreement without cause, all licenses that were granted to Genentech under the agreement terminate and revert to us. Additionally, if Genentech terminates the collaboration agreement without cause, or we terminate the collaboration agreement for cause, we would receive, subject to certain conditions, licenses from Genentech to research, develop and commercialize reverted product candidates. The collaboration agreement may be terminated for cause by either party based on uncured material breach by the other party.
Cobimetinib Clinical Development Program 
In addition to its established commercialization of COTELLIC, Genentech continues to make significant progress with respect to the clinical development, regulatory status and commercial potential of cobimetinib. Cobimetinib is being evaluated in a broad development program consisting of more than 50 clinical trials by Genentech or through Genentech’s investigator sponsored trial program, including two phase 3 pivotal trials currently underway exploring the combination of cobimetinib with atezolizumab or atezolizumab alone in BRAF wild type melanoma (IMspire170) and the combination of cobimetinib with atezolizumab and vemurafenib in BRAF V600 mutant melanoma (IMspire150). Additionally, although IMblaze370, a third phase 3 pivotal trial conducted by Genentech evaluating the combination of cobimetinib with atezolizumab in CRC did not meet its primary endpoint as announced in May 2018, Genentech continues to pursue the cobimetinib development program and is conducting a series of early-stage clinical trials investigating the combination of cobimetinib and atezolizumab in multiple tumor settings. Should these trials prove positive and Genentech obtain regulatory approvals based on such positive results, we believe that cobimetinib could provide us with a potentially meaningful source of revenue in the future.
Melanoma - coBRIM. In July 2014, we announced positive top-line results from coBRIM, the phase 3 pivotal trial conducted by Genentech evaluating cobimetinib in combination with vemurafenib in previously untreated patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic melanoma harboring a BRAF V600E or V600K mutation. The primary endpoint was investigator-determined PFS, and secondary endpoints included OS, ORR, IRRC-determined PFS and DOR. coBRIM met its primary endpoint, demonstrating a statistically significant increase in investigator-determined PFS. The median PFS was 9.9 months for the combination of cobimetinib and vemurafenib versus 6.2 months for vemurafenib alone. The median PFS as established by an IRRC, a secondary endpoint, was 11.3 months for the combination arm compared to 6.0 months for the control arm. ORR, another secondary endpoint, was 68% for the combination versus 45% for vemurafenib alone. Data were published in the NEJM and presented at the ESMO 2014 Congress in September 2014. Updated results for PFS and ORR from coBRIM were then presented at the ASCO 2015 Annual Meeting in June 2015 and showed a median PFS of 12.3 months for the combination of cobimetinib and vemurafenib versus 7.2 months for vemurafenib alone, and an ORR of 70% for the combination of vemurafenib and cobimetinib versus 50% for vemurafenib alone. In November 2015, we announced that the coBRIM trial also met its OS secondary endpoint, demonstrating a statistically significant increase in OS for the combination of cobimetinib and vemurafenib compared to vemurafenib monotherapy. The median OS was 22.3 months for the combination of cobimetinib and vemurafenib versus 17.4 months for vemurafenib alone. The safety profile of the combination was consistent with that observed in a previous study.
CoBRIM served as the basis for the regulatory approval of COTELLIC in combination with Zelboraf as a treatment for patients with BRAF V600E or V600K mutation-positive advanced melanoma in the U.S., Switzerland, the EU, Canada, Australia, Brazil and other countries.

Melanoma - IMspire150. In January 2017, Genentech initiated IMspire150, a phase 3 pivotal trial evaluating the combination of cobimetinib, vemurafenib and atezolizumab vs. cobimetinib plus vemurafenib in previously untreated BRAF V600 mutation positive patients with metastatic or unresectable locally advanced melanoma. This trial, which has a primary endpoint of PFS, was based on the results of Genentech’s ongoing phase 1b trial in the same patient population. The trial completed enrollment of approximately 500 patients in April 2018. Genentech has announced that top-line results are expected during 2019, and should the results prove positive, Genentech also intends to submit regulatory filings for this combination in 2019.
Melanoma - IMspire170. In October 2017, Genentech initiated IMspire170, a phase 3 trial comparing cobimetinib plus atezolizumab to pembrolizumab in previously untreated BRAF WT patients with metastatic or unresectable locally advanced melanoma. IMspire170 was based on the results of Genentech’s ongoing phase 1b trial in the same patient population. This trial, which has a primary endpoint of PFS, is designed to enroll 450 patients; the first patient was enrolled in December 2017. Genentech has announced that top-line results for the trials are expected during 2019, and should the results prove positive, Genentech also intends to submit regulatory filings for this combination in 2019.
Other Cancer Indications. In addition to IMspire150 and IMspire170, additional earlier-stage clinical trials are ongoing studying the combination of cobimetinib with a variety of agents in multiple tumor types. These include:

• | the combination of cobimetinib and vemurafenib in additional melanoma patient populations and settings;


• | a phase 2 trial of cobimetinib in combination with taxanes, with or without atezolizumab in first-line TNBC (COLET);


• | Phase 2 studies of cobimetinib in combination with atezolizumab in RCC, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, UC and hormone receptor positive, HER2 negative breast cancer;


• | Phase 1/2 studies of cobimetinib in combination with atezolizumab in melanoma and NSCLC, in combination with vemurafenib and atezolizumab in melanoma, and in combination with venetoclax in relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia and multiple myeloma;


• | a phase 1b study evaluating the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of cobimetinib in combination with atezolizumab and bevacizumab in patients with metastatic CRC; and


• | a phase 1b/2 study of cobimetinib in combination with atezolizumab (one arm of a randomized umbrella study) in metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.

A complete listing of all ongoing cobimetinib trials can be found at www.ClinicalTrials.gov. 
Daiichi Sankyo
In March 2006, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Daiichi Sankyo for the discovery, development and commercialization of novel therapies targeted against the MR, a nuclear hormone receptor implicated in a variety of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. Under the terms of the agreement, we granted to Daiichi Sankyo an exclusive, worldwide license to certain intellectual property primarily relating to compounds that modulate MR, including esaxerenone, an oral, non-steroidal, selective MR antagonist. Daiichi Sankyo is responsible for all further preclinical and clinical development, regulatory, manufacturing and commercialization activities for the compounds and we do not have rights to reacquire such compounds, except as described below. During the research term, which concluded in November 2007, we jointly identified drug candidates with Daiichi Sankyo for further development. Esaxerenone is the only remaining drug candidate identified under the collaboration that continues to be developed by Daiichi Sankyo, and we are entitled to receive payments upon attainment of pre-specified development, regulatory and commercialization milestones for esaxerenone
In September 2017, Daiichi Sankyo reported positive top-line results from ESAX-HTN, a phase 3 pivotal trial of esaxerenone, and submitted a Japanese regulatory application for esaxerenone for an essential hypertension indication in February 2018, for which we received a $20.0 million milestone payment, which we recorded in the first quarter of 2018. Data from ESAX-HTN were published in the Journal of Hypertension in June 2018. Daiichi Sankyo’s application was then approved by the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) in January 2019, and the first commercial sale of the branded esaxerenone product MINNEBRO in Japan will trigger the payment of a $20.0 million milestone payment to us. As of December 31, 2018, and after giving effect to the milestone payment associated with the Japanese regulatory application for esaxerenone, we have achieved an aggregate of $45.5 million in development, regulatory and commercialization milestone payments related to MINNEBRO over the life of the collaboration agreement. We are eligible to receive additional commercialization milestone payments of up to $110.0 million, including the $20.0 million milestone payment associated with the first commercial sale of MINNEBRO in Japan. In addition, we are entitled to receive low double-digit royalties on sales of MINNEBRO. Daiichi Sankyo may terminate the agreement upon 90 days’ written notice, in which case Daiichi Sankyo’s payment obligations would cease, its license relating to compounds that modulate MR would terminate and revert to us and we would receive, subject to certain terms and conditions, licenses from Daiichi Sankyo to research, 
19


develop and commercialize compounds that were discovered under the collaboration. In addition, pursuant to a license agreement we entered into with Ligand Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Ligand), we are required to pay a royalty of 0.5% to Ligand on net sales of MINNEBRO.
Daiichi Sankyo also continues to advance the development program for esaxerenone, with an ongoing phase 3 pivotal trial evaluating esaxerenone as a treatment option for patients in Japan with diabetic nephropathy. Should this trial prove positive and Daiichi Sankyo obtain regulatory approval based on such positive results, and taking into account the approval of MINNEBRO by the MHLW in January 2019 for the treatment of hypertension, we believe that esaxerenone will provide an additional source of revenue in the future. 
BMS - ROR Collaboration Agreement 
In October 2010, we entered into a worldwide collaboration with BMS pursuant to which each party granted to the other certain intellectual property licenses to enable the parties to discover, optimize and characterize ROR antagonists that may subsequently be developed and commercialized by BMS. Under the terms of the collaboration agreement, we were responsible for activities related to the discovery, optimization and characterization of the ROR antagonists during the collaborative research period which began on October 8, 2010 and ended on July 8, 2013. Since the end of the collaborative research period, BMS has and will continue to have sole responsibility for any further research, development, manufacture and commercialization of products developed under the collaboration and will bear all costs and expenses associated with those activities. 
For each product developed by BMS under the collaboration, we will be eligible to receive payments upon the achievement by BMS of development and regulatory milestones. As of December 31, 2017, we have earned aggregate development and regulatory milestones of $12.5 million, including a $2.5 million development milestone payment in February 2017 in connection with the achievement of certain preclinical milestones set forth in the collaboration agreement and a $10.0 million regulatory milestone payment in October 2017 in connection with BMS’s filing of a Clinical Trial Authorization in Europe for a first in-human study of an RORγ inverse agonist. We are eligible for additional development and regulatory milestone payment of up to $240.0 million in the aggregate and commercialization milestones of up to $150.0 million in the aggregate, as well as royalties on commercial net sales, depending on the advancement of the product candidate and eventual product.
The collaboration agreement was amended and restated in April 2011 in connection with an assignment of patents to a wholly-owned subsidiary. BMS may, at any time, terminate the collaboration agreement upon certain prior notice to us on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis. In addition, either party may terminate the agreement for the other party’s uncured material breach. In the event of termination by BMS at will or by us for BMS’s uncured material breach, the license granted to BMS would terminate, the right to such product would revert to us and we would receive a royalty-bearing license for late-stage reverted compounds and a royalty-free license for early-stage reverted compounds from BMS to develop and commercialize such product in the related country. In the event of termination by BMS for our uncured material breach, BMS would retain the right to such product, subject to continued payment of milestones and royalties.
Manufacturing and Product Supply
We do not own or operate manufacturing facilities, distribution facilities or resources for clinical or commercial production and distribution of our products. Instead, we have multiple contractual agreements in place with third-party contract manufacturing organizations who, on our behalf, manufacture clinical and commercial supplies of CABOMETYX and COMETRIQ. As our operations expand due to our development and commercial progress, we expect to enter into new agreements with additional third-party contract manufacturers and suppliers as needed. This will continue for the foreseeable future for all of our product candidates and all of our current and future commercial products. We have selected well-established and reputable global third-party contract manufacturers for our drug substance and drug product manufacturing that have good regulatory standing, large manufacturing capacities and multiple manufacturing sites within their business footprint. These third parties must comply with applicable regulatory requirements, including the FDA’s Current Good Manufacturing Practices, the EC’s Guidelines on Good Distribution Practice (GDP), as well as other stringent regulatory requirements enforced by the FDA or foreign regulatory agencies, as applicable, and are subject to routine inspections by such regulatory agencies.
Through our third-party manufacturers and data service providers, we have implemented product serialization designed to comply with the Drug Supply Chain Security Act (DSCSA), pursuant to which all prescription pharmaceutical products manufactured and distributed in the U.S. were required to be serialized as of November 27, 2018. 
We monitor and evaluate the performance of our third-party contract manufacturers on an ongoing basis to ensure compliance with these requirements and to affirm their continuing capabilities to meet both our commercial and clinical 
20


needs. We also have contracted with a third-party logistics provider, with multiple distribution locations, to provide shipping and warehousing services for our commercial supply of both CABOMETYX and COMETRIQ in the U.S. We employ highly skilled personnel with both technical and manufacturing experience to diligently manage the activities at our third-party contract manufacturers, and our quality department audits them on a periodic basis.
We source raw materials that are used to manufacture our drug substance from multiple third-party suppliers in Asia and Europe. We stock sufficient quantities of these materials and provide them to our third-party drug substance contract manufacturers to ensure they can manufacture adequate drug substance quantities per our requirements, for both clinical and commercial purposes. We then store drug substance at third-party facilities and provide appropriate amounts to our third-party drug product contract manufacturers, who then manufacture, package and label our specified quantities of finished goods for COMETRIQ and CABOMETYX, respectively. In addition, we rely on our third-party contract manufacturers to source materials such as excipients, components and reagents, which are required to manufacture our drug substance and finished drug product.
Within our supply chain, we have established safety stock amounts for both our drug substance and drug products, and store these quantities in multiple locations. The quantities that we store are based on our business needs and take into account scenarios for market demand, production lead times, potential supply interruptions and shelf life for our drug substance and drug products. In parallel, for business continuity reasons, we expect to establish additional suppliers for our drug substance and drug product manufacturers soon. We believe that our current manufacturing network has the appropriate capacity to produce sufficient commercial quantities of CABOMETYX to support the currently approved advanced RCC and HCC indications, as well as potential additional indications if trials evaluating CABOMETYX in those indications prove to be successful and gain regulatory approval in the future. Our manufacturing footprint also enables us to fulfill our supply obligations for CABOMETYX and COMETRIQ to our collaboration partners, Ipsen and Takeda, for global development and commercial purposes. 
Marketing, Sales and Distribution
We have a fully integrated commercial team consisting of sales, marketing, market access, and commercial operations functions. Our sales team promotes CABOMETYX and COMETRIQ in the U.S. In addition, although we currently do not co-promote COTELLIC alongside Genentech, we have the right to do so and will do so if we, in consultation with Genentech, deem it useful and appropriate to realize COTELLIC’s commercial objectives. We use customary pharmaceutical company practices to market our products in the U.S. and concentrate our efforts on oncologists, oncology nurses and pharmacists. Our commercial products, CABOMETYX and COMETRIQ, are sold initially through wholesale distribution and specialty pharmacy channels and then, if applicable, resold to hospitals and other organizations that provide CABOMETYX and COMETRIQ to end-user patients. To facilitate our commercial activities in the U.S., we also employ various third-party vendors, such as advertising agencies, market research firms and other sales-support related services as needed. We believe that our commercial team and distribution practices are sufficient to ensure our marketing efforts reach our target audience and deliver our products to patients in a timely and compliant fashion.
In addition, we rely on Ipsen and Takeda for ongoing and further commercialization and distribution of CABOMETYX in territories outside of the U.S., as well as for access and distribution activities for the approved products under named patient use programs or similar programs with the effect of introducing earlier patient access to CABOMETYX, and we also rely on Ipsen for these same activities with respect to the commercialization and distribution of COMETRIQ outside of the U.S. For COTELLIC, we rely on Genentech, as our collaboration partner, for all current and future commercialization and marketing activities, with the exception of the limited co-promotion activities highlighted above.
To help ensure that all eligible patients in the U.S. have appropriate access to CABOMETYX and COMETRIQ, we have established a comprehensive reimbursement and patient support program called Exelixis Access Services (EASE). Through EASE, we provide co-pay assistance to qualified, commercially insured patients to help minimize out-of-pocket costs and provide free drug to uninsured or under-insured patients who meet certain clinical and financial criteria. In addition, EASE provides comprehensive reimbursement support services, such as prior authorization support, benefits investigation and, if needed, appeals support.
Seasonal Operations and Backlog
Sales of our marketed products do not reflect any significant degree of seasonality.
The markets in which we operate are characterized by short lead times and the absence of significant backlogs. We do not believe that backlog information is material to our business as a whole.
21


Environment, Health and Safety
In support of the development and expansion of our product pipeline, we have resumed discovery activities. Our research and development processes involve the controlled use of certain hazardous materials and chemicals. We are subject to federal, state and local environmental, health and workplace safety laws and regulations governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of hazardous materials. While we have incurred, and may continue to incur, expenditures to ensure we are in compliance with these laws and regulations, we do not expect the cost of complying with these laws and regulations to be material.
Government Regulation
The FDA and comparable regulatory agencies in state and local jurisdictions and in foreign countries impose substantial requirements upon the clinical development, manufacture and marketing of pharmaceutical products. These agencies and other federal, state and local entities regulate, among other things, research and development activities and the testing, marketing approval, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, distribution, post-marketing safety reporting, export, import, record keeping, advertising and promotion of our products.
The process required by the FDA before product candidates may be marketed in the U.S. generally involves the following:

• | nonclinical laboratory and animal tests, some of which must be conducted in accordance with Good Laboratory Practices;


• | submission of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;


• | adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational drug candidate for its proposed intended use;


• | for drug products, submission of an New Drug Application (NDA) to the FDA for commercial marketing, or generally of a supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA), for approval of a new indication if the product is already approved for another indication;


• | for biological products, submission of a Biologics License Application (BLA) to FDA for commercial marketing, or generally a supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for approval of a new indication if the product is already approved for another indication;


• | pre-approval inspection of manufacturing facilities and selected clinical investigators for their compliance with Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) and Good Clinical Practices (GCP);


• | if FDA convenes an advisory committee, satisfactory completion of the advisory committee review; and


• | FDA approval of the NDA or sNDA, or BLA or sBLA.

The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources. Prior to commencing the first human clinical trial with a product candidate, we must submit an IND to the FDA. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the clinical trial. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. Submission of an IND may not result in FDA authorization to commence a clinical trial. A separate submission to the existing IND must be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development. Further, an independent institutional review board for each medical center proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial and provide its informed consent form before the trial commences at that center. Regulatory authorities or an institutional review board or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk.
For purposes of NDA approval, human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap.

• | Phase 1 - Studies, which involve the initial introduction of a new drug product candidate into humans, are initially conducted in a limited number of subjects to test the product candidate for safety, tolerability, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion in healthy humans or patients.


• | Phase 2 - Studies are conducted with groups of patients afflicted with a specified disease in order to provide enough data to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, optimal dosage, and common short-term side effect and risks associated with the drug. Multiple phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted by the sponsor to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive phase 3 clinical trials. Phase 2 studies are typically well controlled, closely monitored, and conducted in a relatively small number of patients, usually involving no more than several hundred subjects. In some cases, a sponsor may decide to run what is referred to as a “phase 2b”

22


evaluation, which is a second, confirmatory phase 2 trial that could, if positive, serve as a pivotal trial in the approval of a product candidate.

• | Phase 3 - When earlier phase evaluations provide preliminary evidence suggesting that a dosage range of the product is effective and has an acceptable safety profile, phase 3 trials are performed to gather the additional information about effectiveness and safety that is needed to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug and to provide an adequate basis for physician labeling. Phase 3 trials are undertaken in large patient populations to further evaluate dosage, to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety in an expanded patient population at multiple clinical trial sites.

The FDA may require, or companies may pursue, additional clinical trials after a product is approved. These so-called phase 4 studies may be made a condition to be satisfied after a drug receives approval. Failure to satisfy such post-marketing commitments can result in FDA enforcement action, up to and including withdrawal of NDA approval. The results of phase 4 studies can confirm the effectiveness of a product candidate and can provide important safety information to augment the FDA’s adverse drug reaction reporting system. The results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA, or as part of an sNDA. The submission of an NDA requires payment of a substantial user fee to the FDA. The FDA may convene an advisory committee to provide clinical insight on NDA review questions. Although the FDA is not required to follow the recommendations of an advisory committee, the agency usually does so. The FDA may deny approval of an NDA or sNDA by way of a Complete Response letter if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, or it may require additional clinical data and/or an additional phase 3 pivotal clinical trial. Even if such data are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA or sNDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. An NDA may be approved with significant restrictions on its labeling, marketing and distribution under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy. Once issued, the FDA may withdraw product approval if ongoing regulatory standards are not met or if safety problems occur after the product reaches the market. In addition, the FDA may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the effect of approved products that have been commercialized, and the FDA has the power to prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of these post-marketing programs.
Satisfaction of FDA development and approval requirements or similar requirements of state, local and foreign regulatory agencies typically takes several years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product or disease. Government regulation may delay or prevent marketing of product candidates for new diseases for a considerable period of time and impose costly procedures upon our activities. The FDA or any other regulatory agency may not grant approvals for new indications for our product candidates on a timely basis, if at all. Success in early stage clinical trials does not ensure success in later stage clinical trials. Targets and pathways identified in vitro may be determined to be less relevant in clinical studies and results in animal model studies may not be predictive of human clinical results. Data obtained from clinical activities are not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. Even if a product candidate receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific disease states, patient populations and dosages. Further, even after regulatory approval is obtained, later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market, including withdrawal of the NDA approval.
Any products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including obtaining prior FDA approval of certain changes to the approved NDA, record-keeping requirements, and reporting of adverse experiences with the drug. Drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with GMP, which impose certain manufacturing requirements, including procedural and documentation requirements, upon us and our third-party manufacturers.
The FDA closely regulates the marketing and promotion of drugs, including restricting the promotion of uses for which a drug is not approved by the agency. Not only must a company have appropriate substantiation to support claims made about a drug, under the FDA’s current interpretation of the relevant laws, a company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy that are for indications for which the FDA has approved the drug and that are otherwise consistent with the FDA-approved label for the drug. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in adverse publicity, warning or untitled letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may, in their independent medical judgment, prescribe legally available drugs for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA generally does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, restrict manufacturers’ communications on the subject of off-label uses. Additionally, a significant number of pharmaceutical companies have been the target of inquiries and investigations by various U.S. federal and state regulatory, investigative, 
23


prosecutorial and administrative entities in connection with the promotion of products for off-label uses and other sales practices. These investigations have alleged violations of various U.S. federal and state laws and regulations, including claims asserting antitrust violations, violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), false claims laws, the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, anti-kickback laws and other alleged violations in connection with the promotion of products for unapproved uses, pricing and Medicare and/or Medicaid reimbursement.
In the U.S., the Orphan Drug Act of 1983, as amended, is intended to incentivize the development of drugs and biological products for rare diseases or conditions that affect fewer than 200,000 people in the U.S. (or that affects more than 200,000 persons in the U.S. and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available the drug in the U.S. for such disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the drug in the U.S.). If a drug is being developed for a rare disease or condition, to be eligible for designation as an orphan drug, the FDA must not have previously approved a drug considered the “same drug,” as defined in the FDA’s orphan drug regulations, for the same orphan-designated indication. If the FDA has previously approved another same drug for the same indication, to obtain orphan drug designation, the sponsor of the subsequent drug would be required to provide a plausible hypothesis of clinical superiority over the previously approved drug to obtain an orphan designation. Upon FDA receipt of Orphan Drug Designation, the sponsor is eligible for tax credits of up to 50% for qualified clinical trial expenses, the ability to apply for grant funding, and waiver of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) application fee. Following the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, for clinical trial expenses incurred in tax years 2018 and going forward, the tax credit is reduced to 25%. In addition, upon marketing approval, an orphan-designated drug could be eligible for seven years of market exclusivity for the approved orphan-designated indication. Such orphan drug exclusivity, if awarded, would only block the approval of any drug considered the same drug for the same orphan indication. Moreover, a subsequent same drug could break a previously approved drug’s orphan exclusivity through a demonstration of clinical superiority over the previously approved drug.
The FDA has various programs, including Fast Track, priority review and accelerated approval, which are intended to expedite or simplify the process for developing and reviewing promising drugs, or to provide for the approval of a drug on the basis of a surrogate endpoint. Generally, drugs that are eligible for these programs are those for serious or life-threatening conditions, those with the potential to address unmet medical needs and those that offer meaningful benefits over existing treatments. For example, Fast Track is a process designed to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drugs intended to treat serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions that demonstrate the potential to fill unmet medical needs. Priority review is designed to shorten the review period for drugs that treat serious conditions and that, if approved, would offer significant advances in safety or effectiveness or would provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. Under priority review, the FDA aims to take action on application within six months as compared to a standard review time of 10 months. Certain other types of drug applications are also eligible for priority review. Although Fast Track and priority review do not affect the standards for approval, the FDA will attempt to facilitate early and frequent meetings with a sponsor of a Fast Track designated drug and expedite review of the application for a drug designated for priority review. Accelerated approval provides for an earlier approval for a new drug that is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and that fills an unmet medical need based on a surrogate endpoint, or certain clinical endpoints, reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a product candidate receiving accelerated approval perform post-marketing clinical trials to confirm the clinically meaningful outcome as predicted by the surrogate marker trial. In addition to the Fast Track, accelerated approval and priority review programs, the FDA also designates Breakthrough Therapy status to drugs that are intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Drugs designated as breakthrough therapies are also eligible for accelerated approval. The FDA will seek to ensure the sponsor of a breakthrough therapy product candidate receives: intensive guidance on an efficient drug development program; intensive involvement of senior managers and experienced staff on a proactive, collaborative and cross-disciplinary review; and rolling review.
The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (The Hatch-Waxman Act) 
The Hatch-Waxman Act established two abbreviated approval pathways for drug products in which potential competitors may rely upon the FDA’s prior approval of the same or similar drug product.
Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA). An ANDA may be approved by the FDA if the applicant demonstrates that the proposed generic product is the same as the approved drug, which is referred to as the Reference Listed Drug (RLD). Generally, an ANDA must contain data and information showing that the proposed generic product and RLD (1) have the same active ingredient, in the same strength and dosage form, to be delivered via the same route of administration, (2) are intended for the same uses, and (3) are bioequivalent. This is instead of independently demonstrating the proposed product’s safety and effectiveness, which are inferred from the fact that the product is the same as the RLD, which the FDA 
24


previously found to be safe and effective. Furthermore, conducting bioequivalence testing is generally less time consuming and costly than conducting a full set of clinical trials in humans. In this regard, the FDA has published draft guidance containing product-specific bioequivalence recommendations for drug products containing cabozantinib, the active pharmaceutical ingredient in CABOMETYX and COMETRIQ, as it does for many FDA-approved therapeutic products.
505(b)(2) NDAs. A 505(b)(2) application is one for which one or more of the investigations relied upon by the applicant for approval were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use from the person by or for whom the investigations were conducted. Under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA, an applicant may rely, in part, on the FDA’s previous approval of a similar product, or published literature, in support of its application. If the 505(b)(2) applicant establishes that reliance on FDA’s prior findings of safety and efficacy for an approved product is scientifically appropriate, it may eliminate the need to conduct certain preclinical or clinical studies. The FDA may require additional studies or measurements, including comparability studies.
Unlike a full NDA for which the sponsor has conducted or obtained a right of reference to all the data essential to approval, the filing of both an ANDA application and a 505(b)(2) application may be delayed due to patent or exclusivity protections covering an approved product. The Hatch-Waxman Act provides (a) up to five years of exclusivity for the first approval of a new chemical entity (NCE) exclusivity and (b) three years of exclusivity for approval of an NDA or supplemental application for a product that is not an NCE but rather where the application contains new clinical studies considered essential to the approval of the NDA or sNDA (three-year “changes” exclusivity). NCE exclusivity runs from the time of approval of the NDA and bars FDA from accepting for review of any ANDA or 505(b)(2) application for a drug containing the same active moiety for five years (or for four years if the application contains a paragraph IV certification that a reference product patent is invalid or not infringed by the ANDA/505(b)(2) product). The three-year “changes” exclusivity generally bars the FDA from approving any ANDA or 505(b)(2) application that relies on the information supporting the approval of the drug or the change to the drug for which the information was submitted and the exclusivity granted.
Orange Book Listing. An NDA sponsor must identify to the FDA patents that claim the drug substance or drug product or approved method of using the drug. When the drug is approved, those patents are among the information about the product that is listed in the FDA publication, Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, which is referred to as the Orange Book. Any applicant who files an ANDA or a 505(b)(2) NDA must certify, for each patent listed in the Orange Book for the RLD that (1) no patent information on the drug product that is the subject of the application has been submitted to the FDA, (2) such patent has expired, (3) the listed patent will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration, or (4) such patent is invalid or will not be infringed upon by the manufacture, use or sale of the drug product for which the application is submitted. An ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant may also submit a statement that it intends to carve-out from the labeling of its product an RLD’s use that is protected by exclusivity or a method of use patent. The fourth certification described above is known as a Paragraph IV certification. A notice of the Paragraph IV certification must be provided to each owner of the patent that is the subject of the certification and to the reference NDA holder. The reference NDA holder and patent owners may initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the Paragraph IV notice. Filing such a lawsuit within 45 days of the receipt of the Paragraph IV certification notice prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA until the earlier of 30 months, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant. The ANDA or 505(b)(2) application also will not receive final approval until any applicable non-patent exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for the RLD has expired. We intend to defend vigorously any patents for our approved products.
Regulation Outside of the United States 
In addition to regulations in the U.S., we are subject to regulations of other countries governing clinical trials and the manufacturing, commercial sales and distribution of our products outside of the U.S. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain approval by the comparable regulatory authorities of countries outside of the U.S. before we can commence clinical trials in such countries and approval of the regulators of such countries or economic areas, such as the EU, before we may market products in those countries or areas. The approval process and requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from place to place, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval.
The way clinical trials are conducted in the EU will undergo a major change when Regulation (EU) 536/2014 governing clinical trials in the EU, repealing the existing Directive 2001/20/EC comes into application in 2019. This regulation harmonizes the assessment and supervision processes for clinical trials throughout the EU, via an EU portal and database. The EMA will set up and maintain the portal and database, in collaboration with the Member States and the EC.
Under EU regulatory systems, a company may submit MAAs either under centralized or decentralized procedure. Under the centralized procedure, MAAs are submitted to the EMA for scientific review by the Committee for Medicinal 
25


Products for Human Use (CHMP) so that an opinion is issued on product approvability. The opinion is considered by the EC which is responsible for granting the centralized marketing authorization in the form of a binding EC decision. If the application is approved, the EC grants a single marketing authorization that is valid for all EU member states as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway, collectively the European Economic Area (EEA). The decentralized and mutual recognition procedures, as well as national authorization procedure are available for products for which the centralized procedure is not compulsory. The mutual recognition procedure provides for the EU member states selected by the applicant to mutually recognize a national marketing authorization that has already been granted by the competent authority of another member state, referred to as the Reference Member State (RMS). The decentralized procedure is used when the product in question has yet to be granted a marketing authorization in any member state. Under this procedure the applicant can select the member state that will act as the RMS. In both the mutual recognition and decentralized procedures, the RMS reviews the application and submits its assessment of the application to the member states where marketing authorizations are being sought, referred to as Concerned Member States. Within 90 days of receiving the application and assessment report, each Concerned Member State must decide whether to recognize the RMS assessment. If a member state does not agree with the assessment, and the disputed points cannot be resolved the matter is eventually referred to the Coordination Group on Mutual Recognition and Decentralised procedures in the first instance to reach an agreement and failing to reach such an agreement, a referral to the EMA and the CHMP for arbitration that will result in an opinion to form the basis of a decision to be issued by the EC binding on all member states. If the application is successful during the decentralized or mutual recognition procedure, national marketing authorizations will be granted by the competent authorities in each of the member states chosen by the applicant.
Conditional marketing authorizations may be granted in the centralized procedure for a limited number of medicinal products for human use referenced in EU law applicable to conditional marketing authorizations where the clinical dataset is not comprehensive, if (1) the risk-benefit balance of the product is positive, (2) it is likely that the applicant will be in a position to provide the required comprehensive clinical trial data, (3) unmet medical needs will be fulfilled and (4) the benefit to public health of the immediate availability on the market of the medicinal product outweighs the risk inherent in the fact that additional data are still required. Specific obligations, such as the completion of ongoing or new studies and obligations relating to the collection of pharmacovigilance data, may be amongst the conditions stipulated in the marketing authorization.
As in the U.S., we may apply for designation of a product as an Orphan drug for the treatment of a specific indication in the EU before the application for marketing authorization is made. In the EU orphan designation is available for products in development which are either: (a) intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions affecting not more than 5 in 10,000 persons in the EU, or (b) intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition in the Community and when, without incentives, it is unlikely that sales of the drug in the EU would be sufficient to justify the necessary investment in developing the medicinal product. Additionally, the sponsor of an application for orphan drug designation must establish that there exists no satisfactory authorized method of diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of the condition or even if such treatment exists, the product will be of significant benefit to those affected by that condition.
Orphan drugs in the EU enjoy economic and marketing benefits, including up to ten years of market exclusivity for the approved indication unless another applicant for a similar medicinal product can show that its product is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to the orphan-designated product. The period of market exclusivity may be reduced to six years if at the end of the fifth year it is established that the criteria for orphan designation are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity.
Healthcare Regulation 
Federal and state healthcare laws, including fraud and abuse and health information privacy and security laws, also apply to our business. If we fail to comply with those laws, we could face substantial penalties and our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects could be adversely affected. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include, but are not limited to: the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits. among other things, soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce, or in return for, the purchase or recommendation of an item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs; and federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payers that are false or fraudulent. Additionally, we are subject to state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, which may be broader in scope and apply regardless of whether the payer is a federal healthcare program, and many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, further complicate compliance efforts.
26


Numerous federal and state laws, including state security breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws and federal and state consumer protection laws, govern the collection, use and disclosure of personal information. For example, in June 2018, California Governor Jerry Brown signed the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA), which takes effect on January 1, 2020 and will broadly define personal information, give California residents expanded privacy rights and protections and provide for civil penalties for violations and a private right of action for data breaches. There are similar legislative proposals being advanced in other states, as well as in Congress. In addition, most healthcare providers who are expected to prescribe our products and from whom we obtain patient health information, are subject to privacy and security requirements under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology and Clinical Health Act (HIPAA). Although we are not directly subject to HIPAA, we could be subject to criminal penalties if we obtain and/or disclose individually identifiable health information from a HIPAA-covered entity, including healthcare providers, in a manner that is not authorized or permitted by HIPAA. The legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection continues to evolve, and there has been an increasing amount of focus on privacy and data protection issues with the potential to affect our business, including recently enacted laws in a majority of states requiring security breach notification. These laws could create liability for us or increase our cost of doing business. Other countries also have, or are developing, laws governing the collection, use and transmission of personal information. International laws, such as the EU General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (GDPR) and Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection, regulate the processing of personal data within the EU and between countries in the EU and countries outside of the EU, including the U.S. On April 27, 2016, the EU legislature adopted the GDPR, which replaced the prior Directive 95/46/EC when it took effect on May 25, 2018, and it is directly applicable in all Member States. The GDPR applies to EU-based organizations engaged in the processing of personal data belonging to EU data subjects. The GDPR has an extra-territorial effect in the sense that it applies to a “controller” or “processor” who is not established in the EU and is engaged in processing of personal data of EU subjects. Furthermore, in October 2015, the Court of Justice of the EU declared the previous framework, the International Safe Harbor Privacy Principles (the Safe Harbor) invalid for data transfer between the U.S. and the EU. The Safe Harbor has now been replaced by the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield, a framework for transatlantic exchanges of personal data for commercial purposes between the EU and the U.S. in accordance with the principles of the GDPR.  Accordingly, there may be an immediate impact on companies located in the U.S. as they devote resources to comply with these new obligations. The GDPR establishes a tiered approach to penalties for breach which enables the data protection authorities of the various Member States to impose fines for certain infringements, including the breach of requirements relating to international transfers or the basic principles for processing of personal data (such as conditions for obtaining consent from that individual whose data is being transferred). The severity of these fines may be up to the higher of 4% of annual worldwide revenue or €20 million.
In addition, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (the PPACA) created a federal requirement under the federal Open Payments program, that requires certain manufacturers to track and report to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services annually certain payments and other transfers of value provided to physicians and teaching hospitals made in the previous calendar year. In addition, there are also an increasing number of state laws that require manufacturers to make reports to states on pricing and marketing information. These laws may affect our sales, marketing, and other promotional activities by imposing administrative and compliance burdens on us. In addition, given the lack of clarity with respect to these laws and their implementation, our reporting actions could be subject to the penalty provisions of the pertinent state and federal authorities.
Because our products are covered in the U.S. by the Medicaid programs, we have various obligations, including government price reporting and rebate requirements, which generally require our products be offered at substantial rebates/discounts to Medicaid and certain purchasers (including “covered entities” purchasing under the 340B Drug Discount Program). We are also required to discount such products to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, under which additional laws and requirements apply. These programs require submission of pricing data and calculation of discounts and rebates pursuant to complex statutory formulas, as well as the entry into government procurement contracts governed by the Federal Acquisition Regulations, and the guidance governing such calculations is not always clear. Compliance with such requirements can require significant investment in personnel, systems and resources, but failure to properly calculate prices, or offer required discounts or rebates could subject us to substantial penalties. Subject to the application in the EU of the Transparency Directive 89/105/EEC, which aims to ensure the transparency of measures adopted to control pricing and reimbursement, pricing and reimbursement in the EU/EEA is governed by national rules and policy and may vary from Member State to Member State.
Reimbursement 
Sales of our approved products and any future products of ours will depend, in part, on the extent to which their costs will be covered by third-party payers, such as government health programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. Patients may be less likely to use our products if coverage is not provided and reimbursement is inadequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of our products. In addition, although to date qualified patients who 
27


would not otherwise be able to afford our products have been able to receive financial support from us in some cases, and from independent patient support foundations in other cases, these programs have recently been subject to significant government scrutiny, and in the future these patients may no longer be able to use our products. Third-party payers may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drugs for a particular indication. Moreover, a third-party payer’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Additionally, a third-party payer’s decision to cover a particular drug product does not ensure that other payers will also provide coverage for the drug product, or will provide coverage at an adequate reimbursement rate.
In the U.S. and other potentially significant markets for our products, government authorities and third-party payers are increasingly attempting to limit or regulate the price of medical products and services, particularly for new and innovative products and therapies, which may result in lower average selling prices. In some cases, for example, third-party payers try to encourage the use of less expensive generic products through their prescription benefits coverage and reimbursement and co-pay policies. Further, the increased emphasis on managed healthcare in the U.S. and on country-specific and national pricing and reimbursement controls in the EU will put additional pressure on product pricing, reimbursement and usage, which may adversely affect our future product sales and results of operations. These pressures can arise from rules and practices of managed care groups, judicial decisions and governmental laws and regulations related to Medicare, Medicaid and healthcare reform, pharmaceutical reimbursement policies and pricing in general. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing coverage and/or reimbursement controls and measures, could have a material adverse impact on our net product revenues and results of operations.
The U.S. and some foreign jurisdictions are considering proposals or have enacted legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably. Among policy makers and payers in the U.S. and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access. There has been particular and increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the U.S. with respect to drug pricing practices, particularly with respect to drugs that have been subject to relatively large price increases over relatively short time periods. At the federal level, there have been several U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. Also, the Trump administration’s budget proposal for fiscal year 2019 contains drug price control measures that could be enacted during the 2019 budget process or in other future legislation, including measures to permit Medicare Part D plans to negotiate the price of certain drugs under Medicare Part B, to allow some states to negotiate drug prices under Medicaid, and to eliminate cost sharing for generic drugs for low-income patients. Further, in October 2018, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) proposed a rule that would require drug manufacturers to disclose drug prices in television advertisements. While any proposed measure will require authorization through additional legislation to become effective, Congress and the Trump administration have each indicated that they will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. With respect to drug pricing transparency, for example, in October 2017, California Governor Jerry Brown signed legislation known as SB-17, which requires, among other provisions, pharmaceutical manufacturers to provide notice of price increases above a defined threshold to certain purchasers and related reports to the government. SB-17 is currently subject to challenge, but in the meantime, manufacturers must comply with its requirements.
In the U.S., the pharmaceutical industry has already been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives, including, for example, the PPACA. Since January 2017, President Trump has signed two Executive Orders designed to delay the implementation of certain provisions of the PPACA or otherwise circumvent some of the requirements for health insurance mandated by the PPACA. Concurrently, Congress has considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the PPACA. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, two bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the PPACA recently have been enacted. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 includes a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the PPACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate.” Additionally, on January 23, 2018, President Trump signed a continuing resolution on appropriations for fiscal year 2018 that delayed the implementation of certain PPACA-mandated fees, including the so-called “Cadillac” tax on certain high cost employer-sponsored insurance plans, the annual fee imposed on certain health insurance providers based on market share, and the medical device excise tax on non-exempt medical devices. Congress may continue to consider legislation to repeal and replace some or all elements of the PPACA, and in December 2018, a Texas U.S. District 
28


Court Judge ruled that the PPACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because of the repeal of the “individual mandate” that was part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Although that ruling is being appealed, we cannot predict the outcome of this litigation, including a possible decision by the United States Supreme Court, or whether other healthcare reform initiatives will continue to be pursued or adopted in the future. Further federal, state and foreign legislative and regulatory developments are likely, and we expect ongoing initiatives to increase pressure on drug pricing, which could have a negative impact on our revenue or sales of any products or future approved products.
Other legislative changes have also been proposed and adopted since the PPACA was enacted. For example, the Budget Control Act of 2011 resulted in aggregate reductions in Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, starting in 2013, and the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. Further, in November 2018, CMS proposed a rule that would allow Medicare Part D and Medicare Advantage plans to limit coverage under certain defined circumstances for certain drugs, including cancer medicines, pursuant to exceptions to the existing “protected classes” policy. Such laws or regulations, and others that may affect our business that have been recently enacted or may in the future be enacted, may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding for our products. In the future, there will likely continue to be additional proposals relating to the reform of the U.S. healthcare system, some of which could further limit coverage and reimbursement of drug products, including our approved products and any future approved products. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payers. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our products.
In addition, in some non-U.S. jurisdictions, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before its cost may be funded within the respective national healthcare system. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, EU member states may restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national healthcare systems provide reimbursement and may control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profits the medicinal product generates for the company placing it on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products on cost-effectiveness grounds. Historically, products launched in countries in the EU do not follow the price structures of the U.S. and they generally tend to be priced significantly lower.
Competition 
There are many companies focused on the development of small molecules and antibodies for cancer. Our competitors and potential competitors include major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as academic research institutions, clinical reference laboratories and government agencies that are pursuing research activities similar to ours. Many of the organizations competing with us have greater capital resources, larger research and development staff and facilities, more experience in obtaining regulatory approvals and more extensive product manufacturing and commercial capabilities than we do, which may allow them to have a competitive advantage.
Competition for Cabozantinib
We believe that our ability to successfully compete will depend on, among other things:

• | efficacy, safety and reliability of cabozantinib;


• | timing and scope of regulatory approval;


• | the speed at which we develop cabozantinib for the treatment of additional tumor types beyond its approved indications;


• | our ability to complete clinical development and obtain regulatory approvals for cabozantinib;


• | our ability to manufacture and sell commercial quantities of cabozantinib product to the market;


• | our ability to successfully commercialize cabozantinib and secure coverage and adequate reimbursement in approved indications;


• | product acceptance by physicians and other health care providers;


• | the level of our collaboration partners’ investments in the resources necessary to successfully commercialize cabozantinib in territories where it is approved outside of the U.S.;


• | skills of our employees and our ability to recruit and retain skilled employees;


• | protection of our intellectual property; and

29



• | the availability of substantial capital resources to fund development and commercialization activities.

We believe that the quality and breadth of activity observed with cabozantinib, the skill of our employees and our ability to recruit and retain skilled employees, our patent portfolio and our capabilities for research and drug development are competitive strengths. However, many large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have significantly larger intellectual property estates than we do, more substantial capital resources than we have, and greater capabilities and experience than we do in preclinical and clinical development, sales, marketing, manufacturing and regulatory affairs.
The markets for which we intend to pursue regulatory approval of cabozantinib are highly competitive. We are aware of products in research or development by our competitors that are intended to treat all of the tumor types we are targeting, and should they demonstrate suitable clinical evidence, any of these products may compete with cabozantinib. We believe our future success will depend upon our ability to maintain a competitive position with respect to technological advances and the shifting landscape of therapeutic strategy following the advent of immunotherapy. While we have adapted our development strategy for cabozantinib to address the fact that this approach to treating cancer with ICIs, or ICIs in combination with other therapeutic agents, has become highly prevalent in indications for which our products are approved, CABOMETYX may become less marketable if our clinical trials fail to show efficacy in comparison to competing ICI products or ICI product combinations. Furthermore, the complexities of such a strategy has and may continue to require collaboration with some of our competitors.
CABOMETYX - RCC: We believe the principal competition for CABOMETYX in advanced RCC includes: BMS’ nivolumab; the combination of BMS’s ipilimumab and nivolumab; Pfizer’s axitinib, sunitinib and temsirolimus, each as single-agent therapies; Novartis’ everolimus and pazopanib, each as single-agent therapies; Bayer’s and Onyx Pharmaceuticals’ (a wholly-owned subsidiary of Amgen) (Onyx’s) sorafenib; Roche’s bevacizumab; the combination of Eisai’s lenvatinib and Novartis’ everolimus; and Prometheus’ aldesleukin. Additionally, there are a variety of therapies being developed for advanced RCC, including: the combination of Roche’s bevacizumab and atezolizumab; the combination of Merck’s pembrolizumab and Eisai’s lenvatinib; the combination of Merck’s pembrolizumab and Pfizer’s axitinib; the combination of Pfizer’s avelumab and axitinib; the combination of Calithera’s CB-938 and Novartis’ everolimus; AVEO Pharmaceutical’s tivozanib; and generic versions of sorafenib, everolimus and sunitinib.
 The competitive landscape for RCC is evolving rapidly, especially given the entrance of ICI combination therapies and potential entrance of ICI-TKI combination therapies into the RCC treatment landscape, particularly in the first-line setting. This will lead to new trends in prescribing and sequencing of certain drugs and combinations across different lines of therapy. It is therefore difficult to predict how these changes will affect sales of CABOMETYX during 2019 and going forward.
CABOMETYX - HCC: We believe the principal competition for CABOMETYX in previously treated HCC includes: Bayer’s regorafenib; Bayer’s and Onyx’s sorafenib; BMS’ nivolumab; Eisai’s levantinib; and Merck’s pembrolizumab. Additionally, there are a variety of therapies being developed for previously treated HCC, including: Eli Lilly’s ramucirumab; and generic versions of sorafenib.
COMETRIQ: We believe that the principal competing anti-cancer therapy to COMETRIQ in progressive, metastatic MTC is Genzyme’s vandetanib, which has been approved by the FDA and the EC for the treatment of symptomatic or progressive MTC in patients with unresectable, locally advanced, or metastatic disease. We believe that COMETRIQ also faces competition as a treatment for progressive, metastatic MTC from off-label use of certain treatments, including: Bayer’s and Onyx’s sorafenib; Pfizer’s sunitinib; Takeda’s ponatinib; Novartis’ pazopanib; and Eisai’s lenvatinib. Additionally, there are a variety of compounds being developed for MTC with early-stage clinical trials in progress, including: Blueprint Medicine Corporation’s BLU-667 (for certain subsets of MTC patients); and Loxo Oncology, Inc.’s LOXO-292 (which was recently granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation by the FDA for the treatment of patients with RET-mutant MTC who require systemic therapy, have progressed following prior treatment and have no acceptable alternative treatment options). 
Potential Cabozantinib Indications Beyond RCC, MTC and previously treated HCC: We have initiated COSMIC-311, a phase 3 pivotal trial evaluating cabozantinib in patients with DTC who have progressed after up to two prior VEGFR-targeted therapies, and COSMIC-312, a phase 3 pivotal trial evaluating the combination of cabozantinib and atezolizumab in patients with previously untreated HCC. However, we face a rapidly evolving treatment landscape for the treatment of both of these indications, as other therapies have recently received regulatory approval or are in advanced stages of clinical development, which may impair the relative value of CABOMETYX or a combination of CABOMETYX with an ICI in DTC and previously untreated HCC, respectively. Should cabozantinib be approved for this indication of DTC, we believe its principal competition may include: Bayer’s and Onyx’s sorafenib; and Eisai’s lenvatinib. Should the combination of cabozantinib and atezolizumab be approved for the treatment of patients with previously untreated advanced HCC, we believe its principal competition may include: Eisai’s levantinib; Bayer’s and Onyx’s sorafenib; BMS’s nivolumab; the combination of Merck’s pembrolizumab and Eisai’s lenvatinib; BeiGen and Celgene’s tislelizumab; the combination of Roche’s bevacizumab and atezolizumab;

AstraZeneca’s durvalumab; the combination of AstraZeneca’s durvalumab and tremelimumab; and generic versions of sorafenib. Examples of potential competition for cabozantinib in other cancer indications include: other VEGF pathway inhibitors, including Genentech’s bevacizumab and Pfizer’s axitinib; other RET inhibitors including Eisai’s lenvatinib and Takeda’s ponatinib; other MET inhibitors, including Astra Zeneca’s savolitinib, Pfizer’s crizotinib and Mirati’s glesatinib; and ICIs such as BMS’s ipilimumab and nivolumab, Merck’s pembrolizumab and Roche’s atezolizumab.
Competition for Cobimetinib
We believe that cobimetinib’s principal competition amongst targeted agents includes: the combination of Novartis’ trametinib and dabrafenib; and the combination of Array’s encorafenib and binimetinib. Within the class of ICIs, we believe that cobimetinib’s principal competition includes: the combination of BMS’s ipilimumab and nivolumab; and Merck’s pembrolizumab. The second category, ICIs, are of particular competitive importance vis-a-vis cobimetinib in advanced melanoma as they are already FDA approved in melanoma patient populations that overlap with those that may be eligible for cobimetinib, they have been rapidly incorporated into the NCCN treatment guidelines, and they are viewed with a high degree of enthusiasm by physicians and key opinion leaders. Ongoing and future trials incorporating ICIs, including combination trials, may further impact usage of cobimetinib in melanoma and potentially in additional tumor types in which cobimetinib may ultimately gain approval.
Competition for Esaxerenone
We believe that esaxerenone’s principal competition for the treatment of hypertension in Japan will be Bayer’s MR antagonist, finerenone, if and when it is approved by the MHLW. Finerenone is still in development for this indication, and results from ongoing clinical studies are not expected during 2019.
Significant Customers
We operate as a single business segment and have operations solely in the U.S. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we derived 21% of our revenues from Ipsen, 13% of our revenues from Caremark L.L.C. and 12% of our revenues from affiliates of McKesson Corporation.
Patents and Proprietary Rights 
We actively seek patent protection in the U.S., Europe and selected other foreign countries to cover our drug candidates and related technologies. Patents extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained. The actual protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from country to country, depends on the type of patent, the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in the country. We have numerous patents and pending patent applications that relate to methods of screening drug targets, compounds that modulate drug targets, as well as methods of making and using such compounds.
While many patent applications have been filed relating to the drug candidates that we have developed, the majority of these are not yet issued or allowed. We own all global patents associated with cabozantinib, cobimetinib and our other drug candidates referenced below.
Cabozantinib
Cabozantinib is covered by 10 issued patents in the U.S., building from U.S. Pat. No. 7,579,473, for the composition-of-matter of cabozantinib and pharmaceutical compositions thereof. This composition of matter patent would expire in September 2024, but we have been granted a patent term extension to extend the term to August 2026. The following table describes the US patents that cover our marketed cabozantinib products, and which are listed in the Orange Book. Except as otherwise noted, the stated expiration dates include any patent term extensions already granted. In addition to the composition of matter patent referenced above, the table includes patents directed to, among other things, particular salts, polymorphs, formulations, or use of the compound in the treatment of specified diseases or conditions. We continue to pursue additional patents and patent term extensions in the U.S. and other territories covering various aspects of our cabozantinib products that may, if issued, extend exclusivity beyond the expiration of the patents listed in the table.

(1) | Filed for inclusion in the Orange Book for patients with HCC who have been previously treated with sorafenib

In Europe, cabozantinib is protected by issued patents covering the composition-of-matter and methods of use. The issued patent would expire in September 2024, but we have applied for and either have obtained, or expect to obtain Supplementary Protection Certificates in Europe to extend the term to 2029. In addition to the composition of matter patent, the table below includes later-expiring patents directed to the commercial product, including, particular salts, polymorphs, formulations, or use of the compound in the treatment of specified diseases or conditions. 

Product | Patent No. | General Subject Matter | Patent Expiration
CABOMETYX | 2213661 | Composition of matter and methods of treatment | 2029 
2387563 | Salt and polymorphic forms of cabozantinib and methods of treatment | 2030 
COMETRIQ | 2213661 | Composition of matter and methods of treatment | 2029 
2387563 | Salt and polymorphic forms of cabozantinib and methods of treatment | 2030 

Similarly in Japan, cabozantinib is protected by an issued patent covering the composition-of-matter, and salts thereof, as well as pharmaceutical compositions and related methods of use. We intend to apply for patent term extension in Japan to extend the term to 2029. Foreign counterparts of the issued U.S. and European composition of matter patents have been issued in Australia and Canada, and are anticipated to expire in 2024. We have other filed patent applications and issued patents in the U.S. and other selected countries covering certain synthetic methods, salts, polymorphs, formulations, and combinations of cabozantinib that, if issued, are anticipated to expire as late as 2035. Outside the U.S. and Japan, cabozantinib is licensed to Ipsen; in Japan cabozantinib is licensed to Takeda, each in accordance with the respective collaboration agreements. A discussion of risks and uncertainties that may affect our patent position and other proprietary rights is set forth in “Risk Factors,” contained in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Cobimetinib
Cobimetinib is covered by three issued patents in the U.S., including U.S. Pat. No 7,803,839 for the composition of matter of cobimetinib and pharmaceutical compositions thereof. U.S. Pat. No 7,803,839 would normally expire in February 2027, but we have applied for a patent term extension to extend the term to November 2029. Cobimetinib is also covered by an issued patent in Europe (covering the composition-of-matter of cobimetinib and certain methods of use), which would normally expire in October 2026, but we have applied for and are obtaining Supplementary Protection Certificates to extend the term to November 2030. Foreign counterparts of the issued U.S. and European patents are issued or pending in Australia, Canada, Japan and selected other foreign countries. We have filed patent applications in the U.S. and other selected countries covering certain salts and polymorphs of cobimetinib that, if issued, are anticipated to expire in approximately 2036. We have filed patent applications in the U.S. and other selected countries covering certain synthetic methods related to making cobimetinib that, if issued, are anticipated to expire in approximately 2033. Cobimetinib is licensed to Genentech in the U.S. and to Roche outside of the U.S.
Other Drug Candidates
We also have pending patent applications, and will continue to file new patent applications, in the U.S., Europe and other selected countries covering the composition-of-matter of our other drug candidates in clinical and/or preclinical

development. We intend to describe these patents in more detail once it is determined that a particular drug candidate warrants further development.
We have obtained licenses from various parties that give us rights to technologies that we deem to be necessary or desirable for our research and development. These licenses (both exclusive and non-exclusive) may require us to pay royalties as well as upfront and milestone payments.
We require our scientific personnel to maintain laboratory notebooks and other research records in accordance with our policies, which are designed to strengthen and support our intellectual property protection. In addition to our patented intellectual property, we also rely on trade secrets and other proprietary information, especially when we do not believe that patent protection is appropriate or can be obtained. We also require all of our employees and consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors who receive proprietary information from us to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us. These agreements provide that all proprietary information developed or made known to the individual during the course of the individual’s relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. Furthermore, our agreements with employees and, in most circumstances, our agreements with consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors expressly provide that all inventions, concepts, developments, copyrights, trademarks or other intellectual property developed by an employee during the employment period, or developed by a service provider during the service period or utilizing our proprietary drugs or information, shall be our exclusive property. There can be no assurance, however, that these agreements will provide meaningful protection or adequate remedies for our trade secrets in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of such information.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had 484 full-time equivalent employees, all of which are located in the U.S. None of our employees are represented by a labor union, and we consider our employee relations to be good.
