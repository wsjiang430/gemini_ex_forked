Company Overview
Atkore International Group Inc. (collectively with all its subsidiaries referred to in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as "Atkore," the "Company," "we," "us" and "our") was incorporated in the State of Delaware on November 4, 2010. Atkore is the sole stockholder of Atkore International Holdings Inc. ("AIH"), which in turn is the sole stockholder of Atkore International, Inc. ("AII").
We are a leading manufacturer of Electrical Raceway products primarily for the non-residential construction and renovation markets and Mechanical Products and Solutions ("MP&S") for the construction and industrial markets. Electrical Raceway products form the critical infrastructure that enables the deployment, isolation and protection of a structure's electrical circuitry from the original power source to the final outlet. MP&S frame, support and secure component parts in a broad range of structures, equipment and systems in electrical, industrial and construction applications. We believe we hold #1 or #2 positions in the United States by net sales in the vast majority of our products. The quality of our products, the strength of our brands and our scale and national presence provide what we believe to be a unique set of competitive advantages that position us for profitable growth.
On June 9, 2016, the Company's Registration Statement on Form S-1 relating to an initial public offering ("IPO") of our common stock was declared effective by the SEC and on June 15, 2016, we completed the IPO at a price to the public of $16.00 per share. In connection with the IPO, CD&R Allied Holdings, L.P. (the "CD&R Investor"), an affiliate of Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, LLC ("CD&R") sold an aggregate of 12,000,000 shares of our common stock. The CD&R Investor received all of the net proceeds and bore all commissions and discounts from the sale of our common stock. We did not receive any proceeds from the IPO. 
In a series of secondary offerings of our common stock during fiscal 2017, the CD&R Investor reduced its remaining ownership in our company to approximately 48% as of September 30, 2017. In August 2017, the Company announced that its board of directors had approved a share repurchase program for the repurchase of up to an aggregate amount of $75 million of the Company’s common stock. In January 2018, the Company announced a stock repurchase transaction whereby the Company agreed to repurchase from the CD&R Investor, a related party, approximately 17.2 million shares of the Company's common stock, par value $0.01 per share, at a per share price equal to $21.77, for a total purchase price of $375 million, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the stock purchase agreement. Following the stock repurchase transaction in January 2018 and secondary offerings of the Company's common stock in February 2018 and May 2018, the CD&R Investor completed its exit from its investment in the Company, and, as of September 30, 2018, no longer owned any of the Company's common stock. As of December 28, 2018, there were no authorized repurchases remaining under the August 2017 repurchase program. 
On February 5, 2019, the board of directors approved a share repurchase program, under which the Company may repurchase up to $50.0 million of its outstanding common stock. As of September 30, 2019, there were $50.0 million of authorized repurchases remaining. See Item 5, ''Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters, and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities'' for additional information.

Marketing

Our products are primarily marketed by commissioned agents and sold directly to electrical and industrial distributors who resell our products under recognized brand names, including Allied Tube & Conduit, AFC Cable Systems, Heritage Plastics, Unistrut, Power-Strut, Cope and Calpipe as well as certain other sub-brands that are used regionally or in niche markets. Our commissioned agents are selected, trained and managed by our regional sales teams and supported by product managers who ensure that agents are adequately knowledgeable and sufficiently trained to represent our brands to our distribution customers. We stimulate end-user demand by promoting our products and solutions directly to architects, electrical engineers, electrical contractors and electrical code authorities across the United States. We also work directly with electrical contractors, who install Electrical Raceway products on new construction or renovation projects to assist them in selecting the most effective electrical raceway solution. In certain of the markets we serve, we market directly to electrical and industrial distributors, original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs") and governmental entities. 
Distribution
We primarily sell and distribute our products through electrical, industrial and specialty distributors and OEMs. For many of the over 13,000 electrical-distributor branches in the United States, our products are must-stock lines that form a staple of their business. We serve a diverse group of end markets, including new construction, MR&R and infrastructure, diversified industrials, alternative power generation, healthcare, data centers and government. End-users, which are typically electrical, industrial and mechanical contractors as well as OEMs, install our products during non-residential, residential and infrastructure construction and renovation projects or in assembly and manufacturing processes. 

Distribution-based sales accounted for approximately 86% of our net sales for fiscal 2019. We distribute our products to electrical and industrial distributors from our manufacturing and distribution facilities as well as from over 40 dedicated distribution facilities operated by our agents. Our products are also stocked by electrical and industrial distributors who are located in major cities and towns across the United States. Some of our products are purchased by OEMs and used as part of their products and solutions in applications such as utility solar framing, conveyor systems and fabric cover buildings. OEM sales accounted for approximately 14% of our net sales for fiscal 2019. 

Our distribution footprint is concentrated in North America (the United States and Canada), with additional facilities in Australia, China, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. 

Products are generally delivered to the dedicated distribution centers from our facilities and then subsequently delivered to the customer. In some instances, a product is delivered directly from our manufacturing facility to a customer or end-user. In many cases, our products are bundled and co-loaded when shipped. We contract with a wide range of transport providers to deliver our products, primarily via semi-tractor trailer. 

Customers

Our sales and marketing processes are primarily focused on serving our immediate customers, including electrical, industrial and specialty distributors and OEMs. We believe customers view us as offering a strong value proposition based on our broad product offering, strong brands, short order cycle times, reliability and consistent product quality. For each of fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, approximately 88%, 90% and 91%, respectively, of our net sales were sold to customers located in the United States. Our net sales by geographic area were as follows: 

 | Fiscal Year Ended 
(in millions) | September 30, 2019 | | September 30, 2018 | | September 30, 2017
United States | $ | 1,689 | | | $ | 1,652 | | $ | 1,368
International | 228 | | | 183 | | | 136
Total | $ | 1,917 | | | $ | 1,835 | | $ | 1,504


In fiscal 2019, our top ten customers accounted for approximately 33% of net sales. No single customer, even after consolidating all branches of such customer, which often make independent purchasing decisions, accounted for more than 10% of our net sales in fiscal 2019, 2018 or 2017. Our customers include global electrical distributors (such as Consolidated Electrical Distributors, Inc., Graybar Electric Company, Rexel, Sonepar S.A. and Wesco International, Inc.), independent electrical distributors including super-regional electrical distributors (such as U.S. Electrical Services Inc., Crescent Electric Supply Co. and United Electric Supply Company, Inc.) and members of buying groups (such as Affiliated Distributors, Inc. and IMARK Group, Inc.) as well as industrial distributors and big-box retailers (such as The Home Depot, Inc., Fastenal Company, HD Supply Holdings, Inc., McMaster-Carr Supply Co., Menard, Inc. and W.W. Grainger, Inc.).

Suppliers and Raw Materials

We use a variety of raw materials in the manufacture of our products. Our primary raw materials are steel, copper and polyvinyl chloride ("PVC") resin. We believe that sources for these raw materials are well-established, generally available on world markets and are in sufficient quantity that we may avoid disruption to our business if we encountered an interruption from one of our existing suppliers. Our primary suppliers of steel are ArcelorMittal, AK Steel and Nucor; our primary suppliers of copper are AmRod and Freeport McMoran; and our primary suppliers of PVC resin are Westlake, Formosa and Oxy Vinyls. We strive to maintain strong relationships with our suppliers. 
Seasonality 

In a typical year, our operating results are impacted by seasonality. Weather can impact the ability to pursue non-residential construction projects at any time of year in any geography, but historically, our slowest quarters have been the first and second fiscal quarters of each fiscal year when frozen ground and cold temperatures in many parts of the country can impede the start and pursuit of construction projects. Sales of our products have historically been higher in the third and fourth quarters of each fiscal year due to favorable weather and longer daylight conditions during these periods. Seasonal variations in operating results may also be significantly impacted by inclement weather conditions, such as cold or wet weather, which can delay construction projects as well as by adverse economic conditions. 
Manufacturing 

We currently manufacture products in 38 facilities and operate a total footprint of approximately 6 million square feet of manufacturing and distribution space in eight countries. Our headquarters is located in Harvey, Illinois, which is also the location of our largest manufacturing facility. Similar to our distribution footprint, our manufacturing footprint is currently concentrated in the United States, with additional facilities in Australia, Belgium, China, New Zealand, Russia and the United Kingdom.

With respect to our tube and conduit products, we believe we are a technology leader in the in-line galvanizing manufacturing process and have developed specialized equipment that enables us to produce a variety of low-cost high-quality galvanized tube products. Our subsidiary, Allied Tube & Conduit Corporation, or "Allied Tube," developed an in-line 
galvanizing technique (Flo-Coat) in which zinc is applied in a continuous process when the tube and pipe are formed. The Flo-Coat galvanizing process provides superior zinc coverage of fabricated metal products for rust prevention and lower cost manufacturing than traditional hot-dip galvanization.

Competition

The industries in which we operate are highly competitive. Our principal competitors range from national manufacturers to smaller regional manufacturers and differ by each of our product lines. We also face competition from manufacturers in Canada, Mexico and several other international markets, depending on the particular product. We believe our customers purchase from us because we provide value through the quality of our products and the timeliness of our delivery. Competition is generally on the basis of product offering, product innovation, quality, service and price. 

There are many competitors in each of our segments. The main competitors in each of these segments are listed below: 

Electrical Raceway: ABB Ltd., Eaton Corporation plc, nVent Electric plc, Hubbell Incorporated, Zekelman Industries, Inc., Republic Conduit, Inc., Southwire Company, LLC, and Encore Wire Corporation plc

Mechanical Products & Solutions: 

• | Metal Framing: B-Line (part of Eaton Corporation plc), Thomas & Betts (part of ABB Ltd.) and Haydon Corporation


• | Mechanical Tube: Zekelman Industries, Inc.

Intellectual Property 

Patents and other proprietary rights can be important to our business. We also rely on trade secrets, manufacturing know-how, continuing technological innovations, and licensing opportunities to maintain and improve our competitive position. We periodically review third-party proprietary rights, including patents and patent applications, in an effort to avoid infringement of third-party proprietary rights, identify licensing opportunities and monitor the intellectual property claims of others. 

We own a portfolio of patents and trademarks. Other than licenses to commercially available third-party software, we do not believe that any of our licenses to third-party intellectual property are material to our business taken as a whole. Patents for individual products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained. We rely on both trademark registration and common law protection for trademarks. Trademark rights may potentially extend indefinitely and are dependent upon national laws and use of the trademarks. 

While we consider our patents and trademarks to be valued assets, we do not believe that our competitive position is dependent on patent or trademark protection or that our operations are dependent upon any single patent or group of related patents. We nevertheless face intellectual property-related risks. For more information on these risks, see Item 1A, "Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—We may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights in foreign countries, and we may become involved in intellectual property disputes." 

Management of Information Technology Systems 

Historically, information technology has not been a significant differentiator for us in our markets, however, we believe that ease of doing business with us will become increasingly important to our growth. Currently, we operate our business using widely commercially available hardware and software products with well-developed support services. In addition to these widely available IT products, we developed a new application for our agents which we believe will improve the overall order entry process. Additionally, during fiscal 2016, we invested more than $6.0 million and installed and implemented a new general ledger and financial reporting system for the entire Company replacing a number of systems used in various parts of the Company. We have also chosen to migrate our email service and various other information technology services to a cloud computing platform hosted by Microsoft. During fiscal 2019, we completed the implementation of an integrated system for order management, advanced warehouse management, finished goods inventory management and accounts receivable. We have spent over $15.3 million to date on this project, which went live in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018. 
Employees

As of September 30, 2019, we employed approximately 3,900 total full-time equivalent employees of whom approximately 12% are temporary or contract workers. Our employees are primarily located in the United States, with about 18% employed at our international locations in Australia, Belgium, Canada, China, New Zealand, Russia and the United Kingdom. 

As of September 30, 2019, approximately 27% of our employees globally were represented by a union under a collective bargaining agreement. All unions are either located in the United States or Canada with no unions or Worker's Councils at any of our other locations abroad. 
From time to time our collective bargaining agreements expire and come up for re-negotiation. Our collective bargaining agreement for our New Bedford Massachusetts facility expired in February 2018, and we successfully negotiated a new agreement which now expires in February 2023. Our Harvey, Illinois Special Metal Processing Facility agreement with the United Steelworkers Union, involving a bargaining unit of 15 employees, expired on November 11, 2018 and we successfully negotiated a new agreement which now expires in November 2022. Our Harvey, Illinois collective bargaining agreement with the United Steelworkers involves nearly 400 represented employees, is set expire in April 2020. We believe our relationship with our employees is good. 

Regulatory Matters 

Our facilities are subject to various federal, state, local and non-U.S. requirements relating to the protection of human health, safety and the environment. Among other things, these laws govern the use, storage, treatment, transportation, disposal and management of hazardous substances and wastes; regulate emissions or discharges of pollutants or other substances into the air, water, or otherwise into the environment; impose liability for the costs of investigating and remediating, and damages resulting from, present and past releases of hazardous substances and protect the health and safety of our employees. 

We have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, capital expenditures in addition to ordinary course costs to comply with applicable current and future environmental, health and safety laws, such as those governing air emissions and wastewater discharges. In addition, government agencies could impose conditions or other restrictions in our environmental permits which increase our costs. These laws are subject to change, which can be frequent and material. More stringent federal, state or local environmental rules or regulations could increase our operating costs and expenses.

The cost of compliance with environmental, health and safety laws and capital expenditures required to meet regulatory requirements is not anticipated to have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows or competitive position. 

In October 2013, the State of Illinois filed a complaint against our subsidiary Allied Tube, alleging violations of the Illinois Environmental Protection Act relating to discharges to a storm sewer system that terminates at Allied Tube's Harvey, Illinois manufacturing facility. The State sought an injunction ordering Allied Tube to take immediate corrective action to abate the alleged violations and civil penalties as permitted by applicable law. Allied Tube has reviewed management practices and made improvements to its diesel fuel storage and truck maintenance areas to resolve the State's claims. We entered into a consent order that required Allied Tube to pay a nominal penalty, install base low-flow oil and water separation equipment and take certain additional remedial actions to resolve the State's claims. The installation of the low-flow oil and water separation equipment is complete and certain additional remediation activities are in progress. We do not currently expect that any remaining obligations would have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 

In August 2014, we received from the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency, or the "IEPA," the terms of a proposed new stormwater discharge permit for our Harvey, Illinois manufacturing facility. Because the facility did not meet the zinc limit set forth in the proposed permit, the Company commenced negotiations with the IEPA to agree upon mutually acceptable discharge limits. During these negotiations, the facility was operating under an extension of the terms of our existing stormwater discharge permit. In October 2016, we received the final permit. A mutually agreed upon compliance plan is part of the permit and we expect to achieve compliance in accordance with a four-year schedule. The compliance plan includes studies to reduce zinc emitted from galvanizing manufacturing operations, implementation of more rigorous management practices, evaluation of the installation of passive/cost effective stormwater treatment and receiving stream studies to determine if a less stringent permit limit will be as protective of the water system as the current permit limit. Given the scope and time frame of the compliance plan, we do not expect that achieving compliance with either the stormwater discharge permit or the plan will have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

We received from the City of Phoenix the terms of an industrial wastewater discharge permit renewal that contains more rigorous wastewater discharge limits for our Phoenix, Arizona facility. We do not currently expect that any such obligations would have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 

We are continually investigating, remediating or addressing contamination at our current and former facilities. For example, we are currently monitoring groundwater contamination at our Wayne, Michigan facility. Future remediation activities may be required to address contamination at or migrating from the Wayne, Michigan site. Many of our current and former facilities have a history of industrial usage for which additional investigation and remediation obligations could arise in the future and which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
