Item 1. Business
Overview 
We are one of the world’s largest manufacturers of ground-mounting tracking systems used in solar energy projects at utility scale. Our principal products are a portfolio of integrated solar tracking systems comprised of software and hardware, including steel supports, electric motors, gearboxes and electronic controllers commonly referred to as a single-axis “tracker.” Trackers move solar panels throughout the day to maintain an optimal orientation to the sun, which significantly increases their energy production. Solar energy projects that use trackers generate more energy and deliver a lower Levelized Cost of Energy (“LCOE”) than projects that use “fixed tilt” mounting systems, which do not move. The vast majority of ground mounted solar systems in the U.S., and an increasing amount outside of the U.S., use tracker technology.
Our flagship tracker, Duratrack, uses a patented design that allows one motor to drive multiple rows of solar panels through articulated driveline joints. To avoid infringing on our U.S. patent, our competitors must use designs that we believe are inherently less efficient and reliable. For example, our largest competitor’s design requires one motor for each row of solar panels. As a result, we believe our products have greater reliability, lower installation costs, reduced maintenance requirements and competitive manufacturing costs. Additionally, Duratrack uses a passive stow architecture that allows a fully automatic stow angle to protect modules during a weather event, all without the use of sensors. Our core U.S. patent on a linked-row, rotating gear drive system does not expire until February 5, 2030.
As further described below, we acquired STI in January 2022 and introduced a dual-row tracker design to our product portfolio. This tracker uses one motor to drive two connected rows, ideally suited for sites with irregular and highly angled boundaries and regions with low wind and/or snow load requirements as well as fragmented project areas. To offer a comprehensive set of solutions to the growing market, in September 2022, we introduced a third tracker product which requires significantly less grading and civil works permitting prior to installation and accommodates uneven terrain. This suite of products extends our target applications and bankability to deliver the best utility-scale solar tracker solutions to the market. All of our products are protected by U.S. and international patents.
We sell our products to engineering, procurement and construction firms (“EPCs”) that build solar energy projects. In addition, we sell our products to large solar developers, independent power producers and utilities, often under master supply agreements or multi-year procurement contracts. 
Acquisition of STI Norland
On January 11, 2022, the Company completed its acquisition of STI for purchase consideration of $410.5 million in cash and 13,894,800 shares of the Company’s common stock. The fair value of the purchase consideration was $610.8 million and resulted in the Company owning 100% of the equity interests in STI.
STI was founded in 1996 and is headquartered in Pamplona, Spain. With manufacturing facilities in both Spain and Brazil, STI generates revenue through the design, manufacture and sale of its utility-scale solar tracker systems to customers in global markets that include Spain, Brazil, U.S. and South Africa. The integration of STI provides us the opportunity to accelerate our international expansion and better address rising global demand for utility-scale solar projects, particularly in developing countries in South America and Africa.
Sales
Our Customers
We sell our products to EPCs that build solar energy projects. In addition, we sell our products to large solar developers, independent power producers and utilities, often under master supply agreements or multi-year procurement contracts. Although sales to a single customer may occasionally be greater than 10%, they generally represent multiple projects for many different end customers who often directly influence or make the decision to use our solar tracking systems. In 2022, our sales to EPC’s represented approximately 65% of our revenue.
Our Products and Services
Our Tracker Systems
Large-scale solar energy projects are typically laid out in successive “rows” that form an “array.” An array can have dozens of rows with more than 100 solar panels in each row. With a single-axis tracker system, motors and gears cause each row of solar panels to rotate along their north-south axis to continually align the row with the sun throughout the day. Different tracker manufacturers use different approaches to rotate the panels in a row. We have three tracker systems that, depending on the project site characteristics, offer customers a differentiated set of benefits.
DuraTrack® HZ v3
Our flagship product is the DuraTrack® HZ v3 tracker system, which we launched in May 2015. DuraTrack HZ v3 is our third-generation single axis tracker and incorporates unique features such as a patented single-bolt per module mounting system that reduces installation time, a passive wind load mitigation system and a low number of motors and controls per MW.
Array STI H250
The Array STI H250 is designed to deliver a favorable LCOE with a robust, dual-row tracker system. The design enables one motor to move up to 120 photovoltaic modules making this an efficient utility-scale solar tracking system ideally suited for sites with irregular boundaries, highly angled blocks, or fragmented project areas.
Array OmniTrack
The Array OmniTrack delivers all the benefits of our flagship product DuraTrack — high reliability, durability and performance — with the added benefits of enhanced North/South terrain flexibility and minimized grading. OmniTrack’s flexible design allows for installation on unlevel site terrain, accommodating a greater slope. Requiring significantly less grading and civil works permitting, OmniTrack reduces project costs and time to construct.
SmarTrack Software
SmarTrack is our software product that uses site-specific historical weather and energy production data, in combination with machine learning algorithms, to identify the optimal position for a solar array in real time to increase its energy production.
Markets
Product Roadmap
Our products reflect the innovation focus and engineering capabilities of our people. Our product roadmap is rooted in delivering value to the customer, differentiated products and services and new market creation.
We have introduced three generations of trackers and each new version has delivered significant cost and performance improvements over the prior version. We are currently developing the fourth generation of the DuraTrack technology which will focus on improvements to performance, reliability and cost of ownership.
We are also planning to introduce improvements and additional functionality to our SmarTrack software, including unique positioning algorithms designed to maximize energy production from arrays that use bi-facial panels, pre-positioning instructions based on weather forecasts and enhanced site-specific machine learning capabilities as well as cybersecurity enhancements.
Sales and Marketing Strategy
Our sales and marketing strategy is to educate all influencers and stakeholders involved in building, owning and maintaining a solar energy project on the merits of our products generally and their low lifetime cost of ownership specifically. With the objective of making our products the preferred tracker systems globally, we educate customers and influencers through a combination of direct sales efforts; commissioning independent, third-party studies; hosting training seminars; and sponsoring industry conferences and events.
We take a “360-degree” approach to selling, working with developers, independent power producers, EPCs, utilities, independent engineering firms, insurers and mechanical subcontractors in each of the countries where we operate. In the United States, Europe, the Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”), Latin America and Australia our products are actively sold by employees in seven different countries.
Training and Customer Support
We offer our customers engineering expertise to design and deliver the optimal solution for each unique project, installation training services and dedicated project management to provide comprehensive technical support.
We offer a wide variety of training and support designed to ensure an efficient build process of our tracker system, including hands on and video supported instruction and documentation. We support all of our customers with design consulting throughout the sales process. Our technical support organization includes applications, geotechnical and civil engineering expertise in each region where we operate. To support projects around the globe, we have resources available to work on solutions 24/7. We manage open issues via our customer relationship management system in order to monitor service, track closure of all customer issues and further improve our customer service in every region in which we sell our products.
Customer service and satisfaction are a key focus for us and contribute to our success. We have field service engineers located in the geographies where we are active, and support our customers with commissioning of large projects, introduction of new technologies and features and on-the-job training of new installers.
Competition
Trackers are highly specialized products that are specific to the solar industry. The unique expertise required to design trackers and customers’ reluctance to try unproven products has confined the number of firms that produce trackers to a relatively small number. Our principal tracker competitors include Nextracker Inc., PV 
Hardware, GameChange Solar and Artech Solar. We also compete indirectly with manufacturers of fixed tilt mounting systems, including UNIRAC, Inc., and RBI Solar Inc., a subsidiary of Gibraltar Industries, Inc. We compete on the basis of product performance and features, total cost of ownership (usually measured by LCOE), reliability and duration of product warranty, sales and distribution capabilities, and training and customer support.
Resources
Manufacturing
In the U.S., we operate an approximately 57,900 square foot manufacturing facility in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Our manufacturing process is designed to meet four objectives: limit capital intensive and low value-added activities that can be outsourced to other companies; minimize labor content where possible; minimize the amount of assembly our customers will be required to do at the site; and minimize material movement both from vendors to us and inside our factory. With the acquisition of STI, we gained approximately 122,000 and 632,000 square feet of manufacturing and warehouse facilities in Spain and Brazil, respectively, where we manufacture and assemble component parts for local and international markets.
We produce module clamps, center structures, spring dampers and motor controller assemblies at our Albuquerque facility. We have entered outsourcing contracts for steel tubing, drivelines, bearing assemblies and gear boxes that ship directly from our suppliers to job sites or designated warehouses. By using vendors, we are able to drop ship products directly to our customers’ sites, which improves working capital turnover, quality and inventory management.
While we maintain certain levels of supplies and inventories, we have the capability to insource some of the products manufactured by outside vendors to our principal manufacturing facility and have identified alternative vendors for contingency purposes, where we depend upon a small number of vendors to manufacture certain components used in our tracking systems. We have implemented a policy that no component be single-sourced and that second-source suppliers be located domestically where possible.
We believe our Array Legacy Operation’s status as a U.S.-based company with products manufactured in the U.S. reduces the potential impact of U.S. government tariffs placed on, or other U.S. government regulatory actions taken against, products manufactured in foreign countries and imported into the U.S.
Research and Development
We continually devote resources to research and development (“R&D”) with the objective of developing innovative new products and services that enhance system performance, improve product reliability, reduce product cost and simplify installation. Our development strategy is to identify features that bring value to our customers and differentiate us from our competitors. We measure the effectiveness of our R&D using a number of metrics, beginning with a market requirements definition, which includes a program budget, financial payback, resource requirements, and time required to launch the new product, system, or service into the market. We employ a stringent engineering phase gate review process that ensures all R&D programs are meeting their stated objectives from inception to deployment.
We have a strong R&D team with significant experience in solar energy as well as expertise in mechanical engineering, software engineering, civil engineering, systems/control engineering, power electronics, semiconductors, power line communications and networking. As needed, we collaborate with academia, national laboratories and consultants, to further enhance our capabilities and confirm results independently.
Intellectual Property
The success of our business depends, in part, on our ability to maintain and protect our proprietary technologies, information, processes and know-how. We rely primarily on patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws in the U.S. and similar laws in other countries, confidentiality agreements and procedures and other contractual arrangements to protect our technology. As of February 24, 2023, we had 27 issued U.S. patents, 197 issued non-U.S. patents and 130 U.S. and non-U.S. patent applications pending. Similarly, we have 48 registered U.S. and foreign trademarks and 96 U.S. and foreign pending trademark applications. Our U.S. issued patents are scheduled to expire between 2030 and 2037.
We rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to safeguard our interests with respect to proprietary know-how that is not patentable and processes for which patents are difficult to enforce. We believe that many elements of our manufacturing processes involve proprietary know-how, technology or data that are not covered by patents or patent applications, including technical processes, test equipment designs, algorithms, and procedures.
Our policy is for our R&D employees to enter into confidentiality and proprietary information agreements with us to address intellectual property protection issues and require our employees to assign to us all the inventions, designs and technologies they develop during the course of employment with us. However, we might not have entered into such agreements with all applicable personnel, and such agreements might not be self-executing. Moreover, such individuals could breach the terms of such agreements.
We also require our customers and business partners to enter into confidentiality agreements before we disclose any sensitive aspects of our technology or business plans.
Government Contracts
None.
Seasonality
Our revenue has been impacted by seasonality related to federal investment tax credit (“ITC”) step-downs for solar energy projects and seasonal construction activity.
ITC Step-Downs
While solar power is cost-competitive with conventional forms of generation in many U.S. states even without the ITC, we believe step-downs in the ITC have influenced the timing and quantity of some customers’ orders. During the fourth quarter of 2019, we received approximately $400 million of orders that were structured to maintain our customers’ eligibility for the 30% ITC available for projects for which construction began before 2020. We shipped and recorded the associated revenues on approximately $100 million and $300 million of those orders in the fourth quarter of 2019 and first half of 2020, respectively. During the fourth quarter of 2020, we received approximately $80 million of orders that were structured to maintain our customers’ eligibility for the 26% ITC that is available for projects for which construction began before 2021. We shipped and recorded the associated revenues on approximately $40 million and $40 million of those orders during the fourth quarter of 2020 and the first half of 2021, respectively.
With the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act (“IRA”) in August 2022, the ITC was raised to 30% with no step downs until 2032. Accordingly, we do not anticipate the ITC rate to impact our seasonality during that timeframe. 
Construction Activity
Project construction activity in North America and Europe tends to be lower in colder months. The installation of a solar tracker requires setting foundations in the ground which is more costly when the ground is frozen. Accordingly, we typically expect to see higher revenues in the second and third quarters when the weather is warmer in the northern hemisphere and lower in the first and fourth quarters when the weather is colder absent other factors. While we expect this seasonality will continue to impact us in the near term as a large portion of our business is in North America and Europe, we expect to see less pronounced seasonal variations as we grow our business in Brazil and further expand into new markets in the southern hemisphere.
Government Regulation
Environmental Laws and Regulations
We are subject to a variety of environmental, health and safety, and pollution-control laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. We do not believe the costs of compliance with these laws and regulations will be material to the business or our operations. We use, handle, generate, store, discharge and dispose of hazardous substances, chemicals and wastes at some of our facilities in connection with our product development, testing and manufacturing activities. Any failure by us to control the use of, to remediate the presence of or to restrict adequately the discharge of such substances, chemicals or wastes could subject us to potentially significant liabilities, clean-up costs, monetary damages and fines or suspensions in our business operations. In addition, some of our facilities are located on properties with a history of use involving hazardous substances, chemicals and wastes and may be contaminated. Although we have not incurred, and do not currently anticipate, any material liabilities in connection with such contamination, we may be required to make expenditures for environmental remediation in the future.
Government Incentives
Federal, state, local and foreign government bodies provide incentives to owners, end users, distributors and manufacturers of solar energy systems to promote solar electricity in the form of rebates, tax credits and other financial incentives such as system performance payments, payments for renewable energy credits associated with renewable energy generation, and an exclusion of solar energy systems from property tax assessments. The range and duration of these incentives varies widely by geographic market. The market for grid-connected applications, where solar power is sold into organized electric markets or pursuant to power purchase agreements, often depends in large part on the availability and size of these government subsidies and economic incentives.
The recently-enacted IRA in the U.S. makes significant changes to the tax credit regime that applies to solar facilities. As a result of changes made by the IRA, U.S. taxpayers generally will be entitled to a 30% ITC for projects placed in service after 2021, increased to 40% if certain “domestic content” requirements are satisfied, subject, in each case, to an 80% reduction if certain wage and apprenticeship requirements are not satisfied or deemed satisfied in accordance with the requirements of the IRA (either because the project has a net output of less than 1 megawatt or because construction begins before January 29, 2023, the date that is 60 days after the IRS released guidance relating to the prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements). In order to meet the domestic content requirements a qualified facility must show that the project incorporates domestically sourced iron, steel, and manufactured products. In addition, certain other incremental credits are potentially available for facilities located in “energy communities” or “low-income communities” or that are part of “low-income benefit projects” or “low-income residential building projects.”
As a result of changes made by the IRA, U.S. taxpayers will generally also be allowed to elect to receive a production tax credit (“PTC”) in lieu of the ITC for qualified solar facilities if the construction begins before January 1, 2025 and that are placed in service after 2021. The PTC is available for electricity produced and 
sold to unrelated persons in the ten years following a project’s placement in service and is equal to an inflation-adjusted amount (currently 2.6 cents per kilowatt hour, assuming the prevailing wage requirements described above are satisfied or deemed satisfied, reduced by 80% if those requirements are not satisfied) for every kilowatt-hour of electricity produced by a facility. The available credit amount is increased by 10% if the domestic content requirements described above are satisfied. Certain additional incremental PTCs are also available similar to the incremental ITCs described above.
In the case of projects placed in service after 2024, each of the ITC and PTC will be replaced by similar “technology neutral” tax credit incentives that mimic the ITC and PTC but also require that projects satisfy a “zero greenhouse gas emissions” standard (which solar does) in order to qualify for the credits. This new credit regime will continue to apply to projects that begin construction prior to the end of 2033 (and possibly later), at which point the credits will become subject to a phase-out schedule.
Human Capital
We believe our success depends on our ability to attract and retain outstanding employees at all levels of our business. As of December 31, 2022, we had 1,082 full-time employees, of which approximately 51% are located in the U.S., with the balance located in Europe, South America, Latin America, Africa, Australia, and Asia. None of our employees are represented by a labor union. We have not experienced any employment-related work stoppages, and we consider relations with our employees to be good.
We have a team-oriented culture, which we believe helps us to succeed and drive operational excellence. As a rapidly growing business, we rely on the success of our recruitment efforts to attract and retain technically skilled people who can support our ongoing innovation and expansion. We aim to be inclusive in our hiring practices focusing on the best talent for the role, welcoming all genders, nationalities, ethnicities, abilities and other dimensions of diversity. We drive high levels of performance and improvement by prioritizing training and development to ensure our team members are equipped with the knowledge, skills, and tools to succeed. We motivate and develop our employees by providing them with opportunities for advancement, and we invest in both on-the-job training and online training and development tools because we believe our people are the ultimate drivers of our success. These initiatives include multiple compliance trainings as well as various leadership development courses. In addition, we support external development and verification programs as well as offer education reimbursement.
We aim to provide our employees with competitive salary and benefits that enable them to achieve a good quality of life and plan for the future. Our benefits differ according to local norms and market preferences but typically include all salary and social benefits required by local law (including retirement saving programs, paid vacation and sick leave) and many additional benefits that go beyond legal requirements in local markets.
We aim to hire individuals who share our passion, commitment and entrepreneurial spirit. We are also committed to diversity and inclusion because we believe that diversity leads to better outcomes for our business and enables us to better meet the needs of our customers. We recognize the importance of diversity in leadership roles within our company.
Our employees’ health and safety is important to us. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented procedures to reduce the risk of spreading the virus. In addition, we believe that all accidents and injuries at work are preventable and we aim to ensure a zero-injury culture across our offices and operations. We comply with applicable occupational health and safety regulations and are certified to Occupational Health and Safety Quality Management Standard ISO 9001. Our injury rates are low.
