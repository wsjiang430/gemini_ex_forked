ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

A.    Introduction
Churchill Downs Incorporated (the "Company", "we", "us", "our") is an industry-leading racing, gaming and online entertainment company anchored by our iconic flagship event - The Kentucky Derby. We own and operate the largest legal online horseracing wagering platform in the U.S., through our TwinSpires business. We are a leader in brick-and-mortar casino gaming with approximately 9,500 gaming positions in seven states, after the Presque Isle Transaction (as defined below) closed on January 11, 2019. In August 2018, we launched our retail BetAmerica Sportsbook at our two Mississippi casino properties and have announced plans to enter additional U.S. sports betting and iGaming markets. We opened Derby City Gaming, the first historical racing machine ("HRM") facility in Louisville, Kentucky, in September 2018 with 900 HRM machines. We were organized as a Kentucky corporation in 1928, and our principal executive offices are located in Louisville, Kentucky.
Sale of Big Fish Games, Inc.
On November 29, 2017, the Company entered into a definitive Stock Purchase Agreement (the "Stock Purchase Agreement") to sell its mobile gaming subsidiary, Big Fish Games, Inc. ("Big Fish Games"), a Washington corporation, to Aristocrat Technologies, Inc. (the "Purchaser"), a Nevada corporation, an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of Aristocrat Leisure Limited ("Aristocrat"), an Australian corporation (the "Big Fish Transaction"). On January 9, 2018, pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement, the Company completed the Big Fish Transaction. The Purchaser paid an aggregate consideration of $990.0 million in cash in connection with the Big Fish Transaction, subject to customary adjustments for working capital and indebtedness and certain other adjustments as set forth in the Stock Purchase Agreement.

Acquisition of Presque Isle and Pending Acquisition of Lady Luck Nemacolin 
On February 28, 2018, the Company entered into two separate definitive asset purchase agreements with Eldorado Resorts, Inc.

Concurrently with the entry into the Termination Agreement, the Company and ERI also entered into an amendment to the previously announced asset purchase agreement relating to the Presque Isle Transaction (the "Amendment").

The Presque Isle Transaction reflects a stand-alone purchase price of $178.9 million. Closing of the Presque Isle Transaction was also conditioned on the execution of the definitive agreement with respect to the Lady Luck Nemacolin Transaction, which occurred on August 10, 2018 (the "Lady Luck Nemacolin Agreement"). 
On January 11, 2019, the Company completed the Presque Isle Transaction. Subject to receipt of Pennsylvania regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions, the Lady Luck Nemacolin Transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2019.

Pending Acquisition of Certain Ownership Interests of Midwest Gaming Holdings, LLC
On October 31, 2018, the Company announced that it had entered into a definitive purchase agreement pursuant to which the Company will acquire certain ownership interests of Midwest Gaming Holdings, LLC ("Midwest Gaming"), the parent company of Rivers Casino Des Plaines in Des Plaines, Illinois ("Rivers Des Plaines"), for cash (the "Sale Transaction"). 
The Sale Transaction will be comprised of (i) the Company’s purchase of 100% of the ownership stake in Midwest Gaming held by affiliates and co-investors of Clairvest Group Inc. ("Clairvest") for approximately $291.0 million and (ii) the Company’s offer to purchase, on the same terms, additional units of Midwest Gaming held by High Plaines Gaming, LLC ("High Plaines"), an affiliate of Rush Street Gaming, LLC, and Casino Investors, LLC ("Casino Investors").

Based on the results of the purchase of the Clairvest ownership stake and the purchase, on the same terms, of additional units held by High Plaines and Casino Investors, the Company will acquire, at the closing of the Sale Transaction, approximately 42% of Midwest Gaming for aggregate cash consideration of approximately $407.0 million. As a result of the Recapitalization, the Company's ownership of Midwest Gaming will increase to approximately 62%.
The Transactions are dependent on usual and customary closing conditions, including securing approval from the Illinois Gaming Board. The Transactions are expected to close in the first half of 2019.
Stock Split
On October 31, 2018, the Company announced a three-for-one split (the "Stock Split") of the Company's common stock for shareholders of record as of January 11, 2019.

All share and per-share amounts in the Company’s consolidated financial statements and related notes in Part II, Item 8.

B.    Business Segments
During 2018, we managed our operations through five segments: Racing, Online Wagering, Casino, Other Investments and Corporate. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we changed our TwinSpires segment name to Online Wagering as we continue to expand our online sports betting and iGaming platforms. As a result of the Big Fish Transaction, our Big Fish Games segment is now included as a discontinued operation. Financial information about these segments is set forth in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 20 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained within this Report.  Further discussion of financial results by operating segment is provided in Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contained within this Report.
Racing Segment
Our Racing segment includes our four racetracks: Churchill Downs Racetrack ("Churchill Downs"), Arlington International Race Course ("Arlington"), Fair Grounds Race Course ("Fair Grounds") and Calder Race Course ("Calder Racing"). We conduct live horseracing at Churchill Downs, Arlington and Fair Grounds. On July 1, 2014, we entered into a racing services agreement with The Stronach Group ("TSG") to allow Gulfstream Park to manage and operate Calder Racing through December 31, 2020.
Our racing revenue includes commissions on pari-mutuel wagering at our racetracks and off-track betting facilities ("OTBs") plus simulcast host fees earned from other wagering sites. In addition, ancillary revenue generated by the pari-mutuel facilities includes admissions, sponsorships and television rights, and food and beverage sales. Racing revenue and income are influenced by our racing calendar. Racing dates are generally approved annually by the respective state racing authorities. The majority of our live racing revenue occurs during the second quarter with the running of the Kentucky Oaks and Kentucky Derby at Churchill Downs. Therefore, racing revenue and operating results for any interim quarter are not generally indicative of the revenue and operating results for the year. 
Churchill Downs, Arlington and its twelve OTBs in Illinois, and Fair Grounds and its fourteen OTBs in Louisiana, all offer year-round simulcast wagering. The OTBs accept wagers on races at the respective racetrack or on races simulcast from other locations. We generate a significant portion of our pari-mutuel wagering revenue by sending signals of races from our racetracks to other facilities and businesses ("export") and receiving signals from other racetracks ("import").

Churchill Downs
Churchill Downs is located in Louisville, Kentucky and is an internationally known thoroughbred racing operation best known as the home of our iconic flagship event - The Kentucky Derby. We have conducted thoroughbred racing continuously at Churchill Downs since 1875. The Kentucky Derby is the longest continuously held annual sporting event in the United States and is the first race of the annual series of races for 3-year old thoroughbreds known as the Triple Crown. Our history of increased wagering, along with solid attendance and television viewership is attractive to presenting sponsors and contributed to the ninth consecutive year of earnings growth in 2018. We conducted 70 live race days in 2016, 2017 and 2018. In 2019, we anticipate having up to 75 live race days. The Kentucky Horse Racing Commission ("KHRC") awarded us 6 additional optional dates for 2019 that we may elect to run.
In 2002, as part of the financing of improvements to the Churchill Downs facility, we transferred title of the Churchill Downs facility to the City of Louisville, Kentucky and leased back the facility. Subject to the terms of the lease, we can re-acquire the facility at any time for $1.00.

C.    Competition
Overview
We operate in a highly competitive industry with a large number of participants, some of which have financial and other resources that are greater than ours. The industry faces competition from a variety of sources for discretionary consumer spending, including spectator sports, fantasy sports and other entertainment and gaming options. Additionally, our brick-and-mortar casinos compete with traditional and Native American casinos, video lottery terminals, state-sponsored lotteries and other forms of legalized gaming in the U.S. and other jurisdictions.
Legalized gambling is currently permitted in various forms in many states and Canada. Other jurisdictions could legalize gambling in the future, and established gaming jurisdictions could award additional gaming licenses or permit the expansion of existing gaming operations. If additional gaming opportunities become available near our racing or gaming operations, such gaming operations could have a material adverse impact on our business.
In May 2018, the United States Supreme Court struck down the 1992 Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act, which had effectively banned sports wagering in most states. Removal of the ban gives states the authority to authorize sports wagering. 
9

Racing
In 2018, approximately 37,000 thoroughbred horse races were conducted in the United States. Of these races, we hosted approximately 2,220 races, or 6.0% of the total. As a content provider, we compete for wagering dollars in the simulcast market with other racetracks conducting races at or near the same times as our races. As a racetrack operator, we also compete for horses with other racetracks running live racing meets at or near the same time as our races. Our ability to compete is substantially dependent on the racing calendar, number of horses racing and purse sizes. In recent years, competition has increased as more states legalize gaming and allow slot machines at racetracks with mandatory purse contributions. 
Online Wagering
TwinSpires
TwinSpires competes with other ADW businesses for both customers and racing content, as well as brick-and-mortar racetracks, casinos and OTBs. 
Sports Betting and iGaming
Our BetAmerica online sports betting and iGaming business competes for customers with retail and online offerings from both tribal and commercial brick-and-mortar casinos and racetracks.  We compete with daily fantasy sports gaming companies that are expanding into sports betting and iGaming, and other international sports betting businesses looking to expand into the U.S. market. We also compete with significant illegal sports betting and iGaming operations.
Casino
Our Casino properties operate in highly competitive environments, and our primary competition is other regional casino properties. Our Casino properties compete to a lesser extent with state-sponsored lotteries, off-track wagering, card parlors, online gambling and other forms of legalized gaming in the U.S.  Our properties primarily compete for customers with other casinos in their markets and in surrounding regional gaming markets, where location is a critical factor to success. 
Other Investments
Derby City Gaming competes with regional casinos in the area and other forms of legal and illegal gaming. 
D.    Governmental Regulations and Potential Legislative Changes
We are subject to various federal, state and international laws and regulations that affect our businesses. The ownership, operation and management of our Racing businesses, Online Wagering businesses, Casino properties, and Other Investments are subject to regulation under the laws and regulations of each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. The ownership, operation and management of our businesses and properties are also subject to legislative actions at both the federal and state level. 
Racing Regulations
Horseracing is a highly regulated industry. In the United States, individual states control the operations of racetracks located within their respective jurisdictions with the intent of, among other things, protecting the public from unfair and illegal gambling practices, generating tax revenue, licensing racetracks and operators and preventing organized crime from being involved in the industry. Although the specific form may vary, states that regulate horseracing generally do so through a horseracing commission or other gambling regulatory authority. In general, regulatory authorities perform background checks on all racetrack owners prior to granting them the necessary operating licenses. Horse owners, trainers, jockeys, drivers, stewards, judges and backstretch personnel are also subject to licensing by governmental authorities. State regulation of horse races extends to virtually every aspect of racing and usually extends to details such as the presence and placement of specific race officials, including timers, placing judges, starters and patrol judges. We currently satisfy the applicable licensing requirements of the racing and gambling regulatory authorities in each state where we maintain racetracks or pari-mutuel operations and/or businesses.
The total number of days on which each racetrack conducts live racing fluctuates annually according to each calendar year and the determination of applicable regulatory authorities.
In the United States, interstate pari-mutuel wagering on horseracing is subject to the Interstate Horseracing Act of 1978 ("IHA"), as amended in 2000. Through the IHA, racetracks can commingle wagers from different racetracks and wagering facilities and broadcast horseracing events to other licensed establishments.
Specific State Racing Regulations and Potential Legislative Changes
Kentucky
In Kentucky, horseracing tracks are subject to the licensing and regulation of the KHRC, which is responsible for overseeing horseracing and regulating the state equine industry. Licenses to conduct live thoroughbred and Standardbred racing meets, to 
10

participate in simulcasting, and to accept advance deposit wagers from Kentucky residents are approved annually by the KHRC based upon applications submitted by the racetracks in Kentucky. 
In March of 2018, legislation was signed into law that permanently waives the excise tax on live pari-mutuel handle wagers at a Kentucky racetrack hosting the Breeders’ Cup. 
In November of 2018, the KHRC awarded WKY Development, LLC, which is a joint venture between the Company and Keeneland, a racing license for twelve live Standardbred race dates beginning in October 2019, at a racing facility to be constructed in Oak Grove, Kentucky. 
Illinois
In Illinois, licenses to conduct live thoroughbred racing and to participate in simulcast wagering are approved by the Illinois Racing Board ("IRB"). In September 2018, the IRB appointed Arlington the dark host track in Illinois for 60 simulcast host days during 2019, which was the same amount compared to 2018.  In addition, Arlington was awarded 155 live host days for 2019, which was the same amount compared to 2018.  In total, Arlington was awarded 215 live and dark host days in 2019.
In July 2018, legislation was signed into law that extends the authorization of advance deposit wagering though December 31, 2022.
Florida
In Florida, licenses to conduct live thoroughbred racing and to participate in simulcast wagering are approved by the DBPR's Division of Pari-Mutuel Wagering ("DPW"). The DPW is responsible for overseeing the network of state offices located at every pari-mutuel wagering facility, as well as issuing the permits necessary to operate a pari-mutuel wagering facility. The DPW also issues annual licenses for thoroughbred, Standardbred and quarter horse races but does not approve the specific live race days.
Louisiana
In Louisiana, licenses to conduct live thoroughbred and quarter horse racing and to participate in simulcast wagering are approved by the Louisiana State Racing Commission ("LSRC"). The LSRC is responsible for overseeing the awarding of licenses for the conduct of live racing meets, the conduct of thoroughbred and quarter horse racing, the types of wagering that may be offered by pari-mutuel facilities and the disposition of revenue generated from wagering. Off-track wagering is also regulated by the LSRC. Louisiana law requires live thoroughbred racing at a licensed racetrack for at least 80 days over a 20 week period each year to maintain the license and to conduct slot operations.
With the addition of slot machines at Fair Grounds, Louisiana law requires live quarter horseracing to be conducted at the racetrack. We conducted quarter horseracing at Fair Grounds for 10 days in each of 2016, 2017 and 2018. We expect to conduct quarter horseracing for 10 days in 2019.
Pennsylvania
In Pennsylvania, licenses to conduct live thoroughbred racing, to participate in simulcast wagering and to accept advance deposit wagers from Pennsylvania residents are approved by the Pennsylvania State Horse Racing Commission (“PSHRC”).  The PSHRC regulates the operations of horse racing, the conduct of pari-mutuel wagering and the promotion and marketing of horse racing in Pennsylvania.  As a Category 1 slot machine licensee, Presque Isle is required to conduct live racing on at least 100 days each calendar year.  The PSHRC approved Presque Isle for 100 live race days in 2019. 
TwinSpires Regulations and Potential Legislative Changes
TwinSpires is licensed in Oregon under a multi-jurisdictional simulcasting and interactive wagering totalisator hub license issued by the Oregon Racing Commission and in accordance with Oregon law. We also hold advance deposit wagering licenses in certain other states where required such as California, Illinois, Idaho, Kentucky, Maryland, Virginia, Colorado, Arizona, Wyoming, Arkansas, New York and Washington. Changes in the form of new legislation or regulatory activity at the state or federal level could adversely impact our mobile and online ADW business.
Sports Betting and iGaming Regulations and Potential Legislative Changes
Federal 
In May 2018, the United States Supreme Court struck down the 1992 Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act, which had effectively banned sports wagering in most states. Removal of the ban gives states the authority to authorize sports wagering. Should states choose to authorize this activity, we believe it will have a positive impact on our business. 
In January 2019, the Department of Justice’s Office of Legal Counsel ("DJOLC") issued a revised legal opinion regarding the scope of the Interstate Wire Act of 1961 (the "Wire Act"). Under the 2019 revised opinion, the DJOLC states they now believe the 
11

Wire Act applies to all forms of gaming that crosses state lines, including online gambling and online lottery. The new opinion overturned a DJOLC opinion from 2011 which stated the Wire Act applied only to sports betting. We believe the revised DJOLC opinion could have a negative impact on our business operations. 
Specific State Sports Betting and iGaming Regulations and Potential Legislative Changes
Mississippi 
In 2017, Mississippi provisionally allowed sports betting as part of a bill legalizing and regulating fantasy sports, subject to the reversal of the 1992 Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act and approval by the Mississippi Gaming Commission.
In June 2018, the Mississippi Gaming Commission approved rules regulating sports betting confined to brick-and-mortar casinos located in Mississippi, which became effective in July 2018. The tax rate on gross gaming revenues for sports betting is consistent with our casino gross gaming revenues. We believe this approval will have a positive impact on our business. 
New Jersey 
Sports Betting
In June 2018, a bill was signed into law which authorizes sports betting at casinos, racetracks and online, and the Division of Gaming Enforcement issued regulations governing the activity. Each casino or racetrack may offer a maximum of three online sports betting websites. The initial license fee is $100,000 with a tax of 9.75% on land-based gross betting revenue and a 14.25% tax on online gross betting revenue. In February 2019, we launched our BetAmerica online sports betting platform in New Jersey through our partnership with Golden Nugget Atlantic City Casino. We believe this legislation will have a positive impact on our business.
Online Gaming
In February 2013, legislation was signed into law that allows Atlantic City casinos to offer online casino gaming in New Jersey. The legislation provides for a $400,000 license fee and a 17.5% tax rate on gross gaming revenues. In February 2019, we launched our BetAmerica online casino platform in New Jersey through our partnership with Golden Nugget Casino. We believe this legislation will have a positive impact on our business.
Pennsylvania
Sports Betting
In October 2017, a bill was signed into law in Pennsylvania which allows the state's existing brick-and-mortar casinos to operate retail and online sports betting after paying a $10 million license fee. The tax rate on sports wagering is 36% of gross gaming revenue. In July 2018, the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board ("PGCB") issued temporary regulations governing the activity. As of December 31, 2018, seven casinos had petitioned to operate retail and online sportsbooks in Pennsylvania, including Presque Isle, which the Company acquired on January 11, 2019. Five of the seven casino retail sportsbooks are operational, and two have been approved and are not currently operational, including Presque Isle. On February 6, 2019, the PGCB approved our retail and online sports betting petition for Presque Isle. We plan to open our retail BetAmerica Sportsbook at Presque Isle after additional approvals are obtained, including licensing for the related equipment and software providers. The PGCB has not announced a timeline for online sports betting to go live in Pennsylvania. We believe this legislation could have a positive impact on our business. 
Online Gaming
In October 2017, legislation was signed into law that would allow for the operation of online gaming in Pennsylvania. In March 2018, the PGCB issued temporary regulations governing the activity. The legislation allows for casinos to operate up to three categories of licenses: poker, interactive slots and interactive table games. Existing in-state casinos originally had 120 days to purchase a license. Each individual license is $4 million per license or $10 million for all three. Following the initial 120 days, the state allowed out of state gaming entities the opportunity to purchase an online gaming license. The tax rate on poker and table games is 16% of gross gaming revenue, while the tax on slot machine style games is 54%. The PGCB has not announced plans to make the remaining licenses available for purchase. On October 31, 2018, the PCGB approved Presque Isle's petition for a license to offer interactive slots and interactive table games. The PGCB has not announced a timeline for online gaming to go live in Pennsylvania. We believe this legislation could have a positive impact on our business.
Casino Regulations and Potential Legislative Changes
Casino laws are generally designed to protect casino consumers and the viability and integrity of the casino industry. Casino laws may also be designed to protect and maximize state and local revenue derived through taxes and licensing fees imposed on casino industry participants as well as to enhance economic development and tourism. To accomplish these public policy goals, casino 
12

laws establish procedures to ensure that participants in the casino industry meet certain standards of character and fitness. In addition, casino laws require casino industry participants to:

• | Ensure that unsuitable individuals and organizations have no role in casino operations;


• | Establish procedures designed to prevent cheating and fraudulent practices;


• | Establish and maintain responsible accounting practices and procedures;


• | Maintain effective controls over financial practices, including establishment of minimum procedures for internal fiscal affairs and the safeguarding of assets and revenue;


• | Maintain systems for reliable record keeping;


• | File periodic reports with casino regulators;


• | Ensure that contracts and financial transactions are commercially reasonable, reflect fair market value and are arms-length transactions;


• | Establish programs to promote responsible gambling and inform patrons of the availability of help for problem gambling; and


• | Enforce minimum age requirements.

Typically, a state regulatory environment is established by statute and administered by a regulatory agency with broad discretion to regulate the affairs of owners, managers and persons with financial interests in casino operations. Among other things, casino authorities in the various jurisdictions in which we operate:

• | Adopt rules and regulations under the implementing statutes;


• | Interpret and enforce casino laws;


• | Impose disciplinary sanctions for violations, including fines and penalties;


• | Review the character and fitness of participants in casino operations and make determinations regarding suitability or qualification for licensure;


• | Grant licenses for participation in casino operations;


• | Collect and review reports and information submitted by participants in casino operations;


• | Review and approve transactions, such as acquisitions or change-of-control transactions of casino industry participants, securities offerings and debt transactions engaged in by such participants; and


• | Establish and collect fees and taxes.

Any change in the laws or regulations of a casino jurisdiction could have a material adverse impact on our casino operations.
Licensing and Suitability Determinations
Gaming laws require us, each of our subsidiaries engaged in casino operations, certain of our directors, officers and employees, and in some cases, certain of our shareholders, to obtain licenses from casino authorities. Licenses typically require a determination that the applicant qualifies or is suitable to hold the license. Gaming authorities have very broad discretion in determining whether an applicant qualifies for licensing or should be deemed suitable. Criteria used in determining whether to grant a license to conduct casino operations, while varying between jurisdictions, generally include consideration of factors such as the good character, honesty and integrity of the applicant; the financial stability, integrity and responsibility of the applicant, including whether the operation is adequately capitalized in the state and exhibits the ability to maintain adequate insurance levels; the quality of the applicant’s casino facilities; the amount of revenue to be derived by the applicable state from the operation of the applicant’s casino; the applicant’s practices with respect to minority hiring and training; and the effect on competition and general impact on the community.
In evaluating individual applicants, casino authorities consider the individual’s business experience and reputation for good character, the individual’s criminal history and the character of those with whom the individual associates.
Many casino jurisdictions limit the number of licenses granted to operate casinos within the state and some states limit the number of licenses granted to any one casino operator. Licenses under casino laws are generally not transferable without approval. Licenses in most of the jurisdictions in which we conduct casino operations are granted for limited durations and require renewal from time to time. There can be no assurance that any of our licenses will be renewed. The failure to renew any of our licenses could have a material adverse impact on our casino operations.
13

In addition to our subsidiaries engaged in casino operations, casino authorities may investigate any individual who has a material relationship to or material involvement with, any of these entities to determine whether such individual is suitable or should be licensed as a business associate of a casino licensee. Our officers, directors and certain key employees must file applications with the casino authorities and may be required to be licensed, qualify or be found suitable in many jurisdictions. Gaming authorities may deny an application for licensing for any cause that they deem reasonable. Qualification and suitability determinations require submission of detailed personal and financial information followed by a thorough investigation. The applicant must pay all the costs of the investigation. Changes in licensed positions must be reported to casino authorities. In addition to casino authorities' ability to deny a license, qualification or finding of suitability, casino authorities have jurisdiction to disapprove a change in a corporate position.
If one or more casino authorities were to find that an officer, director or key employee fails to qualify or is unsuitable for licensing or unsuitable to continue having a relationship with us, we would be required to sever all relationships with such person. In addition, casino authorities may require us to terminate the employment of any person who refuses to file appropriate applications.
Moreover, in many jurisdictions, certain of our shareholders may be required to undergo a suitability investigation similar to that described above. Many jurisdictions require any person who acquires beneficial ownership of more than a certain percentage of our voting securities, typically 5%, to report the acquisition to casino authorities, and casino authorities may require such holders to apply for qualification or a finding of suitability. Most casino authorities, however, allow an "institutional investor" to apply for a waiver. An "institutional investor" is generally defined as an investor acquiring and holding voting securities in the ordinary course of business as an institutional investor, and not for the purpose of causing, directly or indirectly, the election of a member of our board of directors, any change in our corporate charter, bylaws, management, policies or operations, or those of any of our casino affiliates, or the taking of any other action which casino authorities find to be inconsistent with holding our voting securities for investment purposes only. Even if a waiver is granted, an institutional investor generally may not take any action inconsistent with its status when the waiver was granted without once again becoming subject to the foregoing reporting and application obligations.
Generally, any person who fails or refuses to apply for a finding of suitability or a license within the prescribed period after being advised it is required by casino authorities may be denied a license or found unsuitable, as applicable. Any shareholder found unsuitable or denied a license and who holds, directly or indirectly, any beneficial ownership of our voting securities beyond such period of time as may be prescribed by the applicable casino authorities may be guilty of a criminal offense. Furthermore, we may be subject to disciplinary action if, after we receive notice that a person is unsuitable to be a shareholder or to have any other relationship with us or any of our subsidiaries, we: (i) pay that person any dividend or interest upon our voting securities; (ii) allow that person to exercise, directly or indirectly, any voting right conferred through securities held by that person; (iii) pay remuneration in any form to that person for services rendered or otherwise; or (iv) fail to pursue all lawful efforts to require such unsuitable person to relinquish voting securities including, if necessary, the immediate purchase of said voting securities for cash at fair market value.
Violations of Gaming Laws
If we violate applicable casino laws, our casino licenses could be limited, conditioned, suspended or revoked by casino authorities, and we and any other persons involved could be subject to substantial fines. A supervisor or conservator can be appointed by casino authorities to operate our casino properties, or in some jurisdictions, take title to our casino assets in the jurisdiction, and under certain circumstances, income generated during such appointment could be forfeited to the applicable state or states. Violations of laws in one jurisdiction could result in disciplinary action in other jurisdictions. As a result, violations by us of applicable casino laws could have a material adverse impact on our casino operations.
Some casino jurisdictions prohibit certain types of political activity by a casino licensee, its officers, directors and key employees. A violation of such a prohibition may subject the offender to criminal and/or disciplinary action.
Reporting and Record-keeping Requirements
We are required periodically to submit detailed financial and operating reports and furnish any other information that casino authorities may require. Under federal law, we are required to record and submit detailed reports of currency transactions involving greater than $10,000 at our casinos and racetracks as well as any suspicious activity that may occur at such facilities. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in fines or cessation of operations. We are required to maintain a current stock ledger that may be examined by casino authorities at any time. If any securities are held in trust by an agent or by a nominee, the record holder may be required to disclose the identity of the beneficial owner to casino authorities. A failure to make such disclosure may be grounds for finding the record holder unsuitable. Gaming authorities may require certificates for our securities to bear a legend indicating that the securities are subject to specified casino laws.
Review and Approval of Transactions
Substantially all material loans, leases, sales of securities and similar financing transactions must be reported to and in some cases 
14

approved by casino authorities. We may not make a public offering of securities without the prior approval of certain casino authorities. Changes in control through merger, consolidation, stock or asset acquisitions, management or consulting agreements, or otherwise are subject to receipt of prior approval of casino authorities. Entities seeking to acquire control of us or one of our subsidiaries must satisfy casino authorities with respect to a variety of stringent standards prior to assuming control. Gaming authorities may also require controlling shareholders, officers, directors and other persons having a material relationship or involvement with the entity proposing to acquire control, to be investigated and licensed as part of the approval process relating to the transaction.
License Fees and Gaming Taxes
We pay substantial license fees and taxes in many jurisdictions in connection with our casino operations which are computed in various ways depending on the type of gambling or activity involved. Depending upon the particular fee or tax involved, these fees and taxes are payable with varying frequency. License fees and taxes are based upon such factors as a percentage of the gross casino revenue received; the number of gambling devices and table games operated; or a one-time fee payable upon the initial receipt of license and fees in connection with the renewal of license. In some jurisdictions, casino tax rates are graduated such that the tax rates increase as gross casino revenue increases. Tax rates are subject to change, sometimes with little notice, and such changes could have a material adverse impact on our casino operations.
Operational Requirements
In most jurisdictions, we are subject to certain requirements and restrictions on how we must conduct our casino operations. In certain states, we are required to give preference to local suppliers and include minority and women-owned businesses and organized labor in construction projects to the maximum extent practicable. We may be required to give employment preference to minorities, women and in-state residents in certain jurisdictions. Our ability to conduct certain types of games, introduce new games or move existing games within our facilities may be restricted or subject to regulatory review and approval. Some of our operations are subject to restrictions on the number of gaming positions we may have and the maximum wagers allowed to be placed by our customers.
Specific State Casino Regulations and Potential Legislative Changes
Florida
The ownership and operation of casino gaming facilities in the State of Florida is subject to extensive state and local regulation, primarily by the DBPR, within the executive branch of Florida’s state government. The DBPR is charged with the regulation of Florida’s pari-mutuel, card room and slot gaming industries, as well as collecting and safeguarding associated revenue due to the state. The DBPR has been designated by the Florida legislature as the state compliance agency with the authority to carry out the state’s oversight responsibilities in accordance with the provisions outlined in the compact between the Seminole Tribe of Florida and the State of Florida. Changes in Florida laws or regulations may limit or otherwise materially affect the types of gaming that may be conducted and such changes, if enacted, could have an adverse impact on our Florida gaming operation. The laws and regulations of Florida are based on policies of maintaining the health, welfare and safety of the general public and protecting the gaming industry from elements of organized crime, illegal gambling activities and other harmful elements, as well as protecting the public from illegal and unscrupulous gaming to ensure the fair play of devices. The failure to comply with the rules and regulations of the DBPR could have a material adverse impact on our business.
Seminole Compact 
In December 2015, Florida’s Governor signed a twenty-year Seminole Compact with the Seminole Tribe preserving the Seminole Tribe's geographic exclusivity and right to exclusively operate blackjack, craps and roulette games and providing the state with an expected $3.0 billion in additional state revenue over a seven-year period beginning in 2017. The Seminole Compact addresses other issues such as the potential for pari-mutuel operations to add blackjack in a limited fashion as well as the potential for expanded licenses in Palm Beach and Miami-Dade counties. At this time it is not possible to determine what impact the Seminole Compact will have on our business.
Constitutional Amendment
In November 2018, voters in Florida passed a constitutional amendment which provides any gaming expansion in the state must be approved by 60% of voters. 
Louisiana
The manufacturing, distribution, servicing and operation of video draw poker devices in Louisiana are subject to the Louisiana Video Draw Poker Devices Control Law and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. The manufacturing, distribution, servicing and operation of video poker devices and slot machines are governed by the Louisiana Gaming Control Board (the "Louisiana Board") which oversees all licensing for all forms of legalized gaming in Louisiana. The Video Gaming Division and the Slots Gaming Division of the Gaming Enforcement Section of the Office of the State Police within the Department of Public 
15

Safety and Corrections (the "Division") performs the video poker and slots gaming investigative functions for the Louisiana Board. The laws and regulations of Louisiana are based on policies of maintaining the health, welfare and safety of the general public and protecting the gaming industry from elements of organized crime, illegal gambling activities and other harmful elements, as well as protecting the public from illegal and unscrupulous gaming to ensure the fair play of devices. The Louisiana Board also regulates slot machine gaming at racetrack facilities pursuant to the Louisiana Pari-Mutuel Live Racing Facility Economic Redevelopment and Gaming Control Act. Changes in Louisiana laws or regulations may limit or otherwise materially affect the types of gaming that may be conducted and such changes, if enacted, could have an adverse impact on our Louisiana gaming operations. In addition, the LSRC also issues licenses required for Fair Grounds to operate slot machines at the racetrack and video poker devices at its OTBs. The failure to comply with the rules and regulations of the Louisiana Board or the LSRC could have a material adverse impact on our business.
Maine
The ownership and operation of casino gaming facilities in the State of Maine is subject to extensive state and local regulation and is subject to licensing and regulatory control by the Maine Gambling Control Board (the "MGCB"). The laws, regulations and supervisory procedures of the MGCB are based upon declarations of public policy that are concerned with, among other things: (1) the regulation, supervision and general control over casinos and the ownership and operation of slot machines and table games; (2) the investigation of complaints made regarding casinos; (3) the establishment and maintenance of responsible accounting practices and procedures; (4) the maintenance of effective controls over the financial practices of licensees, including the establishment of minimum procedures for internal fiscal affairs and the safeguarding of assets and revenue and providing for reliable record keeping; and (5) the prevention of cheating and fraudulent practices. The regulations are subject to amendment and interpretation by the MGCB. Changes in Maine laws or regulations may limit or otherwise materially affect the types of gaming that may be conducted and such changes, if enacted, could have an adverse impact on our Maine gaming operations. The failure to comply with the rules and regulations of the MGCB could have a material adverse impact on our business.
Maryland
The ownership and operation of casino gaming facilities in the State of Maryland is subject to extensive state and local regulation and is subject to licensing and regulatory control by the Maryland Lottery and Gaming Control Commission (“MLGCC”), with staff assistance from the Maryland Lottery and Gaming Control Agency (“MLGCA”). The MLGCA oversees all internal controls, auditing, security, surveillance, background investigations, licensing and accounting procedures for each casino in the State of Maryland, including Ocean Downs. Changes in Maryland laws or regulations may limit or otherwise materially affect the types of gaming that may be conducted and such changes, if enacted, could have an adverse impact on our Maryland gaming operations. The failure to comply with the rules and regulations of the MLGCC could have a material adverse impact on our business.
In April 2017, legislation was signed into law to allow a VLT licensee to reduce the following day's proceeds by the amount of money returned to players that exceeds the amount bet through VLTs or table games on a given day, thereby reducing the taxes owed by the VLT licensee. In April 2018, legislation was signed into law which provides a video lottery operation licensee may carry over the losses for up to seven days. The legislation has had, and we believe will continue to have, a positive impact on our business.
In April 2018, legislation was signed into law which provides for up to $1.2 million annually to be distributed through 2024 to Ocean Downs Racetrack from the Purse Dedication Account for losses associated with maintaining a minimum of 40 days of live racing each year. We believe this legislation will have a positive impact on our business.
Mississippi
The ownership and operation of casino gaming facilities in the State of Mississippi is subject to extensive state and local regulation, including the Mississippi Gaming Commission (the "Mississippi Commission"). The laws, regulations and supervisory procedures of the Mississippi Commission are based upon declarations of public policy that are concerned with, among other things: (1) the prevention of unsavory or unsuitable persons from having direct or indirect involvement with gaming at any time or in any capacity; (2) the establishment and maintenance of responsible accounting practices and procedures; (3) the maintenance of effective controls over the financial practices of licensees, including the establishment of minimum procedures for internal fiscal affairs and the safeguarding of assets and revenue, providing for reliable record keeping and requiring the filing of periodic reports with the Mississippi Commission; (4) the prevention of cheating and fraudulent practices; (5) providing a source of state and local revenue through taxation and licensing fees; and (6) ensuring that gaming licensees, to the extent practicable, employ Mississippi residents. The regulations are subject to amendment and interpretation by the Mississippi Commission. Changes in Mississippi laws or regulations may limit or otherwise materially affect the types of gaming that may be conducted and such changes, if enacted, could have an adverse impact on our Mississippi gaming operations. The failure to comply with the rules and regulations of the Mississippi Commission could have a material adverse impact on our business.
16

Ohio
VLTs were introduced in the State of Ohio in 2012 when the Governor of Ohio signed Executive Order 2011-22K, which authorized the Ohio Lottery Commission (the "OLC") to amend and adopt rules necessary to implement a video lottery program at Ohio’s seven horse racing facilities. The ownership and operation of VLT facilities in the State of Ohio is subject to extensive state and local regulation. The laws, regulations and supervisory procedures of the OLC include: (1) regulating the licensing of video lottery sales agents, key gaming employees and VLT manufacturers; (2) collecting and disbursing VLT revenue; and (3) maintaining compliance in regulatory matters. Changes in Ohio laws or regulations may limit or otherwise materially affect the types of gaming that may be conducted and such changes, if enacted, could have an adverse impact on our Ohio gaming operations. The failure to comply with the rules and regulations of the OLC could have a material adverse impact on our business.
Pennsylvania
The ownership and operation of casino gaming facilities in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania are subject to extensive state and local regulation and are subject to licensing and regulatory control by the PGCB as well as other agencies. The PGCB regulates, oversees and enforces all matters related to gaming activity in Pennsylvania, including, without limitation, operations, internal controls, accounting procedures, auditing, security, surveillance, licensing, background investigations and compliance of each casino in the state.  Changes in Pennsylvania laws or regulations may limit or otherwise materially affect the types of gaming that may be conducted and such changes, if enacted, could have an adverse impact on our Pennsylvania gaming operations.  The failure to comply with the rules and regulations of the PGCB could have a material adverse impact on our business.
Specific State HRM Regulations and Potential Legislative Changes
Kentucky
The KHRC is responsible for overseeing the annual licensing and operations of HRMs in Kentucky. In September 2018, Churchill Downs received final approval from the KHRC to open Derby City Gaming, located in Louisville, Kentucky. Derby City Gaming is subject to extensive state and local legislation and is subject to licensing and regulatory control by the KHRC. 
Changes in Kentucky laws or regulations may limit or otherwise materially affect the types of HRMs that may be conducted and such changes, if enacted, could have an adverse impact on our Kentucky HRM operations. The failure to comply with the rules and regulations of the KHRC could have a material adverse impact on our business.
E.    Environmental Matters
We are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations that govern activities that may have adverse environmental effects, such as discharges to air and water, as well as the management and disposal of solid, animal and hazardous wastes and exposure to hazardous materials. These laws and regulations, which are complex and subject to change, include United States Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") and state laws and regulations that address the impacts of manure and wastewater generated by Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations ("CAFO") on water quality, including, but not limited to, storm and sanitary water discharges. CAFO and other water discharge regulations include permit requirements and water quality discharge standards. Enforcement of these regulations has been receiving increased governmental attention. Compliance with these and other environmental laws can, in some circumstances, require significant capital expenditures. We may incur future costs under existing and new laws and regulations pertaining to storm water and wastewater management at our racetracks. Moreover, violations can result in significant penalties and, in some instances, interruption or cessation of operations.
In the ordinary course of our business, we may receive notices from regulatory agencies regarding our compliance with CAFO regulations that may require remediation at our facilities. On December 6, 2013, we received a notice from the EPA regarding alleged CAFO non-compliance at Fair Grounds. We are currently in discussions with the EPA regarding potential remedial actions relating to alleged CAFO non-compliance at Fair Grounds and expect to incur certain capital expenditures to upgrade these facilities to resolve this issue.
We also are subject to laws and regulations that create liability and cleanup responsibility for releases of hazardous substances into the environment. Under certain of these laws and regulations, a current or previous owner or operator of property may be liable for the costs of remediating hazardous substances or petroleum products on its property, without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or caused, the presence of the contaminants, and regardless of whether the practices that resulted in the contamination were legal at the time they occurred. The presence of, or failure to remediate properly, such substances may materially adversely affect the ability to sell or rent such property or to borrow funds using such property as collateral. Additionally, the owner of a property may be subject to claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the property.
17

F.    Marks and Internet Properties
We hold numerous state and federal service mark registrations on specific names and designs in various categories including the entertainment business, apparel, paper goods, printed matter, housewares and glass. We license the use of these service marks and derive revenue from such license agreements.
G.    Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we employed approximately 4,100 full-time and part-time employees Company-wide. Due to the seasonal nature of our live racing business, the number of seasonal and part-time persons employed will vary throughout the year.
H.    Available Information
Our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, proxy statements and other Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") filings, and any amendments to those reports and any other filings that we file with or furnish to the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 are made available free of charge on our website (www.churchilldownsincorporated.com) as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file the materials with the SEC and are also available at the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov.
