 ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 
General
 At our core, we are a global services company. With over 90% market share in the historically highly attractive outsourced maritime health and wellness market, we are the market leader at more than 20x the size of our closest maritime competitor. Over the last 50 years, we have built our leading market position on our depth of staff expertise; broad and innovative service and product offerings; expansive global recruitment, training and logistics platform; and decades-long relationships with cruise line and destination resort partners. Throughout our history, our mission has been simple: helping guests look and feel their best during and after their stay. We serve a critical role for our cruise line and destination resort partners, operating a complex and increasingly important aspect of their overall guest experience. Decades of investment and know-how have allowed us to construct an unmatched global infrastructure to manage the complexity of our operations. We have consistently expanded our onboard offerings with innovative, leading-edge service and product introductions, and developed a powerful back-end recruiting, training and logistics platform to manage our operational complexity, maintain our industry-leading quality standards and maximize revenue per center. The combination of our renowned recruiting and training platform, deep labor pool, global logistics and supply chain infrastructure and proven revenue management capabilities represents a significant competitive advantage that we believe is not economically feasible to replicate. These competitive advantages have served our business well during these extremely challenging times for our industry.
Impact of Coronavirus (COVID-19)
 In the face of the global impact of the coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic, our cruise line partners paused their guest cruise operations and the majority of our U.S. and Caribbean-based destination resort spas temporarily closed in mid-March 2020. During 2021, we initiated our resumption of spa operations on cruise ships and in destination resorts in a phased manner, in concert with our cruise line and resort partners. The potential continuing extent of the effects of COVID-19 on our business is uncertain and will depend on future developments. As of February 25, 2023, our health and wellness centers on 177 ships of our cruise line partners and in 49 destination resort spas were operating as part of our continuing return to service.
We took a number of proactive measures to mitigate the financial and operational impacts of COVID-19, including completing a private placement and various capital market transactions, reduction of capital expenditures and operating expenses, borrowing on our revolving credit facility, deferring payment of dividends declared, and the suspension of our dividend program. To the extent necessary, we will continue to pursue other opportunities to improve our liquidity.
Our Business
 The majority of our revenue and profits are earned through long-term revenue sharing agreements with cruise line partners that economically align both parties and contribute to our attractive asset-light financial profile. These agreements average approximately six years in length and provide us with the exclusive right to offer health, fitness, beauty and wellness services and the ability to sell complementary products onboard the ships we serve. Under these long-term agreements, cruise line partners retain a specified percentage of revenues from all our sales onboard. This inherent alignment encourages collaboration in all aspects of our operations, including facility design, product innovation, pre- and post-cruise sales opportunities, capacity utilization initiatives and other data-driven strategies to drive increased guest traffic and revenue growth. Most of our cruise line agreements encompass 100% of a partner cruise line’s existing fleet and all new ships introduced by the cruise line during the term of the agreement. As opposed to fixed-rent landlords, cruise lines and destination resorts serve as our aligned economic partners.
 We are recognized by our cruise line and destination resort partners and our guests for our comprehensive suite of services and products. We curate and deliver a broad range of offerings centered on providing specific health, fitness, beauty, and wellness solutions to meet our guests’ lifestyle routines or objectives. These services include: (i) traditional body, salon, and skin care services and products; (ii) self-service fitness facilities, specialized fitness classes and personal fitness training; (iii) innovative pain management, detoxifying programs and comprehensive body composition analyses; (iv) weight management programs and products; and (v) advanced medi-spa services, among others. We also offer our guests access to leading beauty and wellness brands including ELEMIS ®, Kérastase ®, BOTOX® Cosmetic, Dysport ®, Restylane®, Perlane®, Thermage®, CoolSculpting®, truSculpt® 3D, and truSculpt® iD, with many brands offered exclusively by us in the cruise market. On average, during the year ended December 31, 2022, guests spent approximately $270 per visit. Additionally, our solution sales approach drives substantial retail sales, with approximately 18% of our revenues derived from the sale of retail products during the year ended December 31, 2022.
 Our state-of-the-art health, fitness, beauty and wellness centers are designed and branded for each cruise line and destination resort to optimize the guest experience, align with our partners’ overall hospitality atmosphere and maximize productivity. During the

year ended December 31, 2022, centers employed up to 79 highly trained professionals and ranged in size up to over 30,000 square feet, depending on the cruise line or destination resort partner’s needs.
 Our cruise line relationships average over 20 years and encompass substantially all of the major global cruise lines, including Carnival Cruise Line, Royal Caribbean Cruises, Princess Cruises, Norwegian Cruise Lines, Celebrity Cruises, Costa Cruises and Holland America, among many others, as well as recent additions to the industry, such as Virgin Voyages. These partnerships extend across contemporary, premium, luxury and budget cruise lines that operate ships regionally and globally. We maintain what we believe to be an exceptional contract renewal rate with our cruise line partners, having renewed approximately 94% of our contracts based on ship count over the last 15 years, including 100% of our contracts with ships larger than 3,500 berths. We have not only maintained relationships with existing cruise line partners, but also have a history of winning contracts and gaining market share. In August 2021, we extended our current agreement with Azamara through May 2026. In November 2022, we extended our current agreement with Norwegian Cruise Lines through December 2029 for all ships across their three brands. On land, we have longstanding relationships with the world’s leading destination hotel and resort operators, including Marriott, Hilton, Wyndham, Atlantis, ClubMed, Caesars Entertainment, Lotte, Loews, Four Seasons, and Mohegan Sun, among others.
 Our Operations and Performance
 We are a Bahamian international business company that earns a substantial portion of our revenue in low- or no-tax jurisdictions, benefiting from a comparatively low effective cash tax rate. Additionally, we have minimal capital expenditures, as our cruise line and destination resort partners typically fund the build-out, maintenance, and refurbishment of our health and wellness centers. The combination of our attractive tax rate and asset-light operating model leads to a financial profile that delivers comparatively high Unlevered After-Tax Free Cash Flow. Annually, from fiscal 2017 through 2019, and post-pandemic, in fiscal 2022, we converted approximately 90% of our Adjusted EBITDA to Unlevered After-Tax Free Cash Flow.
Historically, with the exception of the adverse impact of the recent pandemic discussed elsewhere herein, and since the resumption of our spa operations on cruise ships and in destination resorts, we have driven strong financial performance and believe our leading market position in a growing industry, differentiated business model, and entrenched cruise line and destination resort partner relationships position our business for continued growth. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we achieved revenues of $546.3 million, Adjusted EBITDA of $50.4 million, Net Income of $53.2 million and Unlevered After-Tax Free Cash Flow of $45.1 million.
Attractive Market Opportunity
 
We operate at the intersection of the historically attractive health and wellness and travel leisure industries. We believe we are well-positioned to grow as the cruise industry continues to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic.
Historical Cruise Industry Growth
 
Prior to COVID-19, the cruise industry had been among the fastest-growing segments in the travel leisure industry, including through the recessions of 2001 and 2008-2010. We estimate, based on annual statistics published by Cruise Lines International Association (“CLIA”), that global passenger counts had grown every year until 2020 from approximately 6.3 million passengers in 1995 to an all-time high of approximately 30.0 million passengers in 2019, representing a compound annual growth rate of 6.7%. This passenger growth had been driven by consistent, significant investments in new cruise ship capacity, strong loyalty among experienced cruisers and the large and growing appeal of cruising to all demographics, including millennials. From 2018 to 2020, the Caribbean, Bahamas and Bermuda were the top cruise destinations, representing 44% of passenger volume during that period, according to the CLIA. Although the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly adversely affected, and continues to affect, passenger volume in the global cruise industry, passenger volume has started to recover since a number of cruise lines restarted their operations beginning in July 2021. In its most recently published State of the Cruise Industry Outlook, CLIA forecasted passenger volume to exceed 2019 levels by the end of 2022 or 2023, and reported the results of a survey of international vacationers indicating that 80% of respondents who had previously been on a cruise said that they were likely to cruise again in the next few years, with millennials representing 85% of the cruise passenger respondents who plan to cruise again. New consumer sentiment data released by CLIA during the third quarter of 2022 indicated that the demand and perception of cruise holidays are now greater than in 2019.
Historically Large and Growing Health and Wellness Industry
 
Our health and wellness centers cater to guests seeking a continuation of their health, fitness, beauty and wellness activities while traveling and those who want to trial services while away from home. As consumers increasingly incorporate health and wellness activities into their daily lives, they are placing a higher priority on health and wellness services while traveling and vacationing. In its most recently published State of the Cruise Industry Outlook, CLIA forecasted passenger volume to exceed 2019

levels by the end of 2022 or 2023, and reported the results of a survey of international vacationers indicating that 80% of respondents who had previously been on a cruise said that they were likely to cruise again in the next few years. Seasoned cruise passengers are joined by millennials, representing 85% of the respondents who plan to cruise again. New consumer sentiment data released by CLIA during the third quarter of 2022 indicated that the demand and perception of cruise holidays are now greater than in 2019.

Our Evolution
 
Our history dates back to the early 1960’s, when we opened the world’s first salons at sea onboard transatlantic cruise ships, including the Queen Mary and Queen Elizabeth II. Over more than 50 years, we have continuously defined and redefined the onboard health, fitness, beauty and wellness category by consistently expanding our onboard offerings with innovative and leading-edge service and product introductions, while developing the powerful back-end recruiting, training and logistics platforms to manage and optimize the complexity of our operations and maintain our industry-leading quality standards. We have successfully evolved the onboard health, fitness, beauty and wellness category from what was once a consumer-centric amenity for passengers to a key onboard revenue driver for our cruise line partners.
 In 2015, a consortium led by L Catterton acquired Steiner Leisure, the holding company of OneSpaWorld at that time. Since then, OneSpaWorld has strengthened its already proven platform by leveraging L Catterton’s expertise in consumer services, consumer products, multi-unit retail operations and customer acquisition, among other expertise. OneSpaWorld has enhanced collaboration with its cruise line and destination resort partners to reinforce its market leading position and introduced innovative revenue initiatives to accelerate its revenue growth. Key recent initiatives include:
 •continued innovation in our service and product offerings, coupled with enhanced consultative sales training techniques, resulting in a shifting revenue mix toward higher value-add and higher priced services, higher-priced products, and higher attachment rates for product purchases in connection with a guest service;
 •enhancing and expanding collaboration with cruise line and destination resort partners;
 •expanding pre-marketing, pre-booking and pre-payment platforms with optimal positioning on cruise line websites;
 •employing data-driven, dynamic pricing of services to optimize facility utilization and revenue generation; and
 •incorporating advanced direct marketing programs, including personalized communications and value promotions, to drive consumer demand.
 On March 19, 2019 (the “Business Combination Date”), OneSpaWorld consummated a business combination pursuant to a Business Combination Agreement, dated as of November 1, 2018 (as amended on January 7, 2019, by Amendment No. 1 to the Business Combination Agreement), by and among Steiner Leisure Limited (“SLL”, “Steiner Leisure,” “Steiner,” or “Parent”), Steiner U.S. Holdings, Inc., Nemo (UK) Holdco, Ltd., Steiner UK Limited, Steiner Management Services, LLC, Haymaker Acquisition Corp. (“Haymaker”), OneSpaWorld, Dory US Merger Sub, LLC, Dory Acquisition Sub, Limited, Dory Intermediate LLC, and Dory Acquisition Sub, Inc. (the “Business Combination”), in which Haymaker acquired from Steiner operating business known as OSW Predecessor (“OSW”). Prior to the consummation of the Business Combination, OneSpaWorld was a wholly-owned subsidiary of Steiner Leisure. On the Business Combination Date, OneSpaWorld became the ultimate parent company of the Haymaker and OSW company.
Prior to the cessation of our cruise line and land-based destination resort operations due to COVID-19, our comprehensive suite of premium health, fitness, beauty and wellness services and products reached more consumers than ever before, with 175 centers onboard cruise ships addressing a captive audience of over 20 million passengers annually, and 68 destination resort centers serving global travelers at premier destination resorts around the world.
 Our Strengths
 
Despite the recent impacts of COVID-19 on the travel leisure industry and our business, we believe that our competitive strengths historically have positioned us, and will continue to position us, as a leader in the hospitality-based health and wellness industry and the category dominant leader in the cruise industry.
 
Global Leader in the Hospitality-Based Health and Wellness Industry
 

As the pre-eminent global operator of health and wellness centers onboard cruise ships and a leading operator of health and wellness centers at destination resorts worldwide, we are at the center of the intersection between the health and wellness and travel leisure industries. In 2022, the Global Wellness Institute reported that global wellness tourism was a $814.6 billion industry. We are the market leader at more than 20x the size of our closest maritime competitor. Through our market share, we have had access to a captive audience of over 20 million passengers annually. Cruise ship guests are an attractive demographic, with average annual household incomes of over $100,000. As a result of our scale, our captive consumer audience, and consumers’ increasing desire for more health, fitness, beauty and wellness services and products, we are well-positioned in the global health and wellness industry and have a large and highly attractive addressable consumer market at sea and on land.
 
Differentiated Business Model That Would Be Difficult and Uneconomic to Replicate
 
For more than 50 years, our business model has been built through investment in global infrastructure, supply chain logistics and training, decades-long relationships with our cruise line and destination resort partners and our reputation for offering our guests a best-in-class health, fitness, beauty and wellness experience. Our robust infrastructure and processes required to operate and maximize revenue across our network of global health and wellness centers separates us from existing and prospective peers. In 2022, we embarked on over 6,500 voyages that welcomed over 15 million passengers at more than 193 ports of embarkation, and placed over 4,800 individuals, more than 60% of whom were previously employed by OneSpaWorld, in various positions at our shipboard health and wellness centers. Our business model is centered on providing our cruise line and destination resort partners with the following solutions:
 
•Creating Extraordinary Guest Experiences —We pride ourselves on creating extraordinary guest experiences in our health and wellness facilities, offering our cruise line and destination resort partners’ guests a comprehensive suite of premium health, wellness, fitness and beauty services, treatments, and products.
 •Global Recruiting, Training and Logistics —We recruit, train and manage over 5,000 health, fitness, beauty and wellness professionals annually around the world, representing 88 nationalities and 27 spoken languages. With seven global training facilities, we serve each cruise line’s needs for specific onboard staff with complex language, cultural and service modality requirements and are the only company with the infrastructure to commission highly trained staff at over 1,100 ports of call worldwide. Our commitment to our onboard and destination resort staff has proven to be an essential element of our successful return to service performance.
 •Supply Chain and Logistics —We managed the complex delivery of all products and supplies to our health and wellness centers onboard 177 vessels operating 3,407 itineraries around the world during 2022, leveraging proprietary data to accurately forecast and stock each health and wellness center. Products and supplies can only be loaded at designated ports around the world during a limited window of time while the ship is in port, in many cases overnight, adding to the complexity of the process.
 •Yield and Revenue Management —We have developed proprietary technology, processes and staff training tools to consistently measure, analyze and maximize onboard and destination resort revenue and profitability.
 •Exclusive Relationships with Global Brands —Due to our scale, superior operations, industry longevity and attractive captive consumer audience, through the OneSpaWorld platform at sea, we offer for sale and utilize in our services more than 1,400 product SKUs sourced from over 75 vendors, including ELEMIS, Grown Alchemist, Kérastase, Thermage, GoodFeet® Arch Supports, HypericeTM, and GO SMILE® Teeth Whitening, among others.
 •Facility Design and Branding Expertise —We design our state-of-the-art health and wellness centers specifically for each cruise line vessel and destination resort, creating bespoke branding, guest experience, guest services offerings, complementary retail products assortment, and competitive differentiation for each of our cruise line and destination resort partners to optimize guest experiences and maximize productivity and financial performance.
 The above capabilities have contributed to building a differentiated and defensible strategy around our leading market position in a historically growing and attractive industry.
 Unmatched Breadth of Service and Product Offering
 
We offer our guests a comprehensive suite of health, fitness, beauty and wellness services and products to meet any and all of their needs. We are continuously innovating and evolving our offerings based on the latest trends and tailor our service and product offerings to regional preferences. In addition to conventional personal care services, we offer the latest in fitness, a full range of

massage treatments, nutrition/weight management consultations, teeth whitening, acupuncture, and innovative, higher-ticket medi-spa services at sea, including BOTOX® Cosmetic, Dysport, Restylane, CoolSculpting, Thermage and dermal fillers, among our broad and ever-expanding spectrum of choices. With our captive audience of, historically, over 20 million cruise guests annually, OneSpaWorld is a compelling distribution channel for leading health, fitness, beauty and wellness brands. Renowned brands, including ELEMIS and Kérastase, have partnered with us for exclusive distribution at sea. Cruise line and destination resort partners depend on us to provide their guests with the best and broadest assortment of services and products to enhance their vacation experience and the competitive positioning and consumer value of their brands.
 
Entrenched Partnerships with Economic Alignment
 
We have cultivated partnerships with most of the largest and most reputable cruise lines and premier resorts in the world. Our cruise line relationships average over 20 years and encompass substantially all of the major global cruise lines, including Carnival Cruise Line, Royal Caribbean Cruises, Princess Cruises, Norwegian Cruise Lines, Celebrity Cruises, Costa Cruises, Seabourn Cruise Line, Virgin Voyages, and Holland America, among many others. The majority of our revenues and profits are earned through our long-term revenue sharing agreements with our cruise line partners that economically align both parties and create a collaborative relationship. On land, we partner with market leaders at highly attractive destinations, including Atlantis Paradise Island Bahamas, The Ocean Club, a Four Seasons Resort, Hilton Hawaiian Village Beach Resort and Spa, and the Mohegan Sun Resort, among others. Our long-standing relationships, with economic alignment at the core, strengthen our competitive advantage.
Highly Visible and Predictable Revenue Streams
 
Historically, we have had access to over 20 million passengers annually, with potential long-term passenger growth expected in the future, post the COVID-19 pandemic, as new ships are commissioned in the industry. This new ship growth is highly visible as demonstrated in a publicly available global order book outlining over five years of new ship orders. Across our contracts, OneSpaWorld typically operates on all ships in a fleet and on new ships added during the contract term, securing both existing and new ship revenue. A new ship requires approximately two to four years to be built and is rarely delayed, as cruise lines typically sell out the vessel’s maiden voyage over a year in advance. New ships do not have a revenue ramp-up period given these advanced marketing efforts. Our cruise line partners are experts at dependably filling their ships with passengers, as demonstrated by the industry’s historical average occupancy rate of above 100%, even through recessionary periods. Due to historically consistent industry practices and decades of proprietary operating history data, OneSpaWorld has had strong visibility into our future revenue realization for the next three to five years. Despite recent market conditions related to COVID-19, we have seen these revenue streams rebound throughout fiscal 2022 toward and, in certain cases, above, historical levels.
Asset-Light Model with After-Tax Free Cash Flow Generation
 
Our cruise line partners typically fund the build-out, maintenance, and refurbishment of our onboard health and wellness centers, resulting in an asset-light profile with minimal capex required. Our capital expenditures averaged 1% of revenues over the three years preceding the near cessation of our operations due to COVID-19. Being a Bahamian international business company and earning a significant portion of our revenue in low-tax or no-tax jurisdictions, including international waters, our effective cash tax rate had been approximately 2% over the three years preceding the near cessation of our operations due to COVID-19. This combination translates to exceptional after-tax free cash flow. Annually, from fiscal 2017 through 2019, and post-pandemic, in fiscal 2022, we converted approximately 90% of our Adjusted EBITDA to Unlevered After-Tax Free Cash Flow.
Seasoned and Proven Leadership Team
 
OneSpaWorld is led by a management team that has operated the Company for nearly 20 years. Our Executive Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Leonard Fluxman, and our Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer, Stephen Lazarus, together led OneSpaWorld's predecessor company, Steiner Leisure, as a public company for more than a decade. Mr. Fluxman and Mr. Lazarus now lead an internally developed senior management team with over 150 years of combined industry experience.
Additionally, our Chief Commercial Officer, Susan Bonner, has over 20 years of experience in the cruise line sector and is a seasoned executive with a proven track record and significant background in strategy, revenue management, operations management, sales, and marketing. We benefit from Haymaker’s investing and operational experience at Fortune 500 companies, particularly in the consumer and hospitality sectors. We also have the advantage of extensive industry and related subject matter expertise brought to us by our Board members, including Glenn Fusfield. Until his retirement in 2021, Mr. Fusfield served as Chief Executive Officer of OneSpaWorld. Prior to this role, Mr. Fusfield held various positions of increasing responsibility with the Company for more than 20 years, preceded by 12 years of cruise industry experience. The OneSpaWorld management team’s deep experience and proven track

record in managing the business in both public and private markets positions OneSpaWorld as an attractive vehicle for future long-term growth within the global hospitality-based health and wellness industry.
 Growth Strategies
 Our management plans to continue growing the business through the following strategies:
 
Capture Highly Visible New Ship Growth with Current Cruise Line Partners
 
We expect to continue to benefit long-term from a return to the cruise industry’s capacity for growth, with a consistent and visible pipeline of new ships commissioned annually by our cruise line partners. By the end of 2025, our existing cruise line partners are expected to introduce 21 new ships. Through established cruise line partner relationships, current contracts, competitive positioning of our operating infrastructure, track record of delivering extraordinary guest experiences, and an approximately 94% contract renewal rate over the last 15 years, we are well-positioned to capture new ship growth over the long term.
Expand Market Share by Adding New Potential Cruise Line Partners
 
Although we have more than 20x market share of our nearest competitor in the outsourced maritime health and wellness market, there is an opportunity to continue to grow by winning new contracts. We also routinely meet with cruise lines that do not currently outsource their health and wellness centers or utilize our smaller competitors, but that may have an interest in contracting with us in the future due to our strong reputation and historical results. As evidenced by our successful history of winning new contracts, we remain focused on continuing to protect and grow our dominant market share at sea.
Continue Launching Innovative New Value-Added Services and Products
 
We have successfully innovated services and products to meet guests’ ever-changing needs, attract more guests and generate more revenue and profitability per guest. Medi-spa has been a highly successful innovation for OneSpaWorld at sea and is now an accretive component of our offerings. Performed by medically licensed professionals, the medi-spa offerings provide the latest cosmetic medical services to guests, such as non-surgical cosmetic procedures, including BOTOX Cosmetic, Dysport, Restylane, CoolSculpting, Thermage, and dermal fillers. Guests purchasing medi-spa services spend on average up to 5x more than on traditional health, beauty and wellness services. We continue to roll out incremental revenue opportunities, including the Capillus® Laser Therapy Cap and Hyperice percussion and vibration therapy products and related services. We will continue to focus on launching higher value-add services and products that meet guest demands, align with and enhance our cruise line and destination resort partner brands, optimize health and wellness center utilization, and maximize center-level profitability.
Focus on Enhancing Health and Wellness Center Productivity
 
Cruise lines have become increasingly focused on growing onboard revenue as a way to enhance revenue beyond traditional cabin ticket sales. Between 2013 and 2019, onboard spend on the three largest cruise operators we serve increased by $2.6 billion, from $6.5 billion to $9.1 billion. We are focused on collaborating with cruise line partners to increase passenger penetration and maximize revenue yield through the following initiatives:
 
•Increase Pre-Booking and Pre-Payment Capture Rate —We are working with our cruise line partners to expand our marketing efforts to engage guests upon booking their vacation experience, well before boarding a ship, through pre-booking. Pre-booked appointments can yield approximately 30% more revenue than services booked onboard the ship. Due to our success across select cruise lines that have implemented pre-booking capabilities, we are in the process of implementing pre-booking across additional partner cruise lines.
 •Expand Targeted Marketing and Promotion Initiatives —We are now directly marketing and distributing promotions to onboard passengers as a result of enhanced collaboration with select cruise line partners. These promotions are personalized and individually tailored to guests’ profiles and have successfully driven traffic and revenue at our health and wellness centers. Examples include “happy anniversary” messages to couples, “happy birthday” notes to individual guests, and promotional retail credits offered to guests who visit our centers before the end of their cruise. Guests that received these customized promotions were responsible for approximately 11% of revenues generated during the year ended December 31, 2022.


•Utilize Technology to Increase Utilization and Enhance Service Mix —We have recently begun to successfully introduce and expand technology-enabled dynamic pricing initiatives with selected cruise line partners. While dynamic pricing strategies have historically been applied manually by onboard staff, we are currently rolling out online and pre-cruise access to drive off-peak utilization rates and fill higher-demand time slots with higher-value bookings. This enhanced dynamic pricing capability is currently available with only a few cruise line partners, representing a significant opportunity for revenue growth as it is rolled out and optimized fleet-wide.
 •Extend Retail Beyond the Ship —Our Shop & Ship program provides guests the ability to buy retail products onboard and have products shipped directly to their home to avoid the hassle of packing products in their luggage. On average, a Shop & Ship customer spends more than 3.5x the amount of a non-Shop & Ship customer on retail products. The Shop & Ship program, combined with our e-commerce platform timetospa.com, gives us the ability to maintain a connection with each guest beyond the cruise voyage.
 Health and Wellness Services
 
We curate and deliver an ever-innovating broad range of offerings for our cruise line and destination resort partners, centered around a holistic wellness approach, which includes:
 •Spa and Beauty. We offer a specialized suite of massage and body care services and therapies, together with a broad range of beauty treatments, including facials, hair cutting and styling, manicures and pedicures, and teeth whitening services, among other services custom-designed for our cruise line and destination resort partners.
 •Thermal suites. We offer guests the option to purchase passes for dedicated thermal suite areas on many of the ships where we operate health and wellness centers. Thermal suites are typically located on higher decks and offer sweeping views of the ocean, enabling our guests to relax, recharge, and enjoy various hot and cold hydro-therapies and related amenities, such as thermal loungers, infrared saunas, snow rooms, laconiums (dry heat saunas), caldarium chambers (herbal steam rooms), and hammams (Turkish-style steam rooms). Certain thermal suites also offer cold plunge pools, large therapeutic jacuzzis, and rooms surrounding occupants with layers of body cleansing salt crystals.
 •Medi-spa. We offer medi-spa services on the majority of our ships. Our service menu consists of the leading medi-spa brands, including BOTOX Cosmetic, Dysport, Restylane, CoolSculpting, Thermage, dermal fillers, and microneedling, among others. Medi-spa services are administered by medically licensed professionals. By the end of 2023, we expect to offer medi-spa services on 134 ships.
 •Fitness. We offer guests use of premier fitness centers, featuring industry leading brands, programming and equipment, as well as personalized training services and expert consultation by our fitness professionals. These fitness centers offer guests use of strength equipment and cardiovascular equipment, such as treadmills, elliptical machines, exercise bicycles and rowing and stair machines featuring premier brands including Technogym®, Life Fitness, Peloton and TRX®. Boutique fitness classes, including yoga, Pilates, F45 Training, certain Xponential Fitness brands, and indoor cycling are also available to guests for a fee or at no charge, depending on the class. Our fitness instructors are available to provide paid services, such as body composition analysis and personal training.
 •Nutrition. We offer guests paid personal nutritional and dietary consultation, weight management, nutrition coaching and detoxification. Guests can begin a program on the cruise or at certain of our land-based health and wellness centers and remain engaged with our professional coaches through the successful completion of their programs, generating ongoing purchases of nutritional and detoxification products via our e-commerce platform timetospa.com.
 •Health. Our health and pain management offerings present one of our largest and most profitable categories. Our offerings include acupuncture, electro acupuncture, cupping, posture and gait analysis, GoodFeet Arch Supports, physical therapy, and NormaTec® recovery. Our services are enhanced by our retail sale of our product offerings associated with the services.
 •Mind-Body and Wellness. We offer our guests yoga, Tai Chi and sound therapy in addition to meditation and biofeedback.
 Products
 
We sell over 1,100 branded product SKUs sourced from over 75 vendors due to our scale, superior operations, industry longevity and attractive captive audience at sea and on land. We sell products from leading brands, including ELEMIS, Thermage,

Dysport, GoodFeet Arch Supports and GO SMILE Teeth Whitening. We have an exclusive 10-year supply agreement with ELEMIS. We believe we have a leading retail attachment rate based on the number of products purchased in conjunction with a service compared to the broader consumer personal care services and retail industry. During 2022, product sales comprised approximately 18% of our revenues, enabling incremental revenue even at full treatment room utilization.
 
We utilize three warehouses, consisting of one 27,000 square foot bonded warehouse in Miami, FL, one 21,600 square foot warehouse in Miami, FL, and one 5,000 square foot warehouse in New Jersey. The Miami warehouses provide fulfillment services for cruise inventory, and the New Jersey warehouse provides fulfillment for e-commerce and our Shop & Ship program.
 
Health and Wellness Centers
 As of December 31, 2022, we operated state-of-the-art health and wellness centers on 179 ships, including virtually all of the major cruise lines globally, and 50 land-based destination resorts, principally in the United States, the Caribbean and Asia. Centers are designed and branded for each cruise and destination resort partner to optimize the guest experience, maximize revenues and align with our partners’ brands and hospitality environment. Centers can range in size to more than 30,000 square feet and generally provide fitness areas, treatment rooms and salons, as well as elaborate thermal suites and/or saunas. Onboard heath and wellness centers are generally located on higher ship decks, which encourages increased passenger interest and guest traffic.
Facility Design
 
Our cruise line and destination resort partners each seek differentiated health and wellness experiences for their guests. As such, we provide design capabilities for our cruise line and destination resort partners, creating bespoke branding and design consulting to optimize guest experiences and maximize revenues. We operate health and wellness centers under proprietary brands of Mandara® and Chavana®, as well as brands curated specifically for each cruise line, complete with cruise line and/or ship-specific service menus. As of December 31, 2022, we had 36 health and wellness centers under the Mandara brand, eight centers under the Chavana brand, and one center under our destination resort health and wellness brand, “Glow ®, a Mandara Spa.”
Principal Cruise Line Customers
 A significant portion of our revenue is generated from the following cruise lines, each of which accounted for more than 10% of our total revenues in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively: Carnival (including Carnival, Carnival Australia, Costa, Cunard, Holland America, P&O, Princess, and Seabourn cruise lines): 41.0%, 43.4%, and 46.7%, Royal Caribbean (including Royal Caribbean, Celebrity Cruises, Pullmantur, Azamara and Silversea cruise lines): 28.0%, 20.9%, and 23.1%, and Norwegian Cruise Line (including Norwegian Cruise Line, Oceania Cruises and Regent Seven Seas Cruises): 15.6%, 16.3%, and 14.7%. These companies, combined, accounted for 160 of the 179 ships served by OneSpaWorld as of December 31, 2022. Our contracts are signed at the cruise line-level, not with the parent operator, giving OneSpaWorld a diverse customer base despite parent-level consolidation. Our contracts average five years in duration.

 Cruise Line and Destination Resort Agreements
 
Through our cruise line and destination resort agreements, we have the exclusive right to offer health, fitness, beauty and wellness services and the ability to sell complementary products onboard the ships and at the destination resorts we serve. Under the cruise line agreements, guests pay for our services through our cruise line partners, who retain a specified percentage of gross receipts from such sales before remitting the remainder to us. Our revenue share agreements result in a highly variable cost model, where the primary fixed costs are the meals and accommodations for our shipboard employees. Most of our cruise line agreements cover all of the then-operating ships of a cruise line and typically new ships are added to ships in service through an amendment to the agreement. The agreements have specified terms ranging from three to 9.4 years, with an average remaining term per ship of approximately 3.7 years as of December 31, 2022. Cruise lines can terminate the agreements with limited or no advance notice under certain circumstances, including, among other things, the withdrawal of a ship from the cruise trade, the sale or lease of a ship, or our failure to achieve specified passenger service standards. However, we have never had a contract terminated prior to our respective expiration date.
 
We operate our destination resort health and wellness centers pursuant to agreements with the owners of the properties involved. Our destination resort health and wellness centers generally are required to pay rent based on a percentage of our revenues, with others having fixed rents. Some of our destination resort agreements also require that we make minimum rental payments irrespective of the amount of our revenues. The terms of the agreements for our destination resort health and wellness centers generally range from five to 20 years (including the terms of renewals available at our option). In the U.S. and Caribbean, destination resort health and wellness centers generally have a higher investment cost and lower revenue share with higher staff costs and contracts lasting ten years on average. In Asia, destination resort health and wellness centers have lower investment cost, higher revenue share, lower staff costs, and contracts averaging five years.
 
Marketing and Promotion
 
We promote our services and products to cruise passengers and destination resort guests through targeted marketing, including pre-and post-cruise emails, website advertising, on-site demonstrations and seminars, video presentations shown on in-cabin/in-room television, ship newsletters, tours of our centers, and dedicated signage around the ship. We also encourage our employees to cross-sell, as they believe that such cross-promotional activities frequently result in our customers purchasing services and/or products in addition to those they initially contemplated buying. For example, we cross-sell our fitness body assessment with detox programs, vitamins, and seaweed wraps. We also maintain a dedicated sales desk to facilitate pre-cruise health and wellness services booking and to disseminate health and wellness information for charters and other groups of cruise passengers.
 

Recent collaborative initiatives with cruise line partners have proven to enhance performance across certain key performance indicators. We have developed a fully integrated pre-booking platform, which allows guests to book health and wellness treatments six to eight weeks prior to the voyage. Pre-booked and pre-paid guests on average spend approximately 30% more than guests who book services once already onboard. We recently introduced a new pricing strategy, simplifying the choice architecture for our guests while continuing to make price adjustments across multiple areas within our spas. Guests have responded positively, resulting in an increased service spend coupled with a higher frequency of longer treatments booked, and a shift toward booking relatively more premium and signature services. We have begun rolling out our dynamic pricing model to our full cruise fleet, which provides the ability to optimize demand and maximize utilization of our health and wellness centers. We continually monitor the results of our marketing efforts and adjust our strategies in order to use our marketing resources in a cost-effective manner.
 Competition
 
On cruise ships, we compete with passenger activity alternatives for onboard passenger dollars. We also compete with other maritime wellness facility providers, including cruise lines that insource the activity, as well as potential other outsource providers. Across the destination resorts business, we compete with other outsource providers of health, fitness, beauty and wellness services to hotel and destination resort operators. The destination resorts business is highly fragmented, and there is no one leader within this category.
Seasonality
 
A significant portion of our revenues are generated onboard cruise ships and are subject to specific individual cruise itineraries as to time of year and geographic location, among other factors. As a result, we experience varying degrees of seasonality as the demand for cruises is stronger in the Northern Hemisphere during the summer months and during holidays. Accordingly, the third quarter and holiday periods generally result in the highest revenue yields for us. Further, cruises and destination resorts have been negatively affected by the frequency and intensity of hurricanes, which may be impacted by climate change. The negative impact of hurricanes in the Northern Hemisphere is highest during peak hurricane season from August to October.
Trademarks
 
We hold or control numerous trademarks in the United States and a number of other countries. Our most recognized health and wellness products and services trademarks are for Mandara and Chavana. We believe that the use of our trademarks is important in establishing and maintaining our reputation for providing high quality health and wellness services, as well as cosmetic goods, and we are committed to protecting these trademarks by all appropriate legal means.
 
Registrations for the OneSpaWorld, Mandara and Chavana trademarks, among others, have been obtained in a number of countries throughout the world. We continue to apply for other trademark registrations in various countries.
 While a number of the trademarks we use have been registered in the United States and other countries, the registrations of other trademarks that we use are pending. Recently, we have adopted the mark “OneSpaWorld” as the trade name of our maritime health and wellness business to reflect our position as a global provider of shipboard products and services.
 We license “Mandara” for use by luxury destination resorts in certain Asian countries.
 Sustainability and Social Responsibility
 We strive daily to effect a positive impact on the environment and the lives of our employees, our guests, and the people and cultures of the communities we visit, where we operate, and where we call home. In so doing, we seek to create long-term value for our crise line and destination resort partners and our shareholders.
 How we manage our impact on the environment and the communities where we operate, our relationships with all constituencies across our business, and the accountability of our leadership to our employees and our shareholders are all critically important to the success of our business. Our strategic priorities to achieve these objectives include programs to incorporate sustainability practices into all elements of our business, assure a respectful and equitable workplace fostering broad employee diversity and inclusive opportunity, enhance employee support and personal and career development, strengthen data privacy and cybersecurity, and invest in our communities, including by supporting local organizations and programs that align with our values of wellness, diversity, and sustainability. Our Board of Directors is responsible for guiding management to achieve these objectives and for supervising and promoting these initiatives toward effecting the long-term sustainable growth of the Company.

With respect to environmental matters, we collaborate with our third-party product suppliers to introduce improved packaging solutions to reduce environmental impact. We implement sustainability strategies to reduce paper usage and plastic containers, recycle materials used in the workplace, utilize light sensors to reduce electricity consumption, and require changes to packaging materials from polystyrene to recyclable pillow packs, among other initiatives.
With respect to our employees, we recruit and invest in retaining and advancing individuals with diverse demographic and socioeconomic backgrounds, experiences, and talents, prioritizing their personal and professional development and their health and safety in our shipboard and land-based facilities. See “Human Capital,” below, for further description of our social responsibility objectives and initiatives.
 With respect to governance, we maintain policies intended to assure ethical trading, confidential and non-public personal information, anti-fraud, anti-corruption, third party risk management, trade control compliance, data transfers, internal auditing services, global privacy, and global regulatory compliance, among others.
 Our Board of Directors directly oversees procedures and corporate culture promoting and upholding the ethical conduct of the Company’s business, including adopting and monitoring compliance with the Company’s Code of Ethics, which sets forth the Company’s policies of promoting high standards of integrity by and toward our employees. The Compensation Committee of our Board is responsible for advising the Board with respect to the compensation philosophy, policies, and procedures pertaining to our employees, in order to attract, retain and motivate the most talented personnel. The Audit Committee of our Board is responsible for establishing procedures for identifying and fully addressing employee complaints and concerns through the Company’s Ethics Hotline and otherwise. The Nominating and Governance Committee of our Board is responsible for developing, recommending to the Board, and reviewing on an ongoing basis the Company’s social responsibility and sustainability policies, as well as reviewing and recommending to the Board enhancements to the Company’s Code of Ethics.
Human Capital
 As a pre-eminent global operator of health and wellness services, our people are essential to our operations and core to the long-term success of our Company. Our employees are responsible for upholding our purpose, integrity, and accountability, and representing OneSpaWorld’s mission and values as a global health and wellness company. To attract, retain, motivate and advance the best talent, we strive to embed a culture where employees can safely thrive in an environment supportive of their unique personalities, boundaries, talents, passions, strengths, challenges, responsibilities, and personal and career goals.
 •Our People. As a Company that provides health and wellness services and products, our employees are the bedrock of our cruise and resort guest experience. As of December 31, 2022, we had a total of 4,452 full-time employees, of which 3,415 worked in health and wellness center operations on cruise ships and in destination resorts around the world, 976 represented corporate management and operational support staff, and 61 were involved in recruiting and training. We have one general manager in each cruise ship and destination resort health and wellness center, typically an assistant manager training to become a general manager, and up to 79 total staff depending on the scale of the health and wellness center. As a global operation, we have diverse teams of employees representative of the partners and markets we serve and in which we operate. We believe our employee relationships are strong across our business, as evidenced by the promotion of 100% of our health and wellness center general managers to their roles, an average tenure of nine years for employees at our Coral Gables office, and 20-30 year tenures of our senior leaders, many of whom started with the Company as shipboard health and wellness center team members and advanced to positions at our Coral Gables office and London Wellness Academy. 
 •Culture and Ethics. Culture of ethical behavior is at the forefront of our organization, binding our values and mission across every aspect of our business. We have instituted best practices to ensure that we continue to operate to the highest standards, including requiring all our employees to familiarize themselves during the training with, and adhere strictly to, our Code of Ethics and our corporate social responsibility and sustainability policies.
 •Diversity & Inclusion. Our Company achieves success by recruiting, training, supporting and resourcing our employees from diverse global populations, so as to best serve our cruise line and destination resort partners' diverse global customer base. We maintain an unwavering commitment to diversity and inclusion among our staff. OneSpaWorld is an equal opportunity employer, and we promote and celebrate diversity and inclusion in the workplace. Our employees are sourced globally and represent 88 nationalities, speaking 27 languages. In addition, at our corporate offices in the U.S. and U.K. and our North America health and 


wellness centers, our employee base is comprised of eight distinct ethnicities. As of December 31, 2022, our employees had the following attributes:


 | Female | | Male
Employees (non-management) | | 3,374 | | 728
Manager Staff | 256 | | 66 
Senior Management | 11 | | 14 
Executive Officers | | | 


We educate employees, managers, and leadership on our essential objectives, strategies and initiatives to achieve broad diversity and inclusion across every element of our business. Among other initiatives, we provide annual trainings for all of our employees to assure awareness and adherence to our policies, practices, and procedures toward effecting a culture of civility, harassment prevention, reporting and intervention in all respects, and a fully respectful workplace.
•Talent Attraction. Our success depends on our ability to recruit and train employees skilled in our customer service philosophy. We recruit prospective shipboard health and wellness center employees from a broad spectrum of geographies providing a pipeline of diverse talent from a wide range of demographics and economies. We are proud to bring valuable long-term employment and career opportunities to individuals residing and supporting families in major economies such as Australia, the British Isles, Canada, continental Europe, India, Indonesia, Mauritius, the Philippines, South Africa, South America, and Thailand, as well as smaller, less developed employment markets such as Bhutan, the Caribbean, Madagascar, Nepal, Nigeria, Ukraine, Zambia, and Zimbabwe, among others. We advertise U.S. corporate and destination resort health and wellness center positions on a human resources applicant tracking system, which provides visibility toward all applicants, including diverse candidates. 
 Countries from which we recruited personnel during 2022 are highlighted in blue on the map below.


•Talent Retention: Compensation and Benefits. We strive to provide competitive pay and benefits for our employees. 
 Shipboard health and wellness center employees typically are employed under nine month-long agreements with fixed terms. Our compensation structure includes commissions received in connection with the provision of services and sales of products in our health and wellness centers. We make available to all our shipboard employees comprehensive health and dental care, free of charge during the terms of their employment agreements, as well as long-term disability and accidental death coverage, among other benefits. We provide transportation for our shipboard employees to and from their home countries. Our shipboard employees and their families and friends enjoy discounts on the services and products we offer for sale, as well as personalized fitness and wellness programs. We have continuously improved staff retention, resulting in a more experienced staff across our fleet.
Our U.S. corporate and destination resort health and wellness center employees are eligible to receive Company sponsored benefits, including medical, dental and vision insurance coverage, 401(k) retirement plan participation, personal short and long-term disability, critical illness coverage, flexible spending accounts, basic life insurance and basic accidental death and dismemberment coverage, medical indemnity, and off the job accident insurance, as well as family member life insurance and accidental death and dismemberment coverage. We also provide an employee assistance program free of charge to our employees and members of their households, offering face-to-face mental health counseling sessions with a local provider, legal assistance, financial consultations, resources and referrals for childcare assistance and adoption, eldercare, pet care, and consultations with fraud resolution specialists intended to prevent identity theft.
 •Training and Development. Our business proactively innovates to serve the ever-changing needs and desires of our cruise line and destination resort partners and their guests. To do so, we arm our employees with best-in-class training and development in emerging areas of health and wellness and encourage all of our employees to apply a mindset of innovation. We also operate in areas that are subject to regulation and licensing. To respond to these challenges, we have developed extensive training and licensing practices. Our efforts include training at our London Wellness Academy and our satellite training facilities in India, South Africa and the Philippines, ranging from two to six weeks depending on the profession and modality of each employee, onboard training for certain of our shipboard employees, and management training courses at our Coral Gables office. All our employees are required to complete sexual harassment training, and our shipboard employees also complete health and safety training upon boarding the vessels on which they serve. Certain shipboard employees also complete additional training on safe practices in providing our services, and training on cleaning and sanitization of our equipment and spa facilities. Our employees also receive training using our comprehensive manual entitled “Guidelines for Protection and Sanitization,” or “GPS,” prior to returning to work. 
 We train, support, and encourage our employees to progress through roles of increasing responsibility within our corporate structure during their tenures by providing numerous opportunities for development and training support. Most senior corporate positions are served by employees who began their careers as members of our shipboard health and wellness center teams. In our

offices, employees receive annual career development training through the Company’s state of the art learning management system featuring subject-specific learning modules relevant to our globally complex operations and diverse organization. Sustainability objectives are infused into our employee training and development curriculum and execution via eLearning modules for our shipboard staff, to limit our carbon footprint associated with the impact of in-person training. Our eLearning modules have also been an important component of our efforts to safely train our staff in a remote manner since the commencement of the COVID-19 pandemic.
•Health and Safety. The health and safety of our employees is our highest priority. Upon the commencement of the COVID-19 pandemic, we conceived and implemented initiatives to mitigate risks to our employees. During the first and second quarters of 2020, in response to the near cessation of our operations due to COVID-19, we devised and implemented immediate and ongoing actions to mitigate the extraordinary and unprecedented adverse impact of the pandemic on our personnel. Our initiatives included coordinating with our cruise line partners to assure repatriating safely all of our 3,220 shipboard personnel to their families and homes around the world. 
 •Succession Planning. The success of our business relies on the devoted and experienced leadership of our cruise ship and destination resort health and wellness center managers and our corporate leaders, both senior executives and operational managers. We continually strive to foster the personal and professional development of managers throughout the organization. As a result, as discussed under “Our People,” above, we have developed a strong group of leaders with lengthy tenures. The performance of our senior management team members is subject to ongoing monitoring and evaluation, intended to ensure efficient identification of potential successors and smooth transitions within the team. 
 Government Regulation
 
Our business is subject to certain international, U.S. federal, state and local laws, and regulations and policies in jurisdictions in which we operate.
