Item 1. | Business
--------+---------

General 
 
FutureFuel Corp. (sometimes referred to as the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our,” and includes our wholly owned subsidiaries) is a Delaware corporation, and, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, FutureFuel Chemical Company, manufactures diversified chemical products, bio-based fuel products, and bio-based specialty chemical products. Unless otherwise stated, all dollar amounts other than per share amounts are in thousands.
 
We are headquartered in St. Louis, Missouri, and our manufacturing operations are conducted at our facility in Batesville, Arkansas. Trading of our common stock on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) commenced on March 23, 2011 under the symbol “FF”.
 
During 2022, we distributed normal quarterly cash dividends of $0.06 per share. Additionally, we have declared normal quarterly cash dividends of $0.06 per share on our common stock for the calendar year 2023.
 
Our business is managed in two segments: chemicals and biofuels. The chemicals segment manufactures a diversified listing of chemical products that are sold to third party customers. The majority of the revenues from the chemicals segment are derived from the custom manufacturing of specialty chemicals for specific customers. We have actively worked to develop our chemicals business with new customers in more diversified growth markets. As part of that focus on growth, we have introduced procedural updates to our operation to allow re-entry to the pharma intermediates market and this capability has been validated by third party audits. Our chemicals business is based on a solid reputation as a technology-driven, highly reliable, and globally competitive chemicals producer. We retain a strong emphasis on operational excellence, cost control, and efficiency improvements to enable us to compete in the worldwide chemical industry.
 
With respect to our biofuels segment, our plant has a demonstrated capacity near 59 million gallons per year (“MMgy”) with almost 50 MMgy produced during 2022. This scale and the design of our plant in Batesville allows us to process a wide variety of feedstocks and continuously achieve high biodiesel yields. Combined with the synergies of operating a shared chemical manufacturing facility, this has allowed us to be consistently successful in a highly competitive market.
 
As the market has adapted to the supply chain and logistical impacts of COVID-19, first felt in the spring of 2020 we have remained alert to those conditions to ensure that we maintain the appropriate operating margins for every element of our business. As markets continue to evolve, we will remain agile and flexible in responding to new situations as they develop.

Narrative Description of Our Business 
 
Principal Executive Offices
 
Our principal executive offices are located at 8235 Forsyth Blvd., 4th Floor, Clayton, Missouri 63105. Our telephone number is (314) 854-8352. FutureFuel Chemical Company’s principal executive offices are located at 2800 Gap Road, Highway 394 South, Batesville, Arkansas 72501-9680. Its telephone number is (870) 698-3000.
Plant Location
 
We own approximately 2,200 acres of land six miles southeast of Batesville in north central Arkansas fronting the White River. Approximately 500 acres of the site are occupied with batch and continuous manufacturing facilities, laboratories, and associated infrastructure, including on-site liquid waste treatment. Land and infrastructure are available to support expansion and business growth.
Operations
 
For the year ended December 31, 2022, approximately 80% of our revenue was derived from biofuels, 14% from manufacturing specialty chemicals for specific customers (“custom manufacturing”), and 6% of revenues from multi-customer specialty chemicals (“performance chemicals”).
 
Our biofuels business segment primarily involves the production and sale of biodiesel and petrodiesel blends.  Our custom chemicals manufacturing involves producing unique products for strategic customers, generally under long-term contracts. The custom chemicals manufacturing portfolio includes biocides intermediates, specialty polymers, dyes, stabilizers, oil and gas, and chemicals intermediates. Our performance chemicals product portfolio includes polymer modifiers that enhance stain resistance and dye-ability to nylon and polyester fibers, in addition to several small-volume specialty chemicals and solvents for diverse applications.
 
We are committed to growing and adapting our biofuels and chemicals businesses. For the biofuels business segment, we will continue to leverage our technical capabilities and quality certifications, secure local and regional markets, and expand marketing efforts to fleets and regional/national customers. For our chemicals segment, we intend to pursue development and commercialization of new products, including building block chemicals and intermediate chemicals requiring Good Manufacturing Practices (“GMP”). GMP is a recognized and auditable system ensuring products are produced consistently and controlled according to strict quality standards. It covers all aspects of manufacturing, facilities, equipment, and training utilizing detailed written procedures affecting the quality and consistency of the finished product. GMP complements the Company’s current and active quality registrations, including ISO 9001 and BQ9000, and will benefit our custom chemicals business. GMP will open growth opportunities for the Company to serve customers active in the pharmaceutical intermediates, food ingredients, and other fine chemicals segment. While pursuing this strategy, we will continue our efforts to establish a name identity for both segments.
 
Biofuels Business Segment
 
Biofuel Products
 
Our biofuels business segment began in 2005 and primarily includes the production and sale of biodiesel. In addition, we sell petrodiesel in blends with our biodiesel and, from time to time, with no biodiesel added.
 
Biodiesel is a renewable energy product consisting of mono-alkyl esters of fatty acids. The mono-alkyl esters are typically produced from vegetable oil, fat, or grease feedstocks. Biodiesel is used primarily as a blend with petrodiesel (usually 5% (commonly referenced as “B5”) to 20% (commonly referenced as “B20”) by volume). A major advantage of biodiesel is that it can be used in most existing diesel engines and fuel injection equipment in blends up to B20 with no material impact to engine performance. In 1998, Congress approved the use of biodiesel as an Energy Policy Act compliance strategy, which allowed federal, state, and public fleets covered by this Act to meet their alternative fuel vehicle purchase requirements by simply buying biodiesel and burning it in new or existing diesel vehicles in a minimum B20 blend. Finally, biodiesel also benefits from favorable properties compared to petrodiesel (e.g., negligible sulfur content, lower particulate matter, lower greenhouse gas emissions, and a higher cetane number leading to better engine performance and lubrication). See https://afdc.energy.gov/files/pdfs/30882.pdf.

Our technical and operational competency acquired as a supplier of specialty chemicals, inclusive of research and development and analytical laboratory testing, enabled the development of a flexible manufacturing process. Our process can use a broad range of feedstock oils, including, but not limited to, soy oil, cottonseed oil, pork lard, poultry fat, inedible corn oil, yellow grease, inedible tallow, choice white grease, used cooking oil, and beef tallow. Our Batesville plant produces biodiesel, which is sometimes referenced as “B100.” A biodiesel blend is currently used in the facility’s diesel fleet. We offer B100 and biodiesel blended with petrodiesel (B2, B5, B10, B20, B50, and B99 blends) at our Batesville facility and at a short-term leased storage facility in Little Rock, Arkansas. In addition, we deliver blended product to a small group of customers within our region.
 
Biodiesel Production/Capacity
 
While biodiesel can be made from various renewable sources, the choice of feedstock to be used at any particular facility is determined primarily by the price and availability of each feedstock variety, the yield of biodiesel achieved from that feedstock, and the capabilities of the producer’s biodiesel production facility. In addition, the chemical properties of the biodiesel (e.g., cloud point, pour point, and cetane number) depend on the type of feedstock. See EIA, Monthly Biodiesel Production Report, http://www.eia.gov/biofuels/biodiesel/production/biodiesel.pdf.
 
In the United States, the majority of biodiesel historically has been made from domestically produced crude soybean oil due to its widespread availability and ease of processing. Since we started our biodiesel production, the cost of crude soybean oil has increased due in part to its use in biodiesel production and competing food demands. As a result, the biodiesel feedstock market in the United States transitioned from this expensive first-generation soy feedstock to alternative second-generation lower-cost, non-food feedstocks, such as waste vegetable oil, tallow, and inedible corn oil. However, these second-generation feedstocks increased substantially in price as they are also used to produce renewable diesel which often commands a higher margin due to typically lower variable operating costs and its ability to be used as a direct substitute for petrodiesel. Our continuous production line produces biodiesel from these second-generation lower-cost feedstocks with high-free fatty acids and has demonstrated a biodiesel production capacity in excess of 58 MMgy.
 
Legislative Incentives
 
Biodiesel production and use in the United States continues to be heavily influenced in large part by legislative initiatives at both the federal and state levels.
Federal Renewable Fuels Mandate
 
The largest incentive program at this time is the federal mandate enacted by Congress as part of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (the “2005 Act”). The 2005 Act included several provisions intended to spur the production and use of biodiesel. In particular, the 2005 Act’s provisions included biodiesel as part of the minimum volume (i.e., a mandate) of renewable fuels (the “renewable fuels standard” or “RFS”) to be included in the nationwide gasoline and diesel pool. The volume increased each year, from 4 billion gallons per year in 2006 to 16.55 billion gallons per year in 2013. The 2005 Act required the Environmental Protection Agency (the “USEPA”) to publish “renewable fuel obligations” applicable to refiners, blenders, and importers in the contiguous 48 states. The renewable fuel obligations are expressed in terms of a volume percentage of gasoline sold or introduced into commerce and consist of a single applicable percentage that applies to all categories of refiners, blenders, and importers. The renewable fuel obligations are based on estimates that the Energy Information Association provides to the USEPA on the volumes of gasoline it expects will be sold or introduced into commerce. The USEPA released the final rules to implement the RFS on April 10, 2007. Under those rules, the RFS compliance period began on September 1, 2007. No differentiation was made among the various types of renewable fuels (e.g., biodiesel or ethanol).
 
  3 

  

On December 19, 2007, the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (the “2007 Act”) was enacted which, among other things, expanded the RFS (“RFS2”). Prior to the enactment of the 2007 Act, the RFS requirement was mostly filled by ethanol. In contrast to the 2005 Act, the 2007 Act provided a renewable fuel standard carve-out specifically applicable to biodiesel. On July 1, 2010, RFS2’s biodiesel requirement became effective, thus requiring that a certain percentage of the diesel fuel consumed in the United States be made from renewable sources. The biomass-based diesel mandate rose annually and reached 2.43 billion gallons per year in 2021. On June 3, 2022, USEPA finalized a package of actions setting biofuel volumes for the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) program for years 2020, 2021, and 2022, and introducing regulatory changes intended to enhance the program’s objectives, reducing previously finalized volumes for 2020 and 2021.  The reduction is based on significant and unanticipated events such as COVID.
 
The following table shows the finalized volume requirements by the USEPA with a modest growth rate in biomass-based diesel.
 

 | Renewable Fuel Volumes* | 
---------------------------------------+-------------------------+------
 | 2021 | | 2022 | | 2023 | **
Cellulosic biofuel (million gallons) | | 560 | | 630 | | | 720

Federal Blenders’ and Producers’ Credits
 
Biodiesel tax incentives have been provided through various federal statutes, including the 2005 Act and the American Jobs Creation Act, and later, the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008. The most important of these is the one dollar per gallon Blenders' Tax Credit (“BTC”) applicable to all biodiesel. This credit has lapsed and been reinstated numerous times over the last decade. The BTC was not in place during 2012, 2014, 2015, 2018, and the majority of 2019. For each of these years, the BTC was retroactively reinstated. The longest period of retroactive reinstatement was in late December 2019 which reinstated the credit for 2018 through December 31, 2022. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 extended the credit through December 31, 2024.
 
Like the BTC, the small agri-biodiesel credit was not in place for the majority of 2019. The small agri-biodiesel credit provides for an annual tax incentive in the amount of $0.10 per gallon on the first 15 million gallons of qualified agri-biodiesel produced. In late December 2019, the small agri-biodiesel credit was retroactively reinstated from its expiry on January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2022 and was also extended to December 31, 2024 by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.
 
State Incentives
 
Our review of state statutes reveals that virtually all states provide user or producer incentives for biodiesel, several states provide both types of incentives, and more than 35 states provide incentives to biodiesel producers to build facilities in their states, typically offering tax credits, grants, and other financial incentives. We also are registered in the states of California and Oregon fuel programs, which incentivize the use of low carbon fuels specific to biomass-based diesel. Washington is in the process of implementing a similar program. As we expand our business, we will assess these and other state incentives and determine if we qualify. We will also stay abreast of regulations and update registrations if eligible.
Summary
 
We will continue to identify and pursue other legislative incentives to support our business. However, no assurances can be given that we will qualify for any such incentives or, if we do qualify, what the amount of such incentives will be or whether such incentives will continue to be available.

Quality 
 
For quality specification purposes, and to qualify for the federal mandate, biodiesel must meet the requirements of American Society for Testing and Materials (“ASTM”) D6751. This specification ensures that blends up to B20 are compatible with diesel engines and associated fuel system hardware. See Status and Issues for Biodiesel in the United States, National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Theresa Alleman, Margo Melendez, and Wendy Dafoe et. al., Feb. 2015. All biodiesel manufactured at our Batesville plant is tested in on-site quality control laboratories and confirmed to meet, and typically exceed, the ASTM D6751 standard.
 
Commercially available biodiesels can contain small amounts of unreacted or partially reacted oils and fats as well as other minor impurities. The unreacted or partially reacted oils and fats are called glycerides. In rare instances, the glycerides and other minor components and impurities can clog engine filters. To address this issue, ASTM D6751 was amended in February 2012 to create two new grades of biodiesel. Grade No. 2 is essentially the specifications in effect before the amendment. Grade No. 1 provides for a maximum total monoglyceride content and a maximum cold soak filterability time and, in theory, would be used where the cloud point of No. 2 biodiesel does not provide adequate assurance of quality. Both grades of biodiesel qualify as “biodiesel” for purposes of the RFS2 mandate. The Company continues to operate under the most recently published version of ASTM D6751, Standard Specifications for Biodiesel Fuel Blend Stock (B100) for Middle Distillate Fuels. All biodiesel made in our continuous process meets the more stringent specifications for No. 1 biodiesel.
 
The U.S. biodiesel industry created the BQ-9000 program to address quality issues that arose during the early years of the industry. This program is run by the National Biodiesel Accreditation Committee, which is a cooperative and voluntary program for the accreditation of biodiesel producers and marketers. The program is a quality system-oriented program that includes standards for storage, sampling, testing, blending, shipping, distribution, and fuel management practices. Since the creation and adoption of the BQ-9000 program, the quality of biodiesel in the U.S. market has markedly improved. Our plant has operated as a BQ-9000 accredited production facility since 2006.
 
The ISO 9000 family of standards represents an international consensus on good quality management practices. It consists of standards and guidelines relating to quality management systems and related supporting standards. ISO 9001 provides a set of standardized requirements for a quality management system, regardless of what the user organization does, its size, or whether it is in the private or public sector. It is the only international standard against which organizations can be certified, although certification is not a compulsory requirement of the standard. Our plant is an ISO 9001 accredited production facility for both chemicals and biofuels.
 
Renewable Identification Numbers
 
As noted above, the RFS2 mandates levels of various types of renewable fuels that are to be blended with U.S. gasoline and diesel fuel by U.S. refiners, blenders, and importers. Renewable Identification Numbers (“RINs”) are the mechanism for ensuring that the prescribed levels of blending are reached. As ethanol and biodiesel is produced or imported, the producer or importer has the responsibility to report the activity in the USEPA’s Moderated Transaction System (“EMTS”) where a series of numbers (i.e., a RIN) is assigned to their product. Assignment is made according to guidelines established by the USEPA. Currently, 1.5 RINs are assigned for each gallon of biodiesel produced. When biofuels change ownership to the refiners, importers, and blenders of the fuel, the RINs are also transferred. The RINs ultimately are separated from the renewable fuel generally at the time the renewable fuel is blended. The refiners, importers, and blenders generally use the RINs to establish that they have blended their applicable percentage of renewable fuels during the applicable reporting period. However, once the RINs are separated from the underlying biofuels (e.g., by blending the underlying biodiesel with petrodiesel), they can also be sold separate and apart from the underlying biofuels.
 
We generate RINs with our biodiesel. At times, we sell biodiesel with the RIN attached to the fuel. If we blend the biodiesel with petrodiesel in blends of B80 or less (e.g., B5 or B20), we can either sell the RINs with our blended biodiesel or we can sell them as a separate, free-standing instrument removed from the biodiesel. The decision of whether or not to separate the RINs from the blended biodiesel depends on the desires of the customer and market conditions for separated RINs, particularly, market prices. While biodiesel RINs continue to be traded through market makers, no assurances can be given that a separate market for RINs will be sustained or what value will be realized upon the sale of biodiesel RINs.

Byproducts 
 
Glycerin
 
A byproduct of the biodiesel process is crude glycerin, which is produced at the rate of approximately 10% by mass of the quantity of biodiesel produced. Our business produces both crude glycerin and refined glycerin for commercial sales. Crude glycerin is not suitable for most commercial applications due to high impurity levels and is sold into commercially viable uses for the crude product such as energy, agricultural and animal feed, and other applications not requiring high purity. The price of crude glycerin is impacted by supply and demand balance, energy prices, and prices for other commodities such as corn and soy.
 
Crude glycerin can be refined into a purer form and then used in higher value markets such as specialty chemical production, agricultural formulations, food, pharmaceutical, and/or cosmetic applications. We have added the capability to refine our crude glycerin to an industrial grade with higher value applications. Our business strives to maximize availability of the higher value refined glycerin based on refining capacity, product specifications, prices, and other market conditions.
 
Biodiesel Residue
 
An additional byproduct of the biodiesel production process is biodiesel distillation residue.  This is a relatively low-priced commodity that we aggregate and sell to multiple customers, primarily for use in Bunker C #6 Oil and as an asphalt release agent.
Biodiesel Production Capacity
 
According to Biodiesel Magazine (February 13, 2023) the United States had a total combined annual operational capacity of 2,266 million gallons from 60 biodiesel plants. See http://www.biodieselmagazine.com/plants/listplants/USA/. Operational plant capacity decreased more than 550 million gallons from 2020 as the renewable diesel market expanded (see Competition) and feedstock prices increased. We believe that the biodiesel industry will continue to be highly competitive given the excess capacity.
 
Customers and Markets 
 
Biodiesel and biodiesel blends are currently used in nearly all of the end markets where petrodiesel is used. Most biodiesel in the United States is consumed in the on-road diesel fuel market, although some is used for off-road purposes such as farming, residential/commercial heating oil, and power generation.
 
We currently market our biodiesel products by truck and rail directly to customers in the United States. We also have the capability to load through barge from a terminal in Little Rock, Arkansas. Through the utilization of liquid bulk storage facilities and barge loading capabilities, we are positioned to market biodiesel throughout the United States predominately for transportation. Although the regional market is still being developed, we estimate that the regional direct market available to us at maturity will be at least 30 million gallons per year.
 
For the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, two customers represented approximately 34% of biofuel revenue (27% of total revenue). For the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, three customers represented approximately 52% of biofuel revenue (41% of total revenue). For the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, one customer represented approximately 20% of biofuel revenue (12% of total revenue). We do not have long term contracts with any biofuels customer, but rather sell on the basis of monthly or short-term, multi-month purchase orders at prices based upon then-prevailing market rates. We do not believe that the loss of any of these customers would have a material adverse effect on our biofuels segment or on us as a whole in that: (i) biofuels are a commodity with a large potential customer base; (ii) we believe that we could readily sell biofuels to other customers; (iii) the prices we receive from these customers are based upon then-market rates; and (iv) our sales to the customers are not under fixed terms, and the customers have no obligation to purchase any minimum quantities except as stipulated by short term purchase orders.

Competition
 
Renewable diesel is a rapidly growing and competing biofuel with biodiesel. The Company uses a conventional process of transesterification of feedstocks fats, vegetable oils, or waste cooking oils to make biodiesel. Renewable diesel is produced via hydro-processing of the same feedstocks. Renewable diesel, unlike conventional biodiesel, meets the fuel specification requirements of ASTM D975 (petrodiesel fuel) and ASTM D396 (home heating oil) and can be used as a direct substitute without requiring the need for petrodiesel blending. As a result, renewable diesel trades at a premium price to conventional biodiesel based on fungibility with petrodiesel, better cold weather performance and generation of a higher number of RINS on a per gallon basis.
 
Renewable diesel operational capacity in the US is approximately 1,623 million gallons per year with that figure expected to increase significantly in the next five years. This total is significantly greater than current biodiesel feedstock consumption and will require an increase in the supply chain to meet that demand. That increase is presently being driven by price (feedstock prices have also increased significantly since the beginning of 2020); and the economic benefits in California under the Low Carbon Fuel Standard where almost all domestically produced and imported renewable diesel is sold and used. The future for biodiesel will be driven by feedstock availability; its market price compared to renewable diesel; and State and Federal regulations and incentives.
 
We also compete with other producers of biodiesel regionally, nationally, and with foreign imports. The principal methods of competition in the biodiesel industry are price, supply reliability, biodiesel quality, and RIN integrity, i.e., the degree of confidence the market maintains in the validity of a biodiesel producer’s RINs. The number of operational biodiesel plants has dropped significantly in the past three years, but these have tended to be smaller, simpler plants with limited access to feedstock. Additionally, we compete with numerous other smaller producers and emerging renewable diesel and cellulosic based biodiesel technologies.
 
We cannot give any assurances that renewable diesel fuel, green diesel, natural gas or some other product produced by these or similar competing technologies will not supplant biodiesel as an alternative to conventional petrodiesel. The manufacturing processes for biodiesel and renewable diesel are inherently different and it would not be economically feasible to retrofit the Company’s operation to produce renewable diesel.
 
The biodiesel industry also is in competition with the petroleum-based diesel fuel industry. The biodiesel industry is small relative to the size of the petroleum-based diesel fuel industry, and large petroleum companies have greater resources than we do. Without government incentives and requirements, it is uncertain how the market would react and what the consequent impact on processing economics would be.
 
Supply and Distribution
 
As a result of our feedstock-flexible process, we can source feedstock from a broad supplier base, which includes degummed soy oil, distilled corn oil producers, reclaimed used cooking oil, and pork, chicken, and beef rendering facilities from both national and regional suppliers. Crude corn oil has been sourced from several national and regional producers. All feedstocks are currently supplied by either rail or truck. As discussed in the previous section, sourcing supplies of economically attractive feedstocks is becoming increasingly competitive.
 
We sell biodiesel from our plant site as well as ship it to liquid bulk storage facilities for further distribution. Sales from our plant site are made by railcar and tank truck. Biodiesel is being delivered by Company-owned tank trucks and common carriers to a liquid bulk storage facility leased by us for distribution there and for further transportation by barge or tank truck.
 
  8 

  

Cyclicality and Seasonality
 
Biodiesel producers have historically experienced seasonal fluctuations in demand for biodiesel. Biodiesel demand has tended to be lower during the winter in northern and Midwestern states due to concerns about biodiesel’s ability to operate optimally in cold weather as compared to petrodiesel. This seasonal fluctuation has been strongest for biodiesel made from animal fats and used cooking oils. Biodiesel made from such feedstocks has a higher cloud point (which is the point at which a fuel begins to gel) than biodiesel produced from vegetable oils, such as soybean, canola, or crude corn oil. This higher cloud point may cause cold weather performance issues.
 
The mandate for biodiesel usage as established by RFS2 may interject an additional seasonal fluctuation in our biodiesel business. Once the mandate for a calendar year is met, or is anticipated to be met, demand for biodiesel may decrease.
 
Outlook for the Biodiesel Industry/Our Future Strategy 
 
The passage of the Inflation Reduction Act in August of 2022 extended the BTC through December 31, 2024. Large scale investment in large scale renewable diesel plants competing for the same feedstock pool will put significant pressure on small scale conventional biodiesel producers. We believe that producers who are proactive in responding to these changes can remain competitive and benefit in this emerging market. These responses include: new and improved technologies; alternative feedstocks with higher yields; production scalability and flexibility options; supply chain, distribution and co-location strategies; the sale of RINs separate from the underlying biodiesel; and innovative risk management strategies.
 
Our future strategy for our biofuels segment is geared towards these responses. Notwithstanding our future strategy, our continued production of biodiesel may be limited, in part, by our ability to source feedstock given competitive growing renewable diesel markets, or, in a worst-case scenario, eliminated entirely, in the event Congress eliminates the federal mandate of the RFS2. See “Risk Factors” beginning at page 15 below.
 
Chemicals Business Segment 
 
Overview of the Segment
 
Our chemicals segment manufactures diversified chemical products that are sold to third party customers. This segment comprises two components: “custom manufacturing” (manufacturing specialty chemicals for specific customers) and “performance chemicals” (multi-customer specialty chemicals).
Chemical Products
 
Custom manufacturing involves producing unique products for strategic customers, generally under multi-year or long-term contracts. Most of these products are produced under confidentiality agreements in order to protect each company’s intellectual property. This is a service-based business where customers value dependability, regulatory compliance, technical capabilities, responsiveness, product quality, process scale up and improvement, operational safety, and environmental protection. Our custom manufacturing products are manufactured by continuous production, dedicated batch or general-purpose batch mode depending on specific product and the volumes required. Management believes that we are a strategic production partner to our key and potential customers in this segment, and our sales, engineering and technology teams collaboratively work together with our customers to further develop the processes and drive continued improvement.
 
Our plant’s custom manufacturing product portfolio includes products that are used in the coatings, chemical intermediates, industrial and consumer cleaning, oil and gas, and specialty polymers industries. Historically, our custom manufacturing product portfolio was highly concentrated on two significant legacy products, namely a laundry detergent additive for a leading consumer products company and a proprietary row crop herbicide. The year 2021 marked the first full year that these legacy products were no longer sold. Our current custom manufacturing product portfolio is more diversified into multiple markets including agrochemicals, oilfield chemicals, industrial intermediates, and fabric care markets.
 
Performance chemicals comprise products which are generally available to the open market and sold to multiple customers.  These products are sold based upon specification and are intended for specific performance in the end-use application determined by the customer. This portfolio includes a family of polymer (nylon and polyester) modifiers, glycerin products, and several small-volume specialty chemicals and solvents for diverse applications. We have added the capability to refine our crude glycerin to an industrial grade of glycerin for higher value specialty chemical applications.

Future Strategy
 
We believe we have built a solid reputation as a safe, reliable, cost competitive, and technology-driven chemical producer. To further build on this reputation, we must continuously increase our focus on maintaining and adding customer relationship development, cost control, operational efficiency, capacity utilization, operational safety, and environmental protection to maximize earnings. We also believe that the ability to use large-scale batch and continuous production processes and a constant focus on process improvements allows us to compete effectively in the global custom manufacturing market and to remain cost competitive with, and for some products cost-advantaged over, our competitors. Furthermore, our site’s fully integrated infrastructure facilities, including utilities and waste treatment, provide us with an advantage over many of our competitors, and allow us to provide a complete package of custom manufacturing services. With GMP capabilities and ISO/BQ certifications, we strengthen our capabilities to grow our business further. We intend to improve margins in this area of our business by expansion of the customer base in additional market segments, careful management of product mix with regard to size of opportunity, timing to market, capital efficiency and matching of opportunities to assets and capabilities. We possess a core competency in chemical processing of bio-based feedstocks and expertise in specialty chemical synthesis and process development. We believe that this positions us favorably as a preferred manufacturer of custom chemicals and sustainable products in growing markets.
Customers and Markets
 
Our chemical products are used in a variety of markets and end uses, including detergent, agrochemical, automotive, oil and gas, coatings, nutrition, and polymer additives. Some of the chemical products can be cyclically driven by changes in energy and agricultural commodity prices. In the case of our custom manufacturing business, the customers are often the “brand owners” and, therefore, control factors related to demand, such as market development, patent expirations and external manufacturing strategy. In such cases, we may be unable to increase or maintain our level of sales revenue for these products.
 
No chemical customer represented greater than 10% of total sales revenue in 2022 or 2021.
 
Competition
 
Historically, there have been significant barriers to entry for competitors with respect to specialty chemicals, primarily due to the fact that the relevant technology and manufacturing capability has been held by a small number of companies. As technology and investment have increasingly moved outside of North America, competition from international multi-national chemical manufacturers has intensified, primarily from manufacturers in India and China. We compete with these and other producers primarily based on price, customer service, technology, quality, and reliability. Our major competitors in this segment include large multi-national companies with internal specialty chemical manufacturing divisions and smaller independent producers. The international multi-national competitors are often disadvantaged by poor responsiveness and customer service, while the small producers often have limited technology and financial resources. We believe that we are well positioned for growth due to the combination of our scale of operations, technical capabilities, reputation, and financial strength.
Supply and Distribution
 
Specialty chemicals are generally high unit value products sold in packaged, or low-volume bulk form, and for which distribution is a relatively minor component of cost. Most products are sold FOB the Batesville site for distribution globally. Similarly, raw materials for these products are comparatively higher-value components that are sourced globally. An exception is the biofuels co-products, which are recovered from local processing.

Cyclicality and Seasonality
 
Some of the chemical products can be cyclical, driven by changes in energy prices and agricultural commodity prices. For example, demand for chemical products sold into energy exploration and transportation markets is influenced by oil prices. The use of chemical products in agricultural markets likewise is influenced by agricultural commodity prices. Supply and demand dynamics determine profitability at different stages of cycles and global economic conditions affect the length of each cycle. Despite sensitivity to cyclicality in these industries, many of the products in the chemical segment provide stable earnings.
Backlog
 
The majority of our chemical revenue is derived from custom manufacturing agreements with specific customers. These customers generally provide us with forecasts of demand on a monthly or quarterly basis. These forecasts are intended to enable us to optimize the efficiency of our production processes and generally are not firm sales orders. As such, we do not monitor or report backlog.
Intellectual Property
 
We consider our intellectual property portfolio to be a valuable corporate asset, which we intend to expand and protect globally through a combination of trade secrets, confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements, patents, trademarks, and copyrights. As a producer of a broad and diverse portfolio of chemicals, our intellectual property relates to a wide variety of products and processes acquired through the development and manufacture of over 300 specialty chemicals during the history of the site. Our primary strategy regarding our intellectual property portfolio is to appropriately protect all innovations and know-how in order to provide our business segments with a technology-based competitive advantage wherever possible. In the chemicals business segment, custom manufacturing projects are primarily conducted within the framework of confidentiality agreements with each customer to ensure that intellectual property rights are defined and protected. In the biofuels business segment, innovations and process know-how are vigorously protected as appropriate.
 
As may be necessary, we will seek to license technologies from third parties that complement our strategic business objectives. Neither our business as a whole, nor any particular segment, is materially dependent upon any one particular patent, copyright, or trade secret. As the laws of many foreign countries do not protect intellectual property to the same extent as the laws of the United States, we can make no assurance that we will be able to adequately protect all of our intellectual property assets.
 
Research and Development
 
We devote considerable resources to our research and development programs, which are primarily targeted towards three objectives:
 

● | innovating, developing, and improving biofuels processes, in particular biodiesel and other biofuels, including value-up technology and applications for co-products;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | developing and improving processes for custom manufacturing products; and 
● | innovating, developing, and improving performance chemical products and manufacturing processes. 

 
Our research and development capabilities comprise analytical chemistry competencies to assay and characterize raw materials and products, organic chemistry expertise applied across a breadth of reaction chemistries and materials, design and process engineering capabilities for batch and continuous processing of both solid and liquid materials, and proficiency in process safety and scale-up necessary to design safe chemical manufacturing processes. We believe that these core competencies, established in support of the legacy chemical business, are applicable to building a technology-based position in biofuels and associated bio-based specialty products and expanding our chemical segment product lines.
 
Research and development expense incurred by us for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 were $3,415, $3,484, and $2,988, respectively. Substantially all of such research and development expense are related to the development of new products, services, and processes or the improvement of existing products, services, and processes.

Environmental Matters
 
Various aspects of our operations are subject to regulation by state and federal agencies. Biofuel and chemical operations are subject to numerous, stringent and complex laws and regulations at the federal, state, and local levels governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. These laws and regulations may:

● | require acquisition of permits regarding discharges into the air and discharge of waste waters;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | place restrictions on the handling and disposal of hazardous and other wastes; and 
● | require capital expenditures to implement pollution control equipment. 

 
Compliance with such laws and regulations can be costly, and noncompliance can result in substantial civil and even criminal penalties. Some environmental laws impose strict liability for environmental contamination, rendering a person liable for environmental damages and cleanup costs without regard to negligence or fault. Moreover, there is strong public interest in the protection of the environment. Our operations could be adversely affected to the extent laws are enacted or other governmental action is taken that imposes environmental protection requirements that result in increased costs to the biofuels and/or chemical manufacturing industry in general. The following provides a general discussion of some of the significant environmental laws and regulations that impact our activities.
 
The federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (or “CERCLA”), and analogous state laws, impose joint and several liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original act, on certain classes of persons that contributed to the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. These persons include the owner and operator of the site where the release occurred, past owners and operators of the site, and companies that disposed of or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances found at the site. Responsible parties under CERCLA may be liable for the costs of cleaning up hazardous substances that have been released into the environment and for damages to natural resources. Additionally, it is not uncommon for third parties to assert claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances or other pollutants into the environment.
 
The federal Solid Waste Disposal Act, as amended by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”), is the principal federal statute governing the management of wastes, including the treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous wastes. RCRA imposes stringent operating requirements, and liability for failure to meet such requirements, on a person who is either a generator or transporter of hazardous waste or an owner or operator of a hazardous waste treatment, storage, or disposal facility. Many of the wastes generated in our manufacturing facility are governed by RCRA.
 
The federal Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (“OPA”) and regulations thereunder impose liability on responsible parties for damages resulting from oil spills into or upon navigable waters, adjoining shorelines, or in the exclusive economic zone of the United States. A responsible party may include, but is not limited to, the owner or operator of an onshore facility. Spill cleanup liability may not apply to the facility if a spill is caused by another party’s gross negligence or willful misconduct. Responsible parties may be subject to penalties if the spill resulted from violation of a federal safety, construction, or operating regulation, or if a party fails to report a spill or to cooperate fully in a clean-up. Failure to comply with OPA’s requirements may subject a responsible party to civil, criminal, or administrative enforcement actions via the Water Pollution Control Act.
 
The federal Water Pollution Control Act (the “Clean Water Act”) imposes restrictions and controls on the discharge of pollutants into navigable waters. These controls have become more stringent over the years, and it is possible that additional restrictions may be imposed in the future. Permits must be obtained to discharge pollutants into state and federal waters. The Clean Water Act provides for civil, criminal, and administrative penalties for discharges of oil and other pollutants and imposes liability on parties responsible for those discharges for the costs of cleaning up any environmental damage caused by the release and for natural resource damages resulting from the release. Comparable state statutes impose liability and authorize penalties in the case of an unauthorized discharge of petroleum or its derivatives, or other pollutants, into state waters.
 
The federal Clean Air Act and associated state laws and regulations restrict the emission of air pollutants from many sources, including facilities involved in manufacturing chemicals and biofuels. New facilities are generally required to obtain permits before operations can commence, and new or existing facilities may be required to incur certain capital expenditures to install air pollution control equipment in connection with obtaining and maintaining operating permits and approvals. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil, and criminal penalties for non-compliance with permits or other requirements of the Clean Air Act and associated state laws and regulations.

The federal Endangered Species Act, the federal Marine Mammal Protection Act, and similar federal and state wildlife protection laws prohibit or restrict activities that could adversely impact protected plant and animal species or habitats. Manufacturing activities could be prohibited or delayed in areas where such protected species or habitats may be located, or expensive mitigation may be required to accommodate such activities.
 
The Toxic Substances Control Act (“TSCA”) seeks to reduce risks of injury to health, or the environment associated with the manufacture, processing, distribution, use, or disposal of chemical substances. TSCA requires reporting, record-keeping and testing of certain chemicals and restricts use of some chemical substances and/or mixtures. Some substances are excluded from TSCA, including food, drugs, cosmetics and pesticides. Government agencies may initiate regulatory action to label, restrict, or ban a chemical, or to require the submission of additional data needed to determine the risk a chemical may pose. The statute contains enforcement provisions that include both criminal and civil penalties.
 
Our policy is to operate our plant and facilities in a manner that protects the environment and the health and safety of our employees and the public. We intend to continue to make expenditures for environmental protection and improvements in a timely manner consistent with our policies and with the technology available. In some cases, applicable environmental regulations such as those adopted under the Clean Air Act and RCRA, and related actions of regulatory agencies, determine the timing and amount of environmental costs incurred by us.
 
We establish reserves for closure/post-closure costs associated with the environmental and other assets we maintain. Environmental assets include waste management units, such as chemical waste destructors, storage tanks, and boilers. When these types of assets are constructed or installed, a reserve is established for the future costs anticipated to be associated with the closure of the site based on the expected life of the environmental assets, the applicable regulatory closure requirements, and our environmental policies and practices. These expenses are charged into earnings over the estimated useful life of the assets. Currently, we estimate the useful life of each individual asset up to 27 years.
 
In addition to our general environmental policies and policies for asset retirement obligations and environmental reserves, we accrue environmental costs when it is probable that we have incurred a liability and the amount can be reasonably estimated. In some instances, the amount cannot be reasonably estimated due to insufficient data, particularly in the nature and timing of the future performance. In these cases, the liability is monitored until such time that sufficient data exists. With respect to a contaminated site, the amount accrued reflects our assumptions about remedial requirements at the site, the nature of the remedy, the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other potentially responsible parties at multi-party sites, and the number and financial viability of other potentially responsible parties. Changes in the estimates on which the accruals are based, unanticipated government enforcement action, or changes in health, safety, environmental, chemical control regulations, and testing requirements could result in higher or lower costs.
 
Our cash expenditures related to environmental protection and improvement were approximately $10,268, $9,547, and $10,057 for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively, and are included in costs of goods sold in the consolidated statements of income for each period. These amounts pertain primarily to operating costs associated with environmental protection equipment and facilities but also include expenditures for construction and development. The USEPA recently updated the Miscellaneous Organic NESHAP (“MON”) regulation, 40 CFR Part 63 Subpart FFFF, which governs emissions from organic chemical manufacturing facilities. To comply with this regulation, we must update equipment monitoring systems, chemical leak detection programs, maintenance programs, vessel pressure relief systems, emission reporting protocols and related procedures and these changes must be complete before August 12, 2023. We have budgeted the funds necessary to comply with these regulations. While we do not expect future environmental capital expenditures arising from requirements of environmental laws and regulations to materially increase our planned level of annual capital expenditures for environmental control facilities, we can give no assurances that such requirements will not materialize in the future.
 
We believe that we have obtained, in all material respects, the necessary environmental permits and licenses to carry on our operations as presently conducted. We have reviewed environmental investigations of the properties owned by us and believe, based on the results of the investigations carried out to date, that there are no material environmental issues that adversely impact us. In connection with our acquisition of our warehouse in Batesville, the seller agreed to remediate certain environmental conditions existing at the facility on the date that we acquired it and to indemnify us with respect to those environmental conditions. We continue to monitor the seller’s compliance with its remediation obligations.
 
The Company is a leading provider of renewable fuel and actively works to reduce its carbon footprint. The Company supports the global movement transitioning to a low-carbon economy and strives to control climate change related costs through process innovation, inventory control, and price indexing. Energy, transportation, and raw material costs have all been negatively impacted by climate change.

The Company has the ability to treat hazardous and non-hazardous waste on-site. Over 99% of all generated waste is treated at the facility, eliminating most greenhouse gas emissions associated with transportation of waste, and significantly reducing liability associated with public exposure to waste.
 
Greenhouse gases may have an adverse impact on global weather patterns and crop production and, therefore, could impact the availability and pricing of raw materials used in biodiesel production. The Company has developed strategies for coping with seasonal, weather related, and market driven volatility. These strategies improve the Company’s ability to dampen the impact of climate driven challenges but may not successfully overcome poor market conditions. Profits may be negatively impacted if the Company is unable to pass along price increases to our customers.
 
The Company’s chemical segment uses many commodities derived from crude oil feedstock. These materials are affected by climate change driven policies that regulate petroleum and other energy production industries. Prices are subject to volatility caused in part by supply and demand, political movements, production difficulties, transportation disruptions, and other world events that may be linked to climate change.
 
The Company has on-site emergency response equipment, trained personnel, and preparedness plans in place detailing actions needed to cope with the occurrence of severe weather.  The Company’s production location is in an area generally unaffected by hurricanes or floods; however, changing weather patterns and the increased occurrence of severe weather has the potential to impede raw material supply lines, product distribution, and plant operations.  Key raw materials and spare production equipment are maintained on-site to mitigate the effects of such occurrences.
 
Management Team and Human Capital 
 
Our executive management team at the Batesville plant consists of individuals with a combined 90 plus years of experience in the chemicals industry, comprising technical, operational, and business responsibilities. The members of the executive team also have international experience, including assignments in Europe and Asia. The operational and commercial management group at the Batesville site includes additional degreed professionals with an average experience of more than 25 years in the chemical industry.
 
Our Batesville workforce comprises approximately 472 full-time non-union employees, and includes degreed professionals including chemists (some with PhDs) and engineers (including licensed professional electrical, mechanical, and chemical engineers). Operations personnel have received extensive training and are highly skilled. Additionally, all site manufacturing and infrastructure is fully automated and computer-controlled. Due to the lack of locally-available process industry infrastructure, the workforce is substantially self-sufficient in the range of required operational skills and experience. Voluntary attrition at the site has averaged 8.2% over the past five years. Our Batesville operation is also supported by a small commercial team based in our corporate office in Clayton, Missouri.
