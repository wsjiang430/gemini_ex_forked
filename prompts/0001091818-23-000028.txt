Item 1. Business.
Company Overview
 
We were originally formed as Montrose Ventures, Inc. in the State of Delaware on May 25, 1989. On April 23, 1996, our name was changed to Java Group, Inc., which tried and failed to start a chain of coffee bars. On September 1, 2004, our name was changed to Consolidated General Corp., and under that name the company attempted to buy tier 2 and 3 professional sports teams, including the Vancouver Ravens lacrosse team and the “San Diego Soccers” soccer team. On August 7, 2007, our name was changed to Goldcorp Holdings Co. On October 15, 2010, our name was changed to GoldLand Holdings Co.
 
On March 22, 2016, the board of directors of the Registrant, pursuant to Section 242 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, determined it was in the best interest of the Registrant that the name of the Registrant should be changed to Bravo Multinational Incorporated, to reflect its new business, which is the purchase and leasing of gaming equipment. The change of name was effective upon compliance with all regulatory requirements mandated by FINRA. Further, as a result of the change of the Registrants name the trading symbol for the shares of the Registrant’s common stock has been changed to “BRVO.” Registrant’s CUSIP identifier has been changed to 10568F109.
 
The Registrant filed a Form 8-K with the SEC on April 7, 2016, announcing the change of name, trading symbol, and CUSIP identifier.
 
On January 16, 2017, The Board of Directors of the Company unanimously approved an amendment to the Company’s Articles of Incorporation in order to effect a plan of recapitalization that provides for a one-for-three hundred (1-for-300) reverse stock split of our common stock. Pursuant to written resolutions, the shareholders of the Company voted to approve the proposal to authorize the reverse split. The reverse stock split took effect, after filing a Certificate of Amendment to the Articles of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. The amended Articles of Incorporation increased the authorized shares to 1,050,000,000, consisting of 1,000,000,000 shares of common stock and 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock. The common and preferred shares will have a par value of $0.0001 per share. The preferred shares are blank check preferred. Registrant’s CUSIP identifier has been changed to 10568F208.
 
On October 4, 2019 the Company amended its Articles of Incorporation to designate 10,000,000 shares of its “blank check” preferred stock as Series ‘A’ Preferred Stock, which left 40,000,000 “blank check” authorized but unissued. The Preferred Series ‘A’ had a par value of $0.0001 per share, and entitled holders to receive one hundred (100) time the dividends per share of common stock, 100:1 stock voting rights, 100:1 liquidation rights and conversion ratio of 1:100 to common stock. Currently, there are no Series ‘A’ Preferred shares outstanding.
 
On October 09, 2020, The Company moved it state of incorporation from the State of Delaware to the State of Wyoming. After the move to Wyoming, authorized capital of Bravo Multinational Incorporated consists of an unlimited number of shares of Common Stock, par value $0.0001 per share, an unlimited number of shares of Preferred Stock, $0.0001 par value per share and an unlimited number of shares of Series Preferred ‘A’ stock at a par value of $0.0001, which has the same characteristics as described above. The reincorporation did not affect total stockholder equity or total capitalization of the Company (See Exhibit 3.1).
 
Former Business
 
We currently own 76.63 acres within seven patented mining claims with a 29.167% ownership interest. We allowed all of our BLM unpatented and placer claims to expire. We may look to expand on our mining claim holdings in the future. Currently, the carrying value on such patented claims was fully impaired due to lack of economic viability of such properties.
 
However, it should be noted that we were not at any time a mining operator. As described above, the Company owns mining claims, but none of those claims are leased to a third party. Since the mining operations of our lessee no longer have any relevance to our business of the leasing and selling of gaming equipment, we will only include financial information relating to revenues, expenses, and results of operations and other relevant information with respect to the former mining activities of the lessee of our mining properties. For a complete discussion of the mining activities on our mining claims conducted by other parties, please see our previous Form 10-Ks, 10-Qs, and 8-Ks filed with the SEC
 
Current Business
 
We are currently engaged in the business of leasing and selling gaming equipment. We, however, ceased operations in Nicaragua in 2017 due to political and economic instabilities. We are planning to operate our business in the US and other more stable democracies in Latin America.
 
During October 2017 severe weather, hurricanes, rain and flooding occurred in Nicaragua where the company had its gaming machines operation. Lower tourism and local traffic due to these uncontrollable weather issues had an effect on the Company’s machine revenues during the fourth quarter of 2017. The Company had purchased 300 gaming machines that were placed in casinos where they were producing a monthly revenue stream based on net wins of each machine. Consequently, revenue and account receivable due on these machines cannot be collectable due to the social and economic conditions which prevailed after the storms. Currently, the country has economic and trade sanctions in place by the U.S. Government.

On or about the first week of December 2017, Centro de Entretenimiento y Diversion Mombacho S.A. and GameTouch, LLC notified management of serious issues throughout the Country of Nicaragua. Civil unrest started due to lack of simple social services, like electricity, running water and destroyed infrastructure from Hurricane Nate. The ever growing political and civil unrest affected the country’s economy, which had a direct effect on the gaming industry in Nicaragua. The dangerous situation throughout Nicaragua eliminated BRVO from operating its gaming interests, effectively. On December 30, 2017, management canceled the business contracts with both Centro de Entretenimiento y Diversion Mombacho S.A. and GameTouch, LLC. Currently, the US Government placed trade and financial sanctions on the Government of Nicaragua, which greatly affected BRVO’s business practices in the Country.
 
Throughout 2018, the Company struggled to maintain its gaming operations. The politically unstable situation in Nicaragua, in addition to US financial and trade sanctions against the current Nicaraguan Government, caused Bravo Multinational, Inc. to reassess it gaming operations. As such, on November 18, 2018, management changed the direction of the Company by evaluating gaming operations as they might exist in the USA and Canadian markets and other more stable democracies within Latin America.
 
Management evaluated other possible casino gaming operations with the expectation of finding an economic viable operation. In 2021, management did due diligence on other industry opportunities outside of the casino gaming industries. Management determined and evaluated these opportunities and made the determination that moving forward was not accretive to the Company, and was unlikely to create meaningful shareholder value.
 
Throughout 2021 and 2022, management evaluated other possible casino gaming operations with the expectation of finding an economically viable business model. Also, management is in the process of conducting due diligence and negotiations in connection with other opportunities outside of the casino gaming industry.
