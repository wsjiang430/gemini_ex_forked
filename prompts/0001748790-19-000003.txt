Item 1. - Business
The Company 
Amcor plc (ARBN 630 385 278) is a holding company incorporated under the name Arctic Jersey Limited as a limited company under the laws of the Bailiwick of Jersey in July, 2018, in order to effect the Company's combination with Bemis Company, Inc. On October 10, 2018, Arctic Jersey Limited was renamed "Amcor plc" and became a public limited company incorporated under the Laws of the Bailiwick of Jersey.
Bemis Company, Inc. Merger
On June 11, 2019, we completed the acquisition of Bemis Company, Inc. ("Bemis"), a global manufacturer of flexible packaging products, pursuant to the definitive merger agreement (the "Agreement") between Amcor Limited and Bemis dated August 6, 2018. Under the terms of the Agreement, Bemis shareholders received 5.1 Amcor shares for each share of Bemis stock and Amcor shareholders received one Amcor CHESS Depositary Instrument ("CDI") for each share of Amcor Limited stock issued and outstanding. Upon completion of the transaction, the Amcor shares were registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and traded on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") under the symbol "AMCR" and the CDI's representing our shares on the Australian Securities Exchange ("ASX") are traded under the symbol "AMC." In addition, Amcor Limited shares were delisted from the ASX and Bemis shares were delisted from the NYSE.
Business Strategy
Strategy
Our strategy consists of three components: a focused portfolio, differentiated capabilities, and our aspiration to be THE leading global packaging company. To fulfill our aspiration, we are determined to win for our customers, employees, shareholders and the environment.
Focused portfolio
Our portfolio of businesses share some important characteristics:

• | a focus on primary packaging for fast-moving consumer goods,


• | good industry structure,


• | attractive relative growth, and


• | multiple paths for us to win from our leadership position, scale and other competitive advantages.

These criteria have led us to the focused portfolio of strong businesses we have today across: flexible and rigid packaging, specialty cartons, and closures.
Differentiated capabilities
'The Amcor Way' describes the capabilities deployed consistently across Amcor that enable us to get leverage across our portfolio: Talent, Commercial Excellence, Operational Leadership, Innovation, and Cash and Capital Discipline.
Shareholder value creation
Through our portfolio of business and differentiated capabilities we generate strong cash flow and redeploy cash to consistently create superior customer value. The defensive nature of our end markets mean that year-to-year volatility should be relatively low, measured on a constant currency basis. Through paying dividends and growing the base business organically in a defensive set of end markets, pursuing acquisitions or returning cash to shareholders, over time value creation has been strong and consistent.

Segment Information
Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 280, "Segment Reporting," establishes the standards for reporting information about segments in financial statements. In applying the criteria set forth in ASC 280, the Company has determined it has two reporting segments, Flexibles and Rigid Packaging. The reporting segments produce flexible packaging, rigid packaging, specialty cartons, and closure products, which are sold to customers participating in a range of attractive end use areas throughout Europe, North America, Latin America, Africa and the Asia Pacific regions. Refer to Note 20, "Segments," of the notes to consolidated financial statements for financial information about business segments.
Flexibles Segment
The Flexibles Segment develops and supplies flexible packaging globally. With approximately 43,000 employees at 190 facilities in 38 countries as of June 30, 2019, the Flexibles Segment is one of the world's largest suppliers of plastic, aluminum and fiber based flexible packaging. In fiscal year 2019, Flexibles accounted for approximately 70% of the Company’s consolidated net sales.
Rigid Packaging Segment
The Rigid Packaging Segment is one of the world's largest manufacturers of rigid plastic containers and related products. As of June 30, 2019, the Rigid Packaging Segment employed approximately 6,000 employees at 60 facilities in 12 countries. In fiscal year 2019, Rigid Packaging accounted for approximately 30% of the Company’s consolidated net sales.
Marketing, Distribution, and Competition
Our sales are made through a variety of distribution channels, but primarily through our direct sales force. Sales offices and plants are located throughout Europe, North America, Latin America, Africa and Asia-Pacific regions to provide prompt and economical service to thousands of customers. Our technically trained sales force is supported by product development engineers, design technicians, field service technicians, and a customer service organization. 
Sales to PepsiCo, and its subsidiaries, accounted for approximately 11.1%, 11.0% and 11.7% of our sales in fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Business arrangements with PepsiCo are aggregated across a number of separate contracts in disparate locations and any change in these business arrangements would typically occur over a period of time.
 The major markets in which we sell our products historically have been, and continue to be, highly competitive. Areas of competition include service, innovation, quality, and price. Competitors include Aptar Group, Inc., Ball Corporation, Berry Global, Inc., CCL Industries, Inc., Crown Holdings Incorporated, Graphic Packaging International, Inc., Huhtamaki Oyj, International Paper Company, Mayr-Melnhof Karton AG, Owens-Illinois Inc., Sealed Air Corporation, Silgan Holdings, Inc., Sonoco Products Company, Westrock Company, Winpack, Ltd., and a variety of privately held companies. 
We consider ourselves to be a significant participant in the markets in which we serve; however, due to the diversity of our business, our precise competitive position in these markets is not reasonably determinable. 
Backlog
Working capital fluctuates throughout the year in relation to business volume and other marketplace conditions. We maintain inventory levels that provide a reasonable balance between obtaining raw materials at favorable prices and maintaining adequate inventory levels to enable us to fulfill our commitment to promptly fill customer orders. Manufacturing backlogs are not a significant factor in the industries in which we operate.
Raw Materials
Polymer resins and films, paper, inks, adhesives, aluminum, and chemicals constitute the major raw materials we use. These are purchased from a variety of global industry sources, and we are not significantly dependent on any one supplier for our raw materials. While temporary industry-wide shortages of raw materials may occur, we expect to continue to successfully manage raw material supplies without significant supply interruptions. Currently, raw materials are readily available but pricing can fluctuate.
Intellectual Property
7

We are the owner or licensee of a number of United States and foreign patents and patent applications that relate to certain of our products, manufacturing processes, and equipment. We have a number of trademarks and trademark registrations in the United States and in foreign countries. We also keep certain technology and processes as trade secrets. Our patents, licenses, and trademarks collectively provide a competitive advantage. However, the loss of any single patent or license alone would not have a material adverse effect on our results as a whole or those of our segments. 
Environmental Matters and Government Regulation
We believe our commitment to responsible packaging is integral to our success. Responsible packaging protects the product, extends its shelf life and can reduce a significant amount of waste throughout the supply chain.
In January 2018, we became the first global packaging company pledging to develop all of our packaging to be recyclable or reusable by 2025, to significantly increase our use of recycled materials and to work with others to drive greater recycling of packaging around the world. We are uniquely positioned to lead the way in the development of more sustainable or environmentally friendly packaging. 
Our operations and the real property we own or lease are subject to broad environmental laws and regulations by multiple jurisdictions. These laws and regulations pertain to the discharge of certain materials into the environment, handling and disposition of waste, and cleanup of contaminated soil and ground water as well as various other protections of the environment. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations based on implementation of our Environmental, Health, and Safety Management System and regular audits of those processes and systems. However, we cannot predict with certainty that we will not in the future incur liability with respect to noncompliance with environmental laws and regulations due to contamination of sites formerly or currently owned or operated by us (including contamination caused by prior owners and operators of such sites) or the off-site disposal of regulated materials, which could be material. In addition, these laws and regulations are constantly changing, and we cannot always anticipate these changes. Refer to Note 19, "Contingencies and Legal Proceedings," of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for information about legal proceedings. For a more detailed description of the various laws and regulations that affect our business, see Item 1A. "Risk Factors".
Employees
As of June 30, 2019, we employed approximately 50,000 people worldwide.
Seasonal Factors
The business of each of the reporting segments is not seasonal to any material extent.
Research and Development
Refer to Note 2, "Significant Accounting Policies," of the notes to consolidated financial statements for research and development expenditures.
