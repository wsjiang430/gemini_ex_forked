ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 
eWellness Healthcare Corporation (f/k/a Dignyte, Inc.), (the “eWellness”, “Company”, “we”, “us”, “our”) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on April 7, 2011.
 
The Company and Nature of Business
 
eWellness is the first physical therapy telehealth company to offer insurance reimbursable real-time distance monitored treatments. eWellness plans to generate revenue from Third Party Healthcare Administrators (“TPA”) employees, PTs and corporate wellness licensees on a contractually recurring PHZIO session fee basis. Our PHZIO platform is anticipated to transform the access, cost and quality dynamics of physical therapy (“PT”) delivery for the market participants. eWellness further believes any patient, employer, health plan or healthcare professional interested in a better approach to PT is a potential PHZIO platform user.
 
Our PHZIO platform has been developed to significantly support us in becoming the leader in the new industry of digital telehealth physical therapy (“dPT”). Our focus is to highlight that many of all future PT treatments can be accomplished with a smart phone. This new digital adoption will lower patient treatment costs, expand patient treatment access and improve patient compliance. Our PHZIO platform allows patients and PT’s to cut the cord from the old-school, wait in line, brick and mortar clinical experience to an immediate response digital, in-home PT experience. 80% of all PT assessments and treatments can now be done on a patient’s smart phone in the privacy of their own home. Digital PT is clearly the next upgrade the industry needs to make.
 
Our PHZIO platform completely disrupts the current in-clinic business model of the $30 billion PT industry and the $8 billion corporate wellness industries. Innovators in other industries have solved access, cost and quality inefficiencies through the implementation of technology platforms and business models that deliver products and services on-demand and create new economies by connecting and empowering both consumers and businesses. We have taken the same approach to solving the pervasive access, cost and quality challenges facing the current access to PT clinics. eWellness’ underlying technology platform is complex, deeply integrated and purpose-built over the past four years for the evolving PT marketplace. eWellness’ PHZIO platform is highly scalable and can support substantial growth of third-party licensees. eWellness’ PHZIO platform provides for broad interconnectivity between PT practitioners and their patients, uniquely positioning the Company as a focal point in the rapidly evolving PT industry to introduce innovative, technology- based solutions, such as remote patient monitoring, post-discharge treatment plan adherence and in-home care.

PHZIO re-defines the way PT can be delivered. PHZIO is the first real-time remote monitored one-to-many PT platform for home use. Due to the real-time patient monitoring feature, the PHZIO platform is insurance reimbursable by payers such as Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield.
 
Los Angeles Sales & Marketing Office: The Company opened its first sales and marketing office in Playa Vista, California in May 2017 to accelerate the adoption of PHZIO and the other new digital telehealth tools to patients, physicians and PT’s in California. The company has also hired sales and marketing professional consultants to manage the new silos of business development.
 
eWellness will initially rollout these new telehealth solutions within California, New Jersey, Georgia, Tennessee, Arizona and Canada, with plans to expand nationally over the next twelve months. With these new telehealth tools, eWellness will engage with the “At-Home” Physical Therapy treatment market. This market involves physical therapy practitioners treating patients in their home instead of a clinic. The “At-Home” market model when combined with PHZIO offers patients and practitioners a means to receive and deliver PT services without having to leave work during normal business hours. Patients can receive physical therapy services at almost any hour of the day. A model that is not currently employed within traditional clinical settings.
 
The Company has created a strong path to initial revenue generation and substantial sales growth through executing on our Workers Compensation Sales Funnel. Our Workman’s Compensation Sales Funnel currently includes 101 companies. Starting in the Summer of 2018 we pivoted our sales process to focus on the workman’s compensation PT industry. We are pitching to 12 separate industry silos of potential business within the 101 workman’s compensation sales funnel prospects. Multiple agreements are anticipated to be executed from our workman’s compensation sales funnel through the middle of 2019 and beyond.
 
Based upon a business marketing pivot during the summer of 2018, our current business model is to provision our PHZIO platform to any customer of workers compensation third party administrators (TPA’s), physical therapy clinic in the U.S. and or have large-scale employers use our digital PHZIO platform as a workers’ compensation physical therapy program. We have created a strong path to lowering the spending on workman’s compensation claims through the utilization of our PHZIO digital PT treatment platform.
 
PreHabPT. Any individuals covered by EPS and/or LW, who are seeking non-emergency orthopedic surgery shall first receive a concierge online consultation, in-home or in-office PT therapy evaluation and will be prescribed a four to eight-week prehabpt.com exercise program prior to any surgery. Another in-home or in-office PT evaluation will be made following surgery and a treatment plan will be initiated. PreHabPT is up to an eight-week physician to patient pre-surgical (Prehab) digital therapeutic exercise treatment system for patients that anticipate having total join replacement (knee, hip and or shoulder) or back surgeries.
 
PurePT. PurePT is a patient and independent PT digital treatment platform for connecting new patients to PT’s that are seeking to be treated with our PHZIO treatment system. Patient program assessments can be made in the privacy of a patient’s home or office. PurePT connects new patients to PT’s, particularly in states that have direct access rules where patient’s insurance will reimburse for treatment without requiring a physician’s prescription. PurePT puts the patient first.
 
PHZIO Comprehensive Wellness Program Any EPS and/or LW insureds may, after an in-home or in-office PT assessment, enroll in a 6-month comprehensive wellness program. The top line wellness goals of our PHZIO wellness exercise program is to graduate at least 60% of inducted patients through our 6-month program. Patients should expect to experience an average of a 20% reduction in BMI, a two-inch reduction in waist size, weight loss of at least 10 pounds, significant overall improvement in balance, coordination, flexibility, strength and lumbopelvic stability. Patients also should score better on Functional Outcomes Scales (Oswestry and LEFS) which indicates improved functional activity levels due to reduced low back, knee and hip pain.
 
The Company’s PHZIO home PT exercise platform has been designed to disrupt the $30 billion PT and the $8 billion corporate wellness industries. PHZIO re-defines the way PT can be delivered. PHZIO is the first real-time remote monitored one-to-many PT platform for home use. Due to the real-time patient monitoring feature, the PHZIO platform is insurance reimbursable by payers such as Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield.

The PHZIO Solution: A New PT Delivery System
 

● | SaaS technology platform solution for providers bundling rehabilitation services and employer wellness programs: PTs can evaluate and screen patients and calculate joint angles using drawing tool 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | First real-time remote monitored one-to-many PT treatment platform for home use; 
● | Ability for PTs to observe multiple patients simultaneously in real-time; 
● | Solves what has been a structural problem and limitation in post-acute care practice growth. 
● | PT practices can experience 20% higher adherence and compliance rates versus industry standards; and 
● | Tracking to 30% increase in net income for a PT practice. 

 
Our initial PHZIO platform enables employees or patients to engage with live or on-demand video based physical therapy telemedicine treatments from their home or office. Following a physician’s exam and prescription for physical therapy to treat back, knee or hip pain, a patient can be examined by a physical therapist and if found appropriate inducted in the Company’s PHZIO program that includes a progressive 6-month telemedicine exercise program (including monthly in-clinic checkups). All PHZIO treatments are monitored by a licensed therapist that sees everything the patient is doing while providing their professional guidance and feedback in real-time. This ensures treatment compliance by the patient, maintains the safety and integrity of the prescribed exercises, tracks patient metrics and captures pre-and post-treatment evaluation data. PHZIO unlocks a host of potential for revolutionizing patient treatment models and directly links back to the established brick and mortar physical therapy clinic. This unique model enables any physical therapy practice to be able to execute more patient care while utilizing their same resources and creates more value than was ever before possible.
 
Our PHZIO platform, which includes design, testing, exercise intervention, follow-up, and exercise demonstration, has been developed by accomplished Los Angeles based physical therapist Darwin Fogt. Mr. Fogt has extensive experience and education working with diverse populations from professional athletes to morbidly obese. He understands the most beneficial exercise prescription to achieve optimal results and has had enormous success in motivating all patient types to stay consistent in working toward their goals. Additionally, his methods have proven effective and safe as he demonstrates exercises with attention to proper form to avoid injury. Mr. Fogt has established himself as a national leader in his field and has successfully implemented progressive solutions to delivering physical therapy: he has consulted with and been published by numerous national publications including Runner’s World, Men’s Health, Men’s Journal, and various Physical Therapy specific magazines; his 13 plus years of experience include rehabilitating the general population, as well as professional athletes, Olympic gold medalists, and celebrities. He has bridged the gap between physical therapy and fitness by opening Evolution Fitness, which uses licensed physical therapists to teach high intensity circuit training fitness classes. He also founded one of the first exclusive prenatal and postnatal physical therapy clinic in the country. Mr. Fogt is a leader in advancing the profession to incorporate research-based methods and focus on, not only rehabilitation but also wellness, functional fitness, performance, and prevention. He can recognize that the national healthcare structure (federal and private insurance) is moving toward a model of prevention and that the physical therapy profession will take a larger role in providing wellness services to patients.
 
Innovators in other industries have solved access, cost and quality inefficiencies through the implementation of technology platforms and business models that deliver products and services on-demand and create new economies by connecting and empowering both consumers and businesses. We have taken the same approach to solving the pervasive access, cost and quality challenges facing the current access to physical therapy clinics.
 
Our underlying technology platform is complex, deeply integrated and purpose-built over the three years for the evolving physical therapy marketplace. Our PHZIO platform is highly scalable and can support substantial growth of third-party licensees. Our PHZIO platform provides for broad interconnectivity between PT practitioners and their patients and, we believe, uniquely positions us as a focal point in the rapidly evolving PT industry to introduce innovative, technology-based solutions, such as remote patient monitoring, post-discharge treatment plan adherence and in-home care.

We plan to generate revenue from third-party PT and corporate wellness licensees on a contractually recurring per PHZIO session fee basis. Our PHZIO platform is anticipated to transform the access, cost and quality dynamics of physical therapy delivery for all the market participants. We further believe any patient, employer, health plan or healthcare professional interested in a better approach to physical therapy is a potential PHZIO platform user.
 
Before even launching, we have received a high indication of interest in our service. We think the demand is warranted but recognize, that in the preliminary stages of our services, we may experience bottlenecks in our ability to meet the demand for the service. Under this type of environment, it is critical to maintain awareness of the Company’s operational budget goals and how they are being met in our attempts to address demand. Regardless of our growth pace, it is critical to shareholder value that we are mindful of our operational spending.

Advisory Agreement with Fintech Global Consultants
 
On March 16, 2018, the Company as signed an Advisory Agreement with Fintech Global Consultants [“FGC” http://f-g-c.com] to assist the Company in completing blockchain adaptation across the $30 billion physical therapy and $8 billion wellness markets with new advanced health tech tools. We believe that out implementation of the new blockchain technology for the Company’s PHZIO digital treatment platform and our other new health tech tools may have a beneficial impact on patient care beginning in the third quarter of 2019. The Company has hired a leading international blockchain advisory firm to further our state of the art PHZIO digital telehealth platform. We believe that by being blockchain enabled, our patients will have more convenient access to wellness services, seamless storage and access to HIPPA compliant medical records and simplified insurance reimbursement. In addition, FGC will assist the Company in its planned Initial Coin Offering of up to a $10 million non-dilutive funding that we believe will help in the implementation and acceleration of PHZIO’s expansion on a national basis during the next twelve months.
Competition
 
We have identified multiple privately-held telemedicine and exercise platform companies that utilize Avatar/Kinect-based telerehb platforms including: Reflexion Health, RespondWell, Physmodo, Jintronx, MotionCare 360 and Five Plus. Additionally, we have identified other video-based physical therapy solutions such as: Bluejay, PT Pal, VitalRock, Physiotech, SimplyTherapy and YouTube. Yet, none of these companies have real-time PT monitoring, one-to-many platform, treatments reimbursable by payors and strong program compliance and adherence by patients.
The PHZIO.COM Exercise Program
 
A Monitored In-office & Telemedicine Exercise Program: Our initial 6-month PHZIO exercise program has been designed to provide patients, who are accepted into the program, with traditional one-on-one PT evaluations, re-evaluations (one to four weeks throughout the PHZIO program depending on type of insurance), and after the conclusion of the program a Physical Performance Test. These PTs are known as Induction & Evaluation PTs (“IEPTs”). All patient medical data, information and records are retained in the files of the IEPT. The IEPT will also evaluate the progress of the patient’s participation in our PHZIO program.

● | Physician Diagnosis: Following a physician’s diagnosis of a patient with non-acute back pain, who is also likely overweight and pre-diabetic, a physician may prescribe the patient to participate in the eWellness PHZIO exercise program. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Enrollment Process: The accepted patients are assessed by a PT, located at a PT Licensee clinic and then enrolled in our PHZIO program by going online to our PHZIO program virtual private network (“VPN”) and creating a login name and password. The patient will then populate their calendar with planned times when they anticipate exercising. They will also be provided with a free exercise ball, resistance stretch bands, stretch strap and yoga mat at induction. 
● | Exercising Begins: The day after the patient receives the equipment, the patient will log on to our VPN at least 3 times per week, to watch and follow the prescribed 40-minute on-line exercise program. The PHZIO platform also allows two-way communication (videoconferencing) with one of our licensee’s On-line PTs (“OLPT’s”), who is responsible for monitoring on-line patients. The OLPT’s are also available to answer patient’s questions. When available the patients exercise sessions are recorded and stored in our system as proof that they completed the prescribed exercises. There are 250 various 40-minute exercise videos that are viewed by our patients in successive order. 
● | Driving Patients to work out between 6:00am-9:30am 5 days per week: Our PHZIO system has a calendar function so that patients can schedule when they will login to our PHZIO system. This calendar enables a PT Licensee to better spread the load of patients participating in any forty-minute on-line exercise program during our 15 hours of weekly operations, 6am through 9:30am Monday through Friday are to most optimal hours for patient engagement. Also, if the patient is not on-line at the planned exercise time, our system can send them an automated reminder, via text, voicemail and or e-mail messaging.

Trackable Physical Therapy. The exercise PHZIO prescription and instruction will be delivered with a series of on-line videos easily accessed by each patient on the internet. Each video will be approximately 40 minutes in length with exercises, which will specifically address the common impairments associated with diabetes and/or obesity. Exercise programs will be able to be performed within each patient’s own home or work location without requiring standard gym equipment. Each patient will be required to log in to the system which will monitor performance automatically to ensure their compliance. Each patient will be required to follow up with their referring physician and PT at designated intervals and metrics such as blood pressure, blood sugars, BMI, etc. will be recorded to ensure success of the program.
 
Patient Program Goals. Our initial PHZIO program was designed so that the average patient is targeted to lose 2 pounds per week, totaling up to 48 pounds over the duration of the program to progress toward healthier defined BMI, reduction body fat percentage by at least 8%, reduced reliance on medication for blood glucose regulation and dosage or frequency and a goal of at least a 50% adherence to continuing the PHZIO program independently at conclusion of program.
 
Trackable Video Exercise Program. The On-Line PHZIO video content includes all aspects of wellness preventative care to ensure the best results: cardiovascular training, resistance training, flexibility, and balance and stabilization; research studies on all such distinct impairments have shown to provide effective treatment results. Each video integrates each of the four components to guarantee a comprehensive approach to the wellness program, but each video will specifically highlight one of the four components. All PHZIO video content can be viewed on all desktops, tablets, PC’s and MAC computers.
 
Specific Video Programs. Each patient will receive a prescription for six months (26 week) of physical therapy and exercise that is provided by viewing on-line programs produced by eWellness where the patient can do these exercises and stretching on their own at least 3 days per week for at least 40 minutes. The PHZIO videos can be watched on a laptop or desktop computer and on IOS and Android smart phones since the second quarter of 2017. To view the videos, the patient would log onto the PHZIO web-site and would be directed to watch the appropriate video in sequence. As the patient is logged-in, the monitoring PT will be able to monitor how often and if the entire video session was viewed. This data would be captured and sent weekly to the prescribing physician and the monitoring PT for review. At all times, a licensed OLPT/PTA will have access to each patient utilizing the videos and will be able to communicate with a patient via video-conferencing and/or instant messaging. This will help improve adherence to the program as well as the success and safety of the patients’ treatments. A patient will also be instructed to walk or ride a bike at least 30 minutes three days per week in addition to participating in our program.
 
If the patient is not viewing the videos, then the prescribing physician and/or the monitoring PT would reach out to the patient by telephone and/or e-mail to encourage the patient to keep up their physical fitness regime. After each series, the patient returns for an office visit to the prescribing physician for blood tests, blood pressure and a weight management check- up as well as a follow-up visit with the PT for assessment of the patient’s progress toward established goals.
 
Exercise Patient Kits. Most patients will receive a home exercise tool kit, which will include: an inflatable exercise ball, a hand pump, a yoga mat, a yoga strap, and varying levels of resistance bands. Each of the PHZIO exercise videos will include exercises that incorporate the items in the tool kit. By using a bare minimum of equipment, patients should be able to participate more easily at home or at their workplace. Our estimated cost of the kit is $49, which we pay and factored into aPT licensees’ revenue stream and internal projections. The cost of the exercise kits may also be billed to the patients account.
 
Our Cloud-based PHZIO System Design. Our CTO is currently a principal shareholder and operator of two video content platform-based businesses in Ottawa, Canada that have built and own the intellectual property for various global corporate and governmental projects having similar requirements as ours. Not only will his experience stand to significantly shorten our path to service activation of our own program, but his industry contacts will provide immediate access to valuable resources. Because of this access, initially all system maintenance, updates and upgrades of our PHZIO platform will be made by him and a readily available team of independent freelance consultants in Ottawa. Additionally, through his ownership in these video content platform businesses, the Company did enter into an agreement with one of them to secure the rights to intellectual property completing approximately 100% of the Company’s systems requirements at a total cost of $20,000. Our platform was built based on the Zendesk® highly-scalable customer service application platform. Currently, all system maintenance, updates and upgrades will be made by our CTO’s team in Ottawa.

Insurance/Reimbursement
 
Thus far in the state of California our initial licensee has successfully gained reimbursement from Blue Cross, Blue Shield and CIGNA insurance companies. The licensee receiver reimbursements that are equivalent to in-clinic patient reimbursements. For PT licensee patients, whose insurance companies provide little or no reimbursement for Physical Therapy Telemedicine Reimbursement, they may have higher co-payments for participating in the PHZIO program or be responsible to pay the full cost of such services.
 
Expansion into other markets where telemedicine has high support. On December 20, 2013, we executed a 25-year licensing agreement with a London, Ontario based telemedicine company Physical Relief Telemedicine Health Care Services (“PRTHCS”), pursuant to which we granted PRTHCS a limited, transferable right to use and promote our PHZIO Program within the province of Ontario; additional Canadian territories may be added at the parties’ mutual discretion. PRTHCS has a known track-record in the telemedicine industry in Canada. To date PRTHCS has been unsuccessful in licensing our PHZIO platform to any Canadian based PT clinics.
 
Our Planned Expansion into other States where Telemedicine has high support. The most common path being taken by states is to cover telemedicine services in their Medicaid program. 42 states now provide some form of Medicaid reimbursement for telemedicine services (mostly physician to physician consultations). More importantly 16 states have now expanded their definition of telemedicine to include physical therapy and have also required that state and private insurance plans cover telemedicine services. Those 16 states with the broadest telemedicine policies include: Alaska, Georgia, Hawaii, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Oregon, Texas, Virginia and Vermont.
 
Intellectual Property
 
With adequate funding, we anticipate the development of various Application and Pioneering Methods patent protect and Trademark protection associated with our technology platform and unique physical therapy treatments.
REGULATIONS AND HEALTHCARE REFORM 
 
Numerous federal, state and local regulations regulate healthcare services and those who provide them. Some states into which we may expand have laws requiring facilities employing health professionals and providing health-related services to be licensed and, in some cases, to obtain a certificate of need (that is, demonstrating to a state regulatory authority the need for, and financial feasibility of, new facilities or the commencement of new healthcare services). Only one of the states in which we intend to roll out our services requires a certificate of need for the operation of our physical therapy business functions. Our therapists, however, are required to be licensed, as determined by the state in which they provide services. Failure to obtain or maintain any required certificates, approvals or licenses could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
State Legislation
 
Insurance reimbursement for our PHZIO services is likely to improve in 2019 and beyond based upon current draft legislation in Congress that seeks to significantly expand Medicare’s reimbursement for telemedicine services including for physical therapy. If passed, this legislation would drive private healthcare insurers to also reimburse for physical therapy associated with telemedicine. We have received authorization from the California State Board of Physical Therapy (“CSBPT”) that we could operate our PHZIO platform and bill patients’ insurance within the Association’s rules in the state of California.

On July 21, 2017, bill SB 291 (now P.L.2017, c.117) became effective in New Jersey. The law establishes coverage of telemedicine and telehealth services, both under New Jersey Medicaid and commercial health insurance plans. The law does not explicitly impose a payment parity requirement (i.e., mandating that reimbursement for telemedicine and telehealth services be equal to reimbursement rates for identical in-person services). Instead the law sets the in-person reimbursement rate as the maximum ceiling for telemedicine and telehealth reimbursement rates.
 
On January 17, 2018 an amendment (“SB 1315”) to the New Jersey Physical Therapy Licensing Act of 1983 (“PT Licensing Act”), became effective. This law expands the scope of practice of PTs to include identification of balance disorders; wound debridement and care; utilization review; screening, examination, evaluation, and application of interventions for the promotion, improvement, and maintenance of fitness, health, wellness, and prevention services in populations of all ages exclusively related to physical therapy practice.
 
Stark Law
 
Provisions of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (42 U.S.C. § 1395nn) (the “Stark Law”) prohibit referrals by a physician of “designated health services” which are payable, in whole or in part, by Medicare or Medicaid, to an entity in which the physician or the physician’s immediate family member has an investment interest or other financial relationship, subject to several exceptions. Unlike the Fraud and Abuse Law, the Stark Law is a strict liability statute. Proof of intent to violate the Stark Law is not required. Physical therapy services are among the “designated health services”. Further, the Stark Law has application to the Company’s management contracts with individual physicians and physician groups, as well as, any other financial relationship between us and referring physicians, including any financial transaction resulting from a clinic acquisition. The Stark Law also prohibits billing for services rendered pursuant to a prohibited referral. Several states have enacted laws like the Stark Law. These state laws may cover all (not just Medicare and Medicaid) patients. Many federal healthcare reform proposals in the past few years have attempted to expand the Stark Law to cover all patients as well. As with the Fraud and Abuse Law, we consider the Stark Law in planning our clinics, marketing and other activities, and believe that our operations are in compliance with the Stark Law. If we violate the Stark Law, our financial results and operations could be adversely affected. Penalties for violations include denial of payment for the services, significant civil monetary penalties, and exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs.
HIPAA
 
To further combat healthcare fraud and protect patient confidentially, Congress included several anti-fraud measures in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”). HIPAA created a source of funding for fraud control to coordinate federal, state and local healthcare law enforcement programs, conduct investigations, provide guidance to the healthcare industry concerning fraudulent healthcare practices, and establish a national data bank to receive and report final adverse actions. HIPAA also criminalized certain forms of health fraud against all public and private insurers. Additionally, HIPAA mandates the adoption of standards regarding the exchange of healthcare information to ensure the privacy and electronic security of patient information and standards relating to the privacy of health information. Sanctions for failing to comply with HIPAA include criminal penalties and civil sanctions. In February of 2009, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (“ARRA”) was signed into law. Title XIII of ARRA, the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”), provided for substantial Medicare and Medicaid incentives for providers to adopt electronic health records (“EHRs”) and grants for the development of health information exchange (“HIE”). Recognizing that HIE and EHR systems will not be implemented unless the public can be assured that the privacy and security of patient information in such systems is protected, HITECH also significantly expanded the scope of the privacy and security requirements under HIPAA. Most notable are the new mandatory breach notification requirements and a heightened enforcement scheme that includes increased penalties, and which now apply to business associates as well as to covered entities. In addition to HIPAA, many states have adopted laws and/or regulations applicable in the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health information that can be more stringent than comparable provisions under HIPAA.
 
We believe that our current business operations are fully compliant with applicable standards for privacy and security of protected healthcare information. We cannot predict what negative effect, if any, HIPAA/HITECH or any applicable state law or regulation will have on our business.

Other Regulatory Factors
 
Political, economic and regulatory influences are fundamentally changing the healthcare industry in the United States. Congress, state legislatures and the private sector continue to review and assess alternative healthcare delivery and payment systems. Based upon newly finalized FDA rules, we believe that our PHZIO platform is exempt from Federal Drug Administration (“FDA”) regulation. Yet, in the unlikely event that these rules change in the future, the FDA could then require us to seek 510K approvals for our on-line services that could create delays in provisioning our PHZIO services. (See FDA ruling noted below) Also, potential alternative approaches could include mandated basic healthcare benefits, controls on healthcare spending through limitations on the growth of private health insurance premiums, the creation of large insurance purchasing groups, and price controls. Legislative debate is expected to continue in the future and market forces are expected to demand only modest increases or reduced costs. For instance, managed care entities are demanding lower reimbursement rates from healthcare providers and, in some cases, are requiring or encouraging providers to accept capitated payments that may not allow providers to cover their full costs or realize traditional levels of profitability.

On September 25, 2013, the FDA issued Finalized Guidance of medical mobile applications (“Apps”). The FDA has issued a ruling on Apps that may meet the definition of a medical device, but they have determined that they will not exercise enforcement on these Apps. The Guidance contains an appendix that provides examples of mobile apps that MAY meet the definition of medical device but for which FDA intends to exercise enforcement discretion. These mobile apps may be intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions, or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease. Even though these mobile apps may meet the definition of medical device, the FDA intends to exercise enforcement discretion for these mobile apps because they pose lower risk to the public. The FDA understands that there may be other unique and innovative mobile apps that may not be covered in this list that may also constitute healthcare related mobile apps. This list is not exhaustive; it is only intended to provide clarity and assistance in identifying the mobile apps that will not be subject to regulatory requirements at this time. Based on our understanding of the Guidance, although there can be no guarantee, we believe our PHZIO platform will not be subject to regulatory requirements because such services seem to fall within the statutory examples.

Legal Proceedings
 
In February 2017, the Company was served by a complaint filed by the holder of a note payable. The action was removed from Louisiana state court to the United States Federal District Court in Baton Rouge, LA. The lawsuit alleges that the Company is indebted to the note holder a promissory note stemming from four loans to the Company during the 20 months prior to February 2017 amounting to $75,500 in total original principal bearing interest at 12% per annum, of which $45,202 has been repaid. Further, the note holder claims that, because of alleged defaults and extensions of the notes, the Company is now indebted in the amount of $253,877 inclusive of interest and penalties at an effective rate exceeding 70% per annum, far more than the maximum rate allowable in California or Louisiana. The Company and its counsel have determined that: (i) the note holder is not a licensed lender in the State of California, where the loan was made and the $75,500 was deposited and therefore was not permitted under California law to make loans in the State; and (ii) the interest rate the note holder is seeking to collect is usurious and therefore interest claimed in the lawsuit is neither collectible nor enforceable. In October 2017 the complainant and his counsel motioned to dismiss the unlicensed lender assertion. In January 2018 the U.S. District Court, Louisiana ruled that the unlicensed lender assertion was to proceed.
