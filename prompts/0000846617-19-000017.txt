 Item 1. Business
 Bridge Bancorp, Inc. (the “Registrant” or “Company”), is a registered bank holding company for BNB Bank (the “Bank”), which was formerly known as The Bridgehampton National Bank prior to the Bank’s conversion to a New York chartered commercial bank in December 2017. The Registrant was incorporated under the laws of the State of New York in 1988, at the direction of the Board of Directors of the Bank for the purpose of becoming a bank holding company pursuant to a plan of reorganization under which the former shareholders of the Bank became the shareholders of the Company. Since commencing business in March 1989, after the reorganization, the Registrant has functioned primarily as the holder of all of the Bank’s common stock. In May 1999, the Bank established a real estate investment trust subsidiary, Bridgehampton Community, Inc. (“BCI”), as an operating subsidiary. The assets transferred to BCI are viewed by the bank regulators as part of the Bank’s assets in consolidation. The operations of the Bank also include Bridge Abstract LLC (“Bridge Abstract”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Bank, which is a broker of title insurance services. In October 2009, the Company formed Bridge Statutory Capital Trust II (the “Trust”) as a subsidiary, which sold $16.0 million of 8.5% cumulative convertible Trust Preferred Securities (the “Trust Preferred Securities”) in a private placement to accredited investors. The Trust Preferred Securities were redeemed effective January 18, 2017 and the Trust was cancelled effective April 24, 2017.
 The Bank was established in 1910 and is headquartered in Bridgehampton, New York. The Bank operates 39 branches in its primary market areas of Suffolk and Nassau Counties on Long Island and the New York City boroughs, including 36 in Suffolk and Nassau Counties, two in Queens and one in Manhattan. For over a century, the Bank has maintained its focus on building customer relationships in its market area. The mission of the Bank is to grow through the provision of exceptional service to its customers, its employees, and the community. The Bank strives to achieve excellence in financial performance and build long-term shareholder value. The Bank engages in full service commercial and consumer banking business, including accepting time, savings and demand deposits from the consumers, businesses and local municipalities in its market area. These deposits, together with funds generated from operations and borrowings, are invested primarily in: (1) commercial real estate loans; (2) multi-family mortgage loans; (3) residential mortgage loans; (4) secured and unsecured commercial and consumer loans; (5) home equity loans; (6) construction and land loans; (7) Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”), Federal National Mortgage Association (“Fannie Mae”), Government National Mortgage Association (“Ginnie Mae”) and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (“Freddie Mac”) mortgage-backed securities, collateralized mortgage obligations and other asset backed securities; (8) New York State and local municipal obligations; (9) U.S. government-sponsored enterprise (“U.S. GSE”) securities; and (10) corporate bonds. The Bank also offers the Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Service (“CDARS”) and Insured Cash Sweep (“ICS”) programs, providing multi-millions of dollars of Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) insurance on deposits to its customers. In addition, the Bank offers merchant credit and debit card processing, automated teller machines, cash management services, lockbox processing, online banking services, remote deposit capture, safe deposit boxes, and individual retirement accounts as well as investment services through Bridge Financial Services LLC, which offers a full range of investment products and services through a third-party broker dealer. Through its title insurance abstract subsidiary, the Bank acts as a broker for title insurance services. The Bank’s customer base is comprised principally of small businesses, municipal relationships and consumer relationships.
 As of December 31, 2018, the Bank had 473 full-time equivalent employees. The Bank provides a variety of employment benefits and considers its relationship with its employees to be positive. In addition, the Company maintains equity incentive plans under which it may issue shares of common stock of the Company. Refer to Note 15. “Stock-Based Compensation Plans” for further details of the Company’s equity incentive plans.
 All phases of the Bank’s business are highly competitive. The Bank faces direct competition from a significant number of financial institutions operating in its market area, many with a statewide or regional presence, and in some cases, a national presence. There is also competition for banking business from competitors outside of its market areas. Most of these competitors are significantly larger than the Bank, and therefore have greater financial and marketing resources and lending limits than those of the Bank. The fixed cost of regulatory compliance remains high for community banks as compared to their larger competitors that are able to achieve economies of scale. The Bank considers its major competition to be local commercial banks as well as other commercial banks with branches in the Bank’s market area. Other competitors include savings banks, credit unions, mortgage brokers and financial services firms other than financial institutions such as

investment and insurance companies. Increased competition within the Bank’s market areas may limit growth and profitability. Additionally, as the Bank’s market area expands westward, competitive pressure in new markets is expected to be strong. The title insurance abstract subsidiary also faces competition from other title insurance brokers as well as directly from the companies that underwrite title insurance. In New York State, title insurance is obtained on most transfers of real estate and mortgage transactions.
 The Bank’s principal market areas are Suffolk and Nassau Counties on Long Island and the New York City boroughs, with its legacy markets being primarily in Suffolk County and its newer expansion markets being primarily in Nassau County, Queens and Manhattan. Long Island has a population of approximately 3 million and both counties are relatively affluent and well-educated enjoying above average median household incomes. In total, Long Island has a sizable industry base with a majority of Suffolk County tending towards high tech manufacturing and Nassau County favoring wholesale and retail trade. Suffolk County, particularly Eastern Long Island, is semi-rural and also the point of origin for the Bank. Surrounded by water and including the Hamptons and North Fork, the region is a recreational destination for the New York metropolitan area, and a highly regarded resort locale worldwide. While the local economy flourishes in the summer months as a result of the influx of tourists and second homeowners, the year-round population has grown considerably in recent years, resulting in a reduction of the seasonal fluctuations in the economy which has boosted the Bank’s legacy market opportunities. The Bank’s opportunities in Nassau County are vast as there is a deposit base totaling approximately $17 billion across the zip codes in which the Bank operates. As the Bank had $423.6 million, or 3%, of this Nassau County deposit base at December 31, 2018, there is much room for growth in these expansion markets. Industries represented across the principal market area include retail establishments; construction and trades; restaurants and bars; lodging and recreation; professional entities; real estate; health services; passenger transportation; high-tech manufacturing; and agricultural and related businesses. Given its proximity, Long Island’s economy is closely linked with New York City’s and major employers in the area include municipalities, school districts, hospitals, and financial institutions.
 The Company, the Bank and its subsidiaries, with the exception of the real estate investment trust, which files its own federal and state income tax returns, report their income on a consolidated basis using the accrual method of accounting and are subject to federal and state income taxation. In general, banks are subject to federal income tax in the same manner as other corporations. However, gains and losses realized by banks from the sale of available for sale securities are generally treated as ordinary income, rather than capital gains or losses. The Bank is subject to the New York State Franchise Tax on Banking Corporations based on certain criteria. The taxation of net income is similar to federal taxable income subject to certain modifications. On December 22, 2017, the President signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Act”), resulting in significant changes to existing tax law, including a lower federal statutory tax rate of 21%. The Tax Act was generally effective as of January 1, 2018. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company recorded a charge of $7.6 million, which consisted primarily of the deferred tax asset remeasurement from the previous 35% federal statutory rate to the new 21% federal statutory tax rate.
 DeNovo Branch Expansion
 Since 2010, the Bank has opened 15 branches in New York, including eight branches over the last five years, to continue expansion into new markets and strengthen the Bank’s position in existing markets. In 2014, the Bank opened three branches in Suffolk County in Bay Shore, Port Jefferson and Smithtown. In 2017, the Bank opened three branches in Suffolk County: one in Riverhead, capitalizing on a market opportunity presented by the sale of Suffolk County National Bank to People’s United Bank in the second quarter, one in East Moriches, and a drive-up facility located in Sag Harbor. The Bank also opened a branch in Astoria, Queens in 2017. In 2018, the Bank opened a limited service branch in Suffolk County located in Melville.  Branch Rationalization
 During 2017, the Bank conducted a branch rationalization study analyzing branch performance and market opportunities. As a result of the study, and in an effort to increase efficiency and remove branch redundancy, the Bank closed six locations in the first quarter of 2018. The branches closed in Suffolk County, New York were located in Cutchogue, Center

Moriches, and Melville. The branches closed in Nassau County, New York were located in Massapequa, New Hyde Park and Hewlett.
 Mergers and Acquisitions
 Hamptons State Bank (“HSB”)
 In May 2011, the Bank acquired HSB, which increased the Bank’s presence in an existing market with a branch located in the Village of Southampton.
 First National Bank of New York 
 In February 2014, the Company acquired FNBNY Bancorp and its wholly-owned subsidiary, the First National Bank of New York (collectively “FNBNY”) at a purchase price of $6.1 million and issued an aggregate of 240,598 of the Company’s shares in exchange for all the issued and outstanding stock of FNBNY. The purchase price was subject to certain post-closing adjustments equal to 60 percent of the net recoveries on $6.3 million of certain identified problem loans over a two-year period after the acquisition. As of February 14, 2016, a net recovery of $0.4 million was realized and $0.3 million has been distributed to the former FNBNY shareholders. At acquisition, FNBNY had total acquired assets on a fair value basis of $211.9 million, with loans of $89.7 million, investment securities of $103.2 million and deposits of $169.9 million. The transaction expanded the Company’s geographic footprint into Nassau County, complemented the existing branch network and enhanced asset generation capabilities. Community National Bank (“CNB”)
 In June 2015, the Company acquired CNB at a purchase price of $157.5 million, issued an aggregate of 5.647 million of the Company’s common shares in exchange for all the issued and outstanding common stock of CNB and recorded goodwill of $96.5 million, which is not deductible for tax purposes. At acquisition, CNB had total acquired assets on a fair value basis of $895.3 million, with loans of $729.4 million, investment securities of $90.1 million and deposits of $786.9 million. The transaction expanded the Company’s geographic footprint across Long Island including Nassau County, Queens and into New York City. The transaction complemented the Bank’s existing branch network and enhanced asset generation capabilities.
 Management will continue to seek opportunities to expand its reach into other contiguous markets by network expansion, or through the addition of professionals with established customer relationships. The Bank routinely adds to its menu of products and services, continually meeting the needs of consumers and businesses. Management believes positive outcomes in the future will result from the expansion of the Company’s geographic footprint, investments in infrastructure and technology and continued focus on placing customers first.
 Regulation and Supervision 
 BNB Bank
 The Bank is a New York chartered commercial bank and a member of the Federal Reserve System (a “member bank”). The lending, investment, and other business operations of the Bank are governed by New York and federal laws and regulations, and the Bank is prohibited from engaging in any operations not specifically authorized by such laws and regulations. The Bank is subject to extensive regulation by the New York State Department of Financial Services (“NYSDFS”) and, as a member bank, by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (“FRB”). The Bank’s deposit accounts are insured up to applicable limits by the FDIC under its Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”) and the FDIC has certain regulatory authority as deposit insurer. A summary of the primary laws and regulations that govern the operations of the Bank are set forth below.
 The 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) made extensive changes in the regulation of insured depository institutions. Many of the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act are subject to delayed effective dates and/or require the issuance of implementing regulations. The regulatory process is ongoing and the impact 

 
  Page -3-

 
on operations cannot yet be fully assessed. However, the Dodd-Frank Act has resulted in increased regulatory burden, compliance costs and interest expense for the Company and the Bank. Loans and Investments
 The powers of a New York commercial bank are established by New York law and applicable federal law. New York commercial banks have authority to originate and purchase any type of loan, including commercial, commercial real estate, residential mortgages or consumer loans. Aggregate loans by a state commercial bank to any single borrower or group of related borrowers are generally limited to 15% of the Bank’s capital and surplus, plus an additional 10% if secured by specified readily marketable collateral.
 Federal and state law and regulations limit the Bank’s investment authority. Generally, a state member bank is prohibited from investing in corporate equity securities for its own account other than the equity securities of companies through which the bank conducts its business. Under federal and state regulations, a New York state member bank may invest in investment securities for its own account up to specified limit depending upon the type of security. “Investment Securities” are generally defined as marketable obligations that are investment grade and not predominantly speculative in nature. Applicable regulations classify investment securities into five different types and, depending on its type, a state member bank may have the authority to deal in and underwrite the security. New York-chartered state member banks may also purchase certain non-investment securities that can be reclassified and underwritten as loans.
 Lending Standards
 The federal banking agencies adopted uniform regulations prescribing standards for extensions of credit that are secured by liens on interests in real estate or made for the purpose of financing the construction of a building or other improvements to real estate. Under these regulations, all insured depository institutions, such as the Bank, adopted and maintain written policies that establish appropriate limits and standards for extensions of credit that are secured by liens or interests in real estate or are made for the purpose of financing permanent improvements to real estate. These policies must establish loan portfolio diversification standards, prudent underwriting standards (including loan-to-value limits) that are clear and measurable, loan administration procedures, and documentation, approval and reporting requirements. The real estate lending policies must reflect consideration of the Interagency Guidelines for Real Estate Lending Policies that have been adopted by the federal bank regulators. Federal Deposit Insurance
 The Bank is a member of the DIF, which is administered by the FDIC. Deposit accounts at the Bank are insured by the FDIC. Effective July 22, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act permanently raised the deposit insurance available on all deposit accounts to $250,000 with a retroactive effective date of January 1, 2008.
 The FDIC assesses insured depository institutions to maintain the DIF. Under the FDIC’s risk-based assessment system, institutions deemed less risky pay lower assessments. Assessments for institutions of less than $10 billion of assets are now based on financial measures and supervisory ratings derived from statistical modeling estimating the probability of an institution’s failure within three years. That system, effective July 1, 2016, replaced the previous system under which institutions were placed into risk categories.
 The Dodd-Frank Act required the FDIC to revise its procedures to base assessments upon each insured institution’s total assets less tangible equity instead of deposits. The FDIC finalized a rule, effective April 1, 2011, that set the assessment range at 2.5 basis points to 45 basis points of total assets less tangible equity. In conjunction with the DIF’s reserve ratio achieving 1.15%, the assessment range (inclusive of possible adjustments) was reduced for insured institutions of less than $10 billion of total assets to 1.5 basis points to 30 basis points, effective July 1, 2016.
 The Dodd-Frank Act increased the minimum target DIF ratio from 1.15% of estimated insured deposits to 1.35% of estimated insured deposits. The FDIC must seek to achieve the 1.35% ratio by September 30, 2020. The Dodd-Frank Act requires insured institutions with assets of $10 billion or more to fund the increase from 1.15% to 1.35% and, effective July 1, 2016, such institutions are subject to a surcharge to achieve that goal. The Dodd-Frank Act eliminated the 1.5% maximum fund ratio, instead leaving it to the discretion of the FDIC, and the FDIC has exercised that discretion by establishing a long-range fund ratio of 2%.

 Insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that an institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC. The Company does not know of any practice, condition or violation that might lead to termination of deposit insurance.
 In addition to the FDIC assessments, the Financing Corporation (FICO) is authorized to impose and collect, with the approval of the FDIC, assessments for anticipated payments, issuance costs and custodial fees on bonds issued by the FICO in the 1980s to recapitalize the former Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation. The bonds issued by the FICO are maturing beginning in 2017 and continuing through September 2019. For the quarter ended December 31, 2018, the annualized FICO assessment was equal to 0.32 basis points of average consolidated total assets less average tangible equity.
 Capitalization
 Federal regulations require FDIC insured depository institutions, including state member banks, to meet several minimum capital standards:  a common equity tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 4.5%, a tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 6.0%, a total capital to risk-based assets ratio of 8.0%, and a tier 1 capital to total assets leverage ratio of 4.0%. The existing capital requirements were effective January 1, 2015 and are the result of a final rule implementing regulatory amendments based on recommendations of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act. Common equity tier 1 capital is generally defined as common stockholders’ equity and retained earnings. Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common equity tier 1 and additional tier 1 capital. Additional tier 1 capital generally includes certain noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries. Total capital includes tier 1 capital (common equity tier 1 capital plus additional tier 1 capital) and tier 2 capital. Tier 2 capital is comprised of capital instruments and related surplus meeting specified requirements, and may include cumulative preferred stock and long-term perpetual preferred stock, mandatory convertible securities, intermediate preferred stock and subordinated debt. Also included in tier 2 capital is the allowance for loan and lease losses limited to a maximum of 1.25% of risk-weighted assets and, for institutions that have exercised an opt-out election regarding the treatment of accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”), up to 45% of net unrealized gains on available-for-sale equity securities with readily determinable fair market values. Institutions that have not exercised the AOCI opt-out have AOCI incorporated into common equity tier 1 capital (including unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale-securities). Calculation of all types of regulatory capital is subject to deductions and adjustments specified in the regulations.
 In determining the amount of risk-weighted assets for purposes of calculating risk-based capital ratios, assets, including certain off-balance sheet assets (e.g., recourse obligations, direct credit substitutes, residual interests) are multiplied by a risk weight factor assigned by the regulations based on the risks believed inherent in the type of asset. Higher levels of capital are required for asset categories believed to present greater risk. For example, a risk weight of 0% is assigned to cash and U.S. government securities, a risk weight of 50% is generally assigned to prudently underwritten first lien one-to-four family residential mortgages, a risk weight of 100% is assigned to commercial and consumer loans, a risk weight of 150% is assigned to certain past due loans and a risk weight of between 0% to 600% is assigned to permissible equity interests, depending on certain specified factors.
 In addition to establishing the minimum regulatory capital requirements, the regulations limit capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments to management if the institution does not hold a “capital conservation buffer” consisting of 2.5% of common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets above the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements. The capital conservation buffer requirement was phased in beginning January 1, 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and increasing each year until fully implemented at 2.5% on January 1, 2019. 
 Community Bank Leverage Ratio
 Legislation enacted in 2018 requires the federal banking agencies, including the FRB, to amend the regulatory capital regulations to establish a “Community Bank Leverage Ratio” (the ratio of a bank’s tangible equity capital to average total consolidated assets) of between 8% and 10% of average total consolidated assets.  Banking organizations of less than $10 billion of assets that have capital meeting the specified level and satisfying other criteria could elect to follow this alternative framework and be deemed in compliance with all applicable capital requirements, including the risk-based 

  Page -5-

 
requirements and would be considered “well capitalized” under “prompt corrective action” statutes.  The federal banking agencies may consider a financial institution’s risk profile when evaluating whether it qualifies as a community bank for purposes of the capital ratio requirement. The agencies have issued a proposed rule that, if finalized, would set the Community Bank Leverage Ratio at 9%. Safety and Soundness Standards
 Each federal banking agency, including the FRB, has adopted guidelines establishing general standards relating to internal controls, information and internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth, asset quality, earnings and compensation, fees, and benefits. In general, the guidelines require, among other things, appropriate systems and practices to identify and manage the risks and exposures specified in the guidelines. The guidelines prohibit excessive compensation as an unsafe and unsound practice and describe compensation as excessive when the amounts paid are unreasonable or disproportionate to the services performed by an executive officer, employee, director, or principal shareholder.
 On April 26, 2016, the federal regulatory agencies approved a second proposed joint rulemaking to implement Section 956 of the Dodd-Frank Act, which prohibits incentive-based compensation that encourages inappropriate risk taking. In addition, the NYSDFS issued guidance applicable to incentive compensation in October 2016.
 Prompt Corrective Regulatory Action
 Federal law requires, among other things, that federal bank regulatory authorities take “prompt corrective action” with respect to institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. For these purposes, the statute establishes five capital tiers: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized, and critically undercapitalized.
 The FRB may order member banks which have insufficient capital to take corrective actions. For example, a bank, which is categorized as “undercapitalized” would be subject to other growth limitations, would be required to submit a capital restoration plan, and a holding company that controls such a bank would be required to guarantee that the bank complies with the restoration plan. A “significantly undercapitalized” bank would be subject to additional restrictions. Member banks deemed by the FRB to be “critically undercapitalized” would be subject to the appointment of a receiver or conservator.
 The final rule that increased regulatory capital standards adjusted the prompt corrective action tiers as of January 1, 2015. The various categories have been revised to incorporate the new common equity tier 1 capital requirement, the increase in the tier 1 to risk-based assets requirement and other changes. Under the revised prompt corrective action requirements, insured depository institutions are required to meet the following in order to qualify as “well capitalized:” (1) a common equity tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.5% (new standard); (2) a tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% (increased from 6.0%); (3) a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% (unchanged); and (4) a tier 1 leverage ratio of 5.0% (unchanged). Under the proposed rulemaking discussed above, an institution would be deemed to be “well capitalized” if it meets the “Community Bank Leverage Ratio.”
 Dividends
 Under federal law and applicable regulations, a New York member bank may generally declare a dividend, without prior regulatory approval, in an amount equal to its year-to-date retained net income plus the prior two years’ retained net income that is still available for dividend. Dividends exceeding those amounts require application to and approval by the 

  Page -6-

 
NYSDFS and FRB. In addition, a member bank may be limited in paying cash dividends if it does not maintain the capital conservation buffer described previously.
 Transactions with Affiliates and Insiders
 Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act govern transactions between a member bank and its affiliates, which includes the Company. The FRB has adopted Regulation W, which comprehensively implements and interprets Sections 23A and 23B, in part by codifying prior FRB interpretations under Sections 23A and 23B.
 An affiliate of a bank is any company or entity that controls, is controlled by or is under common control with the bank. A subsidiary of a bank that is not also a depository institution or a “financial subsidiary” under federal law is not treated as an affiliate of the bank for the purposes of Sections 23A and 23B; however, the FRB has the discretion to treat subsidiaries of a bank as affiliates on a case-by-case basis. Sections 23A and 23B limit the extent to which a bank or its subsidiaries may engage in “covered transactions” with any one affiliate to an amount equal to 10% of such bank’s capital stock and surplus, and limit all such transactions with all affiliates to an amount equal to 20% of such capital stock and surplus. The statutory sections also require that all such transactions be on terms that are consistent with safe and sound banking practices. The term “covered transaction” includes the making of loans, purchase of assets, issuance of guarantees and other similar types of transactions. Further, most loans by a bank to any of its affiliates must be secured by collateral in amounts ranging from 100 to 130 percent of the loan amounts. In addition, any covered transaction by an association with an affiliate and any purchase of assets or services by an association from an affiliate must be on terms that are substantially the same, or at least as favorable, to the bank as those that would be provided to a non-affiliate.
 A bank’s loans to its executive officers, directors, any owner of more than 10% of its stock (each, an insider) and any of certain entities affiliated with any such person (an insider’s related interest) are subject to the conditions and limitations imposed by Section 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act and the FRB’s Regulation O thereunder. Under these restrictions, the aggregate amount of the loans to any insider and the insider’s related interests may not exceed the loans-to-one-borrower limit applicable to national banks. All loans by a bank to all insiders and insiders’ related interests in the aggregate may not exceed the bank’s unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus. With certain exceptions, loans to an executive officer, other than loans for the education of the officer’s children and certain loans secured by the officer’s residence, may not exceed the greater of $25,000 or 2.5% of the bank’s unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus, but in no event more than $100,000. Regulation O also requires that any proposed loan to an insider or a related interest of that insider be approved in advance by a majority of the board of directors of the bank, with any interested director not participating in the voting, if such loan, when aggregated with any existing loans to that insider and the insider’s related interests, would exceed either $500,000 or the greater of $25,000 or 5% of the bank’s unimpaired capital and surplus. Generally, such loans must be made on substantially the same terms as, and follow credit underwriting procedures that are no less stringent than, those that are prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with other persons and must not present more than a normal risk of collectability. An exception is made for extensions of credit made pursuant to a benefit or compensation plan of a bank that is widely available to employees of the bank and that does not give any preference to insiders of the bank over other employees of the bank.
 Examinations and Assessments
 The Bank is required to file periodic reports with and is subject to periodic examination by the NYSDFS and the FRB. Applicable laws and regulations generally require periodic on-site examinations and annual audits by independent public accountants for all insured institutions. The Bank is required to pay an annual assessment to the NYSDFS to fund its supervision. Community Reinvestment Act
 Under the federal Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”), the Bank has a continuing and affirmative obligation consistent with its safe and sound operation to help meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low and moderate-income neighborhoods. The CRA does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions nor does it limit an institution’s discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community, consistent with the CRA. The CRA requires the FRB in connection with its examination of the Bank, to assess its record of meeting the credit needs of its community and to take that record into account in its evaluation of certain 

  Page -7-

 
applications by the Bank. For example, the regulations specify that a bank’s CRA performance will be considered in its expansion (e.g., branching or mergers) proposals and may be the basis for approving, denying or conditioning the approval of an application. As of the date of its most recent CRA examination, which was conducted by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the NYSDFS, the Bank’s CRA performance was rated “satisfactory”.
 New York law imposes a similar obligation on the Bank to serve the credit needs of its community. New York law contains its own CRA provisions, which are substantially similar to federal law.
 USA PATRIOT Act
 The USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 gave the federal government new powers to address terrorist threats through enhanced domestic security measures, expanded surveillance powers, increased information sharing and broadened anti-money laundering requirements. The USA PATRIOT Act also required the federal banking agencies to take into consideration the effectiveness of controls designed to combat money-laundering activities in determining whether to approve a merger or other acquisition application of a member institution. Accordingly, if the Bank engages in a merger or other acquisition, the Bank’s controls designed to combat money laundering would be considered as part of the application process. The Bank has established policies, procedures and systems designed to comply with these regulations. Bridge Bancorp, Inc.
 The Company, as a bank holding company controlling the Bank, is subject to the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (“BHCA”), and the rules and regulations of the FRB under the BHCA applicable to bank holding companies. The Company is required to file reports with, and otherwise comply with the rules and regulations of the FRB.
 The FRB previously adopted consolidated capital adequacy guidelines for bank holding companies structured similarly, but not identically, to those applicable to the Bank. The Dodd-Frank Act directed the FRB to issue consolidated capital requirements for depository institution holding companies that are no less stringent, both quantitatively and in terms of components of capital, than those applicable to institutions themselves. The previously discussed final rule regarding regulatory capital requirements implements the Dodd-Frank Act as to bank holding company capital standards. Consolidated regulatory capital requirements identical to those applicable to the subsidiary banks applied to bank holding companies as of January 1, 2015. As is the case with institutions themselves, the capital conservation buffer was phased-in between 2016 and 2019. The new capital rule eliminated from tier 1 capital the inclusion of certain instruments, such as trust preferred securities, that were previously includable by bank holding companies. However, the final rule grandfathered trust preferred issuances prior to May 19, 2010 in accordance with the Dodd-Frank Act. The Company issued trust preferred securities that qualified for grandfathering. These securities were redeemed as of January 18, 2017 and the Trust was cancelled effective April 24, 2017. The Company met all capital adequacy requirements under the new capital rules on December 31, 2018.
 The policy of the FRB is that a bank holding company must serve as a source of strength to its subsidiary banks by providing capital and other support in times of distress. The Dodd-Frank Act codified the source of strength policy.
 Under the prompt corrective action provisions of federal law, a bank holding company parent of an undercapitalized subsidiary bank is required to guarantee, within specified limits, the capital restoration plan that is required of an undercapitalized bank. If an undercapitalized bank fails to file an acceptable capital restoration plan or fails to implement an accepted plan, the FRB may prohibit the bank holding company parent of the undercapitalized bank from paying dividends or making any other capital distribution.
 As a bank holding company, the Company is required to obtain the prior approval of the FRB to acquire more than 5% of a class of voting securities of any additional bank or bank holding company or to acquire all, or substantially all, the assets of any additional bank or bank holding company. In addition, the bank holding companies may generally only engage in activities that are closely related to banking as determined by the FRB. Bank holding companies that meet certain criteria may opt to become a financial holding company and thereby engage in a broader array of financial activities.
 FRB policy is that a bank holding company should pay cash dividends only to the extent that the company’s net income for the past two years is sufficient to fund the dividends and the prospective rate of earnings retention is consistent with the company’s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. In addition, FRB guidance sets forth the

supervisory expectation that bank holding companies will inform and consult with FRB staff in advance of issuing a dividend that exceeds earnings for the quarter and should inform the FRB and should eliminate, defer or significantly reduce dividends if (i) net income available to stockholders for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid during that period, is not sufficient to fully fund the dividends, (ii) prospective rate of earnings retention is not consistent with the bank holding company’s capital needs and overall current and prospective financial condition, or (iii) the bank holding company will not meet, or is in danger of not meeting, its minimum regulatory capital adequacy ratios.
 Current FRB regulations provide that a bank holding company that is not well capitalized or well managed, as such terms are defined in the regulations, or that is subject to any unresolved supervisory issues, is required to give the FRB prior written notice of any repurchase or redemption of its outstanding equity securities if the gross consideration for repurchase or redemption, when combined with the net consideration paid for all such repurchases or redemptions during the preceding 12 months, will be equal to 10% or more of the company’s consolidated net worth. The FRB may disapprove such a repurchase or redemption if it determines that the proposal would constitute an unsafe and unsound practice or violate a law or regulation. FRB guidance generally provides for bank holding company consultation with Federal Reserve Bank staff prior to engaging in a repurchase or redemption of a bank holding company’s stock, even if a formal written notice is not required. However, it has recently come to the attention of the Company that the FRB staff is interpreting the capital regulations as requiring a bank holding company to secure FRB approval prior to redeeming or repurchasing any capital stock that is included in regulatory capital.
 The NYSDFS and FRB have extensive enforcement authority over the institutions and holding companies that they regulate to prohibit or correct activities that violate law, regulation or a regulatory agreement or which are deemed to be unsafe or unsound banking practices. Enforcement actions may include: the appointment of a conservator or receiver for an institution; the issuance of a cease and desist order; the termination of deposit insurance; the imposition of civil money penalties on the institution, its directors, officers, employees and institution-affiliated parties; the issuance of directives to increase capital; the issuance of formal and informal agreements; the removal of or restrictions on directors, officers, employees and institution-affiliated parties; and the enforcement of any such mechanisms through restraining orders or other court actions. Any change in applicable New York or federal laws and regulations could have a material adverse impact on the Bank and the Company and their operations and stockholders.
 During 2008, the Company received approval and began trading on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol “BDGE”. Equity incentive plan grants of stock options and stock awards are recorded directly to the holding company. The Company’s sources of funds are dependent on dividends from the Bank, its own earnings, additional capital raised and borrowings. The information in this report reflects principally the financial condition and results of operations of the Bank. The Bank’s results of operations are primarily dependent on its net interest income. The Bank also generates non-interest income, such as fee income on deposit accounts and merchant credit and debit card processing programs, investment services, income from its title insurance abstract subsidiary, and net gains on sales of securities and loans. The level of its non-interest expenses, such as salaries and benefits, occupancy and equipment costs, other general and administrative expenses, expenses from its title insurance abstract subsidiary, and income tax expense, further affects the Bank’s net income.
 The Company had nominal results of operations for 2018, 2017, and 2016 on a parent-only basis. The Company’s capital strength is paralleled by the solid capital position of the Bank, as reflected in the excess of its regulatory capital ratios over the risk-based capital adequacy ratio levels required for classification as a “well capitalized” institution by the FDIC (see Note 18 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Since 2013, the Company has actively managed its capital position in response to its growth and has raised $261.2 million in capital.
 The Company files certain reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) under the federal securities laws. The Company’s operations are also subject to extensive regulation by other federal, state and local governmental authorities and it is subject to various laws and judicial and administrative decisions imposing requirements and restrictions on part or all of its operations. Management believes that the Company is in substantial compliance, in all material respects, with applicable federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations. Because the Company’s business is highly regulated, the laws, rules and regulations applicable to it are subject to regular modification and change. There can be no assurance that these proposed laws, rules and regulations, or any other laws, rules or regulations, will not be adopted in the future, which could make compliance more difficult or expensive or otherwise adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition or prospects.
