The development of new products varies across markets in order to address differences in cultures, lifestyles, tastes and needs, although most products are offered in a large number of markets.
Research and development and the resultant new products will continue to be an important part of the Company's strategy going forward. See “Research and Development” in Part I, Item I of this Report for additional information on the Company’s recent research and development.

II. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND MARKETS 
The Company operates its business under four reportable segments in four broad geographic regions: (1) Europe (Europe, Africa and the Middle East), (2) Asia Pacific, (3) North America and (4) South America. Market penetration varies throughout the world. Several areas that have low penetration, such as Latin America, Asia, and Central and Eastern Europe and Sub-Saharan Africa, provide the Company significant growth potential. The Company's strategy continues to include greater penetration in markets throughout the world.

Tupperware Brands' products are sold around the world under six brands: Tupperware, Avroy Shlain, Fuller, NaturCare, Nutrimetics and Nuvo. The Company defines its established market economy units as those in Western Europe (including Scandinavia), Australia, Canada, Japan, New Zealand and the United States. All other units are classified as operating in emerging market economies. Businesses operating in emerging markets accounted for 70 percent of 2018 sales, while businesses operating in established markets accounted for the other 30 percent. For the past five fiscal years, 91 or 92 percent of total revenues from the sale of Tupperware Brands' products have been in international markets. 
See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Report for further details regarding segments and geographic areas.
III. DISTRIBUTION OF PRODUCTS 
The Company's products are distributed worldwide primarily through the “direct-to-consumer” method, under which products are sold by an independent sales force to consumers outside traditional retail store locations. The system facilitates the timely distribution of products to consumers, without having to work through retail intermediaries, and establishes uniform practices regarding the use of Tupperware Brands' trademarks and administrative arrangements, such as order entry, delivery and payment, along with the addition and training of new sales force members. 
Products are primarily sold directly to distributors, directors, managers and dealers (“sales force”) throughout the world. Where distributorships are granted, they have the right to market the Company's products using parties and other non-retail methods and to utilize Tupperware Brands' trademarks, pursuant to certain limitations. The vast majority of the sales force members are independent contractors and not employees of Tupperware. In certain limited circumstances, the Company has acquired ownership of distributorships for a period of time, until an independent distributor can be installed, in order to maintain market presence. 
In addition to the introduction of new products and development of new geographic markets, a key element of the Company's strategy is expanding its business by increasing the size of its sales force. Under the system, distributors, directors, team leaders, managers and dealers add, train, and motivate a large number of dealers. Managers are developed from among the dealer group, and team leaders from among the manager group, and promoted to assist in adding, training and motivating dealers, while continuing to sell products. 
As of December 29, 2018, the Company's distribution system had approximately 2,100 distributors, 110,600 managers (including directors and team leaders) and 3.0 million dealers worldwide.
Tupperware has traditionally relied upon the group demonstration method of sales, which is designed to enable purchasers to appreciate, through demonstration, the features and benefits of the Company's products. Group demonstrations are held in homes, offices, social clubs and other locations. Products are also promoted through brochures mailed or given to people invited to attend demonstrations. Some business units utilize a campaign merchandising system, whereby sales force members sell through brochures generated every two or three weeks, to their friends, neighbors and relatives. Sales of products are supported through programs of sales promotions, sales and training aids and motivational conferences for the sales force. In addition, to support its sales force, the Company utilizes catalogs, television and magazine advertising, as well as various social media channels, which help to increase its sales levels with hard-to-reach customers and generate leads for sales and new dealers. A significant portion of the Company's business is operated through distributors, many of whom stock inventory and fulfill orders of the sales force that are generally placed after orders have been received from end consumers. In other cases, the Company sells directly to the sales force, also generally after they have received a consumer order. In China, the Company operated at the end of 2018 through 6,600 independent retail outlets, with heavy emphasis on digital marketing to acquire and sell to members of the outlets and other end consumers.
In 2018, the Company continued to sell directly, and/or through its sales force, to end consumers via the Internet. It also entered into a limited number of business-to-business transactions, in which it sells products to a partner company. Sales through the Internet to end consumers and business-to-business transactions do not constitute a significant portion of the Company's sales.

IV. COMPETITION 
There are many competitors to Tupperware Brands' businesses both domestically and internationally. The principal bases of competition generally are marketing, price, quality and innovation of products, as well as competition with other “direct-to-consumer” companies for sales personnel and demonstration dates. Due to the nature of the direct-to-consumer industry, it is critical that the Company provides a compelling earnings opportunity for the sales force, along with developing new and innovative products. The Company maintains its competitive position, in part, through the use of strong incentives and promotional programs. 
Through its Tupperware® brand, the Company competes in the food storage, serving and preparation, containers, toys and gifts categories. Through its beauty and personal care brands, the Company also competes in the skin care, cosmetics, toiletries, fragrances and nutritionals categories. The Company works to differentiate itself from its competitors through its brand names, product innovation, quality, value-added services, celebrity endorsements, technological sophistication, new product introductions and its channel of distribution, including the training, motivation and compensation arrangements for its independent sales forces. 
V. EMPLOYEES 
At December 29, 2018, the Registrant employed approximately 12,000 people, of whom approximately 700 were based in the United States. 
VI. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
The Registrant incurred $15.0 million, $16.7 million and $18.3 million for fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, on research and development activities for new products and production processes. 
VII. RAW MATERIALS 
Many of the products manufactured by and for the Company require plastic resins that meet its specifications. These resins are purchased through various arrangements with a number of large chemical companies located in many of the Company's markets. As a result, the Company has not experienced difficulties in obtaining adequate supplies. Research and development relating to resins used in Tupperware® brand products is performed by both the Company and its suppliers. 
Materials used in the Company's skin care, cosmetic and bath and body care products consist primarily of readily available ingredients, containers and packaging materials. Such raw materials and components used in goods manufactured and assembled by the Company and through outsource arrangements are available from a number of sources. To date, the Company has been able to secure an adequate supply of raw materials for its products, and it endeavors to maintain relationships with backup suppliers in an effort to ensure that no interruptions occur in its operations. 
VIII. TRADEMARKS AND PATENTS 
Tupperware Brands considers its trademarks and patents to be of material importance to its business; however, except for the Tupperware® trademark, Tupperware Brands is not dependent upon any single patent or trademark, or group of patents or trademarks. The Tupperware® trademark, as well as its other trademarks, is registered on a country-by-country basis. The current duration for such registration ranges from five years to ten years; however, each such registration may be renewed an unlimited number of times. The patents used in Tupperware Brands' business are registered and maintained on a country-by-country basis, with a variety of durations. Tupperware Brands has followed the practice of applying for design and utility patents with respect to most of its significant patentable developments.
IX. ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS 
Compliance with federal, state and local environmental protection laws has not had in the past, and is not expected to have in the future, a material effect upon the Registrant's capital expenditures, liquidity, earnings or competitive position.

X. OTHER 
Sales do not vary significantly on a quarterly basis; however, sales in the first and third quarter are generally lower than the other quarters due to holiday schedules, vacations by dealers and their customers, as well as reduced promotional activities during these periods. Sales generally increase in the fourth quarter, as it includes traditional gift-giving occasions in many markets and as children return to school and households refocus on activities that include party plan sales events and the use of the Company's housewares products, along with increased promotional activities supporting these opportunities. 
Generally, there are no working capital practices or backlog conditions which are material to an understanding of the Registrant's business, although the Company does seek to minimize its net working capital position at the end of each fiscal year and normally generates a significant portion of its annual cash flow from operating activities in its fourth quarter. The Registrant's business is not dependent on a small number of customers, nor is any of its business subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts or subcontracts at the election of the United States government.
