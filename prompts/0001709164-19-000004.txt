Item 1. BUSINESS
General
Hamilton Beach Brands Holding Company operates through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Hamilton Beach Brands, Inc. ("HBB") and The Kitchen Collection, LLC ("KC") (collectively “Hamilton Beach Holding” or the “Company”), in the consumer, commercial and specialty small appliances and specialty retail markets.
On September 29, 2017, NACCO Industries, Inc. ("NACCO"), Hamilton Beach Holding's former parent company, spun-off the Company to NACCO stockholders. In the spin-off, NACCO stockholders, in addition to retaining their shares of NACCO common stock, received one share of Hamilton Beach Brands Holding Class A common stock ("Class A Common") and one share of Hamilton Beach Brands Holding Class B common stock ("Class B Common") for each share of NACCO Class A or Class B common stock. In accordance with applicable authoritative accounting guidance, the Company accounted for the spin-off from NACCO based on the historical carrying value of assets and liabilities. As a result of the distribution of one share of Hamilton Beach Brands Holding Class A common stock and one share of Hamilton Beach Brands Holding Class B common stock for each share of NACCO Class A or NACCO Class B common stock, the earnings per share amounts for the Company for periods prior to the spin-off have been calculated based upon the number of shares distributed in the spin-off. NACCO did not receive any proceeds from the spin-off.
As of December 31, 2018, the Company had approximately 1,495 employees.
The Company makes its annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and any amendments to those reports available, free of charge, through its website, www.hamiltonbeachbrands.com, as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with, or furnished to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).
Results of operations and financial condition are discussed separately for each of HBB and KC, the Company's reportable segments.
Hamilton Beach Brands, Inc.
General 
HBB is a leading designer, marketer and distributor of branded, small electric household and specialty housewares appliances, as well as commercial products for restaurants, bars and hotels. HBB’s products are marketed primarily to retail merchants and wholesale distributors.
Sales and Marketing
HBB designs, markets and distributes a wide range of branded, small electric household and specialty housewares small appliances, including, but not limited to, blenders, can openers, coffeemakers, food processors, indoor electric grills, irons, mixers, slow cookers, toasters and toaster ovens. In addition, HBB designs, markets and distributes commercial products for restaurants, bars and hotels. HBB generally markets its “better” and “best” consumer products under the Hamilton Beach® brand and uses the Proctor Silex® brand for the “good” and opening price point products. HBB participates in the “only-the-best” market with the Hamilton Beach® Professional brand, under a multi-year licensing agreement to sell a line of counter top appliances and kitchen tools under the Wolf Gourmet® brand, and with the CHI®-branded, garment-care line under a multi-year licensing agreement. HBB markets a range of game and garden food processing equipment including, but not limited to, meat grinders, bag sealers, dehydrators and meat slicers under the Weston® brand, as well as several private-label brands. HBB supplies additional private-label products on a limited basis throughout North America. ​HBB markets its commercial products under the Hamilton Beach Commercial® and the Proctor Silex Commercial® brands.
Sales promotion activities are primarily focused on cooperative advertising and digital marketing channels. In addition, HBB promotes certain of its innovative products through the use of television, internet and print advertising. HBB also licenses certain of its trademarks to various licensees primarily for use with microwave ovens, compact refrigerators, and water dispensers, among others.
Customers
Consumer and commercial sales in North America are generated predominantly by a network of inside sales employees to mass merchandisers, e-commerce retailers, national department stores, variety store chains, drug store chains, specialty home retailers, distributors, restaurants, bars, hotels and other retail outlets. Wal-Mart Inc. and its subsidiaries accounted for 
 1

approximately 33% of HBB’s revenue in each of 2018, 2017 and 2016. Amazon.com, Inc. and its subsidiaries accounted for approximately 11%, 12% and 10% of HBB's revenue in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. HBB’s five largest customers accounted for approximately 54%, 55%, and 54% of HBB’s revenue for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. 
Product Warranty
HBB's warranty program to the consumer consists generally of an assurance-type limited warranty lasting for varying periods of up to ten years for electric appliances, with the majority of products having a warranty of one to three years.  There is no guarantee to the customer as HBB may repair or replace, at its option, those products returned under warranty.
Working Capital
The market for small electric household and specialty housewares appliances is highly seasonal in nature. The majority of HBB's revenue and operating profit typically occurs in the second half of the year due to the fall holiday-selling season. Due to the seasonality of purchases of its products, HBB generally uses a substantial amount of cash or short-term debt to finance inventories in anticipation of the fall holiday-selling season.
Patents, Trademarks, Copyrights and Licenses
HBB holds patents and trademarks registered in the United States ("U.S.") and foreign countries for various products. HBB believes its business is not dependent upon any individual patent, copyright or license, but that the Hamilton Beach®, Proctor Silex®, Hamilton Beach Commercial®, and Weston® trademarks are material to its business.
Product Design and Development
HBB incurred $11.0 million, $10.4 million and $9.7 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, on product design and development activities.
Key Suppliers and Raw Material
HBB’s products are supplied to its specifications by third-party suppliers located primarily in China. HBB does not maintain long-term purchase contracts with suppliers and operates mainly on a purchase order basis. HBB generally negotiates the purchases from its foreign suppliers in U.S. dollars.
During 2018, HBB purchased 99% of its finished products from suppliers in China. HBB purchases its inventory from approximately 53 suppliers, one of which represented more than 10% of purchases during the year ended December 31, 2018. HBB believes the loss of any one supplier would not have a long-term material adverse effect on its business because there are adequate supplier choices available that can meet HBB’s production and quality requirements. However, the loss of a supplier could, in the short term, adversely affect HBB’s business until alternative supply arrangements are secured.
The principal raw materials used by HBB’s third-party suppliers to manufacture its products are plastic, glass, steel, copper, aluminum and packaging materials. HBB believes adequate quantities of raw materials are available from various suppliers.
Competition
The small electric household appliance industry does not have substantial entry barriers. As a result, HBB competes with many small manufacturers and distributors of housewares products. Based on publicly available information about the industry, HBB believes it is one of the largest full-line distributors and marketers of small electric household and specialty housewares appliances in North America based on key product categories.
HBB also competes to a lesser degree in Europe through its commercial product lines, and in South America, and China. The competition in these geographic markets is more fragmented than in North America, and HBB is not yet a significant participant in these retail markets.
As brick and mortar retailers generally purchase a limited selection of branded, small electric appliances, HBB competes with other suppliers for retail shelf space. In the e-commerce channel, HBB must compete with a broad list of competitors. HBB conducts consumer marketing for all of our brands. HBB believes the principal areas of competition with respect to its products are product design and innovation, quality, price, product features, supply chain excellence, merchandising, promotion and warranty.
Government Regulation
HBB is subject to numerous federal and state health, safety and environmental regulations. HBB believes the impact of expenditures to comply with such laws will not have a material adverse effect on HBB.

As a marketer and distributor of consumer products, HBB is subject to the Consumer Products Safety Act and the Federal Hazardous Substances Act, which empower the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (“CPSC”) to seek to exclude products that are found to be unsafe or hazardous from the market. Under certain circumstances, the CPSC could require HBB to repair, replace or refund the purchase price of one or more of HBB’s products, or HBB may voluntarily do so.
Throughout the world, electrical appliances are subject to various mandatory and voluntary standards, including requirements in some jurisdictions that products be listed by Underwriters’ Laboratories, Inc. (“UL”) or other similar recognized laboratories. HBB also uses Intertek Testing Services for certification and testing of compliance with UL standards, as well as other national and industry specific standards. HBB endeavors to have its products designed to meet the certification requirements of, and to be certified in, each of the jurisdictions in which they are sold.
Section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the "Dodd-Frank Act") requires public companies to disclose whether certain minerals, commonly known as "conflict minerals," are necessary to the functionality or production of a product manufactured by those companies and if those minerals originated in the Democratic Republic of the Congo ("DRC") or an adjoining country. Our compliance with these disclosure requirements could adversely affect the sourcing, availability, and pricing of minerals used in the manufacture of certain components used in HBB's products. In addition, the supply-chain due diligence investigation required by the conflict minerals rules requires expenditures of resources and management attention, regardless of the results of the investigation.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, HBB’s work force consisted of approximately 670 employees.
Kitchen Collection
General
KC is a national specialty retailer of kitchenware in outlet and traditional malls throughout the U.S.
Sales and Marketing
KC operated 189 retail stores as of December 31, 2018. The stores sell kitchenware from a number of highly recognizable name-brands, including Hamilton Beach® and Proctor Silex®. KC sales accounted for 15.3%, 17.4% and 19.4% of the Hamilton Beach Holding’s annual revenue in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
Seasonality
The majority of KC's revenue and operating profit typically occurs in the second half of the year due to the fall holiday-selling season. Because of the seasonality of purchases of its products, KC incurs substantial short-term debt to finance inventories in anticipation of the fall holiday-selling season.
Patents, Trademarks, Copyrights and Licenses
​KC operates retail stores under the Kitchen Collection® name in malls throughout the U.S. that sell kitchenware from a number of highly recognizable brand names.
Product Sourcing and Distribution
KC purchases all inventory centrally, which allows us to take advantage of volume purchase discounts. KC purchases its inventory from approximately 176 suppliers, one of which represented approximately 25% of purchases during the year ended December 31, 2018. No other supplier represents more than 10% of purchases. KC believes that the loss of any one supplier would not have a long-term material adverse effect on its business because there are adequate supplier choices available that can meet KC’s requirements. However, the loss of a supplier could, in the short term, adversely affect KC’s business until alternative supply arrangements are secured. 
KC currently maintains its inventory for distribution to its stores at a distribution center located near its corporate headquarters in Chillicothe, Ohio. 
Competition
KC competes against a diverse group of retailers, including specialty stores, department stores, discount stores, e-commerce competitors and catalog retailers. The retail environment continues to be extremely competitive. Widespread Chinese sourcing of products allows many retailers to offer value-priced kitchen products. While a number of very low-end and very high-end kitchenware retailers participate in the marketplace, KC believes there continues to be an opportunity for stores offering mid-priced, high-quality kitchenware.
