 ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
 General
 New England Realty Associates Limited Partnership (“NERA” or the “Partnership”), a Massachusetts Limited Partnership, was formed on August 12, 1977 as the successor to five real estate limited partnerships (collectively, the “Colonial Partnerships”), which filed for protection under Chapter XII of the Federal Bankruptcy Act in September 1974. The bankruptcy proceedings were terminated in late 1984. In July 2004, the General Partner extended the termination date of the Partnership until 2057, as allowed in the Partnership Agreement.
 The authorized capital of the Partnership is represented by three classes of partnership units (“Units”). There are two categories of limited partnership interests (“Class A Units” and “Class B Units”) and one category of general partnership interests (the “General Partnership Units”). The Class A Units were initially issued to creditors and limited partners of the Colonial Partnerships and have been registered under Section 12(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). Each Class A Unit is exchangeable for 30 publicly traded depositary receipts (“Receipts”), which are currently listed on the NYSE American and are registered under Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act. The Class B Units were issued to the original general partners of the Partnership. The General Partnership Units are held by the current general partner of the Partnership, NewReal, Inc. (the “General Partner” or “New Real”). The Class A Units represent an 80% ownership interest, the Class B Units represent a 19% ownership interest, and the General Partnership Units represent a 1% ownership interest.
 The Partnership is engaged in the business of acquiring, developing, holding for investment, operating and selling real estate. The Partnership, directly or through 27 subsidiary limited partnerships or limited liability companies, owns and operates various residential apartment buildings, condominium units and commercial properties located in Massachusetts and New Hampshire. As used herein, the Partnership’s subsidiary limited partnerships and limited liabilities companies are each referred to as a “Subsidiary Partnership” and are collectively referred to as the “Subsidiary Partnerships.”
 The Partnership owns between a 99.67% and 100% interest in each of the Subsidiary Partnerships, except in eight limited liability companies (the “Investment Properties” or “Joint Ventures”) in which the Partnership has between a 40% and 50% ownership interest. The majority shareholder of the General Partner indirectly owns between 47.6% and 59%, and five other current and past employees of Hamilton own collectively between 0% and 2.4%, respectively of Joint Ventures . The Partnership’s interest in the Investment Properties is accounted for on the equity method in the Consolidated Financial Statements. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements—“Principles of Consolidation.” See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements—“Investment in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures” for a description of the properties and their operations. Of those Subsidiary Partnerships not wholly owned by the Partnership, except for the Investment Properties, the remaining ownership interest is held by an unaffiliated third party. In each such case, the third party has entered into an agreement with the Partnership, pursuant to which any benefit derived from its ownership interest in the applicable Subsidiary Partnerships will be returned to the Partnership.
 The long‑term goals of the Partnership are to manage, rent and improve its properties and to acquire additional properties with income and capital appreciation potential as suitable opportunities arise. When appropriate, the Partnership may sell or refinance selected properties. Proceeds from any such sales or refinancing will be used to reduce debt, reinvested in acquisitions of other properties, distributed to the partners, repurchase equity interests, or used for operating expenses or reserves, as determined by the General Partner.
 Operations of the Partnership
 On February 24, 2019, Harold Brown, the owner of 75% of the outstanding voting securities of NewReal Inc., the general partner, of New England Realty Associates Limited Partnership passed away. As a result, Mr. Brown’s estate 

 
  3

 
currently holds voting control over the NewReal shares.
     Effective as of February 24, 2019, the Board of Directors of the Partnership’s general partner, NewReal Inc., elected Jameson Brown as the Treasurer and Chief Financial Officer of New Real to fill the vacancy created by the death of Harold Brown, who served as both the Treasurer and a director of NewReal.  
     As of December 31, 2018, the Partnership was managed by the General Partner, NewReal, Inc., a Massachusetts corporation wholly owned by Harold Brown and Ronald Brown. The General Partner has engaged The Hamilton Company, Inc. (the “Hamilton Company” or “Hamilton”) to perform general management functions for the Partnership’s properties in exchange for management fees. The Hamilton Company was wholly owned by Harold Brown and employed Ronald Brown and Harold Brown. The Partnership, Subsidiary Partnerships, and the Investment Properties currently contract with the management company for 53 individuals at the Properties and 15 individuals at the Joint Ventures who are primarily involved in the supervision and maintenance of specific properties. The General Partner has no employees.
 As of February 1, 2019, the Partnership and its Subsidiary Partnerships owned 2,711 residential apartment units in 23 residential and mixed‑use complexes (collectively, the “Apartment Complexes”). The Partnership also owns 19 condominium units in a residential condominium complex, all of which are leased to residential tenants (collectively referred to as the “Condominium Units”). The Apartment Complexes, the Condominium Units and the Investment Properties are located primarily in the metropolitan Boston area of Massachusetts.
 As of February 1, 2019, the Subsidiary Partnerships also owned a commercial shopping center in Framingham, Massachusetts, one commercial building in Newton and one in Brookline, Massachusetts and commercial space in mixed‑use buildings in Boston, Brockton and Newton, Massachusetts. These properties are referred to collectively as the “Commercial Properties.” See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, included as a part of this Form 10‑K.
 Additionally, as of February 1, 2019, the Partnership owned a 40‑50% interest in 8 residential and mixed use complexes, the Investment Properties, with a total of  691 residential units, one commercial unit, and a 50 car parking lot. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these investments.
 The Apartment Complexes, Investment Properties, Condominium Units and Commercial Properties are referred to collectively as the “Properties.”
 Harold Brown had, and, in certain cases, Ronald Brown, and officers and employees of the Hamilton Company own or have owned interests in certain of the Properties, Subsidiary Partnerships and Joint Ventures. See “Item 13. Certain Relationships, Related Transactions and Director Independence.”
 The leasing of real estate in the metropolitan Boston area of Massachusetts is highly competitive. The Apartment Complexes, Condominium Units and the Investment Properties must compete for tenants with other residential apartments and condominium units in the areas in which they are located. The Commercial Properties must compete for commercial tenants with other shopping malls and office buildings in the areas in which they are located. Thus, the level of competition at each Property depends on how many other similarly situated properties are in its vicinity. In addition to Item 1A, Risk Factors, See “Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Factors that May Affect Future Results.”
 The Second Amended and Restated Contract of Limited Partnership of the Partnership (the “Partnership Agreement”) authorizes the General Partner to acquire real estate and real estate related investments from or in participation with either or both of Harold Brown and Ronald Brown, or their affiliates, upon the satisfaction of certain terms and conditions, including the approval of the Partnership’s Advisory Committee and limitations on the price paid by the Partnership for such investments. The Partnership Agreement also permits the Partnership’s limited partners and the General Partner to make loans to the Partnership, subject to certain limitations on the rate of interest that may be charged to the Partnership. Except for the foregoing, the Partnership does not have any policies prohibiting any limited partner, General Partner or any other person from having any direct or indirect pecuniary interest in any investment to be acquired or disposed of by the Partnership or in any transaction to which the Partnership is a party or has an interest in or 

 
  4

 
from engaging, for their own account, in business activities of the types conducted or to be conducted by the Partnership. The General Partner is not limited in the number or amount of mortgages which may be placed on any Property, nor is there a policy limiting the percentage of Partnership assets which may be invested in any specific Property.
 Unit Distributions
 In January 2018, the Partnership approved quarterly distributions of $9.00 per Unit ($0.30 per Receipt), payable on March 31, 2018, June 15, 2018, September 15, 2018, and December 15, 2018. In 2018 the Partnership paid a total distribution of an aggregate $ 36.00 per Unit ($1.20 per Receipt) for a total payment of $4,477,923 in 2018. In 2017 the Partnership paid a total distribution of an aggregate $64.50 per Unit ($2.15 per Receipt) for a total payment of $7,985,835 in 2017. 
 On August 20, 2007, NewReal, Inc., the General Partner authorized an equity repurchase program (“Repurchase Program”) under which the Partnership was permitted to purchase, over a period of twelve months, up to 300,000 Depositary Receipts (each of which is one‑tenth of a Class A Unit). Over time, the General Partner has authorized increases in the equity repurchase program. On March 10, 2015, the General Partner authorized an increase in the Repurchase Program to 2,000,000 Depository Receipts and extended the Program for an additional five years from March 31, 2015 until March 31, 2020. The Repurchase Program requires the Partnership to repurchase a proportionate number of Class B Units and General Partner Units in connection with any repurchases of any Depositary Receipts by the Partnership based upon the 80%, 19% and 1% fixed distribution percentages of the holders of the Class A, Class B and General Partner Units under the Partnership’s Second Amended and Restate Contract of Limited Partnership. Repurchases of Depositary Receipts or Partnership Units pursuant to the Repurchase Program may be made by the Partnership from time to time in its sole discretion in open market transactions or in privately negotiated transactions. From August 20, 2007 through December 31, 2018, the Partnership has repurchased 1,365,306 Depositary Receipts at an average price of $27.14 per receipt (or $814.20 per underlying Class A Unit), 3,072 Class B Units and 162 General Partnership Units, both at an average price of $ 926.26 per Unit, totaling approximately $40,274,000 including brokerage fees paid by the Partnership. 
 Property Transactions
 On March 29, 2018, Hamilton Highlands, LLC (“Hamilton Highlands”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of New England Realty Associates Limited Partnership (the “Partnership”), purchased Webster Green Apartments, a 79 unit apartment complex located at 755-757 Highland Avenue, Needham, Massachusetts.  The sale was consummated pursuant to the terms of a Purchase and Sale Contract by and between Webster Green Apartments, LLC, the prior owner of the Property, and The Hamilton Companies, Inc., an affiliate of the Partnership, which agreement was subsequently assigned by Hamilton to Hamilton Highlands. 
     In connection with the purchase, the Hamilton Highlands entered into an Assumption and Modification Agreement dated as of March 29, 2018 with Brookline Bank pursuant to which the Hamilton Highlands assumed a note dated as of January 14, 2016 in the principal amount of $21,500,000 and various agreements relating to the Note including a Mortgage, Assignment of Leases and Rents, Security Agreement, Fixture Filing  dated as of January 14, 2016. The purchase price was $34,500,000, consisting of a payment of approximately $13,000,000 in cash and the assumption of the note and mortgage. Hamilton Highlands funded $5,000,000 of the cash portion of the purchase price out of cash reserves and the remaining $8,000,000 by drawing on an existing line of credit. The closing costs were approximately $141,000. From the purchase price, the Partnership allocated approximately $502,000 for in- place leases, and approximately $40,000 to the value of tenant relationships. These amounts are being amortized over 12 and 24 months respectively.
     On July 6, 2017, Woodland Park Partners, LLC, a newly formed subsidiary of the Partnership, purchased the Woodland Park Apartments, a 126-unit apartment complex located at 264-290 Grove Street, Newton, Massachusetts (the “Property”), for a purchase price of $45,600,000. The closing costs were approximately $64,000. To fund the purchase price, the Partnership borrowed $25,000,000 under its outstanding line of credit with KeyBank, NA, and $16,000,000 from HBC Holdings, LLC, a Massachusetts limited liability company controlled by Harold Brown. The loan from HBC Holdings was to mature on July 16, 2018, with interest only at 4.75%.  The balance of the purchase price was funded by

the Partnership’s cash reserves. The line of credit was paid down to $17,000,000 and the loan payable to HBC Holdings was paid in full through the refinancing of Woodland Park and partnership cash reserves by December 31, 2017. From the purchase price, the Partnership allocated approximately $541,000 for in- place leases, and approximately $42,000 to the value of tenant relationships. These amounts are being amortized over 12 and 24 months respectively.
     On August 3, 2016, Hamilton Green Apartments, LLC sold a single family house contiguous with its apartment complex in Andover, Massachusetts.  The sale price of the property was $1,000,000 with closing costs of $227,663 and a cost basis of $668,544 resulting in a gain on the sale of $104,443.  Included in the closing costs is a mortgage prepayment penalty of $187,905.  The proceeds from the sale were used to reduce the principal amount on the apartment complex’s mortgage.
 During 2018, the Partnership and its Subsidiary Partnerships completed improvements to certain of the Properties at a total cost of approximately $4,118,000. These improvements were funded from cash reserves and, to some extent, escrow accounts established in connection with the financing or refinancing of the applicable Properties. These sources have been adequate to fully fund improvements. The most significant improvements were made at Redwood Hills, 62 Boylston Street, Hamilton Oaks, Captain Parker, 9 School Street , and 1144 Commonwealth Apartments,  at a cost of $704,000, $441,000,  $415,000, $312,000, $295,000, and $262,000 respectively. The Partnership plans to invest approximately $3,500,000 in capital improvements in 2019.

 Line of Credit 
 On July 31, 2014, the Partnership entered into an agreement for a $25,000,000 revolving line of credit.  The term of the line was for three years with a floating interest rate equal to a base rate of the greater of (a) the Prime Rate (b) the Federal Funds Rate plus one-half of one percent per annum, or (c) the LIBOR Rate for a period of one month plus 1% per annum, plus the  applicable margin of 2.5%.

 On July 6, 2017, the credit line had an outstanding balance of $25,000,000, which was drawn down in its’ entirety and was used  in conjunction with a loan of $16,000,000 from HBC Holdings, LLC, a Massachusetts Limited Liability company controlled by Harold Brown, and cash reserves, to purchase Woodland Park Partners, LLC (“Woodland Park”).
  On September 29, 2017, Woodland Park Partners, LLC entered into a Multifamily Loan and Security Agreement with KeyBank National Association. As a result of securing the financing, the Partnership used the proceeds of the loan to pay off the loan from HBC Holdings, LLC. The Line of Credit was paid down by $8,000,000 on October 5, 2017 with both proceeds from the financing and cash reserves of the Partnership. 
 On March 29, 2018, the Partnership drew down $8,000,000 in conjunction with the purchase of Webster Green Apartments.  On June 4, 2018, the Partnership paid down the credit line by $16,000,000 as a result of the proceeds from the refinancing of Hamilton Park Towers, LLC, also known as Dexter Park. In July, 2018, the Partnership paid down the line of credit by $4,000,000. In October of 2018, the Partnership paid down the Line of Credit by $3,000,000. As of December 31, 2018, the credit line had an outstanding balance of $2,000,000. Subsequent to the end of the year, the line was paid down in full.
 The line of credit may be used for acquisition, refinancing, improvements, working capital and other needs of the Partnership. The line may not be used to pay distributions, make distributions or acquire equity interests of the Partnership. 
 The line of credit is collateralized by varying percentages of the Partnership’s ownership interest in 23 of its

subsidiary properties and joint ventures. Pledged interests range from 49% to 100% of the Partnership’s ownership interest in the respective entities. 
 The Partnership paid fees to secure the line of credit. Any unused balance of the line of credit is subject to a fee ranging from 15 to 20 basis points per annum. The Partnership paid approximately $27,000 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018.
 The line of credit agreement has several covenants, such as providing cash flow projections and compliance certificates, as well as other financial information. The covenants include, but are not limited to the following: maintain a leverage ratio that does not exceed 65%; aggregate increase in indebtedness of the subsidiaries and joint ventures should not exceed $15,000,000; maintain a tangible net worth (as defined in the agreement) of a minimum of $150,000,000; a minimum ratio of net operating income to total indebtedness of at least 9.5%; debt service coverage ratio of at least 1.6 to 1, as well as other items.
