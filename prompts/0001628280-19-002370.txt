Item 1.        Business
Altice USA, Inc. ("Altice USA" or the "Company") was incorporated in Delaware on September 14, 2015. Prior to the Altice Europe Distribution discussed below, Altice USA was majority-owned by Altice Europe N.V. (formerly Altice N.V.), a public company with limited liability (naamloze vennootshcap) under Dutch law ("Altice Europe" and Altice Europe N.V. and its subsidiaries, the "Altice Group"). Since the completion of the Altice Europe Distribution discussed below, the Company is majority-owned by Patrick Drahi through Next Alt. S.a.r.l. ("Next Alt") rather than Altice Europe. 
Altice USA is one of the largest broadband communications and video services providers in the United States and markets its services under two brands: Optimum, in the New York metropolitan area, and Suddenlink, principally in markets in the south-central United States. We deliver broadband, pay television, telephony services, proprietary content and advertising services to approximately 4.9 million residential and business customers. Our footprint extends across 21 states through a fiber-rich broadband network with more than 8.7 million homes passed as of December 31, 2018. 
We acquired Cequel Corporation ("Suddenlink" or "Cequel") on December 21, 2015 and Cablevision Systems Corporation ("Optimum" or "Cablevision") on June 21, 2016. These acquisitions are referred to throughout this document as the "Suddenlink Acquisition" (or the "Cequel Acquisition") and the "Optimum Acquisition" (or the "Cablevision Acquisition"), respectively, and collectively as the "Acquisitions." We are a holding company that does not conduct any business operations of our own and we operate as one segment.
We are building a fiber-to-the-home ("FTTH") network, which will enable us to deliver more than 10 Gbps broadband speeds across our entire Optimum footprint and part of our Suddenlink footprint. Altice Gigabit fiber service provides a next-generation connectivity experience to support the most data-intensive activities, from streaming 4K ultra-high-definition ("UHD") and high-definition ("HD") video on multiple devices, online multi-player video game streaming platforms, video chatting, streaming music, high-quality virtual-and augmented reality experiences, and downloading large files simultaneously on dozens of devices at once. While building the FTTH network, we also continue to roll out enhanced broadband services to our customers on our existing hybrid fiber-coaxial ("HFC") network which is digital and data over cable service interface specification ("DOCSIS") 3.0. In addition to our Altice Gigabit fiber service, 1Gbps broadband services are expected to be available across our Optimum footprint in 2019 through Digital Switched Video upgrades. In addition, further 1Gbps capacity will be added in certain areas in our Suddenlink footprint. 
During the fourth quarter of 2017, we introduced a home communications hub, Altice One, and we continue expanding the availability of this device. Altice One is an innovative, integrated platform with a dynamic and sophisticated user interface, combining a set-top box, Internet wireless router and cable modem in one device, and it is our most advanced home communications hub. The initial roll out of Altice One across our footprint is now complete, with availability to over 80% of our entire footprint. We have reached approximately 300 thousand Altice One customers as of December 31, 2018.

See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for further details. 

Altice Europe Distribution
On June 8, 2018, Altice Europe distributed substantially all of its equity interest in the Company through a distribution in kind to holders of Altice Europe's common shares A and common shares B (the “Distribution”). The Distribution took place by way of a special distribution in kind by Altice Europe of its 67.2% interest in the Company to Altice Europe shareholders. Each shareholder of Altice Europe on May 23, 2018, the Distribution record date, received 0.4163 shares of the Company's common stock for every share held by such shareholder in Altice Europe. Between May 24, 2018 and June 4, 2018, each Altice Europe shareholder was given the opportunity to elect the percentage of shares of the Company's Class A common stock and shares of the Company's Class B common stock such shareholder would receive in the Distribution, whereby the number of shares of the Company's Class B common stock to be distributed was subject to a cap of 50% of the total shares of the Company's common stock being distributed (the “Class B Cap”). Because the Class B Cap had been exceeded, the shares of the Company's Class B common stock delivered to Altice Europe’s shareholders of record who elected to receive them were subject to proration, and such shareholders received additional shares of the Company's Class A common stock to the extent of the excess.
Immediately following the Distribution, there were 489,384,523 shares of Altice USA Class A common stock and 247,684,443 shares of Altice USA Class B common stock outstanding.
Prior to Altice Europe's announcement of the Distribution, the Board of Directors of Altice USA, acting through its independent directors, approved the payment of a $2.035 per share dividend to all shareholders of record on May 22, 2018. The payment of the dividend, aggregating approximately $1.5 billion, was made on June 6, 2018, and was funded with cash at CSC Holdings LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cablevision, from financings completed in January 2018, and cash generated from operations at Cequel. In connection with the payment of the dividend, the Company recorded a decrease in retained earnings of $536.2 million, representing the cumulative earnings through the payment date, and a decrease in paid in capital of $963.7 million.
In connection with the Distribution, the Management Advisory and Consulting Services Agreement with Altice Europe, which provided certain consulting, advisory and other services, was terminated. Compensation under the terms of the agreement was an annual fee of $30 million paid by the Company.
Our Products and Services
We provide broadband, pay television and telephony services to both residential and business customers. We also provide enterprise-grade fiber connectivity, bandwidth and managed services to enterprise customers through our Lightpath business (also marketed as Altice Business) and we provide advertising time and services to advertisers.
The prices we charge for our services vary based on the number of services and associated service level or tier our customers choose, coupled with any promotions we may offer. As part of our marketing strategy our customers are increasingly choosing to bundle their subscriptions to two (‘‘double product’’) or three (‘‘triple product’’) of our services at the same time. Customers who subscribe to a bundle generally receive a discount from the price of buying each of these services separately, as well as the convenience of receiving multiple services from a single provider, all on a single monthly bill. For example, we offer an ‘‘Optimum Triple Play’’ package that is a special promotion for new customers or eligible current customers where Optimum broadband, pay television and telephony services are each available at a reduced rate for a specified period when purchased together. Approximately 50% of our residential customers were triple product customers as of December 31, 2018.

Broadband Services
We offer a variety of broadband service tiers tailored to meet the different needs of our residential customers. Current customer offers include five tiers with download speeds ranging from 20 Mbps to 400 Mbps for our residential customers in our Optimum service area and 50 Mbps to 1 Gbps for our residential customers in our Suddenlink service area. Our broadband services also include the Optimum wireless router, as well as Internet security software, including anti-virus, anti-spyware, personal firewall and anti-spam protection. Substantially all of our HFC network is digital and data over cable service interface specification DOCSIS 3.0 compatible, with approximately 280 homes per node and a bandwidth capacity of at least 750 MHz throughout. This network allows us to provide our customers with advanced broadband, pay television and telephony services. 
In addition, we have deployed Wi-Fi across our New York metropolitan service area with approximately 1.94 million Wi-Fi hotspots as of December 31, 2018. The Wi-Fi network allows broadband customers to access the service while they are away from their home or office. Wi-Fi is delivered via wireless access points mounted on our broadband network, in certain retail partner locations, certain NJ Transit rail stations, New York City parks and other public venues. Similarly, our wireless router product includes a second network that enables all broadband customers to access the Wi-Fi network. Access to the Wi-Fi network is offered as a free value-added benefit to broadband customers and for a fee to non-customers in certain locations. Our Wi-Fi service also allows our broadband customers to access the Wi-Fi networks of Comcast Corporation ("Comcast"), Charter Communications, Inc. ("Charter") and Cox Communications, Inc. Through these relationships we offer our customers access to additional hotspots nationwide.
Pay Television Services
We currently offer a variety of pay television services, which include delivery of broadcast stations and cable networks, and advanced digital pay television services, such as video-on-demand ("VOD"), high-definition ("HD") channels, digital video recorder ("DVR") and pay-per-view, to our residential markets. Depending on the market and level of service, our pay television services include, among other programming, local broadcast networks and independent television stations, news, information, sports and entertainment channels, regional sports networks, international channels and premium services such as HBO, Showtime, Cinemax, Starz, and The Movie Channel. Our residential customers pay a monthly charge based on the pay television programming level of service, tier or package they receive and the type of equipment they select. Customers who subscribe to seasonal sports packages, international channels and premium services may be charged an additional monthly amount. We may also charge additional fees for pay-per-view programming and events, DVR and certain VOD services.
As of December 31, 2018, our residential customers were able to receive between 436 to 614 digital channels depending on their market and level of service. In addition, depending on the service area, we offer between 143 to 180 HD channels which represent the most widely watched programming, including all major broadcast networks, as well as most leading 
4

national cable networks, premium channels and regional sports networks. HDTV features high-resolution picture quality, digital sound quality and a wide-screen, theater-like display when using an HDTV set and an HD-capable converter. We also continue to launch additional HD channels to continuously improve our customer's viewing experience. As of December 31, 2018, over 95% of our residential pay television customers were digital pay television customers who subscribed to HDTV services. 
We also provide advanced services, such as pay-per-view and VOD, that give residential pay television customers control over when they watch their favorite programming. Our pay-per-view service allows customers to pay to view single showings of programming on an unedited, commercial-free basis, including feature films, live sporting events, concerts and other special events. Our VOD service provides on-demand access to movies, special events, free prime time content and general interest titles. Subscription-based VOD premium content such as HBO and Showtime is made available to customers who subscribe to one of our premium programming packages. Our customers have the ability to start the programs at whatever time is convenient, as well as pause, rewind and (for most content) fast forward both standard definition and HD VOD programming. As of December 31, 2018, pay-per-view services were available to over 99% of all our pay television customers and VOD services were available to over 95% of our pay television customers, and we offer thousands of HD titles on-demand.
For a monthly fee, we offer DVR services through the use of digital converters, the majority of which are HDTV-capable and have video recording capability.  Customers can choose either a set-top box DVR with the ability to record, pause and rewind live television or the Cloud DVR Plus with remote-storage capability to record 15 shows simultaneously while watching any live or pre-recorded show, and pause and rewind live television. Depending on the service area and market, customers have the option to use a set-top box DVR or a TiVo HD/DVR converter, which delivers multi-room DVR capability using TiVo Mini devices that allow customers to pause and rewind live television, manage recordings from different television locations and play them back throughout the home. In addition, TiVo Stream service, which allows customers to stream live television channels and recorded programming wirelessly throughout their home to Android and iOS devices, and, subject to copyright restrictions, download previously recorded content to these devices so that it can be viewed outside the home, is provided to current TiVo DVR customers.
During the fourth quarter of 2017, we introduced a home communications hub, called Altice One. This hub is an innovative, integrated platform with a dynamic and sophisticated user interface, combining a set-top box, Internet wireless router and cable modem in one device. It is based on LaBox, which Altice Europe has successfully deployed in France, the Dominican Republic and Israel, and is initially offered to new customers subscribing to our double and triple-product packages. It is capable of delivering broadband Internet, Wi-Fi, digital television services, over-the-top ("OTT") services and fixed-line telephony and supports 4K video and Cloud DVR with the capacity to record 15 television programs simultaneously and the ability to rewind live television on the last two channels watched. Additional features include a point-anywhere voice-command remote control and a companion mobile app that allows viewing of all television content including DVR streaming.  Additional televisions will be paired with "minis," which can also act as Wi-Fi extenders for an advanced Wi-Fi experience throughout the home. During the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company updated Altice One's operating system which added additional enhanced mobility and more advanced features for customers, including the ability to watch Cloud DVR content on the go on the Altice One mobile app. This operating system also brings Altice One customers access to the YouTube Kids app, the ability to use voice search on YouTube to discover videos, more 4K content for a vivid viewing experience, and live show restart on more than 20 additional networks.         
For our customers without Altice One we also offer alternative viewing platforms for our pay television programming through mobile applications.  Optimum customers have access to the Optimum App, available for the iPad, iPhone, iPod touch, personal computers, Kindle Fire and select Android phones and tablets, and Suddenlink customers have access to Suddenlink2GO, available for personal computers and select phones and tablets. Depending on the platform, the Optimum App features include the ability to watch live television, stream on-demand titles from various networks and use the device as a remote to control the customer's digital set-top box while inside the home. Suddenlink2GO enables customers to watch movies, shows and clips on a personal computer once authenticated via a customer portal and select television shows and movies on their mobile devices. 
Telephony Services
Through voice over Internet protocol ("VoIP") telephone service we also offer unlimited local, regional and long-distance calling within the United States, Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands and Canada for a flat monthly rate, including popular calling 
5

features such as caller ID with name and number, call waiting, three-way calling, enhanced emergency 911 dialing and television caller ID. We also offer additional options designed to meet our customers' needs, including directory assistance, voicemail services and international calling. Discount and promotional pricing are available when our telephony services are combined with our other service offerings.
Mobile
In the fourth quarter of 2017, we and Sprint Corporation ("Sprint") entered into a multi-year strategic agreement pursuant to which we will utilize Sprint's network to provide mobile voice and data services to our customers throughout the nation, and our broadband network will be utilized to accelerate the densification of Sprint's network. The Company continues to develop the core network to support its infrastructure-based mobile virtual network operator ("MVNO") including upgrading and expanding its Wi-Fi network. The Company’s full MVNO agreement with Sprint is differentiated from other light MVNOs in that it gives the Company full access control, including over its own core network, Home Location Register and SIM cards. This will allow the Company to fully control seamless data offloading and the handover between the fixed and wireless networks. In addition, the Company will have full product, features and marketing flexibility with its new mobile service. Mobile service for Altice USA customers is expected to be launched in 2019. We believe this product offering will enable us to deliver greater value and more benefits to our customers by offering mobile voice and data services, in addition to our broadband, pay television, and telephony services.
Business Services
Both our Optimum and Suddenlink businesses offer a wide and growing variety of products and services to both large enterprise and small and medium-sized business ("SMB") customers, including broadband, telephony, networking and pay television services. As of December 31, 2018, our Optimum business served approximately 263 thousand SMB customers and our Suddenlink business served approximately 114 thousand SMB customers. We serve enterprise customers primarily through our Lightpath business, a subsidiary of Cablevision.
Enterprise Customers
Lightpath provides Ethernet, data transport, IP-based virtual private networks, Internet access, telephony services, including session initiated protocol ("SIP") trunking and VoIP services to the business market in the New York metropolitan area. Our Lightpath bandwidth connectivity service offers speeds up to 100 Gbps. Lightpath also provides managed services to businesses, including hosted telephony services (cloud based SIP-based private branch exchange), managed Wi-Fi, managed desktop and server backup and managed collaboration services including audio and web conferencing. Through Lightpath, we also offer fiber-to-the-tower ("FTTT") services to wireless carriers for cell tower backhaul and enable wireline communications service providers to connect to customers that their own networks do not reach. Lightpath's customers include companies in health care, financial, education, legal and professional services, and other industries, as well as the public sector and communication providers, incumbent local exchange carriers ("ILEC"), and competitive local exchange carriers ("CLEC"). As of December 31, 2018, Lightpath had over 10,100 locations connected to its fiber network. Our Lightpath advanced fiber optic network extends more than 7,500 route miles, which includes approximately 375,000 miles of fiber, throughout the New York metropolitan area.
For enterprise and larger commercial customers, Suddenlink offers high capacity data services, including wide area networking and dedicated data access and advanced services such as wireless mesh networks. Suddenlink also offers enterprise class telephone services which include traditional multi-line phone service over DOCSIS and trunking solutions via SIP for our Primary Rate Interface and SIP trunking applications. Similar to Lightpath, Suddenlink also offers FTTT services. These Suddenlink services are offered on a standalone basis or in bundles that are developed specifically for our commercial customers.
SMB Customers
Both Optimum and Suddenlink provide broadband, pay television and telephony services to SMB customers. In addition to these services, we also offer managed services, including business e-mail, hosted private branch exchange, web space storage and network security monitoring for SMB customers. Telephony services include Optimum Voice for Business, Suddenlink Business Class Phones, Business Hosted Voice and Business Trunking (SIP and PRI). Optional telephony add-on services include international calling and toll free numbers.

Advertising
a4
a4 is the advanced advertising and data solutions subsidiary of Altice USA. It provides audience-based, IP-authenticated cross-screen advertising solutions to local, regional and national businesses and advertising clients.  a4 enables advertisers to reach U.S. households across their devices through cable networks, on-demand and addressable inventory.
New York Interconnect 
In many markets, we have entered into agreements commonly referred to as “Interconnects” with other cable operators to jointly sell local advertising. This simplifies our clients' purchase of local advertising and expanding their geographic reach. In some markets, we represent the advertising sales efforts of other cable operators; in others, other cable operators represent us. For example, we manage NY Interconnect, LLC, a partnership launched in the second quarter 2018 between Altice USA, Charter and Comcast. This provides national brands with television and digital advertising opportunities to millions of households across the New York designated market area ("DMA"). 
News 12 Networks
Our News 12 Networks consists of seven 24-hour local news channels in the New York metropolitan area—the Bronx, Brooklyn, Connecticut, Hudson Valley, Long Island, New Jersey and Westchester—providing each with complete access to hyper-local breaking news, traffic, weather, sports, and more. In addition, News 12 Networks also includes five traffic and weather channels that offer constantly updated information; the award-winning News12.com; the News 12 app available on Apple and Android products; the News 12 app on the Altice One Box; channel 612 on Optimum TV, providing local news on demand; and News 12 OTT products on Amazon, Apple, and Roku devices.
Since launching in 1986, News 12 Networks has been widely recognized by the news industry with numerous prestigious honors and awards, including Emmy Awards, plus multiple Edward R. Murrow Awards, NY Press Club Awards, and more. We derive revenue from our News 12 Networks for the sale of advertising and affiliation fees paid by cable operators. 
i24NEWS
i24NEWS consists of three 24-hour global channels in New York, Paris, and Israel. Each channel provides global breaking news and world stories with a focus on the Middle East and Israel. In addition, i24NEWS allows viewers to access programming on i24NEWS.tv, the i24NEWS app available on Apple and Android products; the i24NEWS app on the Altice One Box; and i24NEWS OTT products on Amazon, Apple, and Roku devices. i24NEWS launched in English, French, and Arabic in July 2013.
In April 2018, Altice Europe transferred its ownership of i24NEWS to the Company for minimal consideration (the "i24 Acquisition"). As the acquisition was a combination of businesses under common control, the Company combined the results of operations and related assets and liabilities of i24NEWS as of April 1, 2018. Operating results for periods prior to April 1, 2018 and the balance sheet as of December 31, 2017 have not been revised to reflect the i24 Acquisition as the impact was deemed immaterial. 
Altice Technical Services
In January 2018, the Company acquired 70% of the equity interests in Altice Technical Services US Corp. ("ATS") for $1.00 (the "ATS Acquisition") and the Company became the owner of 100% of the equity interests in ATS in March 2018. ATS was previously owned by Altice Europe and a member of ATS's management through a holding company. In light of Altice Europe's determination to focus on businesses other than the Company, we and Altice Europe concluded it was in Altice Europe's and the Company's interests for Altice USA to own and operate ATS. The ATS Acquisition was approved by our Audit Committee pursuant to the Company's related-party transaction approval policy. As the acquisition is a combination of businesses under common control, the Company combined the results of operations and related assets and liabilities of ATS for all periods since its formation. 
ATS provides technical operating services, including field services, such as dispatch, customer installations, disconnects, service changes and other customer service visits, outside plant maintenance services and design and construction services for HFC and FTTH infrastructure.

Franchises
As of December 31, 2018, our systems operated in more than 1,300 communities pursuant to franchises, permits and similar authorizations issued by state and local governmental authorities. Franchise agreements typically require the payment of franchise fees and contain regulatory provisions addressing, among other things, service quality, cable service to schools and other public institutions, insurance and indemnity. Franchise authorities generally charge a franchise fee of not more than 5% of certain of our cable service revenues that are derived from the operation of the system within such locality. We generally pass the franchise fee on to our customers.
Franchise agreements are usually for a term of 5 to 15 years from the date of grant (a majority of which are for 10 years), however, approximately 400 of Altice’s communities are located in states (Connecticut, Missouri, North Carolina and Texas) where by law franchise agreements do not have an expiration date. Franchise agreements are usually terminable only if the cable operator fails to comply with material provisions and then only after the franchising authority complies with substantive and procedural protections afforded by the franchise agreement and federal and state law. Prior to the scheduled expiration of most franchises, we generally initiate renewal proceedings with the granting authorities. This process usually takes less than three years but can take a longer period of time. The Communications Act, which is the primary federal statute regulating interstate communications, provides for an orderly franchise renewal process in which granting authorities may not unreasonably withhold renewals. See "Regulation—Cable Television—Franchising." In connection with the franchise renewal process, many governmental authorities require the cable operator to make certain commitments, such as building out certain franchise areas, meeting customer service requirements and supporting and carrying public access channels.
Historically, we have been able to renew our franchises without incurring significant costs, although any particular franchise may not be renewed on commercially favorable terms or otherwise. We expect to renew or continue to operate under all or substantially all of these franchises. For more information regarding risks related to our franchises, see "Risk Factors—Risk Factors Relating to Regulatory and Legislative Matters—Our cable system franchises are subject to non-renewal or termination. The failure to renew a franchise in one or more key markets could adversely affect our business." Proposals to streamline cable franchising recently have been adopted at both the federal and state levels. For more information see "Regulation—Cable Television—Franchising."
Programming
We design our channel line-ups for each system according to demographics, programming contract requirements, market research, viewership, local programming preferences, channel capacity, competition, price sensitivity and local regulation. We believe offering a wide variety of programming influences a customer's decision to subscribe to and retain our pay television services. We obtain programming, including basic, expanded basic, digital, HD, HD 4K, VOD and broadband content, from a number of suppliers, including broadcast and cable networks.
We generally carry cable networks pursuant to written programming contracts, which continue for a fixed period of time, usually from three to five years, and are subject to negotiated renewal. Cable network programming is usually made available to us for a license fee, which is generally paid based on the number of customers who subscribe to the level of service that provides such programming. Such license fees may include "volume" discounts available for higher numbers of customers, as well as discounts for channel placement or service penetration. Where possible, we negotiate volume discount pricing structures. For home shopping channels, we receive a percentage of the revenue attributable to our customers' purchases, as well as, in some instances, incentives for channel placement.
We typically seek flexible distribution terms that would permit services to be made available in a variety of retail packages and on a variety of platforms and devices in order to maximize consumer choice. Suppliers typically insist that their most popular and attractive services be distributed to a minimum number or percentage of customers, which limits our ability to provide consumers full purchasing flexibility. Suppliers also typically seek to control or limit the terms on which we are able to make their services available on various platforms and devices yet this has become more flexible each year.
Our cable programming costs have increased in excess of customary inflationary and cost-of-living type increases. We expect programming costs to continue to increase due to a variety of factors including annual increases imposed by stations and programmers and additional programming being provided to customers, including HD, HD 4K, digital and VOD programming. In particular, broadcast and sports programming costs have increased significantly over the past 
8

several years. In addition, contracts to purchase sports programming sometimes provide for optional additional programming to be available on a surcharge basis during the term of the contract. These increases have coincided with a significant increase in the quality of the programming, from high production value original cable series to enhanced camera and statistical data technology in sports broadcasts, and more flexible rights to make the content available on various platforms and devices.
We have programming contracts that have expired and others that will expire in the near term. We will seek to renegotiate the terms of these agreements, but there can be no assurance that these agreements will be renewed on favorable or comparable terms. To the extent that we are unable to reach agreement with certain programmers on terms that we believe are reasonable, we have been, and may in the future be, forced to remove such programming channels from our line-up, which may result in a loss of customers. For example, in 2017, we were unable to reach agreement with Starz on acceptable economic terms, and effective January 1, 2018, all Starz services were removed from our lineups, and we launched alternative networks offered by other programmers under new long-term contracts. On February 13, 2018, we and Starz reached a new carriage agreement and we started restoring the Starz services previously offered. Also in our Suddenlink business, we were unable to reach agreement with Viacom on acceptable economic terms for a long-term contract renewal, and effective October 1, 2014, all Viacom networks were removed from our channel lineups in our Suddenlink business, and we launched alternative networks offered by other programmers under new long-term contracts. We and Viacom did not reach a new agreement to include certain Viacom networks in the Suddenlink channel lineup until May 2017. For more information, see "Risk Factors—Risk Factors Relating to Our Business—Programming and retransmission costs are increasing and we may not have the ability to pass these increases on to our customers. Disputes with programmers and the inability to retain or obtain popular programming can adversely affect our relationship with customers and lead to customer losses."
Sales and Marketing
Sales are managed centrally and multiple sales channels allow us to reach each current and potential customers in a variety of ways, including in-bound customer care centers, outbound telemarketing, stores, field technician sales and door-to-door sales. E-commerce is also managed centrally on behalf of the organization and is a growing and dynamic part of our business and is our fastest growing sales channel. We also use mass media, including broadcast television, digital media, radio, newspaper and outdoor advertising, to attract customers and direct them to our in-bound customer care centers or website. Our sales and service employees use a variety of sales tools as they work to match customers' needs with our best-in-class products, with a focus on building and enhancing customer relationships.
Because of our local presence and market knowledge, we invest heavily in targeted marketing. Our strategic focus is on building new customer relationships and bundling broadband, pay television and telephony services. Our promotional materials and messaging focus on how our products and services deliver innovative solutions to customer pain points. Much of our advertising is developed centrally and customized for our regions. Among other factors, we monitor customer perceptions, marketing tactic impact and competition, to increase our responsiveness and the effectiveness of our efforts. Our footprint has several large college markets where we market specialized products and services to students for multiple dwelling units ("MDUs"), such as dormitories and apartment complexes.
We have separate dedicated sales teams for our SMB and enterprise offerings and dedicated service teams to support SMB and enterprise clients.
Customer Experience
We believe customer service is the cornerstone of our business, and our strategy is to prove in our markets that we are "reliable, technical experts, and simple to interact with"; and in the event of a service failure we are "responsive and courteous" to reconcile the relationship. Accordingly, we make a concerted effort to continually improve each customer's experience and have made significant investments in our people, processes and technology to enhance our customers' experience and to reduce the number of times customers need to contact us. We hire and develop talent to be customer-centric. 
The insights from operational metrics help us focus our improvement efforts. Listening to and acting upon feedback is a major pillar in our customer experience program. We review feedback as part of our daily operations.
9

We provide technical service to our customers 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and we have systems that allow our customer care centers to be accessed and managed remotely in the event that systems functionality is temporarily lost, which provides our customers access to customer service with limited disruption.
We are prioritizing new capabilities such as engaging outbound messaging, automated digital assistance, searchable help, simpler self-service, and more efficient support operations, intended to foster a premium, digital customer experience that builds a foundation to anticipate customers’ needs.
We also utilize our customer portal to enable our customers to view and pay their bills online, obtain useful information and perform various equipment troubleshooting procedures. Our customers may also obtain support through our online chat, e-mail functionality and social media websites, including Twitter and Facebook.
Network Management
Our cable systems are generally designed with an HFC architecture that has proven to be highly flexible in meeting the increasing needs of our customers. We deliver our signals via laser-fed fiber optic cable from control centers known as headends and hubs to individual nodes. Each node is connected to the individual homes served by us. A primary benefit of this design is that it pushes fiber optics closer to our customers' homes, which allows us to subdivide our systems into smaller service groups and make capital investments only in service groups experiencing higher than average service growth.
As of December 31, 2018, approximately 95% of our basic pay television customers were served by systems with a capacity of at least 750 MHz and approximately 280 homes per node. Our Optimum network has been upgraded to nearly four times the maximum available broadband speeds since the Cablevision Acquisition, and we have expanded our Gbps broadband service to approximately 76% of our Suddenlink footprint, compared to approximately 40% prior to the Suddenlink Acquisition. More than 99% of our residential broadband Internet customers are connected to our national backbone with a presence in major carrier access points in New York, Dallas, Chicago, San Jose, Washington D.C. and Phoenix. This presence allows us to avoid significant Internet transit costs by establishing peering relationships with major Internet service and content providers enabling direct connectivity with them at these access points.
We also have a networking caching architecture that places highly viewed Internet traffic from the largest Internet-based content providers at the edge of the network closest to the customer to reduce bandwidth requirements across our national backbone, thus reducing operating expense. This collective network architecture also provides us with the capability to manage traffic across several Internet access points, thus helping to ensure Internet access redundancy and quality of service for our customers. Additionally, our national backbone connects most of our systems, which allows for an efficient and economical deployment of services from our centralized platforms that include telephone, VOD, network DVR, common pay television content, broadband Internet, hosted business solutions, provisioning, e-mail and other related services.
We have also commenced a plan to build a FTTH network, which will enable us to deliver more than 10 Gbps broadband speeds across our entire Optimum footprint and part of our Suddenlink footprint. We believe this FTTH network will be more resilient with reduced maintenance requirements, fewer service outages and lower power usage, which we expect will drive further structural cost efficiencies.
We have also focused on system reliability and disaster recovery as part of our national backbone and primary system strategy. For example, to help ensure a high level of reliability of our services, we implemented redundant power capability, as well as fiber route and carrier diversity in our networks serving most of our customers. With respect to disaster recovery, we invested in our telephone platform architecture for geo-redundancy to minimize downtime in the event of a disaster to any single facility. Additionally, we are working to implement a geo-redundant disaster recovery environment for our network operations center supporting both residential and business customers.
In addition, we have expanded and refined our bandwidth utilization in capacity constrained systems in order to meet demand for new and improved advanced services. A key component to reclaim bandwidth was the digital delivery of pay television channels that were previously distributed in analog through the launch of digital simulcast, which duplicates analog channels as digital channels. Additionally, the deployment of lower-cost digital customer premises equipment, such as HD digital transport adapters, enabled the use of more efficient digital channels instead of analog channels, thus allowing the reclamation of expanded basic analog bandwidth in the targeted systems. This reclaimed analog bandwidth could then be repurposed for other advanced services such as additional HDTV services and faster Internet access speeds. 
10

This technology has the added benefit of providing improved picture and sound quality to customers for most of their pay television programming.
We have commenced building a nationwide mobile core network with four main interconnection points (New Jersey, Texas, California and Illinois), as well as the necessary interconnection points for Sprint and other roaming partners. We completed calls across our core network on September 6, 2018. As of December 31, 2018, we are continuing the development of carrier bundles with original equipment manufacturers in anticipation of the launch of our mobile voice and data business in 2019.
Information Technology
Our IT systems consist of billing, customer relationship management, business and operational support and sales force management systems. We are updating and simplifying our IT infrastructure through further investments, focusing on cost efficiencies, improved system reliability, functionality and scalability and enhancing the ability of our IT infrastructure to meet our ongoing business objectives. Additionally, through investment in our IT platforms and focus on process improvement, we have simplified and harmonized our service offering bundles and improved our technical service delivery and customer service. We contract with managed service providers to deliver core Business Support Systems and Operations Support Systems. These services are integrated into our overall IT ecosystems to ensure an efficient operation. Backup services are provided through alternate systems and infrastructure.
Suppliers
Customer Premise and Network Equipment
We purchase set-top boxes and other customer premise equipment from a limited number of vendors because our cable systems use one or two proprietary technology architectures. We also buy HD, HD/DVRs and VOD equipment, routers, including the components of our new home communications hub, and other network equipment from a limited number of suppliers, including Altice Labs, Altice Europe's technology, services and innovation center. See "Risk Factors—Risk Factors Relating to Our Business—We rely on network and information systems for our operations and a disruption or failure of, or defects in, those systems may disrupt our operations, damage our reputation with customers and adversely affect our results of operations."
Broadband and Telephone Connectivity
We deliver broadband and telephony services through our HFC network. We use circuits that are either owned by us or rented from third parties to connect to the Internet and the public switched telephone network. We pay fees for rented circuits based on the amount of capacity available to it and pay for Internet connectivity based on the amount of IP-based traffic received from and sent over the other carrier's network.
Mobile Voice and Data Equipment
We expect to purchase for resale mobile handsets from a limited number of vendors. Customers of our mobile service are expected to be able to purchase these handsets with upfront payments or financed without interest over a 24-month period.
Competition
We operate in a highly competitive, consumer-driven industry and we compete against a variety of broadband, pay television and mobile and fixed-line telephony providers and delivery systems, including broadband communications companies, wireless data and telephony providers, satellite delivered video signals, Internet-delivered video content and broadcast television signals available to residential and business customers in our service areas. We believe our leading market position in our footprint, technologically advanced network infrastructure, including our FTTH build-out, our home communications hub and our focus on enhancing the customer experience favorably position us to compete in our industry. See also "Risk Factors—Risk Factors Relating to Our Business—We operate in a highly competitive business environment which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity."

Broadband Services Competition
Our broadband services face competition from broadband communications companies' digital subscriber line ("DSL"), FTTH and wireless broadband offerings as well as from a variety of companies that offer other forms of online services, including satellite-based broadband services. Current and future fixed and wireless Internet services, such as 3G, 4G and 5G fixed and wireless broadband services and Wi-Fi networks, and devices such as wireless data cards, tablets and smartphones, and mobile wireless routers that connect to such devices, may compete with our broadband services.
Pay Television Services Competition
We face intense competition from broadband communications companies with fiber-based networks, primarily Verizon Communications Inc. ("Verizon"), which has constructed a FTTH network plant that passes a significant number of households in our Optimum service area. We estimate that Verizon is currently able to sell a fiber-based pay television service, as well as broadband and VoIP services, to at least half of the households in our Optimum service area. In addition, Frontier Communications Corporation ("Frontier") offers pay television service in competition with us in most of our Connecticut service area.
We also compete with direct broadcast satellite ("DBS") providers, such as DirecTV (a subsidiary of AT&T Inc.) and DISH Network Corporation ("DISH"). DirecTV and DISH offer one-way satellite-delivered pre-packaged programming services that are received by relatively small and inexpensive receiving dishes. DirecTV has exclusive arrangements with the National Football League that give it access to programming that we cannot offer. In 2018 AT&T acquired Time Warner, which owns a number of cable networks, including TBS, CNN and HBO, as well as Warner Bros. Entertainment, which produces television, film and home-video content. AT&T's and DirecTV's potential access to Time Warner programming could allow AT&T and DirecTV to offer competitive and promotional packages. However, we believe cable-delivered VOD services, which include HD programming, offer a competitive advantage to DBS service because cable headends can provide two-way communication to deliver a large volume of programming which customers can access and control independently, whereas DBS technology can only make available a much smaller amount of programming with DVR-like customer control.
Our pay television services also face competition from a number of other sources, including companies that deliver movies, television shows and other pay television programming over broadband Internet connections to televisions, computers, tablets and mobile devices, such as Netflix, Hulu, iTunes, YouTube, Amazon Prime, Sling TV, Playstation Vue, DirecTV Now, and Locast.
Telephony Services Competition
Our telephony service competes with wireline, wireless and OTT phone providers, such as Vonage, Skype, GoogleTalk, Facetime, WhatsApp and magicJack, as well as companies that sell phone cards at a cost per minute for both national and international service. In addition, we compete with other forms of communication, such as text messaging on cellular phones, instant messaging, social networking services, video conferencing and email. The increase in the number of different technologies capable of carrying telephony services and the number of alternative communication options available to customers as well as the replacement of wireline services by wireless have intensified the competitive environment in which we operate our telephony services.
Mobile Wireless Competition
Our mobile wireless service, expected to launch in 2019, will face competition from a number of incumbent network-based mobile service providers (like AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile US, Inc. ("T-Mobile") and Sprint), as well as a number of reseller or MVNO providers (such as Tracfone, Boost Mobile and Cricket Wireless). We believe that our approach to the mobile wireless service offering, including the construction and operation of our own "mobile core" and the ability to bundle and promote the product to our existing customer base, will give us advantages over resellers and incumbent network-based operators alike. Our mobile wireless strategy depends on the availability of wholesale access to radio access networks ("RAN") from one or more network-based providers with whom we are likely to compete. Our mobile service is vulnerable to constraints on the availability of wholesale access or increases in price from the incumbents. Consolidation among wholesale RAN access providers could impair our ability to launch and sustain our mobile service. In 2018, Sprint and T-Mobile announced an intent to merge. We believe the reduction of competition among mobile wireless network-based providers that would result from the merger likely will impact negatively the price and availability of wholesale RAN access to Altice, affect the operating cost for our mobile wireless data service, and impact our ability 
12

to compete for mobile subscribers. In addition, improvements by incumbent mobile service providers on price, features, speeds, and service enhancements will continue to impact the competitiveness and attractiveness of our mobile service, and we will need to continue to invest in our services, product and marketing to answer that competition. 
Business Services Competition
We operate in highly competitive business telecommunications market and compete primarily with local incumbent telephone companies, especially AT&T, CenturyLink, Inc. ("Centurylink"), Frontier and Verizon, as well as from a variety of other national and regional business services competitors.
Advertising Sales Competition
We face intense competition for advertising revenue across many different platforms and from a wide range of local and national competitors. Advertising competition has increased and will likely continue to increase as new formats seek to attract the same advertisers. We compete for advertising revenue against, among others, local broadcast stations, national cable and broadcast networks, radio stations, print media and online advertising companies and content providers.
Regulation
Our cable, related and other services are subject to a variety of federal, state and local law and regulations, including in instances where we operate outside of the U.S., the laws and regulations of the countries and regions where we operate. The Communications Act, and the rules, regulations and policies of the Federal Communications Commission ("FCC"), as well as other federal, state and other laws governing cable television, communications, consumer protection, privacy and related matters, affect significant aspects of the operations of our cable, related and other services.
The following paragraphs describe the existing legal and regulatory requirements we believe are most significant to our operations today. Our business can be dramatically impacted by changes to the existing regulatory framework, whether triggered by legislative, administrative or judicial rulings.
Cable Television
Franchising.    The Communications Act requires cable operators to obtain a non-exclusive franchise from state or local franchising authorities to provide cable service. Although the terms of franchise agreements differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, they typically require payment of franchise fees and contain regulatory provisions addressing, among other things, use of the right of way, service quality, cable service to schools and other public institutions, insurance, indemnity and sales of assets or changes in ownership. State and local franchising authority, however, must be exercised consistent with the Communications Act, which sets limits on franchising authorities' powers, including limiting franchise fees to no more than 5% of gross revenues from the provision of cable service, prohibiting franchising authorities from requiring us to carry specific programming services, and protecting the renewal expectation of franchisees by limiting the factors a franchising authority may consider and requiring a due process hearing before denying renewal. Even when franchises are renewed, however, the franchise authority may, except where prohibited by applicable law, seek to impose new and more onerous requirements as a condition of renewal. Similarly, if a franchising authority's consent is required for the purchase or sale of a cable system, the franchising authority may attempt to impose more burdensome requirements as a condition for providing its consent. Cable franchises generally are granted for fixed terms and in many cases include monetary penalties for noncompliance. They may also be terminable if the franchisee fails to comply with material provisions.
In recent years, the traditional local cable franchising regime underwent significant change as a result of various federal and state actions. Several states have reduced or eliminated the role of local, municipal government in franchising in favor of state or system-wide franchises, and the trend has been toward consolidation of franchising authority at the state level, in part to accommodate the interests of new broadband and cable entrants over the last decade. At the same time, the FCC has adopted rules that streamline entry for new competitors (such as those affiliated with broadband communications companies) and reduce certain franchising burdens for these new entrants. The FCC adopted more modest relief for existing cable operators, but a recent federal court decision curtailed a portion of this relief that relates to the cap on in-kind payments to franchising authorities.
Pricing and Packaging.    The Communications Act and the FCC's rules limit the scope of price regulation for cable television services. Among other limitations, franchising authorities may regulate rates for only "basic" cable service. In 2015, the FCC adopted a rule barring franchise authority rate regulation absent an affirmative showing by the 
13

franchising authority that there is an absence of effective competition. Based on the 2015 FCC rule, none of our pay television customers are currently subject to basic rate regulation.
There have been frequent calls to impose further rate regulation on the cable industry. It is possible that Congress or the FCC may adopt new constraints on the retail pricing or packaging of cable programming. As we attempt to respond to a changing marketplace with competitive marketing and pricing practices, we may face regulations that impede our ability to compete.
Must-Carry/Retransmission Consent.    Cable operators are required to carry, without compensation, programming transmitted by most local commercial and noncommercial broadcast television stations that elect "must carry" status.
Alternatively, local commercial broadcast television stations may elect "retransmission consent," giving up their must-carry right and instead negotiating with cable systems the terms on which the cable systems may carry the station's programming content. Cable systems generally may not carry a broadcast station that has elected retransmission consent without the station's consent. The terms of retransmission consent agreements frequently include the payment of compensation to the station.
Broadcast stations must elect "must carry" or retransmission consent every three years. A substantial number of local broadcast stations currently carried by our cable systems have elected to negotiate for retransmission consent. In the most recent retransmission consent negotiations, popular television stations have demanded substantial compensation increases, thereby increasing our operating costs.
Ownership Limitations.    Federal regulation of the communications field traditionally included a host of ownership restrictions, which limited the size of certain media entities and restricted their ability to enter into competing enterprises. Through a series of legislative, regulatory, and judicial actions, most of these restrictions have been either eliminated or substantially relaxed. In 2017, the FCC relaxed some broadcast media ownership rules, and the broadcast industry subsequently experienced consolidation. The broadcast industry could consolidate further, which could impact the fees we pay broadcasters to license their signals.
Set-Top Boxes.    The Communications Act includes a provision that requires the FCC to take certain steps to support the development of a retail market for "navigation devices," such as cable set-top boxes. Several years ago, the FCC began a proceeding to consider requiring cable operators to accommodate third-party navigation devices, which if adopted could impose substantial development and operating requirements on the industry. Though there is currently no active effort to advance these proposals, the FCC may in the future consider implementing other measures to promote the competitive availability of retail set-top boxes or third-party navigation options that could impact our customers' experience, our ability to capture user interactions to refine and enhance our services, and our ability to provide a consistent customer support environment.
PEG and Leased Access.     Franchising authorities may require that we support the delivery and support for public, educational, or governmental ("PEG") channels on our cable systems. In addition to providing PEG channels, we must make a limited number of commercial leased access channels available to third parties (including parties with potentially competitive pay television services) at regulated rates. The FCC adopted revised rules several years ago mandating a significant reduction in the rates that operators can charge commercial leased access users. These rules were stayed, however, by a federal court, pending a cable industry appeal. This matter currently remains pending, and the revised rules are not yet in effect. Although commercial leased access activity historically has been relatively limited, increased activity in this area could further burden the channel capacity of our cable systems.
Pole Attachments.    The company makes extensive use of utility poles and conduit owned by other utilities to attach and install the facilities that are integral to our network and services. The Communications Act requires most utilities to provide cable systems with access to poles and conduits for access to attach such facilities at regulated rates. States (or, where states choose not to regulate, the FCC) regulate utility company rates for the rental of pole and conduit space used by companies, including operators like us, to provide cable, telecommunications services, and Internet access services, unless states establish their own regulations in this area. Many states in which we operate have elected to set their own pole attachment rules. Adverse changes to the pole attachment rate structure, rate, classifications, and access could significantly increase our annual pole attachment costs.
Program Access.    The program access rules generally prohibit a cable operator from improperly influencing an affiliated satellite-delivered cable programming service to discriminate unfairly against an unaffiliated distributor where the 
14

purpose or effect of such influence is to significantly hinder or prevent the competitor from providing satellite-delivered cable programming. FCC rules also allow a competing distributor to bring a complaint against a cable-affiliated terrestrially-delivered programmer or its affiliated cable operator for alleged violations of this rule, and seek reformed terms of carriage as remedy.
Program Carriage.    The FCC's program carriage rules prohibit us from requiring that an unaffiliated programmer grant us a financial interest or exclusive carriage rights as a condition of its carriage on our cable systems and prohibit us from unfairly discriminating against unaffiliated programmers in the terms and conditions of carriage on the basis of their nonaffiliation.
Exclusive Access to Multitenant Buildings.    The FCC has prohibited cable operators from entering into or enforcing exclusive agreements with owners of multitenant buildings under which the operator is the only multichannel video programming distributor ("MVPD") with access to the building.
CALM Act.    The FCC's rules require us to ensure that all commercials carried on our cable service comply with specified volume standards.
Privacy and Data Security.    In the course of providing our services, we collect certain information about our customers and their use of our services. We also collect certain information regarding potential customers and other individuals. Our collection, use, disclosure and other handling of information is subject to a variety of federal and state privacy requirements, including those imposed specifically on cable operators and telecommunications service providers by the Communications Act. We are also subject to data security obligations, as well as requirements to provide notice to individuals and governmental entities in the event of certain data security breaches, and such breaches, depending on their scope and consequences, may lead to litigation and enforcement actions with the potential of substantial monetary forfeitures or to adversely affect our brand.
As cable operators provide interactive and other advanced services, additional privacy and data security requirements may arise through legislation, regulation or judicial decisions. For example, the Video Privacy Protection Act of 1988 has been extended to cover online interactive services through which customers can buy or rent movies. In addition, Congress, the Federal Trade Commission ("FTC"), and other lawmakers and regulators are all considering whether to adopt additional measures that could impact the collection, use, and disclosure of customer information in connection with the delivery of advertising and other services to consumers customized to their interests. 
Federal Copyright Regulation.    We are required to pay copyright royalty fees on a semi-annual basis to receive a statutory compulsory license to carry broadcast television content. These fees are subject to periodic audit by the content owners. The amount of a cable operator's royalty fee payments are determined by a statutory formula that takes into account various factors, including the amount of "gross receipts" received from customers for "basic" service, the number of "distant" broadcast signals carried and the characteristics of those distant signals (e.g., network, independent or noncommercial). Certain elements of the royalty formula are subject to adjustment from time to time, which can lead to increases in the amount of our semi-annual royalty payments. The U.S. Copyright Office, which administers the collection of royalty fees, has made recommendations to Congress for changes in or elimination of the statutory compulsory licenses for cable television carriage of broadcast signals and the U.S. Government Accountability Office is conducting a statutorily-mandated inquiry into whether the cable compulsory license should be phased out. Changes to copyright regulations could adversely affect the ability of our cable systems to obtain such programming, and could increase the cost of such programming. Similarly, we must obtain music rights for locally originated programming and advertising from the major music performing rights organizations. These licensing fees have been the source of litigation in the past, and we cannot predict with certainty whether license fee disputes may arise in the future.
Access for Persons with Disabilities.    The FCC's rules require us to ensure that persons with disabilities can more fully access the programming we carry. We are required to provide closed captions and pass through video description to customers on some networks we carry, and to provide an easy means of activating closed captioning and to ensure the audio accessibility of emergency information and on-screen text menus and guides provided by our navigation devices.
Other Regulation.    We are subject to various other regulations, including those related to political broadcasting; home wiring; the blackout of certain network and syndicated programming; prohibitions on transmitting obscene programming; limitations on advertising in children's programming; and standards for emergency alerts, as well as telemarketing and general consumer protection laws and equal employment opportunity obligations. The FCC also imposes various 
15

technical standards on our operations. In the aftermath of Superstorm Sandy, the FCC and the states are examining whether new requirements are necessary to improve the resiliency of communications networks, potentially including cable networks. Each of these regulations restricts our business practices to varying degrees. The FCC can aggressively enforce compliance with its regulations and consumer protection policies, including the imposition of substantial monetary sanctions. It is possible that Congress or the FCC will expand or modify its regulations of cable systems in the future, and we cannot predict at this time how that might impact our business.
Broadband
Regulatory Classification.    Broadband Internet access services were traditionally classified by the FCC as "information services" for regulatory purposes, a type of service that is subject to a lesser degree of regulation than "telecommunications services." In 2015, the FCC reversed this determination and classified broadband Internet access services as "telecommunications services." This reclassification had subjected our broadband Internet access service to greater regulation, although the FCC did not apply all telecommunications service obligations to broadband Internet access service. The 2015 Order could have had a material adverse impact on our business. In December 2017, the FCC adopted an order that in large part reversed again the 2015 Order and reestablished the "information service" classification for broadband Internet access service. The 2017 Order, came into effect, in June 2018, is the subject of legal challenges that may overturn or weaken the relief it provides.
Net Neutrality.   Congress and some states are considering legislation that may codify “net neutrality” rules, which could include prohibitions on blocking, throttling and prioritizing Internet traffic. A number of states, including California and New York, have adopted legislation and/or executive orders that apply “net neutrality” rules to ISPs.
Access for Persons with Disabilities.    The FCC's rules require us to ensure that persons with disabilities have access to "advanced communications services" ("ACS"), such as electronic messaging and interoperable video conferencing. They also require that certain pay television programming delivered via Internet Protocol include closed captioning and require entities distributing such programming to end users to pass through such captions and identify programming that should be captioned.
Other Regulation.    Providers of broadband Internet access services must comply with Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (‘‘CALEA’’), which requires providers to make their services and facilities accessible for law enforcement intercept requests. Various other federal and state laws apply to providers of services that are accessible through broadband Internet access service, including copyright laws, telemarketing laws, prohibitions on obscenity, and a ban on unsolicited commercial e-mail, and privacy and data security laws. Online content we provide is also subject to some of these laws.
Other forms of regulation of broadband Internet access service currently being considered by the FCC, Congress or state legislatures include consumer protection requirements, cyber security requirements, consumer service standards, requirements to contribute to universal service programs and requirements to protect personally identifiable customer data from theft. Pending and future legislation in this area could adversely affect our operations as an Internet service provider and our relationship with our Internet customers.
Additionally, from time to time the FCC and Congress have considered whether to subject broadband Internet access services to the federal Universal Service Fund ("USF") contribution requirements. Any contribution requirements adopted for Internet access services would impose significant new costs on our broadband Internet service. At the same time, the FCC is changing the manner in which Universal Service funds are distributed. By focusing on broadband and wireless deployment, rather than traditional telephone service, the changes could assist some of our competitors in more effectively competing with our service offerings.
Telephony Services
We provide telephony services using VoIP technology ("interconnected VoIP"). The FCC has adopted several regulations for interconnected VoIP services, as have several states, especially as it relates to core customer and safety issues such as E911, local number portability, disability access, outage reporting, universal service contributions, and regulatory reporting requirements. The FCC has not, however, formally classified interconnected VoIP services as either information services or telecommunications services. In this vacuum, some states have asserted more expansive rights to regulate interconnected VoIP services, while others have adopted laws that bar the state commission from regulating VoIP service.
16

Universal Service.     Interconnected VoIP services must contribute to the USF used to subsidize communication services provided to low income households, to customers in rural and high cost areas, and to schools, libraries, and rural health care providers. The amount of universal service contribution required of interconnected VoIP service providers is based on a percentage of revenues earned from interstate and international services provided to end users. We allocate our end user revenues and remit payments to the universal service fund in accordance with FCC rules. The FCC has ruled that states may impose state universal service fees on interconnected VoIP providers.
Local Number Portability.   The FCC requires interconnected VoIP service providers and their "numbering partners" to ensure that their customers have the ability to port their telephone numbers when changing providers. We also contribute to federal funds to meet the shared costs of local number portability and the costs of North American Numbering Plan Administration.
Other Regulation.     Interconnected VoIP service providers are required to provide enhanced 911 emergency services to their customers; protect customer proprietary network information from unauthorized disclosure to third parties; report to the FCC on service outages; comply with telemarketing regulations and other privacy and data security requirements; comply with disabilities access requirements and service discontinuance obligations; comply with call signaling requirements; and comply with CALEA standards. In August 2015, the FCC adopted new rules to improve the resiliency of the communications network. Under the new rules, providers of telephony services, including interconnected VoIP service providers, must make available eight hours of standby backup power for consumers to purchase at the point of sale. The rules also require that providers inform new and current customers about service limitations during power outages and steps that consumers can take to address those risks.
We operate traditional telecommunications services under the trade name Lightpath in various state subsidiaries, and those services are largely governed under rules established for CLECs under the Communications Act. The Communications Act entitles our CLEC subsidiaries to certain rights, but as telecommunications carriers, it also subjects them to regulation by the FCC and the states. Their designation as telecommunications carriers also results in other regulations that may affect them and the services they offer.
Interconnection and Intercarrier Compensation.    The Communications Act requires telecommunications carriers to interconnect directly or indirectly with other telecommunications carriers and networks, including VoIP. Under the FCC's intercarrier compensation rules, we are entitled, in some cases, to compensation from carriers when they use our network to terminate or originate calls and in other cases are required to compensate another carrier for using its network to originate or terminate traffic. The FCC and state regulatory commissions, including those in the states in which we operate, have adopted limits on the amounts of compensation that may be charged for certain types of traffic. In an October 2011 Order, the FCC determined that intercarrier compensation for all terminating traffic, including VoIP traffic exchanged in time-division multiplexing ("TDM") format, would be phased down over several years to a "bill-and-keep" regime, with no compensation between carriers for most terminating traffic by 2018. The FCC is considering further reform that could reduce or eliminate compensation for originating traffic as well.
Universal Service.    Our CLEC subsidiaries are required to contribute to the USF. The amount of universal service contribution required of us is based on a percentage of revenues earned from interstate and international services provided to end users. We allocate our end user revenues and remit payments to the universal service fund in accordance with FCC rules. The FCC has ruled that states may impose state universal service fees on CLEC telecommunications services.
Other Regulation.    Our CLEC subsidiaries' telecommunications services are subject to other FCC requirements, including protecting the use and disclosure of customer proprietary network information; meeting certain notice requirements in the event of service termination; compliance with disabilities access requirements; compliance with CALEA standards; outage reporting; and the payment of fees to fund local number portability administration and the North American Numbering Plan. As noted above, the FCC and states are examining whether new requirements are necessary to improve the resiliency of communications networks. Communications with our customers are also subject to FCC, FTC and state regulations on telemarketing and the sending of unsolicited commercial e-mail and fax messages, as well as additional privacy and data security requirements.
State Regulation.    Our CLEC subsidiaries' telecommunications services are subject to regulation by state commissions in each state where we provide services. In order to provide our services, we must seek approval from the state regulatory commission or be registered to provide services in each state where we operate and may at times require local approval to construct facilities. Regulatory obligations vary from state to state and include some or all of the following requirements: 
17

filing tariffs (rates, terms and conditions); filing operational, financial, and customer service reports; seeking approval to transfer the assets or capital stock of the broadband communications company; seeking approval to issue stocks, bonds and other forms of indebtedness of the broadband communications company; reporting customer service and quality of service requirements; outage reporting; making contributions to state universal service support programs; paying regulatory and state Telecommunications Relay Service and E911 fees; geographic build-out; and other matters relating to competition.
In 2019 we expect to launch a mobile wireless voice and data service. We will offer this service using wholesale RAN agreements that we have entered into, such as our agreement with Sprint, and that we expect to enter into with others, as well as with our existing Wi-Fi hotspot infrastructure in subscriber homes and at outdoor Wi-Fi hotspots. Our mobile wireless service will be subject to most of the same FCC and consumer protection regulations as typical, network-based wireless carriers (such as E911 services, local number portability, privacy protection, and constraints on billing and advertising practices). The FCC or other regulatory authorities may adopt new or different regulations that apply to our services or similarly situated providers, impose new taxes or fees, or modify the obligations of other network-based carriers to provide wholesale RAN access to providers like Altice. 
Other Services
We may provide other services and features over our cable system, such as games and interactive advertising that may be subject to a range of federal, state and local laws such as privacy and consumer protection regulations. We also maintain various websites that provide information and content regarding our businesses. The operation of these websites is also subject to a similar range of regulations.
Privacy Regulations
Our cable, Internet, voice, wireless and advertising services are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations, including in instances where we operate outside of the U.S., the laws and regulations of the countries and regions where we operate regarding subscriber privacy, data security, data protection, and data use. Our provision of Internet services subjects us to the limitations on use and disclosure of user communications and records contained in the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986. Broadband Internet access service is also subject to various privacy laws applicable to electronic communications. In 2018, California passed a comprehensive privacy act aimed at increasing disclosure requirements, privacy protections, and the rights of consumers to identify and delete stored private data, subject to some limited business exceptions. We expect further scrutiny of privacy practices at all levels of government in the areas where we operate, and implementing systems to comply with new rules could impact our business opportunities and impose operating costs on the business.
Our i24 operation has employees and offices in the European Union that are subject to the General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR"). Further, our a4 advertising business conducts limited business with customers that advertise in the EU. As such, we have certain compliance obligations with EU and member state (and UK) laws and regulations, including compliance obligations under the GDPR, and bear potential enforcement risks if we fail to comply, even as the application of those regulations to some of our operations are unclear or are unknown.
Environmental Regulations
Our business operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations, including regulations governing the use, storage, disposal of, and exposure to, hazardous materials, the release of pollutants into the environment and the remediation of contamination. In part as a result of the increasing public awareness concerning the importance of environmental regulations, these regulations have become more stringent over time. Amended or new regulations could impact our operations and costs.
Employees and Labor Relations
As of December 31, 2018, we had 11,800 full-time, 118 part-time and 267 temporary employees of which 291 were covered under collective bargaining agreements and an additional 226 were represented by a union. As of December 31, 2018, we believe our relations with employees are satisfactory.
