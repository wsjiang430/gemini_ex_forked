Treasure Success was established in Hong Kong in July 2016 and operates in Hong Kong. Treasure Success’s primary activities are to employ sales and merchandising staff and supporting personnel in Hong Kong to support the business of Jerash Garments and its subsidiaries.
    Products
 
As a garment manufacturing group, we excel in manufacturing sport and outerwear. Our products are in the customized, ready-made sport and outerwear segment, and the Group derives all of our revenue from the manufacturing and sales of sport and outerwear, which is the only segment in which we operate. The Group’s product offering consists of jackets, polo shirts, crew neck shirts, pants and shorts made from knitted fabric. Our primary product offering is jackets, and in the fiscal years ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, approximately 52% and 48%, respectively, of the Group’s total shipped pieces were jackets.
Manufacturing and Production
 
Our production facilities are located in Al Tajamouat Industrial City, a Development Zone in Amman, Jordan, and are comprised of four factory units and three warehouses. Effective as of January 1, 2019, the government of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan converted Al Tajamouat Industrial City into a Development Zone. Following this change, we will continue to operate under benefits similar to the Qualifying Industrial Zone (“QIZ”) designation, but are subject to a 5% corporate income tax. Currently, the first factory unit, which the Group owns, employs approximately 1,500 people. Its primary functions are to house the Group’s management offices, as well as production lines, the Group’s trims warehouse, and sewing, ironing, and packaging units. The second factory unit, which the Group leases, employs approximately 1,400 people. Its primary functions are to house the Group’s administrative and human resources personnel, as well as merchandising and accounting departments, as well as additional production lines, the Group’s trims and finished products warehouses, and sewing, ironing, packing and quality control units. The third factory unit, which the Group leases, employs approximately 200 people. Its primary functions are to perform the cutting and embroidery for the Group’s products. The fourth factory, which the Group leases, currently employs approximately 500 people. Its primary functions are housing additional production lines.

In 2015, we commenced a project to build a 4,800 square foot workshop in the Tafilah Governorate of Jordan, which was previously planned to be a sewing workshop, but has been changed to become a dormitory. This dormitory is expected to be operational in September 2019 and is expected to house workers for the 54,000 square foot workshop in Al-Hasa County.
 
In calendar year 2018, the Group commenced another project to build a 54,000 square foot workshop in Al-Hasa County in the Tafilah Governorate of Jordan, which is expected to be completed in September 2019. Provided that we satisfy certain employment requirements over certain time periods, we do not anticipate incurring any significant costs for the project, which is being constructed in conjunction with the Jordanian Ministry of Labor and the Jordanian Education and Training Department. In the event we breach our agreement with these government agencies, we will have to pay such agencies 250,000 Jordanian Dinar (“JOD”) or $353,000. See Item 2. Properties below for more information regarding this workshop.
 
Total annual capacity at the Group’s existing facilities is approximately 8.0 million pieces (average for product categories including t-shirts, polos and jackets). Our production flow begins in the Group’s third factory unit in the cutting department. From there, the product moves to either the Group’s first or second factory unit for processing by the sewing unit, finishing department, quality control, and finally the ironing and packing units. If applicable during this process, the product is sent back to the embroidery department at the Group’s third factory unit for embroidery.
 
The Group does not have long term supply contracts or arrangements with our suppliers. Most of the Group’s ultimate suppliers for raw materials, such as fabric, zippers and labels, are designated by customers and the Group purchases such materials on a purchase order basis.
 
Employees
 
As of March 31, 2019, the Group had an aggregate of approximately 3,000 employees located in Jordan Hong Kong, and in United States of America, all of which are full-time employees.

In fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019, the Group depended on a few key customers for its sales. Substantially all of the Group’s sales in fiscal 2018 and 2019 were to VF Corporation.
 
The Group established our relationship with VF Corporation in 2012. Substantially all of the Group’s products are sold under The North Face Brand that is owned by VF Corporation. Currently, we manufacture primarily outerwear for The North Face. Approximately 79% of the Group’s sales in each of fiscal 2019 and 2018, were derived from the sale of the Group’s products to VF Corporation. We are not party to any long-term contracts with VF Corporation or the Group’s other customers, and our sales arrangements with our customers do not have minimum purchase requirements. As is common in our industry, VF Corporation and our other customers place purchase orders with us after the Group completes detailed sample development and approval processes that we and our customers have agreed upon for their purchase and manufacture of the garments in question. It is through the sample development and approval processes that the Group and VF Corporation and our other customers agree to the purchase and manufacture of the garments in question. For fiscal 2019, VF Corporation issued approximately 10,500 purchase orders to us in amounts ranging from approximately $6 to $365,000. The Group is not substantially dependent on any particular order from VF Corporation.
 
VF Corporation is in the retail industry, which is subject to substantial cyclical variations. Consequently, there can be no assurance that sales to current customers will continue at the current rate or at all. In addition, our annual and quarterly results may vary, which may cause our profits and the market price of our common stock to decline.
 
The Group continues to seek to expand and strengthen our relationship with our current customers and other brand names. However, the Group cannot assure you that these brands will continue to buy our products in the same volumes or on the same terms as they did in the past.
 
Competition
 
The markets for the manufacturing of sport and outerwear are highly competitive. The competition in the fields in which the Group operates is focused primarily on the price of the product, its quality, and the level of customer service. Our products compete with products of other apparel manufacturers in Israel, Europe, the United States, South and Central America and Asia.
 
Most competition with other manufacturers in the clothing industry focuses on reducing production costs, reducing supply lead times, design, product quality, and efficiency of supply to the customer. Since production costs depend to a large extent on labor costs, in recent years most production in the industry has been moved to countries where the labor costs are low.  Some of the Group’s competitors have a lower cost base, longer operating experience, broader customer base and other advantages over us which allow them to compete with us. As described in more detail under “- Conditions in Jordan” below, the Group is able to sell our products manufactured at our facilities in Jordan to the United States free from customs duties and import quotas under certain conditions. These favorable terms enable us to remain competitive on the basis of price. In December 2017, the European Union (“EU”) extended a free trade agreement to us such that goods manufactured by us in Jordan that are subsequently shipped to EU countries are shipped free of duty.
 
Conditions in Jordan
 
The Group’s manufacturing facilities are located in Jordan. Accordingly, the Group is directly affected by political, security and economic conditions in Jordan.

From time to time Jordan has experienced instances of civil unrest, terrorism and hostilities among neighboring countries, including Syria and Israel. A peace agreement between Israel and Jordan was signed in 1994. Terrorist attacks, military activity, rioting, or civil or political unrest in the future could influence the Jordanian economy and the Group’s operations by disrupting operations and communications and making travel within Jordan more difficult and less desirable. Political or social tensions also could create a greater perception that investments in companies with Jordanian operations involve a high degree of risk, which could adversely affect the market and price for the Group’s common stock.
 
Jordan is a constitutional monarchy, but the King holds wide executive and legislative powers. The ruling family has taken initiatives that support the economic growth of the country. However, there is no assurance that such initiatives will be successful or will continue. The rate of economic liberalization could change, and specific laws and policies affecting manufacturing companies, foreign investments, currency exchange rates and other matters affecting investments in Jordan could change as well.
 
A proposed tax bill that was part of an economic reform plan backed by the International Monetary Fund and aimed at narrowing Jordan’s growing debt contained new taxes on products, such as internet subscriptions, and the elimination of subsidies on bread led to protests throughout Jordan beginning on May 30, 2018. On June 5, 2018, King Abdullah II of Jordan responded to the protests by removing Jordan’s prime minister and replacing him with Omar al-Razzaz. Prime Minister Razzaz then withdrew the proposed tax bill from consideration and formed a new cabinet. On June 11, 2018 Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates (the “UAE”) pledged $2.5 billion of aid to Jordan (including a deposit into Jordan’s central bank), annual budget support for the next five years and development projects. Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the UAE signed a formal agreement on October 4, 2018 that provided for a $1.1 billion deposit to Jordan’s central bank and future annual budget and project finance support as part of the larger $2.5 billion aid package.
 
Trade Agreements
 
The Group benefits from exemptions from customs duties and import quotas due to the Group’s location in Al Tajamouat Industrial City, a Development Zone in Amman, Jordan, and the free trade agreements with the United States and the EU.
 
Development Zones are industrial parks that house manufacturing operations in Jordan. Companies operating in Development Zones receive certain tax benefits and are eligible to take advantage of the free trade agreements between the United States and Jordan. Under the trade agreement between Jordan and the U.S., goods produced in Development Zone areas can directly access U.S. markets without tariff or quota restrictions if they satisfy certain criteria. Companies operating in Development Zones are subject to a 5% corporate income tax.

Income Tax Incentives
 
The Encouragement of Investment Committee of Jordan resolved that Jerash Garments’ project is an economically approved project in accordance with the Encouragement of Investment Law number 16 of 1995 and accordingly was granted exemptions from customs duties on the plant’s equipment and machinery. Historically, in accordance with the Jordanian Income Tax law, all of Jerash Garments’ exports are 100% exempted, provided a specific Declaration in that respect is filed with the Jordanian Customs and Income Tax Departments. This exemption was extended for 5 years until December 31, 2018.
 
Effective January 1, 2019 the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan’s government changed Jerash Garments’ and its subsidiaries’ area from a Free Zone to a Development Zone. In accordance with Development Zone law, Jerash Garments and its subsidiaries begin paying corporate income tax in Jordan at a rate of 5%. For more information, see Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Income Tax.
 
In addition, Jerash Garments and its subsidiaries are subject to local sales tax of 16%. However, Jerash Garments was granted a sales tax exemption from the Jordanian Investment Commission for the period June 1, 2015 to June 1, 2018 that allowed Jerash Garments to make purchases with no sales tax charge. This exemption was extended to February 15, 2020 and the Company intends to apply to extend the exemption before the expiration date.
 
Government Regulation
 
The Group’s manufacturing and other facilities in Jordan are subject to various local regulations relating to the maintenance of safe working conditions and manufacturing practices. Management believes that it is currently in compliance in all material respects with all such regulations. The Group is not subject to governmental approval of the Group’s products or manufacturing process.
