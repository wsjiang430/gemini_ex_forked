About Genpact
 Genpact is a global professional services firm that makes business transformation real.  We drive digital-led innovation and run digitally-enabled intelligent operations for our clients, guided by our experience running thousands of processes for hundreds of Fortune Global 500 clients.  We have more than 87,000 employees serving clients in key industry verticals from more than 25 countries. Our 2018 total net revenues were $3.0 billion.
 In 2018, we continued to implement a strategy focused on differentiated, domain-led solutions, growing our expertise in strategic industries and geographic markets, and expanding our client relationships.  We made acquisitions in 2018 to increase our domain expertise in our areas of focus, and we invested in our people and our solutions – in particular our digital capabilities –in an effort to drive more agile business models for our clients and help them to stay ahead of the disruptive challenges they are facing.
 Our Approach
 We use our Smart Enterprise ProcessesSM (SEP) —a patented and highly granular approach to dramatically improving the performance of business processes – to help our clients make their business processes more efficient and effective. SEPs, and their more recent evolution, Digital SEPs, combine Lean Six Sigma methodologies – which reduce waste and inefficiency and improve process quality – with design-thinking principles and our deep expertise in how businesses run.  Our SEPs test the effectiveness of client processes using best-in-class benchmarks we have developed by mapping and analyzing hundreds of millions of client transactions across thousands of end-to-end business processes. In this way, we identify opportunities for improving client processes and technologies, and we apply our deep process knowledge and process-centric technology to transform them.  Our Digital SEPs build on our SEP framework by adding domain-specific digital products and solutions that draw on our expertise in mobility, cloud, workflow, advanced visualization, robotics, and machine learning. 
 Genpact Cora integrates our proprietary automation, analytics, and AI technologies into a unified platform. It draws insights from our deep domain and operations expertise in our target industries and service lines, and is focused on improving the customer experience. Our teams use Genpact Cora to embed the latest technologies along with our deep domain knowledge into our solutions to accelerate our clients’ digital transformations.
 Domain-led digital transformation
 Our clients are operate in increasingly complex business environments, driven by an explosion in technology opportunities, new and disruptive competitors, and shifting market dynamics.  Companies need to reimagine their business models and adapt to rapid change. 
 These organizations seek partners that can both improve productivity and manage cost while creating competitive advantages and realizing top-line benefits, such as expanded market share, seamless customer experiences, increased revenue, and minimized risk and loss. We believe our approach to business transformation, enabled through combining our deep industry and process expertise with our advanced skills in digital, differentiates us from our competitors.
 Our Lean DigitalSM Innovation Centers help clients learn about new digital solutions that can address their business needs. We use these innovation centers to bring together clients, partners, and other industry leaders for brainstorming and hackathon-style workshops. As part of this process, we apply design thinking to make the most of human capabilities, domain expertise, and innovative technology, 
 4


and create solutions that quickly and aptly meet client objectives. The results can include quick-turnaround prototypes that clients can install and test in their own environments.
 We enable domain-led digital transformation for our clients primarily in two ways: designing and running Intelligent OperationsSM and providing digital-led Transformation Services. 
 Intelligent Operations
 Our Intelligent Operations embed digital and advanced analytics into our business process outsourcing solutions to automate and transform our clients’ operations. This allows enterprises to be more flexible and helps them focus on what they need to do to better compete in their industries. 
 Transformation Services
 Our transformation services include our digital products, services and solutions, consulting services, and analytics offerings. 
 Digital: Through our portfolio of digital products, we help our clients harness the power of digital. Our Genpact Cora platform helps us design and implement our digital solutions, making use of advanced technologies, including robotic process automation, AI and data engineering.

We use quantitative and qualitative methods to analyze a client’s data to help them assess new business opportunities, manage risk, and make better business decisions. Our Lean Digital Innovation Centers in Bangalore and Delhi, India, Boston and Palo Alto, United States, and Netyana, Israel bring together our clients, partners, and other industry experts to design and develop new ideas.

 We work with clients across our chosen industry verticals, which are areas in which we believe we have deep industry acumen.

 Our services for clients in the insurance industry – such as property and casualty insurers, life and annuities insurers, reinsurance providers and insurance brokerage firms – include underwriting, claims management, risk and catastrophe modelling, and customer segmentation and loyalty.
 Consumer goods and retail
 Our clients in this vertical include companies in the food and beverage, household goods, apparel, personal goods and consumer health industries as well as grocery chains and other retailers.  The services we provide to these clients include supply chain management, order management, trade promotion optimization, and supplier risk management. 
 Life sciences and healthcare
 Our clients in this vertical include pharmaceutical, medical technology and biotechnology companies as well as healthcare payers (health insurers) and providers and pharmacy benefit managers.  Our services for life sciences clients include regulatory affairs services, such as lifecycle management, regulatory operations, Chemistry Manufacturing Controls compliance, safety and pharmacovigilance, and regulatory information management.

 High Tech
 Our clients in this vertical include companies in the electronics, software and technology sectors. The services we provide to these clients include industry-specific solutions for the IIoT, order and supply chain management, and risk management. 
 Our clients 
 We serve more than 700 clients across many industries and geographies. Our clients include some of the biggest brands in the world, many of which are leaders in their industries. 
 GE
 GE has been our largest client since our inception and accounted for $268.2 million, or approximately 8.9%, of our total net revenues in 2018. We serve most of GE’s business units, including GE Aviation, Baker Hughes GE, GE Corporate, GE Current, GE Digital, GE Healthcare, GE Industrial Finance, GE Power, GE Renewables and GE Transportation. 
 We provide broad services to GE across all of our service offerings. Commitments with respect to services we may perform for GE are set forth in statements of work, or SOWs, purchase orders and business services agreements, or BSAs, that we may enter into with individual GE business units from 
 7


time to time. These SOWs, purchase orders and BSAs cover in more detail the type of work to be performed and the associated amounts to be billed. In general, each GE business unit decides whether to enter into a SOW, purchase order or BSA with us and on what terms it will do so. Therefore, although some decisions may be made centrally at GE, our revenues from GE come from many different businesses, each with its own leader who makes decisions about our services. 
 Global clients
 We serve about one fourth of the Fortune Global 500, including clients such as Aon, Bayer, Boeing, Citigroup, Hyatt, McKesson, PayPal, Walgreens Boots Alliance and Walmart. 
 Our net revenues from Global Clients, which include all clients other than GE, have grown from $1.6 billion in 2013 to $2.7 billion in 2018, representing a compound annual growth rate of 11%. Our net revenues from Global Clients as a percentage of total net revenues increased from approximately 77% in 2013 to approximately 91% in 2018.  See Item 7—“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Classification of Certain Net Revenues.” 
 Our contracts with clients often take the form of a master services agreement, or MSA, which is a framework agreement that we then supplement with SOWs, and we also frequently enter into software-as-a-service and consulting agreements with our clients depending on the scope of the services to be performed. Our MSAs specify the general terms that apply to the services we will provide. For more about our contracting frameworks, see Item 7—“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Overview—Net Revenues.” 
 Our people 
 Our people are critical to the success of our business.  We have created, and constantly reinforce, a culture that emphasizes collaboration, innovation, process improvement, and dedication to our clients.  We seek to attract, retain and develop employees who exhibit our core values – curiosity, incisiveness and courage – and who uphold our dedication to integrity consistent with our Code of Ethical Business Conduct. We are committed to the career development of our employees, and our increasingly mobile, agile and inclusive learning infrastructure supports focused and meaningful technical, functional, industry-specific, managerial, and leadership skill development for our employees based on their roles and levels. Our performance management approach supports our career philosophy by encouraging employees to reflect on their performance, set challenging goals, identify their development needs and find relevant learning and training opportunities. 
 As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 87,000 employees working in more than 25 countries.
 Partnerships and alliances
 We have entered into and continue to pursue alliances with companies whose solutions complement ours. Together, we work to enhance our existing solutions or create new solutions to meet market needs. 
 Our alliances generally fall into one of the following categories: 
  
• | Joint ventures
--+---------------


• | Strategic, go-to-market alliances
--+----------------------------------


• | Deal-specific relationships to jointly solve a specific issue for a client
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Digital and other “white label” embedded technology-based relationships
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We have three primary types of partners: consulting partners, digital partners, and solution partners. Our digital and solution partnerships aim to nurture relationships with established and emerging players and start-ups. These potential partners specialize in leading-edge disruptive digital technologies and solutions that we can embed into our offerings or proactively bring to market.

Corporate social responsibility
 Genpact’s approach to corporate social responsibility focuses on three pillars that reflect our strengths, core expertise, and causes that our employees care about:
  
• | Education and employability
--+----------------------------


• | Gender diversity and inclusion
--+-------------------------------


• | Sustainability
--+---------------

 We foster a culture of giving and volunteering through several global platforms, projects, and social initiatives. Our more than 31,000 employee volunteers have, among other things, helped underprivileged children get better access to education, assisted unemployed women in developing job skills and finding jobs, and worked on projects to help improve infrastructure and education in the communities in which we work and live.  Additionally, more than 10,000 of our employees participate in our payroll-based charitable donation programs.
 Sales and marketing
 We market our services to both existing and potential clients through our business development team and our global relationship managers. Members of this team are based around the globe, including in the United States, Europe, Australia and Asia, and dedicate their time to expanding the services we provide to our existing clients as well as acquiring new clients. 
 We have designated client partners and global relationship managers for each of our strategic relationships. The relationship manager is supported by digital and analytics, process improvement, quality, transition, finance, human resources, information technology and industry/product subject matter expert teams to ensure the best possible solution is provided to our clients. We constantly measure our client satisfaction levels to ensure that we maintain high service levels for each client, using measures such as the Net Promoter Score. Our sales force is primarily organized by industry vertical teams that are supported by horizontal service offerings. 
 The length of our selling cycle varies depending on the type of engagement. The sales cycle for project work is typically much shorter than the sales cycle for a large business process engagement. Our efforts may begin in response to our lead generation program, a perceived opportunity, a reference by an existing client, a request for proposal or otherwise. In addition to our business development personnel, the sales effort involves people from the relevant service areas, people familiar with that prospective client’s industry and business leaders. We may expend substantial time and resources in securing new business. See Item 7—“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Overview—Net Revenues.” 
 As our relationship with a client grows, the time required to win an engagement for additional services often gradually declines. In addition, as we become more knowledgeable about a client’s business and processes, our ability to identify opportunities to create value for the client typically increases. For example, productivity benefits and greater business impact can often be achieved by applying our Lean DigitalSM approach and SEPSM methodology, by focusing on processes that are “upstream” or “downstream” from the processes we initially handle, or by applying our analytical, consulting and digital capabilities to transform processes.
 We also strive to foster relationships between our senior leadership team and our clients’ senior management. These “C-level” relationships ensure that both parties are focused on establishing priorities, aligning objectives and driving client value from the top down. High-level executive relationships have been particularly constructive as a means of increasing business from our existing clients. It also provides us with a forum for addressing client concerns. Our governance methodology is designed to ensure that we are well connected at all levels of our clients’ organizations (executive, management and operations). 
 Significant new business opportunities are reviewed by business and sales leaders from the applicable industry vertical, operations personnel, and members of our finance department. If they 
 9


determine that the new business is aligned with our strategic objectives and a good use of our resources, then our business development team is authorized to pursue the opportunity. 
 Global delivery
 We serve our clients using our global network of 88 delivery centers in 17 countries. We have delivery centers in Australia, Brazil, China, Guatemala, India, Israel, Japan, Latvia, Malaysia, Mexico, the Netherlands, the Philippines, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, the United Kingdom, and the United States. We also have many employees who work with our clients either onsite or virtually, which offers flexibility for both clients and employees.  
 With this global network, we are able to manage complex processes around the world. We use different locations for different types of services depending on client needs and the mix of skills and cost of employees at each location.
 Our presence around the world gives us:
  
• | multilingual capabilities;
--+---------------------------


• | access to a larger talent pool; and
--+------------------------------------


• | “near-shoring” capabilities to take advantage of time zones.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------

 We also regularly look for new places to open delivery centers and offices, both in new countries or new cities in countries where we already have a presence. Before we choose a new location, we consider several factors, such as the talent pool, infrastructure, government support, operating costs, and client demand. 
 Service delivery model
 We seek to be a seamless extension of our clients’ operations. To that end, we developed the Genpact Virtual CaptiveSM service delivery model, in which we create a virtual extension of our clients’ teams and environments. Our clients get dedicated employees and management, as well as dedicated infrastructure at our delivery centers. We also train our teams in our clients’ cultures, processes, and business environments. 
 Intellectual Property 
 The solutions we offer our clients often include a range of proprietary methodologies, software, and reusable knowledge capital. We also develop intellectual property in the course of our business and our agreements with our clients regulate the ownership of such intellectual property. We seek to protect our intellectual property through various means, including by agreement and applications for patents, trademarks, service marks, copyrights and domain names. Some of our intellectual property rights are trade secrets and relate to proprietary business process enhancements. 
 We often use third-party and client software platforms and systems to provide our services. Our agreements with our clients normally include a license to use the client’s proprietary systems to provide our services. Clients authorize us to access and use third party software licenses held by the client so that we may provide our services. 
 
It is our practice to enter into agreements with our employees and independent contractors that: 
  
• | ensure that all new intellectual property developed by our employees or independent contractors in the course of their employment or engagement is assigned to us;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | provide for employees’ and independent contractors’ cooperation in intellectual property protection matters even if they no longer work for us; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | include a confidentiality undertaking by our employees and independent contractors.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 10


Competition 
 We operate in a highly competitive and rapidly evolving global market. We have a number of competitors offering services that are the same as or similar to ours. Our competitors include: 

• | large multinational service providers and accounting firms that provide consulting and other professional services;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | companies that are primarily business process service providers operating from low-cost countries, most commonly India;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | companies that are primarily information technology service providers with some business process service capabilities;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | smaller, niche service providers that provide services in a specific geographic market, industry or service area, including digital; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | in-house departments of companies that use their own resources rather than engage an outside firm for the types of services and solutions we provide.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our revenues are derived primarily from Fortune Global 500 and Fortune 1000 companies. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our industry include: 
  
• | skills and capabilities;
--+-------------------------


• | technical and industry expertise;
--+----------------------------------


• | innovative service and product offerings, including digital offerings;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


• | ability to add value, including through continuous process improvement;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | reputation and client references;
--+----------------------------------


• | contractual terms, including competitive pricing;
--+--------------------------------------------------


• | scope of services;
--+-------------------


• | quality of services and solutions;
--+-----------------------------------


• | ability to sustain long-term client relationships; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------


• | global reach and scale.
--+------------------------

 Our clients typically retain us on a non-exclusive basis. 
 
Regulation 
 We are subject to regulation in many jurisdictions around the world as a result of the complexity of our operations and services, particularly in the countries where we have operations and where we deliver services. We are also subject to regulation by regional bodies such as the European Union, or EU. 
 In addition, the terms of our service contracts typically require that we comply with applicable laws and regulations. In some of our service contracts, we are contractually required to comply even if such laws and regulations apply to our clients, but not to us, and sometimes our clients require us to take specific steps intended to make it easier for them to comply with applicable requirements. In some of our service contracts, our clients undertake the responsibility to inform us about laws and regulations that may apply to us in jurisdictions in which they are located. 
 If we fail to comply with any applicable laws and regulations, we may be restricted in our ability to provide services, and may also be the subject of civil or criminal actions involving penalties, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations. Our clients generally have the right to terminate our contracts for cause in the event of regulatory failures, subject to notice periods. See Item 1A—“Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Business—Our global operations expose us to numerous and sometimes 
 11


conflicting legal and regulatory requirements, and violations of these laws and regulations could harm our business.” If we fail to comply with contractual commitments to facilitate our clients’ compliance, we may be liable for contractual damages, and clients in regulated industries may be less willing to use our services. 
 We are affected by laws and regulations 
in the United States, 
the 
United Kingdom
, 
the EU and its member states, 
and other countries in which we do business 
that are intended to limit the impact of outsourcing on employees in those jurisdictions, and occasional changes to laws and regulations in such jurisdictions may impose changes that further restrict or discourage offshore outsourcing or otherwise harm our business.  See Item 1A—“Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Business—Future legislation or executive action in the United States and other jurisdictions could significantly affect the ability or willingness of our clients and prospective clients to utilize our services.” 
 Our collection, use, disclosure and retention of personal health-related and other information is 
subject to 
an array of privacy, data security, and data breach notification laws and regulations that change frequently, are inconsistent across the jurisdictions in which we do business, and impose significant compliance costs. In the United States, personal information is subject to numerous federal and state laws and regulations relating to privacy, data security, and breach notification, including, for example, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, 
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, 
Federal Trade Commission Act
, 


Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act
, Communications Act, and Electronic Communications Privacy Act. As of 2018, all fifty U.S. states and the District of Columbia have implemented separate data security and breach notification laws with which we must comply; in addition, some states have strengthened their existing laws. Some courts have become more willing to allow individuals to pursue claims in data breach cases, indicating that it may become easier for consumers to sue companies for data breaches. California’s new privacy law, which is expected to take effect in 2020, will impose additional obligations related to the collection and usage of California residents’ data. Related 
laws and regulations 
govern our direct marketing activities and our use of personal information for 
direct marketing, 
including 
the Telemarketing 
and 
Consumer Fraud and Abuse Prevention Act
, 
Telemarketing Sales Rule, 
Telephone Consumer Protection Act and rules promulgated by the Federal Communications Commission, and 
CAN-SPAM Act. In 2018, the Clarifying Lawful Overseas Use of Data, or CLOUD, Act established new required processes and procedures for handling U.S. law enforcement requests for data that we may store outside of the U.S. 
In the EU, a new, comprehensive General Data Protection Regulation, or the GDPR, went into effect in May 2018. The GDPR supersedes EU member states’ national protection laws and imposes privacy and data security compliance obligations and increased penalties for noncompliance. In particular, the GDPR has introduced numerous privacy-related changes for companies operating in the EU, including greater control for data subjects, increased data portability for EU consumers, data breach notification requirements and increased fines. GDPR enforcement has begun, and companies have faced fines for violations of certain provisions. Fines can reach as high as 4% of a company’s annual total revenue, potentially including the revenue of a company’s international affiliates. Additionally, foreign governments outside of the EU are also taking steps to fortify their data privacy laws and regulations. For example, some countries in Latin America and Asia are considering GDPR-like data protection laws, and Canada implemented a new mandatory breach reporting and recordkeeping regime in November 2018. Evolving laws and regulations in India protecting the use of personal information could also impact our engagements with clients, vendors and employees in India. As privacy laws and regulations around the world continue to evolve, these changes could adversely affect our business operations, websites and mobile applications that are accessed by residents in the applicable countries.  
 In the United States, we are either directly subject to, or contractually required to comply or facilitate our clients’ compliance with, laws and regulations arising out of our work for clients operating there, especially in the area of banking, financial services and insurance, such as the Financial Modernization Act (sometimes referred to as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act), the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act, the Right to Financial Privacy Act, the Bank Secrecy Act, the USA PATRIOT Act, the Bank Service Company Act, the Home Owners Loan Act, the Electronic Funds Transfer Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, and regulation by U.S. agencies such as the SEC, the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the National Credit Union Administration, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. 
 12


Because of our debt collections work in the United States, we are also regulated by laws such as the Truth in Lending Act, the Fair Credit Billing Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act and related regulations. We are currently licensed to engage in debt collection activities in all jurisdictions in the United States where licensing is required. U.S. banking and debt collection laws and their implementing regulations are occasionally amended, and these changes may impose new obligations on us or may change existing obligations.  
  Because of our insurance processing activities in the United States, we are currently licensed as a third-party administrator in 41 states and are regulated by the department of insurance in each such state. In two other states, we qualify for regulatory exemption from licensing based on the insurance processing activities we provide. 
 In the United States, we are subject to laws and regulations governing foreign trade, such as export control, customs and sanctions regulations maintained by government bodies such as the Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security, the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, and the Homeland Security Department’s Bureau of Customs and Border Protection. 
 Several of our service delivery centers, primarily located in India, China, the Philippines and Guatemala, benefit from tax incentives or concessional rates provided by local laws and regulations. The Indian Special Economic Zones Act of 2005, or SEZ legislation, introduced a tax holiday in certain situations for operations established in designated “special economic zones,” or SEZs. The SEZ tax benefits are available only for new business operations that are conducted at qualifying SEZ locations. We cannot predict what percentage of our operations or income in India or other jurisdictions in future years will be eligible for a tax holiday. See Item 7—“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Overview—Income Taxes.” In addition to the tax holidays described above, certain benefits are also available to us under certain Indian state laws. These benefits include rebates and waivers in relation to payments for the transfer or registration of property (including for the purchase or lease of premises), waivers of conversion fees for land, exemption from state pollution control requirements, entry tax exemptions, labor law exemptions and commercial usage of electricity. 
 Our hedging activities and currency transfer are restricted by regulations in certain countries, including India, Romania and China. 
 Certain Bermuda Law Considerations 
 As a Bermuda company, we are also subject to regulation in Bermuda. Among other things, we must comply with the provisions of the Companies Act 1981 of Bermuda as amended, or the Companies Act, regulating the declaration and payment of dividends and the making of distributions from contributed surplus. 
 We are classified as a non-resident of Bermuda for exchange control purposes by the Bermuda Monetary Authority. Pursuant to our non-resident status, we may engage in transactions in currencies other than Bermuda dollars. There are no restrictions on our ability to transfer funds in and out of Bermuda or to pay dividends to United States residents that are holders of our common shares. 
 Under Bermuda law, “exempted” companies are companies formed for the purpose of conducting business outside Bermuda. As an exempted company, we may not, without a license granted by the Minister of Finance, participate in certain business transactions, including transactions involving Bermuda landholding rights and the carrying on of business of any kind, for which we are not licensed in Bermuda. 
 Organizational structure
 We conduct our business primarily through direct and indirect subsidiaries of our parent company, Genpact Limited, which is a Bermuda exempted limited company.
 Our business was initially conducted through various entities and divisions of GE. We began operating as an independent company in 2004, when GE spun off our operations and sold indirect interests in us to our initial investors. In 2007, we completed our initial public offering. In 2012, affiliates 
 13


of Bain Capital Investors, LLC, or Bain Capital, acquired the majority of the remaining interests held by our initial investors. Following an offering in February 2019, Bain Capital (through its affiliates) owned approximately 17% of our outstanding equity as of February 15, 2019. 
 Available Information 
 We file current and periodic reports, proxy statements, and other information with the SEC. The SEC maintains an Internet site that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC, at www.sec.gov. We make available free of charge on our website, www.genpact.com, our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the SEC. The contents of our website are not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report.
