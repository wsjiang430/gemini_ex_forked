ITEM 1. BUSINESS.

Aspen Group, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, the Company or AGI) is a holding company. AGI has three subsidiaries, Aspen University Inc. organized in 1987, United States University Inc., and Aspen Nursing, Inc. (ANI). ANI is a subsidiary of Aspen University Inc. On March 13, 2012, the Company was recapitalized in a reverse merger. 

All references to the Company, AGI, Aspen Group, we, our and us refer to Aspen Group, Inc., unless the context otherwise indicates.

Description of Business

AGI is an education technology holding company. It operates two universities, Aspen University (Aspen University or AUI or Aspen) and United States University (United States University or USU).

AGI leverages its education technology infrastructure and expertise to allow its two universities, Aspen University and United States University, to deliver on the vision of making college affordable again. Because we believe higher education should be a catalyst to our students long-term economic success, we exert financial prudence by offering affordable tuition that is one of the greatest values in higher education. AGIs primary focus relative to future growth is to target the high growth nursing profession, as today 81% of all students across both universities are degree-seeking nursing students.

In March 2014, Aspen University unveiled a monthly payment plan available to all students across every online degree program offered by the university. The monthly payment plan is designed so that students will make one payment per month, and that monthly payment is applied towards the total cost of attendance (tuition and fees, excluding textbooks). The monthly payment plan offers online associate and bachelor students the opportunity to pay their tuition and fees at $250/month, online master students $325/month, and online doctoral students $375/month, interest free, thereby giving students a monthly payment option versus taking out a federal financial aid loan.

USU began offering monthly payment plans in the summer of 2017. Today, monthly payment plans are available for the online RN to BSN program ($250/month), online MBA/M.A.Ed/MSN programs ($325/month), and the online hybrid Masters of Nursing-Family Nurse Practitioner (FNP) program ($375/month). Effective August 2019, new student enrollments for USUs FNP monthly payment plan will be offered a $9,000 two-year payment plan ($375/month x 24 months) designed to pay for the first years pre-clinical courses only (approximate cost of $9,000). The second academic year in which students complete their clinical courses (approximate cost of $18,000) will be required to be funded through conventional payment methods (either cash, private loans, corporate tuition reimbursement or federal financial aid).

Additionally, Aspen University began its first semester in July 2018 for its pre-licensure Bachelor of Science in Nursing degree program at its initial campus in Phoenix, Arizona. Aspens innovative hybrid (online/on-campus) program allows most of the credits to be completed online (83 of 120 credits or 69%), with pricing offered at Aspens current low tuition rates of $150/credit hour for online general education courses and $325/credit hour for online core nursing courses. For high school students with no prior college credits, the total cost of attendance is less than $50,000. As a result of overwhelming demand in the Phoenix metro area, Aspen University began offering both day (July, November, and March semesters) and evening/weekend (January, May, and September semesters) programs starting in January 2019, equaling six semester starts per year. In September 2018, Aspen announced the signing of a memorandum of understanding to open a second campus in the Phoenix metro in partnership with HonorHealth, currently projected to launch in September 2019. 

Since 1993, Aspen University has been nationally accredited by the DEAC, a national accrediting agency recognized by the DOE and CHEA. On February 25, 2019, the DEAC informed Aspen University that it had renewed its accreditation for five years to January 2024.

Since 2009, USU has been regionally accredited by WSCUC. 

Both universities are qualified to participate under the Higher Education Act and the Federal student financial assistance programs (Title IV, HEA programs).

Competitive Strengths - We believe that we have the following competitive strengths:

Emphasis on Online Education - Except for our Aspen University pre-licensure BSN hybrid (online/on-campus) nursing program and USUs hybrid (online/on-campus) MSN-FNP and International MBA programs, we have designed our courses and programs exclusively for online delivery, and we recruit and train faculty for online instruction. We provide students the flexibility to study and interact at times that suit their schedules. We design our online sessions and materials to be interactive, dynamic and user friendly.
Debt Minimization - We are committed to offering among the lowest tuition rates in the sector, which to date has alleviated the need for a significant majority of our students to take out federal financial aid loans to fund their tuition and fees requirements. 
Commitment to Academic Excellence - We are committed to continuously improving our academic programs and services, as evidenced by the level of attention and resources we apply to instruction and educational support. We are committed to achieving high course completion and graduation rates compared to competitive distance learning, for-profit schools. One-on-one contact with our highly experienced faculty brings knowledge and great perspective to the learning experience. Faculty members are available by telephone and email to answer questions, discuss assignments and provide help and encouragement to our students. 
Highly Scalable and Profitable Business Model - We believe our education model, our relatively low student acquisition costs, and our variable faculty cost model will enable us to expand our operating margins. As we increase student enrollments we are able to scale our online business on a variable basis the number of adjunct faculty members after we reach certain enrollment metrics (not before). A single adjunct faculty member can work with as little as two students or as many as 30 at any given time. 

We also think our hybrid BSN pre-licensure nursing program has significant potential since there are large waiting lists of applicants at most public universities that offer pre-licensure BSN programs in major U.S. metropolitan areas. Specifically, there were 56,397 qualified applicants not admitted to pre-licensure BSN programs in the 2016-2017 academic year, as reported by the AACN (2018). Our experience in the Phoenix metro has confirmed the existence of the backlog. Throughout our first full fiscal year (FY19) marketing the program, Aspen University delivered 433 new student enrollments and ended the fiscal year with 396 active students in its Pre-Licensure BSN program in Phoenix.

One Student at a Time personal care - We are committed to providing our students with highly responsive and personal individualized support. Every student is assigned an Academic Advisor who becomes an advocate for the students success. Our one-on-one approach assures contact with faculty members when a student needs it and monitoring to keep them on course. Our administrative staff is readily available to answer any questions and works with a student from initial interest through the application process and enrollment, and most importantly while the student is pursuing a degree or studies. 

Admissions

In considering candidates for acceptance into any of our certificate or degree programs, we look for those who are serious about pursuing  or advancing in  a professional career, and who want to be both prepared and academically challenged in the process. We strive to maintain the highest standards of academic excellence, while maintaining a friendly learning environment designed for educational, personal and professional success. A desire to meet those standards is a prerequisite. Because our programs are designed for self-directed learners who know how to manage their time, successful students have a basic understanding of time management principles and practices, as well as good writing and research skills. Admission to Aspen is based on a thorough assessment of each applicants potential to complete successfully the program.

Industry Overview 

The U.S. market for postsecondary education is a large but flattening market. From 2012 to 2016, total enrollments declined 4% from 20,928,443 to 20,082,977, according to Babson Survey Research Group. The survey reported that private, for-profit enrollments declined significantly over the four-year period, from 1,856,538 to 1,218,646 or -34.4%. Additionally, the survey reported that students enrolled exclusively in distance education courses increased by 13.2% over the four-year period, from 2,633,515 to 2,980,854. Again, enrollments in this cohort in the private, for-profit segment declined by 24.3%, from 927,899 to 702,139. The market share increases among exclusively distance education students was split between public universities and private, non-profits as both segments increased enrollments by more than 250,000 students each. Students enrolled in some but not all distance education courses rose 20.1% over the four-year period, from 2,791,891 to 3,353,659. The private, for-profit segment declined at a lower rate in this cohort, from 134,319 to 125,181 students or -6.8%.
Competition

According to the 2015 Digest of Education Statistics (nces.ed.gov), there are more than 4,600 U.S. colleges and universities serving traditional college age students and adult students. Any reference to universities herein also includes colleges. Competition is highly fragmented and varies by geography, program offerings, delivery method, ownership, quality level, and selectivity of admissions. No one institution has a significant share of the total postsecondary market. While we compete in a sense with traditional brick and mortar universities, our primary competitors are universities that primarily enroll online students. Our primarily online university competitors that are publicly traded include: American Public Education, Inc. (Nasdaq: APEI), Adtalem Global Education (NYSE: ATGE), Grand Canyon Education, Inc. (Nasdaq: LOPE), and Strategic Education, Inc. (Nasdaq: STRA). We also compete with the privately owned Apollo Education Group, which includes University of Phoenix and is considered the market leader based on total enrollments. 

These competitors have degreed enrollments ranging from approximately 38,000 to 90,000 students. As of April 30, 2019, the Company had 8,932 active degree-seeking students enrolled. 

The primary mission of most traditional accredited four-year universities is to serve full-time students and conduct research. Most online universities serve working adults. Aspen Group acknowledges the differences in the educational needs between working and full-time students at brick and mortar schools and provides programs and services that allow our students to earn their degrees without major disruption to their personal and professional lives.

We also compete with public and private degree-granting regionally and nationally accredited universities. An increasing number of universities enroll working students in addition to the traditional 18 to 24-year-old students, and we expect that these universities will continue to modify their existing programs to serve working learners more effectively, including by offering more distance learning programs. We believe that the primary factors on which we compete are the following:

·
 Active and relevant curriculum development that considers the needs of employers;
 ·
 The ability to provide flexible and convenient access to programs and classes;
 ·
 Cost of the program;
 ·
 High-quality courses and services;
 ·
 Comprehensive student support services;
 ·
 Breadth of programs offered;
 ·
 The time necessary to earn a degree;
 ·
 Qualified and experienced faculty;
 ·
 Reputation of the institution and its programs;
 ·
 The variety of geographic locations of campuses;
 ·
 Name recognition; and
 ·
 Convenience.

Sales and Marketing

Following Mr. Michael Mathews becoming Aspens Chief Executive Officer in May 2011, Mr. Mathews and his team made significant changes to Aspens sales and marketing program, specifically spending a significant amount of time, money and resources on our proprietary Internet marketing program. What is unique about our Internet marketing program is that we have not used and have no plans in the near future to utilize third-party online lead generation companies to attract prospective students. To our knowledge, most if not all for-profit online universities utilize multiple third-party online lead generation companies to obtain a meaningful percentage of their prospective student leads. Aspens executive officers have many years of expertise in the online lead generation and Internet advertising industry, which for the foreseeable future will allow Aspen to cost-effectively drive all prospective student leads internally. This is a competitive advantage for Aspen Group because third-party leads are typically unbranded and non-exclusive (lead generation firms typically sell prospective student leads to multiple universities), therefore the conversion rate for those leads tends to be appreciably lower than internally generated, Aspen Group university-specific branded, proprietary leads.

Additionally, in connection with the launch of the pre-licensure BSN hybrid (online/on-campus) program in Phoenix, AZ, the Company has begun to augment its Internet advertising marketing with local radio spots in the Phoenix metro area.

Employees

As of June 15, 2019, we had 232 full-time employees, and 405 adjunct professors, who are part-time employees. None of our employees are parties to any collective bargaining arrangement. We believe our relationships with our employees are good.
Corporate History

Aspen Group was incorporated on February 23, 2010 in Florida. In February 2012, Aspen Group reincorporated in Delaware under the name Aspen Group, Inc.

Aspen University Inc. was incorporated on September 30, 2004 in Delaware. Its predecessor was a Delaware limited liability company organized in Delaware in 1999. On March 13, 2012, Aspen Group, which was then inactive, acquired Aspen University Inc. in a transaction we refer to as the reverse merger. On December 1, 2017, Aspen Group acquired USU. 
Available Information 

Our corporate website is www.aspu.com. We make available on our website under SEC Filings access to our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, Proxy Statements on Schedule 14A and amendments to those materials filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act), free of charge.
Regulation

Students attending our schools finance their education through a combination of individual resources, corporate reimbursement programs and federal student financial assistance funds available through our participation in the Title IV Programs. The discussion which follows outlines the extensive regulations that affect our business. Complying with these regulations entails significant effort from our executives and other employees. Further, regulatory compliance is also expensive. Beyond the internal costs, compliance with the extensive regulatory requirements also involves engagement of outside regulatory professionals.

To participate in Title IV Programs, a school must, among other things, be:


· | Authorized to offer its programs of instruction by the applicable state education agencies in the states in which it is physically located (in our case, Colorado, Arizona and California);
· | Accredited by an accrediting agency recognized by the Secretary of DOE; and 
· | Certified as an eligible institution by DOE. 

State Authorization

On December 19, 2016, DOE issued regulations regarding state authorization of distance education (the “2016 regulations”) that were originally scheduled to go into effect on July 1, 2018. Under the 2016 regulations, Title IV Program institutions, like ours, that offer postsecondary education through distance education to students in a state in which the institution is not physically located or in which it is otherwise subject to state jurisdiction as determined by that state, must meet any state requirements to offer postsecondary education to students in that state and provide specific consumer disclosures regarding educational programs. Under the 2016 regulations, an institution may meet state requirements by seeking authorization from the state or (in all states other than California) through a state authorization reciprocity agreement. The 2016 regulations would require an institution to document state approval for distance education if requested by DOE.
 
On May 25, 2018, the DOE published an announcement in the Federal Register (the Notice) that proposed a two-year delay, until July 1, 2020, of the effective date of the 2016 regulations, and on July 3, 2018, the DOEs delay of the 2016 regulations took effect. According to the Notice, the regulatory delay was prompted by the receipt of letters from the American Council on Education, the Western Interstate Commission for Higher Education, the Cooperative for Educational Technologies, the National Council for State Authorization Reciprocity Agreements, and the Distance Education Accrediting Commission. The organizations stated that they needed information as to how to comply with the regulations, including how the term residence as described in the preamble of the 2016 regulations may conflict with state laws and how to disclose to students the appropriate state complaint process when a number of states, including California, do not currently have formalized complaint processes for all out-of-state institutions. The organizations also pointed out that there is widespread confusion with respect to the public and individualized disclosures of state licensure eligibility for every discipline that requires a license to enter a profession. The Department of Education said that because of the complexity of these issues, we are not confident that we could develop a workable solution through guidance and without the input of negotiators who have been engaged in meeting these requirements. The Notice said that since guidance is nonbinding, negotiated rulemaking is the most appropriate vehicle to provide substantive clarification necessary to stakeholders.

On July 31, 2018, DOE announced its intention to convene a negotiated rulemaking committee (the Committee) to consider proposed regulations for Title IV Programs, including revisions to the 2016 regulations. The Committee convened for several meetings from January to April 2019. On June 12, 2019, DOE published a notice of proposed rulemaking, which included proposed regulations that would supplant the 2016 regulations (the Proposed Regulations). Like the 2016 regulations, the Proposed Regulations would require Title IV Program institutions, like ours, that offer postsecondary education through distance education to students in a state in which the institution is not physically located or in which it is otherwise subject to state jurisdiction as determined by that state, to meet any state requirements to offer postsecondary education to students who are located in that state. 

The Proposed Regulations are subject to a public comment period set to conclude on July 12, 2019, and DOE has indicated that it plans to issue a final rule by November 1, 2019, meaning the Proposed Regulations would be scheduled to go into effect on July 1, 2020. We cannot predict whether the Proposed Regulations will go into effect as currently drafted or as revised. 

Because we are subject to extensive regulations by the states in which we become authorized or licensed to operate, we must abide by state laws that typically establish standards for instruction, qualifications of faculty, administrative procedures, marketing, recruiting, financial operations and other operational matters. State laws and regulations may limit our ability to offer educational programs and to award degrees. Some states may also prescribe financial regulations that are different from those of DOE. If we fail to comply with state licensing requirements, we may lose our state licensure or authorizations. Failure to comply with state requirements could result in Aspen losing its authorization from the Colorado Commission on Higher Education, a department of the Colorado Department of Higher Education (Colorado Department) or Arizona State Board for Private Postsecondary Education (Arizona Board), and USU losing its authorization from the California Bureau for Private Postsecondary Education (California Bureau). In such event, the school would lose its eligibility to participate in Title IV Programs, or its ability to offer certain educational programs, any of which may force us to cease the schools operations.

Additionally, Aspen, ANI and USU are Delaware corporations. Delaware law requires an institution to obtain approval from the Delaware Department of Education, or Delaware DOE, before it may incorporate with the power to confer degrees. In July 2012, Aspen received notice from the Delaware DOE that it was granted provisional approval status effective until June 30, 2015. On April 25, 2016, the Delaware DOE informed Aspen University it was granted full approval to operate with degree-granting authority in the State of Delaware until July 1, 2020. On June 6, 2018, the Delaware DOE granted an initial operating license to United States University until June 30, 2023.

Accreditation

Aspen University is accredited by the DEAC, a national accrediting agency recognized by CHEA and DOE, and USU is accredited by WSCUC, a regional accrediting agency recognized by CHEA and DOE. Accreditation is a non-governmental system for evaluating educational institutions and their programs in areas including student performance, governance, integrity, educational quality, faculty, physical resources, administrative capability and resources, and financial stability. In the U.S., this recognition comes primarily through private voluntary associations that accredit institutions and programs. To be recognized by DOE, accrediting agencies must adopt specific standards for their review of educational institutions. Accrediting agencies establish criteria for accreditation, conduct peer-review evaluations of institutions and programs for accreditation, and publicly designate those institutions or programs that meet their criteria. Accredited institutions are subject to periodic review by accrediting agencies to determine whether such institutions maintain the performance, integrity and quality required for accreditation.

Accreditation is important to our schools for several reasons. Accreditation provides external recognition and status. Employers rely on the accredited status of institutions when evaluating an employment candidates credentials. Corporate and government sponsors under tuition reimbursement programs look to accreditation for assurance that an institution maintains quality educational standards. Other institutions depend, in part, on our accreditation in evaluating transfers of credit and applications to graduate schools. Moreover, institutional accreditation awarded from an accrediting agency recognized by DOE is necessary for eligibility to participate in the Title IV Programs. From time to time, accrediting agencies adopt or make changes to their policies, procedures and standards. If our schools fail to comply with any of these requirements, the non-complying schools accreditation status could be at risk.
 
In addition to institutional accreditation, there are numerous specialized accreditors that accredit specific programs or schools within their jurisdiction, many of which are in healthcare and professional fields. USUs and Aspen Universitys baccalaureate and masters degree programs in nursing are accredited by the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education (CCNE) and Aspen Universitys doctoral nursing degree is currently under review for accreditation. CCNE is officially recognized by CHEA and DOE and provides accreditation for nursing programs. Accreditation by CCNE signifies that those programs have met the additional standards of that agency. We are also pleased that Aspen Universitys School of Business and Technology has been awarded the status of Candidate for Accreditation by the International Accreditation Council for Business Education (IACBE) for its baccalaureate and masters business programs. If we fail to satisfy the standards of specialized accreditors, we could lose the specialized accreditation for the affected programs, which could result in materially reduced student enrollments in those programs and prevent our students from seeking and obtaining appropriate licensure in their fields.

State Education Licensure and Regulation

As an institution of higher education that grants degrees and certificates, we are required to be authorized by applicable state education authorities which exercise regulatory oversight of our institutions. In addition, in order to participate in the Title IV Programs, we must be authorized by the applicable state education agencies.

Aspen University is an approved institutional participant in SARA. SARA is intended to make it easier for students to take online courses offered by postsecondary institutions based in another state. SARA is overseen by a National Council (NC-SARA) and administered by four regional education compacts. There is an annual renewal for participating in NC-SARA and the state-level agency, in Aspen Universitys case CO-SARA, and institutions must agree to meet certain requirements to participate.


6


The only state that does not participate in SARA is California and it has imposed regulatory requirements on out-of-state educational institutions operating within its boundaries, such as those having a physical facility or conducting certain academic activities within the state. Aspen University is registered as an out-of-state institution with California until February 28, 2021. Aspen currently enrolls students in all 50 states. While we do not believe that any of the states in which our schools are currently licensed or authorized, other than Colorado, Arizona and California, are individually material to our operations, the loss of licensure or authorization in any state could prohibit us from recruiting prospective students or offering services to current students in that state, which could significantly reduce our enrollments.

Because USU is based in California, which does not participate in NC-SARA, USU must obtain authorization in every state in which it intends to market and enroll online students, which was the standard method prior to the formation of NC-SARA. USU is currently authorized to offer one or more programs in 40 states and is in the application process with 7 additional states and the District of Columbia. USU maintains its state authorizations through annual reporting and required renewals.

Individual state laws establish standards in areas such as instruction, qualifications of faculty, administrative procedures, marketing, recruiting, financial operations, and other operational matters, some of which are different than the standards prescribed by the Colorado Department, the Arizona Board and the California Bureau. Laws in some states limit schools ability to offer educational programs and award degrees to residents of those states. Some states also prescribe financial regulations that are different from those of DOE, and many require the posting of surety bonds. Laws, regulations, or interpretations related to online education could increase our cost of doing business and affect our ability to recruit students in particular states, which could, in turn, negatively affect enrollments and revenues and have a material adverse effect on our business.

On February 22, 2019, members of the California General Assembly proposed a legislative package that would increase regulatory compliance requirements for institutions that are approved by the California Bureau. The legislative package passed the California General Assembly but has been amended to reduce significantly the regulatory burden on institutions approved by the California Bureau. The legislative package must also pass the California Senate by September 13, 2019 before it is signed into law. We cannot predict whether the legislative package will become law. 

State Professional Licensure

States have specific requirements that an individual must satisfy in order to be licensed or certified as a professional in specific fields. For example, graduates from some USU and Aspen University nursing programs often seek professional licensure in their field because they are legally required to do so in order to work in that field or because obtaining licensure enhances employment opportunities. Success in obtaining licensure depends on several factors, including each individuals personal and professional qualifications as well as other factors related to the degree or program completed, including but not necessarily limited to: 

· | whether the institution and the program were approved by the state in which the graduate seeks licensure, or by a professional association;
· | whether the program from which the applicant graduated meets all state requirements; and 
· | whether the institution and/or the program is accredited by a CHEA and DOE-recognized agency. 


Professional licensure and certification requirements can vary by state and may change over time. 

Nature of Federal, State and Private Financial Support for Postsecondary Education

The federal government provides a substantial part of its support for postsecondary education through the Title IV Programs, in the form of grants and loans to students. Students can use those funds at any institution that has been certified by DOE to participate in the Title IV Programs. Aid under Title IV Programs is primarily awarded on the basis of financial need, generally defined as the difference between the cost of attending the institution and the amount a student can reasonably contribute to that cost. All recipients of Title IV Program funds must maintain satisfactory academic progress and must progress in a timely manner toward completion of their program of study. In addition, each school must ensure that Title IV Program funds are properly accounted for and disbursed in the correct amounts to eligible students.


7


Our institutional missions manifest itself through offering students the opportunity to fund their education without relying solely on student loans. In March 2014, Aspen University launched a $250 monthly payment plan for associate and bachelor degree students and a $325 monthly payment plan for masters degree students, and subsequently a $375 monthly payment plan for doctoral students. The monthly payment plan is available to all Aspen University and United States University students except those in the Aspen University BSN Pre-licensure program. Note that effective August 2019, new student enrollments for USUs FNP monthly payment plan will be offered a $9,000 two-year payment plan ($375/month x 24 months) designed to pay for the first years pre-clinical courses only (approximate cost of $9,000). The second academic year in which students complete their clinical courses (approximate cost of $18,000) will be required to be funded through conventional payment methods (either cash, private loans, corporate tuition reimbursement or federal financial aid).

Currently, 69% of Aspen University students utilize monthly payment options, including the monthly payment plan (63%) or the installment plan (6%). In 2017, USU implemented these monthly payment options and currently has 68% of its students utilizing them, including the monthly payment plan (67%) and the installment plan (1%).

When Aspen University students seek funding from the federal government, they receive loans and grants to fund their education under the following Title IV Programs: (1) the Federal Direct Loan program, or Direct Loan and (2) the Federal Pell Grant program, or Pell. USU students are eligible for the same, plus Federal Work Study and Federal Supplemental Opportunity Grants. For the fiscal year ended April 30, 2019, approximately 19% of Aspen Universitys cash-basis revenues for eligible tuition and fees were derived from Title IV Programs. Therefore, the majority of Aspen University students self-finance all or a portion of their education. For the calendar year ended December 31, 2018, approximately 30% of United States Universitys cash-basis revenues for eligible tuition and fees were derived from Title IV Programs. 

Additionally, students may receive full or partial tuition reimbursement from their employers. Eligible students can also access private loans through a number of different lenders for funding at current market interest rates.

Under the Direct Loan program, DOE makes loans directly to students. The Direct Loan Program includes the Direct Subsidized Loan, the Direct Unsubsidized Loan, the Direct PLUS Loan (including loans to graduate and professional students), and the Direct Consolidation Loan. The Budget Control Act of 2011 signed into law in August 2011, eliminated Direct Subsidized Loans for graduate and professional students, as of July 1, 2012. The terms and conditions of subsidized loans originated prior to July 1, 2012 are unaffected by the law.

For Pell grants, DOE makes grants to undergraduate students who demonstrate financial need. To date, few of our students have received Pell Grants. Accordingly, the Pell Grant program currently is not material to the Companys cash revenues.

Regulation of Federal Student Financial Aid Programs

The substantial amount of federal funds disbursed through Title IV Programs, the large number of students and institutions participating in these programs, and allegations of fraud and abuse by certain for-profit institutions have prompted DOE to exercise considerable regulatory oversight over for-profit institutions of higher learning. Accrediting agencies and state education agencies also have responsibilities for overseeing compliance of institutions in connection with Title IV Program requirements. As a result, our institutions are subject to extensive oversight and review. Because DOE periodically revises its regulations and changes its interpretations of existing laws and regulations, we cannot predict how the Title IV Program requirements will be applied in all circumstances. See the Risk Factors contained herein which disclose comprehensive regulatory risks.

In addition to the state authorization requirements and other regulatory requirements described herein, other significant factors relating to Title IV Programs that could adversely affect us include the following legislative action and regulatory changes:

Congressional Action. Congress reauthorizes the Higher Education Act approximately every five to six years. Congress most recently reauthorized the Higher Education Act in August 2008 through the end of 2013 and the law has been extended since that date. Congress has held hearings regarding the reauthorization of the HEA and has continued to consider new legislation regarding passage of the HEA. We cannot predict whether or when Congress might act to amend further the HEA. The elimination of additional Title IV Programs, material changes in the requirements for participation in such programs, or the substitution of materially different programs could increase our costs of compliance and could reduce the ability of certain students to finance their education at our institutions. 


8


Federal Rulemaking. On July 31, 2018, DOE announced its intention to convene a negotiated rulemaking committee (the Committee) to prepare proposed regulations for Title IV Programs. From January 2019 to April 2019, the Committee met to consider proposed regulations on a variety of topics including the following: 

· | Criteria used by the Secretary of the DOE to recognize accrediting agencies; 
· | Clarification of the primary functions and responsibilities of accrediting agencies, state education agencies, and DOE; 
· | Clarification of permissible arrangements between institutions and other organizations to provide a portion of an education program;
· | Revisions to rules related to distance education, direct assessment programs, and competency-based education; 
· | Consideration of the 2016 regulations relating to state authorization of distance education and corresponding disclosures; 
· | Revisions to various regulatory definitions, including the definition of a “credit hour”; and 
· | Elimination of regulations related to Title IV Programs that have not been funded in recent years. 


In April 2019, the Committee reached consensus on all proposed rules subject to the negotiated rulemaking. On June 12, 2019, DOE issued a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) that proposes rules related to accreditation and state authorization. The NPRM is subject to a public comment period set to conclude on July 12, 2019, and DOE has indicated that it plans to issue a final rule by November 1, 2019, meaning the rules included in the June 12, 2019 NPRM would be scheduled to go into effect on July 1, 2020. We cannot predict whether those proposed regulations will go into effect as currently drafted or will be revised. 

DOE intends to issue two additional NPRMs prior to November 1, 2019, that would include the proposed rules not included in the June 12, 2019 NPRM. We cannot predict when DOE will publish the two additional NPRMs. 

Administrative Capability. DOE regulations specify extensive criteria by which an institution must establish that it has the requisite administrative capability to participate in Title IV Programs. Failure to satisfy any of the standards may lead DOE to find the institution ineligible to participate in Title IV Programs or to place the institution on provisional certification as a condition of its participation. To meet the administrative capability standards, an institution must, among other things:

· | Comply with all applicable Title IV Program regulations; 
· | Have capable and sufficient personnel to administer the federal student financial aid programs; 
· | Have acceptable methods of defining and measuring the satisfactory academic progress of its students; 
· | Have cohort default rates above specified levels; 
· | Have various procedures in place for safeguarding federal funds; 
· | Not be, and not have any principal or affiliate who is, debarred or suspended from federal contracting or engaging in activity that is cause for debarment or suspension; 
· | Provide financial aid counseling to its students; 
· | Refer to DOE’s Office of Inspector General any credible information indicating that any applicant, student, employee, or agent of the institution, has been engaged in any fraud or other illegal conduct involving Title IV Programs; 
· | Report annually to the Secretary of Education on any reasonable reimbursements paid or provided by a private education lender or group of lenders to any employee who is employed in the institution’s financial aid office or who otherwise has responsibilities with respect to education loans;
· | Develop and apply an adequate system to identify and resolve conflicting information with respect to a student’s application for Title IV aid; 
· | Submit in a timely manner all reports and financial statements required by the regulations; and 
· | Not otherwise appear to lack administrative capability. 


DOE regulations also add an administrative capability standard related to the existing requirement that students must have a high school diploma or its recognized equivalent in order to be eligible for Title IV Program aid. Under the administrative capability standard, institutions must develop and follow procedures for evaluating the validity of a students high school diploma if the institution or the Secretary of Education has reason to believe that the students diploma is not valid.

If an institution fails to satisfy any of these criteria or any other DOE regulation, DOE may:


· | Require the repayment of Title IV Program funds; 
· | Transfer the institution from the “advance” system of payment of Title IV Program funds to cash monitoring status or to the “reimbursement” system of payment;
· | Place the institution on provisional certification status; or 
· | Commence a proceeding to impose a fine or to limit, suspend or terminate the participation of the institution in Title IV Programs.

If we are found not to have satisfied DOE’s “administrative capability” requirements, we could lose, or be limited in our access to, Title IV Program funding. USU had been requested to post a letter of credit (LOC) in the amount of $71,634 in response to a compliance audit that reported the university had a repeat finding related to late R2T4 (return to Title IV) returns, but that LOC, as funded by AGI expired as of March 31, 2019 and the funds are slated to return. As of May 14, 2019, United States University has been granted provisional approval to participate in the Title IV Programs and has a program participation agreement reapplication date of December 31, 2020. As part of the provisional approval, the DOE informed USU that it must post a letter of credit in the amount of $255,708, which was funded by AGI; this letter will remain in effect for the duration of the provisional approval. USU expects to be on Heightened Cash Management 1 (HCM1), once formal notification is received from the DOE.

Distance Education. We offer all of our existing degree and certificate programs via Internet-based telecommunications from our headquarters in Colorado, Arizona and California. Under the Higher Education Opportunity Act, or HEOA, an accreditor that evaluates institutions offering distance education must require such institutions to have processes through which the institution establishes that a student who registers for a distance education program is the same student who participates in and receives credit for the program.

On December 16, 2016, DOE issued a final rule that requires institutions to meet all state requirements for legally offering distance education in any state in which the institution is offering distance education courses. The rule was scheduled to go into effect on July 1, 2018 which has been delayed until July 1, 2020. On June 12, 2019, DOE issued Proposed Regulations that among other things, would modify the 2016 regulations regarding state authorization of distance education. See Risk Factors in Item 1A of this Report.

Financial Responsibility. The Higher Education Act and DOE regulations establish extensive standards of financial responsibility that institutions such as Aspen must satisfy to participate in the Title IV Programs. These standards generally require that an institution provide the resources necessary to comply with Title IV Program requirements and meet all of its financial obligations, including required refunds and any repayments to DOE for liabilities incurred in programs administered by DOE.

DOE evaluates institutions on an annual basis for compliance with specified financial responsibility standards that include a complex formula that uses line items from the institutions audited financial statements. In addition, the financial responsibility standards require an institution to receive an unqualified opinion from its accountants on its audited financial statements, maintain sufficient cash reserves to satisfy refund requirements, meet all of its financial obligations, and remain current on its debt payments. The formula focuses on three financial ratios: (1) equity ratio (which measures the institutions capital resources, financial viability, and ability to borrow); (2) primary reserve ratio (which measures the institutions viability and liquidity); and (3) net income ratio (which measures the institutions profitability or ability to operate within its means). An institutions financial ratios must yield a composite score of at least 1.5 for the institution to be deemed financially responsible without the need for further federal oversight. DOE may also apply such measures of financial responsibility to the operating company and ownership entities of an eligible institution.

Although we believe our schools met the minimum composite score necessary to meet the financial ratio standard for fiscal year 2019, DOE may determine that our calculations are incorrect, and/or it may determine that either or both of our schools continue to not meet other financial responsibility standards. If DOE were to determine that we do not meet its financial responsibility standards, we may be able to continue to establish financial responsibility on an alternative basis. Alternative bases include, for example:


· | Posting a letter of credit in an amount equal to at least 50% of the total Title IV Program funds received by us during our most recently completed fiscal year; 
· | Posting a letter of credit in an amount equal to at least 10% of such prior year’s Title IV Program funds received by us, accepting provisional certification, complying with additional DOE monitoring requirements and agreeing to receive Title IV Program funds under an arrangement other than DOE’s standard advance payment arrangement such as the “reimbursement” system of payment or cash monitoring; or
· | Complying with additional DOE monitoring requirements and agreeing to receive Title IV Program funds under an arrangement other than DOEs standard advance payment arrangement such as the reimbursement system of payment or cash monitoring. 


Failure to meet DOEs financial responsibility requirements, either because we do not meet DOEs financial responsibility standards or are unable to establish financial responsibility on an alternative basis, would cause us to lose access to Title IV Program funding.


10


Third-Party Servicers. DOE regulations permit an institution to enter into a written contract with a third-party servicer for the administration of any aspect of the institutions participation in Title IV Programs. The third-party servicer must, among other obligations, comply with Title IV Program requirements and be jointly and severally liable with the institution to the Secretary of Education for any violation by the servicer of any Title IV Program provision. An institution must report to DOE new contracts with or any significant modifications to contracts with third-party servicers as well as other matters related to third-party servicers. We contract with a third-party servicer which performs certain activities related to our participation in Title IV Programs. If our third-party servicer does not comply with applicable statutes and regulations including the Higher Education Act, we may be liable for its actions, and we could lose our eligibility to participate in Title IV Programs.

Return of Title IV Program Funds. Under DOEs return of funds regulations, when a student withdraws, an institution must return unearned funds to DOE in a timely manner. An institution must first determine the amount of Title IV Program funds that a student earned. If the student withdraws during the first 60% of any period of enrollment or payment period, the amount of Title IV Program funds that the student earned is equal to a pro rata portion of the funds for which the student would otherwise be eligible. If the student withdraws after the 60% threshold, then the student has earned 100% of the Title IV Program funds. The institution must return to the appropriate Title IV Programs, in a specified order, the lesser of (i) the unearned Title IV Program funds and (ii) the institutional charges incurred by the student for the period multiplied by the percentage of unearned Title IV Program funds. An institution must return the funds no later than 45 days after the date of the institutions determination that a student withdrew. If such payments are not timely made, an institution may be subject to adverse action, including being required to submit a letter of credit equal to 25% of the refunds the institution should have made in its most recently completed fiscal year. Under DOE regulations, late returns of Title IV Program funds for 5% or more of students sampled in the institutions annual compliance audit or a DOE program review constitutes material non-compliance with the Title IV Program requirements.
The 90/10 Rule. A requirement of the Higher Education Act commonly referred to as the 90/10 Rule, applies only to proprietary institutions of higher education. An institution is subject to loss of eligibility to participate in the Title IV Programs if it derives more than 90% of its revenues (calculated on a cash basis and in accordance with a DOE formula) from Title IV Programs for two consecutive fiscal years. An institution whose rate exceeds 90% for any single fiscal year will be placed on provisional certification for at least two fiscal years and may be subject to other conditions specified by the Secretary of DOE. For the year ended April 30, 2019, approximately 19% of Aspens revenues were derived from Title IV Programs. For the year ended December 31, 2018, 30% of USUs revenues were derived from Title IV Programs.
Student Loan Defaults. Under the Higher Education Act, an education institution may lose its eligibility to participate in some or all of the Title IV Programs if defaults on the repayment of Direct Loan Program loans by its students exceed certain levels. For each federal fiscal year, a rate of student defaults (known as a cohort default rate) is calculated for each institution with 30 or more borrowers entering repayment in a given federal fiscal year by determining the rate at which borrowers who become subject to their repayment obligation in that federal fiscal year default by the end of the following two federal fiscal years. For such institutions, DOE calculates a single cohort default rate for each federal fiscal year that includes in the cohort all current or former student borrowers at the institution who entered repayment on any Direct Loan Program loans during that year.

If an institutions cohort default rate equals or exceeds 25% in any single year, the institution may be placed on provisional certification status. Provisional certification does not limit an institutions access to Title IV Program funds; however, an institution with provisional status is subject to closer review by DOE and may be subject to summary adverse action if it violates Title IV Program requirements. If an institutions default rate exceeds 40% for one federal fiscal year, the institution may lose eligibility to participate in some or all Title IV Programs. Aspen Universitys official 3-year cohort default rates were as follows: FY2015 (5.7%), FY2014 (6.2%) and FY2013 (6.4%). USUs official 3-year cohort default rates were as follows: FY2015 (11.4%), FY2014 (9.6%) and FY2013 (3.5%).

Incentive Compensation Rule. As a part of an institutions program participation agreement with DOE and in accordance with the Higher Education Act, an institution may not provide any commission, bonus or other incentive payment to any person or entity engaged in any student recruitment, admissions or financial aid awarding activity based directly or indirectly on success in securing enrollments or financial aid. Failure to comply with the incentive payment rule could result in termination of participation in Title IV Programs, limitation on participation in Title IV Programs, or financial penalties. Aspen believes it is in compliance with the Incentive Compensation Rule (the IC Rule).


11


In recent years, other postsecondary educational institutions have been named as defendants in whistleblower lawsuits, known as qui tam cases, brought by current or former employees pursuant to the Federal False Claims Act, alleging that their institutions compensation practices did not comply with the IC Rule. A qui tam case is a civil lawsuit brought by one or more individuals, referred to as a relator, on behalf of the federal government for an alleged submission to the government of a false claim for payment. The relator, often a current or former employee, is entitled to a share of the governments recovery in the case, including the possibility of treble damages. A qui tam action is always filed under seal and remains under seal until the government decides whether to intervene in the case. If the government intervenes, it takes over primary control of the litigation. If the government declines to intervene in the case, the relator may nonetheless elect to continue to pursue the litigation at his or her own expense on behalf of the government. Any such litigation could be costly and could divert managements time and attention away from the business, regardless of whether a claim has merit.

The U.S. Government Accountability Office (the GAO) released a report finding that DOE has inadequately enforced the current ban on incentive payments. In response, DOE has undertaken to increase its enforcement efforts by, among other approaches, strengthening procedures provided to auditors reviewing institutions for compliance with the incentive payments ban and updating its internal compliance guidance in light of the GAO findings and DOE incentive payment rule.

Code of Conduct Related to Student Loans. As part of an institutions program participation agreement with DOE, HEOA requires that institutions that participate in Title IV Programs adopt a code of conduct pertinent to student loans. For financial aid officers or other employees who have responsibility related to education loans, the code must forbid, with limited exceptions, gifts, consulting arrangements with lenders, and advisory board compensation other than reasonable expense reimbursement. The code also must ban revenue-sharing arrangements, opportunity pools that lenders offer in exchange for certain promises, and staffing assistance from lenders. The institution must post the code prominently on its website and ensure that its officers, employees, and agents who have financial aid responsibilities are informed annually of the codes provisions. Aspen has adopted a code of conduct under the HEOA which is posted on its website. In addition to the code of conduct requirements that apply to institutions, HEOA contains provisions that apply to private lenders, prohibiting such lenders from engaging in certain activities as they interact with institutions. Failure to comply with the code of conduct provision could result in termination of our participation in Title IV Programs, limitations on participation in Title IV Programs, or financial penalties.
Misrepresentation. The Higher Education Act and current regulations authorize DOE to take action against an institution that participates in Title IV Programs for any substantial misrepresentation made by that institution regarding the nature of its educational program, its financial charges, or the employability of its graduates. DOE regulations define substantial misrepresentation to cover additional representatives of the institution and additional substantive areas and expands the parties to whom a substantial misrepresentation cannot be made. The regulations also augment the actions DOE may take if it determines that an institution has engaged in substantial misrepresentation. DOE may revoke an institutions program participation agreement, impose limitations on an institutions participation in Title IV Programs, or initiate proceedings to impose a fine or to limit, suspend, or terminate the institutions participation in Title IV Programs.
Credit Hours. The Higher Education Act and current regulations use the term credit hour to define an eligible program and an academic year and to determine enrollment status and the amount of Title IV Program aid an institution may disburse during a payment period. Recently, both Congress and DOE have increased their focus on institutions policies for awarding credit hours. DOE regulations define the term credit hour in terms of a certain amount of time in class and outside class, or an equivalent amount of work. The regulations also require accrediting agencies to review the reliability and accuracy of an institutions credit hour assignments. If an accreditor identifies systematic or significant noncompliance in one or more of an institutions programs, the accreditor must notify the Secretary of Education. If DOE determines that an institution is out of compliance with the credit hour definition, DOE could require the institution to repay the incorrectly awarded amounts of Title IV Program aid. In addition, if DOE determines that an institution has significantly overstated the amount of credit hours assigned to a program, DOE may fine the institution, or limit, suspend, or terminate its participation in the Title IV Programs.

On July 31, 2018, DOE announced its intention to convene a negotiated rulemaking committee (the Committee) to consider proposed regulations for Title IV Programs, including revisions to the regulatory definition of credit hour. The Committee reached consensus on a revised definition of credit hour in April 2019, but DOE has not yet published a proposed rule that includes the revised definition. 


12


Compliance Reviews. We are subject to announced and unannounced compliance reviews and audits by various external agencies, including DOE, its Office of Inspector General, state licensing agencies, and accrediting agencies. As part of DOEs ongoing monitoring of institutions administration of Title IV Programs, the Higher Education Act and DOE regulations require institutions to submit annually a compliance audit conducted by an independent certified public accountant in accordance with Government Auditing Standards and applicable audit standards of DOE. These auditing standards differ from those followed in the audit of our consolidated financial statements contained herein. In addition, to enable DOE to make a determination of financial responsibility, institutions must annually submit audited financial statements prepared in accordance with DOE regulations. Furthermore, DOE regularly conducts program reviews of education institutions that are participating in the Title IV Programs, and the Office of Inspector General of DOE regularly conducts audits and investigations of such institutions. 
Potential Effect of Regulatory Violations. If we fail to comply with the regulatory standards governing Title IV Programs, DOE could impose one or more sanctions, including transferring the non-complying school to the reimbursement or cash monitoring system of payment, seeking to require repayment of certain Title IV Program funds, requiring Aspen to post a letter of credit in favor of DOE as a condition for continued Title IV certification, taking emergency action against us, referring the matter for criminal prosecution or initiating proceedings to impose a fine or to limit, condition, suspend or terminate our participation in Title IV Programs. In addition, the failure to comply with the Title IV Program requirements by one institution could increase DOE scrutiny of the other institution and could impact the other institutions participation in Title IV Programs.

We also may be subject, from time to time, to complaints and lawsuits relating to regulatory compliance brought not only by our regulatory agencies, but also by other government agencies and third parties, such as state attorneys general, federal and state consumer protection agencies, present or former students or employees and other members of the public.

Restrictions on Adding Educational Programs. State requirements and accrediting agency standards may, in certain instances, limit our ability to establish additional educational programs. Many states require approval before institutions can add new programs under specified conditions. The Colorado Commission on Higher Education, the Arizona Board, the California Bureau for Private Postsecondary Education, and other state educational regulatory agencies that license or authorize us and our programs may require institutions to notify them in advance of implementing new programs, and upon notification, may undertake a review of the institutions licensure or authorization.

On August 22, 2017, DOE recertified Aspen University to participate in Title IV Programs, and set a subsequent program participation agreement reapplication date of March 31, 2021. As of May 14, 2019, United States University has been granted provisional approval to participate in the Title IV Programs and has a program participation agreement reapplication date of December 31, 2020. As part of the provisional approval, the DOE informed USU that it must post a letter of credit in the amount of $255,708, which was funded by AGI; this letter will remain in effect for the duration of the provisional approval. USU expects to be on HCM1, once formal notification is received from the DOE.

In the future, DOE may impose terms and conditions in any program participation agreement that it may issue, including growth restrictions or limitation on the number of students who may receive Title IV Program aid. The institution may also be required to provide certifications to DOE signed by a senior administrative official attesting that the new program meets certain accreditation and state licensure requirements.

DEAC and WSCUC require pre-approval of new courses, programs, and degrees that are characterized as a substantive change. An institution must obtain written notice approving such change before it may be included in the institutions grant of accreditation. An institution is further prohibited from advertising or posting on its website information about the course or program before it has received approval. The process for obtaining approval generally requires submission of a report and course materials and may require a follow-up on-site visit by an examining committee.

Gainful Employment. Under the Higher Education Act, only proprietary school educational programs that lead to gainful employment in a recognized occupation are eligible to participate in Title IV Program funding. DOE issued final Gainful Employment (GE) regulations on October 31, 2014 (2014 GE Rule), which went into effect on July 1, 2015. The 2014 GE Rule defines the requirements that programs at proprietary institutions must meet in order to be considered a GE program that is eligible for Title IV Program funding. Under these regulations, all GE programs must meet certain metrics regarding their graduates debt-to-earnings or debt-to-discretionary-income (collectively, D/E) ratios to maintain Title IV Program eligibility, as well as creating extensive reporting and disclosure requirements for institutions.


13


Under the 2014 GE Rule, DOE issued only one set of D/E rates, in January 2017. In the period following that publication, DOE has continued to collect and distribute information to institutions, and institutions were required to continue complying with the Rule, subject to various delays. 

On July 1, 2019, DOE issued a new final GE Rule. In this publication, DOE rescinded the entirety of Subparts Q and R of 34 CFR 668, which included all of the provisions of the 2014 GE Rule. The effective date of this new rule is July 1, 2020; however, the Secretary has provided institutions the opportunity to implement the new rule beginning on July 1, 2019. Both Aspen University and USU have opted to implement the new rule early and have internally documented their determination to take early action, following the direction provided by the DOE in Gainful Employment Electronic Announcement #122. Therefore, as of July 1, 2019, neither Aspen University nor USU is required to comply with the 2014 GE Rule. 

Eligibility and Certification Procedures. Each institution must periodically apply to DOE for continued certification to participate in Title IV Programs. Such recertification is required every six years, but may be required earlier, including when an institution undergoes a change of control. An institution may come under DOEs review when it expands its activities in certain ways, such as opening an additional location, adding a new program, or, in certain cases, when it modifies academic credentials that it offers.

DOE may place an institution on provisional certification status if it finds that the institution does not fully satisfy all of the eligibility and certification standards and in certain other circumstances, such as when it undergoes a change in ownership and control. DOE may more closely review an institution that is provisionally certified if it applies for approval to open a new location, add an educational program, acquire another school or make any other significant change.

In addition, during the period of provisional certification, the institution must comply with any additional conditions included in its program participation agreement. If DOE determines that a provisionally certified institution is unable to meet its responsibilities under its program participation agreement, it may seek to revoke the institutions certification to participate in Title IV Programs with fewer due process protections for the institution than if it were fully certified. Students attending provisionally certified institutions remain eligible to receive Title IV Program funds.

Borrower Defense to Repayment (BDTR). Pursuant to the Higher Education Act and following negotiated rulemaking, on November 1, 2016, the DOE released a final regulation (2016 BDTR Rule) specifying the acts or omissions of an institution that a borrower may assert as a defense to repayment of a loan made under the Direct Loan Program and the consequences of such borrower defenses for borrowers, institutions, and the DOE. Under the regulation, for Direct Loans disbursed after July 1, 2017, a student borrower may assert a defense to repayment if: (1) the student borrower obtained a state or federal court judgment against the institution; (2) the institution failed to perform on a contract with the student; and/or (3) the institution committed a substantial misrepresentation on which the borrower reasonably relied to his or her detriment.

These defenses are asserted through claims submitted to the DOE, and the DOE has the authority to issue a final decision. In addition, the regulation permits the DOE to grant relief to an individual or group of individuals, including individuals who have not applied to the DOE seeking relief. If a defense is successfully raised, the DOE has discretion to initiate action to collect from an institution the amount of losses incurred based on the borrower defense. 

The regulation also amends the rules concerning discharge of federal student loans when a school or campus closes, requires institutions to report events that might potentially impact an institutions financial responsibility (financial triggers) to allow DOE to determine if the institution needs to provide additional assurances or surety to continue participating in the Title IV programs, and prohibits pre-dispute arbitration agreements and class action waivers for borrower defense-type claims. 

On January 19, 2017, the DOE issued a final procedural rule, specifically relating to the then-upcoming borrower defense rules, with request for comments. These rules were limited to updating the hearing procedures for actions to establish liability against an institution of higher education and establishing procedures for recovery proceedings under the borrower defense regulations. 

Several times between June 2017 and February 2018, the DOE announced delays until July 1, 2019 for implementation of certain portions of the 2016 BDTR Rule. However, in October 2018, a judge denied a request to delay implementation, and as a result, the regulations went into effect as of October 16, 2018 and will remain in effect until such time as any new regulations are developed under the negotiated rulemaking process. DOE issued additional guidance regarding its planned implementation of the 2016 BDTR rule on March 15, 2019, which included specific processes for reporting financial responsibility trigger events occurring since July 1, 2017. 
 
14


Prior to the court decision noted above, on June 16, 2017, the DOE announced its intent to convene a negotiated rulemaking committee to develop new and different proposed regulations related to borrower defense to replace the 2016 BDTR Rule and to address certain other related matters. Following three negotiated rulemaking sessions, on July 31, 2018, the DOE published a notice of proposed rulemaking that, among other things, would establish a new federal standard for evaluating, and a process for adjudicating, BDTR claims made on or after July 1, 2019. The DOE accepted public comments on the notice of proposed rulemaking through August 30, 2018; however, the DOE did not publish the final rule by November 1, 2018, as required by the Departments master calendar to allow the final regulation to take effect on July 1, 2019. DOE has indicated that it still intends to publish a new BDTR Rule to replace the 2016 BDTR Rule, but has not yet done so. We cannot predict when or if DOE will issue a new BDTR Rule, or what will be proposed or ultimately adopted.

Change in Ownership Resulting in a Change of Control. In addition to school acquisitions, other types of transactions can also cause a change of control. The DOE, most state education agencies, and the DEAC all have standards pertaining to the change of control of schools, but those standards are not uniform. DOE regulations describe some transactions that constitute a change of control, including the transfer of a controlling interest in the voting stock of an institution or the institutions parent corporation. The DOE regulations provide that a change of control of a publicly-traded corporation occurs in one of two ways: (i) if there is an event that would obligate the corporation to file a Current Report on Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, disclosing a change of control or (ii) if the corporation has a shareholder that owns at least 25% of the total outstanding voting stock of the corporation and is the largest shareholder of the corporation, and that shareholder ceases to own at least 25% of such stock or ceases to be the largest shareholder. A significant purchase or disposition of our voting stock could be determined by the DOE to be a change of control under this standard. Many states include the sale of a controlling interest of common stock in the definition of a change of control requiring approval. A change of control under the definition of one of these agencies would require us to seek approval of the change in ownership and control to maintain our accreditations, state authorization or licensure. The requirements to obtain such approval from the states and the DEAC vary widely. In some cases, approval of the change of ownership and control cannot be obtained until after the transaction has occurred.

When a change of ownership resulting in a change of control occurs at a for-profit institution, the DOE applies a different set of financial tests to determine the financial responsibility of the institution in conjunction with its review and approval of the change of ownership. The institution generally is required to submit a same-day audited balance sheet reflecting the financial condition of the institution immediately following the change in ownership. The institutions same-day balance sheet must demonstrate an acid test ratio of at least 1:1, which is calculated by adding cash and cash equivalents to current accounts receivable and dividing the sum by total current liabilities (and excluding all unsecured or uncollateralized related party receivables). The same-day balance sheet must also demonstrate positive tangible net worth. If the institution does not satisfy these requirements, the DOE may condition its approval of the change of ownership on the institutions agreeing to post a letter of credit, provisional certification, and/or additional monitoring requirements, as described in the above section on Financial Responsibility. The time required for the DOE to act on a change in ownership and control application may vary substantially. As of May 14, 2019, United States University has been granted provisional approval to participate in the Title IV Programs and has a program participation agreement reapplication date of December 31, 2020. As part of the provisional approval, the DOE informed USU that it must post a letter of credit in the amount of $255,708; this letter will remain in effect for the duration of the provisional approval. United States University currently awaits final disposition concerning any potential Heightened Cash Monitoring 1 (HCM1); the institution has not been, nor is it currently identified on the DOE website as an HCM1 school. See Risk Factors contained in Item 1A of this Report.

A change of control also could occur as a result of future transactions in which Aspen is involved. Some corporate reorganizations and some changes in the composition of the Board are examples of such transactions. Moreover, the potential adverse effects of a change of control could influence future decisions by us and our shareholders regarding the sale, purchase, transfer, issuance or redemption of our stock. In addition, the regulatory burdens and risks associated with a change of control also could discourage bids for your shares of common stock and could have an adverse effect on the market price of your shares.

Possible Acquisitions. Similarly to the Companys acquisition of USU, we may expand through acquisition of related or synergistic businesses. Our internal growth is subject to monitoring and ultimately approval by the DEAC and WSCUC. If the DEAC or WSCUC finds that the growth may adversely affect our academic quality, the DEAC or WSCUC can request us to slow the growth and potentially withdraw accreditation and require us to re-apply for accreditation. DOE may also impose growth restrictions on an institution, including in connection with a change in ownership and control.

Clery Act and Title IX. Both USU and Aspen University publish the required Annual Crime and Security Reports to comply with the requirements of the federal Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act (Clery Act). USUs Report covers its San Diego, CA location; Aspen publishes separate reports for its Denver, CO and Phoenix, AZ locations. Both universities are committed to providing students, faculty, staff, and guests a safe and secure environment. The Reports identify policies and procedures for security and crime prevention, substance abuse, sexual misconduct/harassment (Title IX), and emergency response and evacuation.

Other Approvals. The U.S. Department of Defense and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (the VA) regulate our participation in the militarys tuition assistance program and the VAs veterans education benefits program, respectively. The laws, regulations, standards and policies of these agencies cover the vast majority of our operations, including our educational programs, facilities, instructional and administrative staff, administrative procedures, marketing, recruiting, financial operations and financial condition. These regulatory requirements can also affect our ability to add new or expand existing educational programs and to change our corporate structure and ownership.
Seasonality 

Our business has been seasonal with our fiscal fourth quarter (beginning February 1) being our strongest quarter and the fiscal second quarter (beginning August 1) being the next strongest. The fiscal first quarter (beginning May 1) is the weakest as it covers the summer months of June and July. Given the growth of USUs structured two-year MSN-FNP program and Aspen Universitys six semesters per year pre-licensure BSN campus program, future seasonality may be less pronounced.
