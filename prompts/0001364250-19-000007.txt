Item 1. Business Overview
Business description
Douglas Emmett, Inc. is a fully integrated, self-administered and self-managed REIT. We are one of the largest owners and operators of high-quality office and multifamily properties located in premier coastal submarkets in Los Angeles and Honolulu. Through our interest in our Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries, our consolidated JVs, and our unconsolidated Funds, we focus on owning, acquiring, developing and managing a significant market share of top-tier office properties and premier multifamily communities in neighborhoods with significant supply constraints, high-end executive housing and key lifestyle amenities. Our properties are located in the Beverly Hills, Brentwood, Burbank, Century City, Olympic Corridor, Santa Monica, Sherman Oaks/Encino, Warner Center/Woodland Hills and Westwood submarkets of Los Angeles County, California, and in Honolulu, Hawaii. We intend to increase our market share in our existing submarkets and may enter into other submarkets with similar characteristics where we believe we can gain significant market share. The terms "us," "we" and "our" as used in this Report refer to Douglas Emmett, Inc. and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. 
At December 31, 2018, we owned a Consolidated Portfolio consisting of (i) a 16.6 million square foot office portfolio, (ii) 3,595 multifamily apartment units and (iii) fee interests in two parcels of land from which we receive rent under ground leases. We also manage and own equity interests in our unconsolidated Funds which, at December 31, 2018, owned an additional 1.8 million square feet of office space. We manage our unconsolidated Funds alongside our Consolidated Portfolio, and we therefore present the statistics for our office portfolio on a Total Portfolio basis. For more information, see Item 2 “Properties” of this Report. As of December 31, 2018, our portfolio consisted of the following (not including the two parcels of land from which we receive rent under ground leases):

 | Consolidated Portfolio | TotalPortfolio
Office (includes ancillary retail space) | | 
Wholly-owned properties | 53 | 53 
Consolidated JV properties | 10 | 10 
Unconsolidated Fund properties | — | 8 
 | 63 | 71 
Rentable square feet (in thousands) | 16,617 | 18,455 
Multifamily | | 
Wholly-owned properties | 10 | 10 
Units | 3,595 | 3,595 

Business Strategy

We employ a focused business strategy that we have developed and implemented over the past four decades:

• | Concentration of High Quality Office and Multifamily Properties in Premier Submarkets.

First we select submarkets that are supply constrained, with high barriers to entry, key lifestyle amenities, proximity to high-end executive housing and a strong, diverse economic base. Virtually no entitled Class A office space is currently under construction in any of our targeted submarkets. Our submarkets are dominated by small, affluent tenants, whose rents are very small relative to their revenues and often not the paramount factor in their leasing decisions. At December 31, 2018, our office portfolio median size tenant was approximately 2,600 square feet. Our office tenants operate in diverse industries, including among others legal, financial services, entertainment, real estate, accounting and consulting, health services, retail, technology and insurance, reducing our dependence on any one industry. In 2016, 2017 and 2018, no tenant accounted for more than 10% of our total revenues.

• | Disciplined Strategy of Acquiring Substantial Market Share.

Once we select a submarket, we follow a disciplined strategy of gaining substantial market share to provide us with extensive local transactional market information, pricing power in lease and vendor negotiations and an enhanced ability to identify and negotiate investment opportunities. As a result, we average approximately a 39% share of the Class A office space in our submarkets based on the square feet of exposure in our total portfolio to each submarket. See "Office Portfolio Summary" in Item 2 “Properties” of this Report.

• | Proactive Asset and Property Management.

Our fully integrated and focused operating platform provides the unsurpassed tenant service demanded in our submarkets, with in-house leasing, proactive asset and property management and internal design and construction services, which we believe provides us with a competitive advantage in managing our property portfolio. Our in-house leasing agents and legal specialists allow us to lease a large property portfolio with a diverse group of smaller tenants, closing an average of approximately three office leases each business day, and our in-house construction company allows us to compress the time required for building out many smaller spaces, resulting in reduced vacancy periods. Our property management group oversees day-to-day property management of both our office and multifamily portfolios, allowing us to benefit from the operational efficiencies permitted by our submarket concentration. 
Corporate Structure
Douglas Emmett, Inc. was formed as a Maryland corporation on June 28, 2005 to continue and expand the operations of Douglas Emmett Realty Advisors and its 9 institutional funds. All of our assets are directly or indirectly held by our Operating Partnership, which was formed as a Delaware limited partnership on July 25, 2005. As the sole stockholder of the general partner of our Operating Partnership, we generally have the exclusive power under the partnership agreement to manage and conduct the business of our Operating Partnership, subject to certain limited approval and voting rights of the other limited partners. Our interest in our Operating Partnership entitles us to share in the profits and losses and cash distributions in proportion to our percentage ownership. 
Funds and JVs
In addition to fifty-three office properties and ten residential properties wholly owned by our Operating Partnership, we manage and own equity interests in:

• | three unconsolidated Funds through which we and institutional investors own eight office properties in our core markets totaling 1.8 million square feet and in which we own a weighted average of 62% at December 31, 2018 based on square footage. We are entitled to (i) priority distributions, (ii) distributions based on invested capital, (iii) a carried interest if the investors’ distributions exceed a hurdle rate, (iv) fees for property management and other services and (v) reimbursement of certain costs. 


• | three consolidated JVs through which we and institutional investors own ten office properties in our core markets totaling 2.8 million square feet and in which we own a weighted average of 28% at December 31, 2018 based on square footage. We are entitled to (i) distributions based on invested capital as well as (in the case of two of the JVs) additional distributions based on cash net operating income, (ii) fees for property management and other services and (iii) reimbursement of certain acquisition-related expenses and certain other costs. 

The financial data in this Report presents our Funds on an unconsolidated basis and our JVs on a consolidated basis in accordance with GAAP. Most of the property data in this Report is presented for our Total Portfolio, which includes the properties owned by our JVs and our Funds, as we believe this presentation assists in understanding our business. 
Taxation
We believe that we qualify, and we intend to continue to qualify, for taxation as a REIT under the Code, although we cannot assure that this has happened or will happen. See Item 1A "Risk Factors" of this Report for the risks we face regarding taxation as a REIT. The following summary is qualified in its entirety by the applicable Code provisions and related rules, and administrative and judicial interpretations. If we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we will generally not be required to pay federal corporate income taxes on the portion of our net income that is currently distributed to stockholders. This treatment substantially eliminates the “double taxation” (i.e., at the corporate and stockholder levels) that generally results from investment in a corporation. However, we will be required to pay federal income tax under certain circumstances.

The Code defines a REIT as a corporation, trust or association (i) which is managed by one or more trustees or directors; (ii) the beneficial ownership of which is evidenced by transferable shares or certificates of beneficial interest; (iii) which would be taxable but for Sections 856 through 860 of the Code as a domestic corporation; (iv) which is neither a financial institution nor an insurance company subject to certain provisions of the Code; (v) the beneficial ownership of which is held by 100 or more persons; (vi) of which, during the last half of each taxable year, not more than 50% in value of the outstanding stock is owned, actually or constructively, by five or fewer individuals; and (vii) which meets certain other tests, described below, regarding the amount of its distributions and the nature of its income and assets. The Code requires that conditions (i) to (iv) be met during the entire taxable year and that condition (v) be met during at least 335 days of a taxable year of 12 months, or during a proportionate part of a taxable year of less than 12 months.
There are two gross income requirements: 

i. | at least 75% of our gross income (excluding gross income from “prohibited transactions” as defined below and qualifying hedges) for each taxable year must be derived directly or indirectly from investments relating to real property or mortgages on real property or from certain types of temporary investment income, and


ii. | at least 95% of our gross income (excluding gross income from “prohibited transactions” and qualifying hedges) for each taxable year must be derived from income that qualifies under the 75% test or from other dividends, interest or gain from the sale or other disposition of stock or securities. In general, a “prohibited transaction” is a sale or other disposition of property (other than foreclosure property) held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business. 

We must satisfy five asset tests at the close of each quarter of our taxable year:

i. | at least 75% of the value of our total assets must be represented by real estate assets including shares of stock of other REITs, debt instruments of publicly offered REITs, certain other stock or debt instruments purchased with the proceeds of a stock offering or long-term public debt offering by us (but only for the one-year period after such offering), cash, cash items and government securities,


ii. | not more than 25% of our total assets may be represented by securities other than those in the 75% asset class,


iii. | of the assets included in the 25% asset class, the value of any one issuer’s securities owned by us may not exceed 5% of the value of our total assets and we may not own more than 10% of the vote or value of the securities of any one issuer, in each case other than securities included under the 75% asset test above and interests in TRS or QRS, each as defined below, and in the case of the 10% value test, subject to certain other exceptions,


iv. | not more than 20% of the value of our total assets may be represented by securities of one or more TRS, and


v. | not more than 25% of the value of our total assets may be represented by nonqualified publicly offered REIT debt instruments.

In order to qualify as a REIT, we are required to distribute dividends (other than capital gains dividends) to our stockholders equal to at least (A) the sum of (i) 90% of our “REIT taxable income” (computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and our net capital gain) and (ii) 90% of the net income, if any (after tax), from foreclosure property, less (B) the sum of certain items of non-cash income. The distributions must be paid in the taxable year to which they relate, or in the following taxable year if declared before we timely file our tax return for such year, if paid on or before the first regular dividend payment date after such declaration and if we so elect and specify the dollar amount in our tax return. To the extent that we do not distribute all of our net long-term capital gains or distribute at least 90%, but less than 100%, of our REIT taxable income, we will be required to pay tax thereon at regular corporate tax rates. Furthermore, if we fail to distribute during each calendar year the sum of at least (i) 85% of our ordinary income for such year, (ii) 95% of our capital gains income for such year, and (iii) any undistributed taxable income from prior periods, we would be required to pay a 4% excise tax on the excess of such required distributions over the amounts actually distributed.
We own interests in various partnerships and limited liability companies. In the case of a REIT that is a partner in a partnership or a member of a limited liability company that is treated as a partnership under the Code, Treasury Regulations provide that for purposes of the REIT income and asset tests, the REIT will be deemed to own its proportionate share of the assets of the partnership or limited liability company (determined in accordance with its capital interest in the entity), subject to special rules related to the 10% asset test, and will be deemed to be entitled to the income of the partnership or limited liability company attributable to such share.
8

We own an interest in a subsidiary which is intended to be treated as a QRS. The Code provides that a QRS will be ignored for federal income tax purposes and all assets, liabilities and items of income, deduction and credit of the QRS will be treated as our assets, liabilities and items of income. We hold certain of our properties through subsidiaries that have elected to be taxed as REITs. We also own interests in certain corporations which have elected to be treated as TRSs. A REIT may own more than 10% of the voting stock and value of the securities of a corporation which jointly elects with the REIT to be a TRS, provided certain requirements are met. A TRS generally may engage in any business, including the provision of customary or non-customary services to tenants of its parent REIT and of others, except a TRS may not manage or operate a hotel or healthcare facility. A TRS is treated as a regular corporation and is subject to federal income tax and applicable state income and franchise taxes at regular corporate rates. In addition, a 100% tax may be imposed on a REIT if its rental, service or other agreements with its TRS, or the TRS agreements with the REIT’s tenants, are not on arm’s-length terms.
We may be required to pay state or local tax in various state or local jurisdictions, including those in which we own properties or otherwise transact business or reside. The state and local tax treatment of us and our stockholders may not conform to the federal income tax consequences discussed above. We may also be subject to certain taxes applicable to REITs, including taxes in lieu of disqualification as a REIT, on undistributed income, and on income from prohibited transactions. 
In addition, if we acquire any asset from a corporation that is or has been a C corporation in a transaction in which our tax basis in the asset is less than the fair market value of the asset, in each case determined as of the date on which we acquired the asset, and we subsequently recognize gain on the disposition of the asset during the five year period beginning on the date on which we acquired the asset, then we generally will be required to pay tax at the highest regular corporate tax rate on this gain to the extent of the excess of (i) the fair market value of the asset over (ii) our adjusted tax basis in the asset, in each case determined as of the date on which we acquired the asset. 
Insurance
We carry comprehensive liability, fire, extended coverage, business interruption and rental loss insurance covering all of the properties in our portfolio under a blanket insurance policy. We believe the policy specifications and insured limits are appropriate and adequate given the relative risk of loss and the cost of the coverage and industry practice. See Item 1A “Risk Factors” of this Report for the risks we face regarding insurance.
Competition
We compete with a number of developers, owners and operators of office and multifamily real estate, many of which own properties similar to ours in the same markets in which our properties are located. See Item 1A “Risk Factors” of this Report for the risks we face regarding competition.
Regulation
Our properties are subject to various covenants, laws, ordinances and regulations, including regulations relating to common areas, fire and safety requirements, various environmental laws, the ADA and rent control laws. See Item 1A “Risk Factors” of this Report for the risks we face regarding laws and regulations.
Sustainability
In operating our buildings and running our business, we actively work to promote our operations in a sustainable and responsible manner.  Our sustainability initiatives include items such as lighting, retrofitting, energy management systems, variable frequency drives in our motors, electricity co-generation, energy efficiency, recycling and water conservation.  As a result of our efforts, over 95% of our eligible office space is ENERGY STAR certified by the EPA as having energy efficiency in the top 25% of buildings nationwide. As of the date of this Report, the EPA is evaluating a new scoring system for the ENERGY STAR certification.
Segments
We operate two business segments: the acquisition, development, ownership and management of office real estate, and the acquisition, development, ownership and management of multifamily real estate. The services for our office segment include primarily rental of office space and other tenant services, including parking and storage space rental. The services for our multifamily segment include primarily rental of apartments and other tenant services, including parking and storage space rental. See Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 15 of this Report for more information regarding our segments.
