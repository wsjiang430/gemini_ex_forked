History
T-Mobile USA, Inc. (“T-Mobile USA”), a Delaware corporation, was formed in 1994 as VoiceStream Wireless PCS (“VoiceStream”), a subsidiary of Western Wireless Corporation (“Western Wireless”). VoiceStream was spun off from Western Wireless in 1999, acquired by Deutsche Telekom AG (“DT”) in 2001 and renamed T-Mobile USA, Inc. in 2002.
In 2013, T-Mobile US, Inc., a Delaware corporation, was formed through the business combination of T-Mobile USA and MetroPCS Communications, Inc. (“MetroPCS”). The business combination was accounted for as a reverse acquisition with T-Mobile USA as the accounting acquirer. Accordingly, T-Mobile USA’s historical financial statements became the historical financial statements of the combined company.
In September 2018, we announced the rebranding of our prepaid brand, MetroPCS, as Metro™ by T-Mobile. 
Business
We provide wireless services to 79.7 million postpaid, prepaid and wholesale customers and generate revenue by providing affordable wireless communication services to these customers, as well as a wide selection of wireless devices and accessories. Our most significant expenses relate to acquiring and retaining high-quality customers, providing a full range of devices, compensating employees, and operating and expanding our network. We provide service, devices and accessories across our flagship brands, T-Mobile and Metro by T-Mobile, through our owned and operated retail stores, as well as through our websites (www.T-Mobile.com and www.MetroPCS.com) and customer care channels. In addition, we sell devices to dealers and other third-party distributors for resale through independent third-party retail outlets and a variety of third-party websites. The information on our websites is not part of this Form 10-K. See Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for additional information.
In 2018, we completed the acquisition of television innovator Layer3 TV, Inc. (“Layer3 TV”). This transaction represented an opportunity to acquire a complementary service to our existing wireless service to advance our video strategy. For more information, see Note 2 – Business Combinations of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
On April 29, 2018, we entered into the Business Combination Agreement with Sprint to merge in an all-stock transaction. The combined company will be named “T-Mobile,” and as a result of the Merger, is expected to be able to rapidly launch a nationwide 5G network, accelerate innovation and increase competition in the U.S. wireless, video and broadband industries. The Merger is subject to regulatory approvals and certain other customary closing conditions. We expect to receive regulatory approval in the first half of 2019. For more information regarding our Business Combination Agreement, see Note 2 – Business Combinations of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Customers
We provide wireless communication services to three primary categories of customers: 

• | Branded postpaid customers generally include customers who are qualified to pay after receiving wireless communication services utilizing phones, DIGITS or connected devices which includes tablets, wearables and SyncUp DRIVE™;


• | Branded prepaid customers generally include customers who pay for wireless communication services in advance. Our branded prepaid customers include customers of T-Mobile and Metro by T-Mobile; and

• | for qualifying customers who finance their initial device with an EIP, an option to enroll in our Just Upgrade My Phone (“JUMP!®”) program to later upgrade their device. Upon a qualifying JUMP! upgrade, the customer’s remaining EIP balance is settled provided they trade-in their used device at the time of upgrade in good working condition and purchase a new device from us on a new EIP.


• | JUMP! On Demand™ includes a low monthly payment that covers the cost of leasing a new device and gives qualified customers the freedom to exchange it for a new device up to one time per month for no extra fee. Upon device upgrade or at lease end, customers must return their device in good working condition or purchase their device. Customers that choose to purchase their device have the option to finance their device over a nine-month EIP.

Network 
We continue to expand the footprint and increase the capacity of our network to better serve our customers. Our advancements in network technology and our spectrum resources ensure we can continue to increase the capabilities of our 4G LTE network as we prepare for our nationwide deployment of 5G.
Spectrum Growth
We provide wireless communication services utilizing mid-band spectrum licenses, such as Advanced Wireless Services (“AWS”) and Personal Communications Service (“PCS”), and low-band spectrum licenses utilizing our 600 MHz and 700 MHz spectrum.

• | We owned an average of 110 MHz of spectrum nationwide as of December 31, 2018, comprised of an average of 31 MHz in the 600 MHz band, 10 MHz in the 700 MHz band, 29 MHz in the 1900 MHz PCS band and 40 MHz in the AWS band. We also own millimeter wave spectrum that comprises an average of 264 MHz covering over 110 million points of presence (“POPs”) in the 28 GHz band and 105 MHz covering nearly 45 million POPs in the 39 GHz band.

We will evaluate future spectrum purchases in current and upcoming auctions and in the secondary market to augment our current spectrum position.

• | As of December 31, 2018, we owned a nationwide average of 31 MHz of 600 MHz low-band spectrum. We now own approximately 41 MHz of low-band spectrum (600 MHz and 700 MHz), covering 100% of the U.S.


• | We are building out 5G across the US, including deployment in six of the top 10 markets, including New York and Los Angeles, in 2018. This network will be ready for the introduction of the first standards-based 5G smartphones in 2019. We plan on the delivery of a nationwide standards-based network next year.


• | In 2018, we entered into two multi-year contracts that will support the deployment of a nationwide 5G network. In July 2018, we and Nokia entered into a multi-year $3.5 billion contract for Nokia to provide us with complete end-to-end 5G technology, software and services. In September 2018, we and Ericsson announced a multi-year $3.5 billion contract in which Ericsson will provide us with the latest 5G New Radio hardware and software compliant with 3rd Generation Partnership Project (“3GPP”) standards.


• | We have started deployment of 600 MHz spectrum on an aggressive schedule. As of December 31, 2018, we were live in more than 2,700 cities and towns in 43 states and Puerto Rico covering hundreds of thousands of square miles. Combining 600 and 700 MHz spectrum, we have deployed low band spectrum to 301 million POPs.


• | We have actively engaged with broadcasters to accelerate the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) spectrum clearance timelines, entering into 95 agreements with several parties. These agreements are expected to, in aggregate, accelerate clearing, bringing the total clearing target to approximately 272 million POPs by year-end 2019. As of December 31, 2018, we had cleared approximately 135 million POPs. We remain committed to assisting broadcasters occupying 600 MHz spectrum to move to new frequencies.


• | We currently have 29 devices compatible with 600 MHz including the latest iPhone generation.


• | We expect our 600 MHz spectrum holdings will be used to deploy America’s first nationwide standards-based 5G network next year. 600 MHz 4G LTE radios are software upgradeable to support 5G as it becomes available later this year.


• | Over the last year, we have entered into and closed on various agreements for the acquisition and exchange of 700 MHz A-Block, AWS and PCS spectrum licenses. See Note 6 – Goodwill, Spectrum License Transactions and Other Intangible Assets of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.


• | We intend to opportunistically acquire spectrum licenses in private party transactions and future FCC spectrum license auctions.

Network Coverage Growth

• | We continue to expand our coverage breadth and, as of December 31, 2018, covered more than 325 million people with 4G LTE.


• | As of December 31, 2018, we had equipment deployed on approximately 64,000 macro towers and 21,000 distributed antenna system (“DAS”) and small cell sites. We remain on plan to roll out approximately 20,000 small cells through 2019.

Network Speed Leadership
We offer the fastest nationwide 4G LTE upload and download speeds in the United States. The fourth quarter of 2018 is the 20th consecutive quarter we have led the industry in both categories based on the results of millions of user-generated speed tests.
Network Capacity Growth 
We continue to expand our capacity through the re-farming of existing spectrum and implementation of new technologies including Voice over LTE (“VoLTE”), Carrier Aggregation, 4x4 multiple-input and multiple-output (“MIMO”), 256 Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (“QAM”) and Licensed Assisted Access (“LAA”).

• | VoLTE comprised 87% of total voice calls as of December 31, 2018, compared to 80% as of December 31, 2017. Moving voice traffic to VoLTE frees up spectrum and allows for the transition of spectrum currently used for 2G and 3G to 4G LTE. We are leading the U.S. wireless industry in the rate of VoLTE adoption.


• | Carrier aggregation is live for our customers in 923 markets. This advanced technology delivers superior speed and

7

performance by bonding multiple discrete spectrum channels together. 

• | 4x4 MIMO is currently available in 564 markets. This technology effectively delivers twice the speed and incremental network capacity to customers by doubling the number of data paths between the cell site and a customer's device. We started deploying massive MIMO (FD-capable and 5G with future software upgrades) in selected locations in late 2018.


• | We have rolled out 256 QAM in 988 markets. 256 QAM increases the number of bits delivered per transmission to enable faster speeds. We are the first carrier globally to have rolled out the combination of carrier aggregation, 4x4 MIMO and 256 QAM. This trifecta of standards has been rolled out to more than 500 markets.


• | We have also started rolling out LAA, a technology which utilizes unlicensed 5 GHz spectrum to augment available bandwidth. The first LAA small cell went live in New York City in the fourth quarter of 2017 and the technology has since been rolled out to nearly 1,700 cell sites, the vast majority being small cells. Deployments of LAA have also commenced in 28 cities including Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Washington DC, Atlanta, Houston, Las Vegas, San Diego and New Orleans. In areas where LAA has been deployed, customers with capable handsets have observed real-life speeds in excess of 500 Mbps.


• | In July 2018, we launched our Narrowband Internet of Things (“NB-IoT”) service nationwide, making us the first to launch NB-IoT in the U.S. and the first in the world to launch NB-IoT in the guard bands for improved efficiency. Built on the 3GPP standard, NB-IoT is a low power, wide area network LTE-advanced technology that provides a pathway to 5G Internet of Things and enables many comparable benefits like low power usage, long battery life and low device cost.

Competition
The wireless telecommunications industry is highly competitive. We are the third largest provider of postpaid service plans and the largest provider of prepaid service plans in the U.S. as measured by customers. Our competitors include other national carriers, such as AT&T Inc. (“AT&T”), Verizon Communications, Inc. (“Verizon”) and Sprint. AT&T and Verizon are significantly larger than us and enjoy greater resources and scale advantages as compared to us. In addition, our competitors include numerous smaller regional carriers, existing mobile virtual network operators (“MVNOs”), including TracFone Wireless, Inc., Comcast Corporation (“Comcast”) and Charter Communications, Inc., and future MVNOs, such as Altice USA, Inc., many of which offer or plan to offer no-contract, postpaid and prepaid service plans. Competitors also include providers who offer similar communication services, such as voice, messaging and data services, using alternative technologies or services. Competitive factors within the wireless telecommunications industry include pricing, market saturation, service and product offerings, customer experience, network investment and quality, development and deployment of technologies, availability of additional spectrum licenses and regulatory changes. Some competitors have shown a willingness to use aggressive pricing as a source of differentiation. Other competitors have sought to add ancillary services, like mobile video, to enhance their offerings. Taken together, the competitive factors we face continue to put pressure on growth and margins as companies compete to retain the current customer base and continue to add new customers.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we employed approximately 52,000 full-time and part-time employees, including network, retail, administrative and customer support functions.
Regulation 
The FCC regulates many key aspects of our business, including licensing, construction, the operation and use of our network, modifications of our network, control and ownership of our licenses and authorizations, the sale, transfer and acquisition of certain licenses, domestic roaming arrangements and interconnection agreements, pursuant to its authority under the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (“Communications Act”). The FCC has a number of complex requirements and proceedings that affect our operations and that could increase our costs or diminish our revenues. For example, the FCC has rules regarding provision of 911 and E-911 services, porting telephone numbers, interconnection, roaming, internet openness or net neutrality, disabilities access, privacy and cybersecurity, consumer protection, and the universal service and Lifeline programs. Many of these and other issues are being considered in ongoing proceedings, and we cannot predict whether or how such actions will affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our ability to provide services and generate revenues could be harmed by adverse regulatory action or changes to existing laws and regulations. In addition, regulation of companies that offer competing services can impact our business indirectly. 
Wireless communications providers must be licensed by the FCC to provide communications services at specified spectrum frequencies within specified geographic areas and must comply with the rules and policies governing the use of the spectrum as 
8

adopted by the FCC. The FCC issues each license for a fixed period of time, typically 10-15 years depending on the particular licenses. While the FCC has generally renewed licenses given to operating companies like us, the FCC has authority to both revoke a license for cause and to deny a license renewal if a renewal is not in the public interest. Furthermore, we could be subject to fines, forfeitures and other penalties for failure to comply with FCC regulations, even if any such non-compliance was unintentional. In extreme cases, penalties can include revocation of our licenses. The loss of any licenses, or any related fines or forfeitures, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
Additionally, Congress’ and the FCC’s allocation of additional spectrum for broadband commercial mobile radio service (“CMRS”), which includes cellular, PCS, miscellaneous wireless services and specialized mobile radio, could significantly increase competition. We cannot assess the impact that any developments that may occur in the U.S. economy or any future spectrum allocations by the FCC may have on license values. FCC spectrum auctions and other market developments may adversely affect the market value of our licenses in the future. A significant decline in the value of our licenses could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the FCC periodically reviews its policies on how to evaluate carriers’ spectrum holdings. A change in these policies could affect spectrum resources and competition among us and other carriers. 
Congress and the FCC have imposed limitations on foreign ownership of CMRS licensees that exceed 20% direct ownership or 25% indirect ownership. The FCC has ruled that higher levels of indirect foreign ownership, even up to 100%, are presumptively consistent with the public interest albeit subject to review. Consistent with that established policy, the FCC has issued a declaratory ruling authorizing up to 100% ownership of our Company by DT. This declaratory ruling, and our licenses, are conditioned on DT’s and the Company’s compliance with a network security agreement with the Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Department of Homeland Security. Failure to comply with the terms of this agreement could result in fines, injunctions and other penalties, including potential revocation of our spectrum licenses.
While the Communications Act generally preempts state and local governments from regulating the entry of, or the rates charged by, wireless communication providers, certain state and local governments regulate other terms and conditions of wireless service, including billing, termination of service arrangements and the imposition of early termination fees, advertising, network outages, the use of devices while driving, zoning and land use. Additionally, after the FCC’s adoption of the 2017 “Restoring Internet Freedom” Order, a number of states have sought to impose state-specific net neutrality and privacy requirements on providers’ broadband services. The FCC ruling broadly preempts such state efforts, which are inconsistent with the FCC’s federal deregulatory approach, and there are pending court challenges that will determine if such state enactments are lawful. While most states are largely seeking to codify the repealed federal rules, there are differences in some states, notably California, which has passed separate privacy and net neutrality legislation. There are efforts on the Hill to push for federal legislation to codify uniform federal privacy and net neutrality requirements, while also ensuring the preemption of separate state requirements, including the California laws. If not rescinded, separate state requirements will impose significant business costs and could also result in increased litigation costs and enforcement risks. State authority over wireless broadband services will remain unsettled until final action by the courts or Congress. 
In addition, the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) and other federal agencies have jurisdiction over some consumer protection and elimination and prevention of anticompetitive business practices with respect to the provision of non-common carrier services. Further, the FCC and the Federal Aviation Administration regulate the siting, lighting and construction of transmitter towers and antennae. Tower siting and construction are also subject to state and local zoning, as well as federal statutes regarding environmental and historic preservation. The future costs to comply with all relevant regulations are to some extent unknown and changes to regulations, or the applicability of regulations, could result in higher operating and capital expenses, or reduced revenues in the future.
