Overview
 
Our Mission
 
At Charles & Colvard, Ltd., we believe luxury can be both beautiful and conscientious. With innovative technology and sustainable practices, our goal is to lead a revolution in the jewelry industry – delivering a brilliant product at extraordinary value balanced with environmental and social responsibility.
About Charles & Colvard
 
Charles & Colvard, Ltd., a North Carolina corporation founded in 1995 (which may be referred to as Charles & Colvard, we, us, or our), manufactures, markets and distributes Charles & Colvard Created Moissanite® (which we refer to as moissanite or moissanite jewels) and finished jewelry featuring our proprietary moissanite gemstone for sale in the worldwide jewelry market. Our unique differentiator, moissanite – The World’s Most Brilliant Gem® – is core to our ambition to create a movement around beautiful, environmentally and socially responsible fine jewelry and fashion jewelry. Charles & Colvard is the originator of lab-created moissanite, and we believe that we are leading the way in delivering the premium moissanite brand through technological advances in gemstone manufacturing, cutting, polishing and setting. By coupling what we believe to be unprecedented gemstones with responsibly-sourced precious metals, we are delivering a uniquely-positioned product line for the conscientious consumer.
 
Our strategy is to build a globally revered brand of gemstones and finished jewelry that appeals to a wide consumer audience and leverages our advantage of being the original and leading worldwide source of moissanite. We believe a direct relationship with consumers is important to this strategy, which entails delivering tailored educational content, engaging in dialogue with our audience, and positioning our brand to meet the demands of today’s discerning consumer. In June 2019, we successfully completed an underwritten public offering of 6,250,000 shares of our common stock, which, together with the partial exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment option for an additional 630,500 shares in July, resulted in total gross proceeds of approximately $11.01 million, before deducting the underwriting discount and fees and expenses of approximately $1.02 million. The timing of this financing event is critical given the growing worldwide acceptance of lab-created gemstones with emerging generations of consumers. These proceeds, which we intend to use for marketing and for general corporate and working capital purposes, will enable us to focus efforts on expanding the Charles & Colvard global brand awareness with our target consumer and further develop our global omni-channel sales strategy with a primary focus on top line growth. For more detailed information about our planned use of targeted funds for reinvestment into our business, see Marketing to the Online Channels Segment below.
 
We sell loose moissanite jewels and finished jewelry through two operating segments: our Online Channels segment, which comprises our charlesandcolvard.com website, e-commerce outlets, including marketplaces, drop-ship customers, and other pure-play, exclusively e-commerce customers; and our Traditional segment, which consists of domestic and international distributors and retail customers. For more information about our operating segments, see Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data”, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 
We believe our expanding application of an omni-channel sales strategy across the jewelry trade and to the end consumer with gemstones and branded finished jewelry featuring Charles & Colvard moissanite positions our goods at the many touchpoints where consumers are when they are making their buying decisions – thereby creating greater exposure for our brand and increasing consumer demand.
Our Market Opportunity
 
By 2020 the global online fashion jewelry market is expected to drive $45 billion in sales, which is expected to represent 15% of the global jewelry market, and global online fine jewelry is projected to represent a staggering $30 billion of the global jewelry market according to Forbes.com and McKinsey & Company. We believe this convergence of the online jewelry shopper and the emergence of lab-created gemstones as a solution to the underserved, ethically-minded value consumer shapes a bright and sizeable future opportunity for Charles & Colvard and jewelry designed with our exceptional gemstone.

Our Strategic Transformation
 
As consumers, and particularly those in the Millennial and emerging Gen-Z generations, have shifted to significant levels of online shopping and buying patterns, we transformed our go-to-market strategy in a relatively short period. Our historical business was that of a gemstone manufacturer, and as such, we created gemstones, and leveraged our distributor network as the primary method for delivering our goods to market. That meant relying on our Traditional segment partners to generate interest and sales for our gemstone, while they were doing the same for other gemstones and jewelry across the industry. Consequently, we believe there was a substantial lack of market awareness for moissanite and the Charles & Colvard brands.
 
In February 2016, we made the strategic decision to explore a potential divestiture of our direct-to-consumer home party business previously operated through our Charles & Colvard Direct, LLC (dba Lulu Avenue®) subsidiary. After careful analysis of our core competencies, market strategies, and intent to advance toward profitability, we determined a divestiture of this distribution channel to be in our best interest and that of our shareholders. In March 2016, we and Charles & Colvard Direct, LLC, entered into an asset purchase agreement with Yanbal USA, Inc., or Yanbal, under which Yanbal purchased certain assets related to our direct-to-consumer home party business for $500,000 and assumed certain liabilities related to such assets.
 
In October 2016, we re-launched Charles & Colvard with the intent to position both Charles & Colvard and its innovative moissanite products as a premium gemstone and jewelry brand. During this pivotal time, we launched the charlesandcolvard.com website as our primary storefront, established our brand across key social media properties, and began a significant digital marketing campaign. The purpose of this strategy was to gain exposure, build brand awareness, and begin the journey of establishing a lifetime relationship with consumers that are seeking an alternative luxury brand that aligns with their buying preferences.
 
The calendar year ended December 31, 2017, was a year of growth and optimization of our branding initiatives. Over the course of 2017, we executed our strategic plan with new innovations in our Forever OneTM product line and finished jewelry offerings. We invested in key retail and online partnerships, as evidenced by our brick-and-mortar expansion into nearly all Helzberg Diamonds stores and our achievement of the authorized Seller-Fulfilled Prime status on Amazon.com. We believe that we improved the charlesandcolvard.com customer’s experience with our brand by offering free shipping and introducing a 60-day free returns policy.
 
During the transition period ended June 30, 2018, we delivered on several key initiatives that we believe helped create a strong underpinning for our business. Among these achievements, we entered into an amendment to our exclusive Supply Agreement with Cree for the supply of SiC materials that extends the agreement by five years with our unilateral option, subject to certain conditions, for renewal for an additional two-year period. The amendment also allows us under certain conditions to purchase alternative SiC material whose standards fall outside of Forever OneTM specifications. We also introduced Moissanite by Charles & Colvard®, a value line of gemstones that offers the cost-conscious consumer a competitively-priced option for moissanite jewels. We expanded key retail relationships that  we believe will be instrumental in expanding the Charles & Colvard brand and positioning our products with other luxury brand options. We invested in new cooperative marketing relationships that we believe will be essential for proliferating the Charles & Colvard brand into new and innovative marketing channels. Finally, we signed new international e-commerce agreements that will make it easier for us to sell and ship our products globally. Finally, we significantly expanded our media exposure into nationally-recognized fashion-related print media.
 
During June and July 2018, we negotiated and entered into a $5.00 million asset-based revolving credit facility with White Oak Commercial Finance, LLC, or White Oak. The annual borrowing fees associated with this credit facility are lower than those in connection with our previous credit facility with a commercial bank, and moreover, we believe the borrowing terms and financial covenants underlying this credit facility are less restrictive than those under our previous credit arrangement. Accordingly, we believe our current credit facility will continue to enable us to be more nimble when executing our strategic plans.

In June 2019, as described above, we successfully completed an underwritten public offering of 6,250,000 shares of our common stock at a price of $1.60 per share, which, together with the partial exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment option for an additional 630,500 shares in July, resulted in net proceeds of approximately $9.99 million, net of underwriting discount and fees and expenses. We intend to use these proceeds for marketing and for general corporate and working capital purposes. As evidenced by what we believe is a vote of confidence by our shareholders and the financial success of our underwritten public offering, we will continue to execute our digital marketing strategy to build and reinvest in our business.
 
During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, we achieved four consecutive quarters of net income. We believe this strong financial performance positions us with a strong foundation on which to apply and achieve the maximum benefit from the net proceeds of our recent public offering. We finished fiscal 2019 with more than half of our business derived from our Online Channels segment, which serves our direct-to-consumer customer, or DTC, presence. We believe this growth continues to establish our leadership position as a DTC brand. Also, during fiscal 2019, we forged new inroads into numerous international markets, where we believe that we have key growth opportunities. Accordingly, we launched several marketplaces including but not limited to Amazon sites in Australia, Germany, Italy, France, Spain and, Japan. Concurrently, we continued to support cross-border trade, or CBT, efforts to drive international customers to our U.S.-based website with enhanced international shopping features. Lastly, we leveraged our regional distribution network in certain international regions, such as China, that will require a significant local presence and use of resources. We feel confident in our agile international growth model and plan to continue these efforts into fiscal 2020.
 
Throughout fiscal 2019, we expanded our product selections to meet market demand, including expanding the footprint of our Moissanite by Charles & Colvard® product line and introducing our Signature Collection, a patent-pending line of exclusive jewelry featuring our unique floret logo. We saw strong sales performance of these new product lines, which we believe is an indication of the recognition and adoption of our brand by consumers. Finally, we continued to grow our presence with key retail partners, such as with Helzberg Diamonds stores with the addition of incremental product styles and an expanded case line presence in nearly all doors. In October 2018, we announced the establishment of a new relationship with Macy’s, with whom we continue to build a significant and growing online presence. We plan to continue evolving our retail strategy as we optimize our strategic partnership arrangements.
 
A more detailed description of our achievements during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, the transition period ended June 30, 2018, and the calendar year ended December 31, 2017, is included in Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
 
Our Strategic Outlook
 
Our focus for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2020 is centered on the expansion of Charles & Colvard’s brand on a global scale. As lab-created gemstones are being embraced by emerging generations, we believe our ability to establish moissanite and the Charles & Colvard brand directly with consumers is key to our future success and ability to fuel our growth. We will execute on our key strategies with a continued commitment to spending judiciously and generating sustainable earnings improvement.
 
Our key strategies for fiscal 2020 are as follows:
 
  
• | Expansion of Brand Awareness. We plan to utilize digital advertising channels and other marketing strategies such as influencer marketing programs involving brand advocates to drive messaging to larger markets by way of large social media followings, and Over-the-Top, or OTT, advertising platforms that include subscription video-on-demand, or SVOD, services like Netflix and Hulu. Through these channels, we believe that we will find new and compelling ways to engage the target consumer that is not yet familiar with our brand. We plan to expand our brand footprint on a global scale – engaging the consumer everywhere she shops. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | International Sales Reach. We intend to balance our omni-channel sales strategy with regional-specific marketing programs, online channels growth initiatives, and through relationships with select retail and distribution partners. We believe that expanded product offerings will ensure a variety of goods to meet the demands of today’s discerning consumers. We also plan to deploy distribution channels, marketing programs, and geographically-aligned curations to attract consumers and drive regional sales. Additionally, cross-border trade promotions will remain a key strategy that we believe will drive global customers to Charles & Colvard’s corporate transactional site where we can offer the most comprehensive and brand-immersive experience.

• | Product Evolution. Being responsive to customer preferences has played a pivotal role in the rise of our Online Channels segment as the high-growth component of our business. We employ what we believe to be an agile product development philosophy that ensures a swift and fluid stream of new finished jewelry and gemstones that are responsive to customer demand. As we expand our reach to international locations – and as our Millennial and Gen-Z audiences mature – we will listen intently to market demand, measure carefully the costs and opportunities for our business, and strive to deliver the products that are responsive to our audiences’ choices. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Enhanced Customer Experience. We plan to evolve our technology platform and services to support a continually-enhanced customer experience. We will use analytics to make data-driven decisions that offer deeper personalization and more immersive shopping experiences. We plan to drive customer engagement, encourage repeat buyers, and grow our customer loyalty program, all of which we believe will support our ability to deliver an exemplary worldwide customer service experience. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Corporate Social Responsibility. We believe that we have the responsibility to be a good corporate citizen, and in practice, to have a business model that helps us be socially accountable to our stakeholders. During fiscal 2019, we elevated our use of recycled precious metals in more than 95% of all the finished jewelry we sourced. Going forward, we are working toward utilizing only recycled precious metals in our production lines. We also plan to carefully measure the environmental impact of our business operations with a goal toward improving our overall environmental footprint. We also want to positively impact the communities where we work and live – which we will continue to support through philanthropic programs that advocate positive social change. We plan to create a higher level of transparency regarding these corporate social responsibility practices so that our customers and stakeholders will be able to track our efforts and hold us accountable to be an even better corporate citizen.

Our Guiding Principles
 
One of the most critical factors in implementing our strategies and achieving success is our team of employees. We carefully develop, support and reward our team members, making sure they know our fundamental mission, which is to lead a revolution in the jewelry industry – delivering a brilliant product at an extraordinary value balanced with environmental and social responsibility. We have set forth Guiding Principles that set the tone for everything we do – from structuring our interactions with strategic partners, customers and shareholders to the way we operate our business, and the products we bring to market.
 
Following are the principles that guide our actions:
 
  
• | Catalyze. Build positive momentum with customers and influencers by being thoughtful and trustworthy in every interaction;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Innovate. Disrupt the jewelry industry through use of technology – in gemstone and jewelry design, business processes and engagement with our audience;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Aspire. Be socially conscious, economically informed and environmentally responsible. Strive to build a sustainable business and give back through community acts;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Obsess. Think like a consumer, act like a friend. Constantly seek ways to reduce friction between the brand and our audience;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Achieve. Focus attention on the interdependent successes of individual, brand and shareholder; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Enrich. Promote personal growth and the ability to effect positive change in the business by cultivating a culture of critical thinking and creativity.

Our Audience
 
Our consumer audience is in transition. Prior to our product brand re-launch in 2016, our audience largely comprised Baby Boomers and Generation X – which we consider an older set of consumers. Today, our market research, which is based on charlesandcolvard.com customer analytics, indicates that more than half of our audience comprises Millennial and emerging Gen-Z consumers. Regardless of demographic, our research indicates that our audience is driven by three distinct motivating factors: (i) Beauty – the innate brilliance of our gemstone and jewelry selection; (ii) Value – the “bang for the buck” possible with moissanite, and the ability to buy luxury items while saving money for other things in life; and (iii) Conscientiousness – having a positive impact on the world by buying a brand that is ethically-oriented and socially responsible.
 
While these common motivating factors transcend demographics, we believe that we are seeing trends that lend themselves to highly targeted marketing programs. Most distinctly, conscious consumerism has become a reality in today’s competitive retail environment. Increasingly, consumers are seeking brands that do business for good and are making a conscious effort to control their impact on the environment. This is a common characteristic among  Millennial and Gen-Z audiences, whom we believe are more socially and ethically minded than previous generations.
 
In addition to moving toward conscientious consumerism, it is becoming increasingly evident that today’s consumer desires a direct and more personal relationship with the brands from which he or she chooses to purchase. According to a recent market research study cited by the Interactive Advertising Bureau, a trade group that empowers the media and marketing industries to thrive in today’s digital economy, two-thirds of consumers expect direct brand connectivity. Further, according to a recent survey by Astound Commerce, a global digital commerce agency, 59% of respondents preferred to do research directly on brand sites, with 55% preferring to buy directly from brands. With more than half of our fiscal year 2019 revenue being generated from our Online Channels segment, we believe it’s clear that our customers are responding positively to our direct connection with consumers. This benefits the Charles & Colvard brand, as it empowers us to control our brand message and voice with the consumer. For these pointed reasons, we plan to continue our focus on direct-to-consumer outreach and deep customer engagement. Our marketing programs will be driven by the above understanding of our audience and their motivating factors. Their mindset will drive the segmented messages we deliver, define the partners and kindred brands we select and co-promote with, and determine the channels and means by which we engage our audience.
 
In summary, we believe our beautiful, high value, ethically-sourced product aligns directly with the principles and purchasing requirements of our primary target – the Millennial and Gen-Z audiences.
 
Marketing to the Online Channels Segment
 
Driven by continuously updated knowledge of our audience, through e-commerce and web analytics as well as research through social media and customer service channels, we proactively engage our consumers through a multi-channel digital marketing strategy. Our goal is to continue growing our direct relationship with the consumer, which we believe will drive interest across all of our selling channels. Despite capital constraints in recent years, we have successfully built a growing consumer following and an effective marketing engine that combined have contributed to our recent growth. Targeted application of proceeds from our recent public offering will be focused on digital marketing efforts, which we believe will ultimately drive topline growth due to expanding brand awareness across the globe.
 
Our approach for marketing directly to the consumer includes the following types of communication channels and content types:
 
Communication Channels
 
Following are the myriad of connected channels we use to promote our brand and products:
 
  
• | Organic Social Media. To reinforce and support our position as the leading source of ethically-sourced, lab-created moissanite, our marketing team manages several social media initiatives that target current and future jewelry consumers to support the promotion and sale of Charles & Colvard Created Moissanite®. Our campaigns are focused on driving a consistent message emphasizing the socially responsible aspects of our jewels and finished jewelry, their everlasting beauty, and overall value. Our social media efforts include owned posts and engagements (our own profiles and activities). We concentrate on the following six main social media platforms based on the demographics and psychographics of their users: Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, Twitter, YouTube and LinkedIn.

• | Paid Advertising (Including, But Not Limited To, Search Engine Marketing, Display Ads, Video Ads, and Social Media Advertising). Approximately 81% of consumers begin their buying journeys by using a web search to discover new products and services, according to a recent research study by Synchrony Financial, formerly known as GE Capital Retail Bank. In short, we believe the typical buyer’s journey is a digital one. Digital marketing encompasses the myriad of ways we can be a part of that journey from resources such as Search Engine Marketing (based on keyword buys and ads), digital display (banner ads and product re-targeting ads), video pre-roll (ads playing before and during third-party YouTube videos), native advertising (long-form content produced in conjunction with digital-media and entertainment outlets), and social media advertising (specifically on social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, and Pinterest). We are using and continually optimizing available digital marketing channels. And we will also continue to monitor new forms of paid media as they arise – assessing whether they will be effective in helping us connect with our target audiences. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Email. We know that people who subscribe to our emails are 35% more likely to purchase than visitors to our website who are not subscribed (based on analytics from Google and Marketo, an Adobe Company, a global marketing analytics firm). Therefore, we target some of our paid advertising on specifically driving email subscriptions, and we have used technology to incorporate website elements that encourage signing-up. In addition, when potential customers do subscribe, we have much better data with which to personalize communications with these customer prospects through direct email and our website content. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Public Relations. Earned brand mentions – cultivated by a comprehensive outreach program and powerful connections within beauty, fashion and cultural media outlets – is highly important to our brand-building efforts. By inclusion in articles, gift guides, and other pieces in known online magazines like InStyle, Town & Country, Refinery29, and others, we reach our target audiences in a way that allows us to “borrow” the authority of the media outlet. During the calendar year that ended December 31, 2018, we generated a meaningful number of mentions in consumer-related publications and blogs. Each of those mentions generated new online traffic to our website, sparked social media mentions, and grew our overall consumer audience. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Influencers. According to a recent study by the Digital Marketing Institute, a global digital marketing research firm, almost half of all consumers depend on influencer recommendations for product and brand purchases. Similarly, according to the Influencer Marketing 2020 report published by Influencer Intelligence, in association with Econsultancy, a leading U.S. influencer marketing authority, up to 61% of Millennial consumers say they have been swayed in their purchasing decisions by digital marketing influencers. This is a clear indicator of what marketers have already come to accept, which is that people trust other people’s opinion more than they trust a brand’s advertising. However, we believe there is a caveat – the influencers with whom a brand partners must truly be aligned together in mindset. We do not believe that we can simply find someone with millions of followers, pay them to post about our brand and product, and expect to see results. Instead, we believe we must find influencers who embody the same mindset as our brand and believe as we do in the products that we bring to market. This kind of long-term influencer reach takes time and commitment to develop and we plan to continue to build this type of influencer network throughout fiscal 2020.

• | Our Website. Along with the primary purpose of making sales, our website is a critical communication channel within the buyers’ journey. We use our site to educate new visitors on the origin, benefits, and beauty of moissanite. We create specific landing pages to support our different buyers’ journeys – whether through an engagement ring buyer’s guide or assistance with gift buying for men. It is the home for information on how we give back to our local community and other organizations.

Content Types
 
Following are the varied mediums that we use across the communication channels listed above:
 
  
• | Photography. We believe in the importance of amazing photography when marketing a visually-driven product such as jewelry. We are continually creating new photos to support our ecommerce channels and to keep our marketing on all channels targeted and fresh. We create lifestyle photography for use in advertising, organic social media posts and more. Those photos also allow shoppers on our site to see the product in context, which illustrates style and scale far better than product shots on white background. We plan to continually explore new styles of photography to better market our products and engage our audiences in conversation. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Videos. According to Cisco Systems, Inc., more than 80% of all content consumed on the Internet is expected to be video by 2020. In addition, according to Simply Measured, a Sprout Social company that empowers enterprises to do more with their social media strategy, video social media posts generate 12-times the shares as a post with text and images combined. Accordingly, we have dramatically increased our use of video on all channels mentioned above. Over the past year, we have created an educational Style Guide video series that gives tips on how to pair certain engagement and wedding bands, to mix different metals, or to detail the distinctions in our different gemstone cuts. We have also created a Q&A Video series, giving customers easily communicated answers to commonly asked questions. We have also released multiple video ad series during this past fiscal year for the Calendar Year-End Holidays, Valentine’s Day, and Mother’s Day to drive higher sales. Within a few months of release, these video series were viewed thousands of times. Accordingly, we believe the video medium will be a growing communication channel across all of our lines of business and we intend to continue focusing on video-related resources going forward.

• | Interactive and Immersive Experiences. Throughout fiscal 2019, we expanded our use of custom landing pages, featuring immersive experiences, focused on highly specific audiences (e.g., men exploring engagement rings), campaigns (e.g., Mother’s Day) and partnerships (e.g., our sponsorship of the North Carolina Courage, a professional women’s soccer team based in Raleigh, North Carolina, a member of the National Women’s Soccer League, or NWSL, and the reigning NWSL 2018 National Champions). These landing pages allow us to target specific messages to audiences looking for specific information, which drives them to spend more time on our website and increases the shopper’s chance to purchase and return to our website more often. As we increase our ability to personalize content through today’s technology, we intend to expand the use of landing pages featuring interactive and immersive content to drive consumer engagement.

• | User Generated Content. We believe that our greatest sales people are our satisfied customers – our fans. The more content our fans create – in the form of reviews or feedback on our website and social media posts on their own profiles – the more brand awareness we generate. When we engage with people who have posted, and then re-post their images and stories, we believe that we receive the highest level of social media engagement. Along with cultivating those posts through one-on-one engagement with our satisfied customers on social media, our renewed Loyalty Program that was launched in July 2019 will encourage more and more people to post their positive personal reviews and stories.

Distributing to the Online Channels Segment
 
Equally as important to us as marketing to our direct consumer audience is moving our customers through the process of engaging with our brand – and eventually converting them into a lifetime customer. Throughout the above marketing tactics, we employ calls to action that drive the consumer to the many places where they can view our products and complete their purchase. We utilize a centralized distribution and fulfillment facility in Morrisville, North Carolina, to fulfill Online Channels segment orders.

Following are our primary online transactional channels:
 
  
• | charlesandcolvard.com. Throughout the transition period ended June 30, 2018 and fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, we believe that we significantly enhanced our transactional website to optimize for the mobile consumer and to reduce friction between our brand and the shopper. Programs such as free shipping, a 60-day returns policy, and an enhanced and optimized shopping experience were rolled out. With data collected through web analytics, and through user surveys that reveal how consumers use the site, we are in a continual state of optimizing the buying experience – making it easier for shoppers to browse, sort and compare. We utilize these data to inform the selection of new, leading-edge technologies to further enhance our users’ experience, including technologies provided by such partners as Amazon Pay, Affirm, Inc., and PayPal Holdings, Inc., or PayPal, for financing purchases, Braintree, a service of PayPal, for ease of transfer, and Flow, which is a company that specializes in facilitating cross-border global trade and e-commerce services. Our goal is to remain continually focused on improving our customers’ experience.

• | Cross-Border Trade. With 84% of global e-commerce sales predicted to take place outside of Europe and North America by 2020, according to statistics from Statista.com (based on data from Shopify Inc., a global cloud-based, multi-channel commerce platform), we are combining regionalized marketing efforts in new geographies with promotional campaigning to drive international consumers to our charlesandcolvard.com web property. Through the application of market-leading CBT technology, such as building our relationship with Flow, we believe CBT to be a significant opportunity in fiscal 2020 and beyond. For example, Flow is widely considered the next-generation for CBT e-commerce transactions and is known worldwide to be revolutionizing how merchants go global. Flow’s platform helps such global enterprises create a positive and localized shopping experience for their international customers while helping to ensure a complete and accurate record of CBT transactions for the enterprise.

• | Marketplaces. A large majority of buyers start their online shopping experience with a web search. In fact, according to jumpshot®, a global content management and digital intelligence firm, more than 50% of those web searches begin on Amazon. That number skews even higher within the Millennial demographic in that Amazon is the web search brand Millennials identify as most relevant based on a finding by the Pew Research Center, a renowned nonpartisan fact think tank. Therefore, we have made a point to be prominent on Amazon, achieving Seller-Fulfilled Prime status in 2017, which means we have the option of fulfilling orders with the same benefits of Amazon Prime. This enables us to be positioned more prominently in Amazon’s search platform and to take advantage of their negotiated shipping rates and service levels that, in turn, lower our overall shipping costs. This status is available by Amazon to only those sellers who have a history of fulfilling orders quickly and maintaining appropriate levels of stock. In fiscal 2019, we expanded our relationship with Amazon to include many international locations, including websites in Europe, Australia, and Japan. We also have a market presence on eBay and a multitude of other specialty marketplaces, allowing us to meet our customers when and where they want to buy. Our goal is to continue to optimize our presence on these marketplaces and to expand into new regions and platforms where we have identified cost-effective opportunities.

• | Pure-Play E-tailers. FTI Consulting, a global business advisory firm, estimates that 25% of total retail sales will become e-commerce centric by 2030. As consumers become more digitally savvy, new businesses have gained traction by tailoring their product, services and experiences to specific consumer preferences. We believe that these pure-play e-tailers offer unique opportunities for Charles & Colvard to feature our gemstones and connect with their loyal audiences. As our fiscal 2020 strategy evolves, we plan to focus on expanding these relationships and forge new partnerships that enable us to reach broader audiences.

• | Drop Ship Retail. In an effort to smartly expand their assortments, many retailers utilize direct fulfillment from their vendors to their consumers, or drop-ship, as it enables them to offer a more robust assortment online without having to physically take ownership of the goods in their warehouse. These retailers are consistently seeking socially responsible brands to serve the growing demand for conscientious product selection from their audiences. Since we began drop-shipping products in 2013, we have refined our information technology and operations capabilities to support these partnership arrangements in multiple ways, including fully integrated electronic data interchange, or EDI, solutions for inventory management, order processing, and invoicing. Operationally, we maintain in-stock rates and leverage our centralized distribution and fulfillment facility to meet partner service-level agreements, or SLAs, for shipments and returns. We plan to continue seeking new partnership arrangements as well as optimize existing arrangements throughout fiscal 2020 and beyond.

Marketing to the Traditional Channels Segment
 
The Traditional Channels segment is our legacy segment – represented by such outlets as manufacturers, distributors, and brick-and-mortar retailers. Going forward, these market channels remain important avenues for Charles & Colvard to drive product to market and be present in the many places the consumer takes his or her shopping journey.

• | Trade Advertising. Throughout the transition period ended June 30, 2018 and the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, we continued to target the trade with print advertisements featuring moissanite, with specific emphasis on our Forever OneTM moissanite jewels and finished jewelry featuring the Forever OneTM jewel in leading trade publications. We intend to continue to deliver meaningful promotion of Forever OneTM as we further expand this product line into the distribution network within our Traditional segment. In May 2018, we introduced a new grade of moissanite, Moissanite by Charles & Colvard®, which delivers to the trade a price-sensitive moissanite product that competes with other comparable value-based products making their way to market. Additionally, we utilize a Partner Portal on our website into which authorized distributor and retail partners can gain secured access to our logos, branding materials, and other marketing-related guidelines.

• | Industry Associations. We maintain relationships with major jewelry industry organizations and jewelry trade publications as an opportunity to communicate with our peers on a consistent basis through media coverage, trade shows, and charitable events, among others. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Trade Shows. Our attendance at leading jewelry trade shows as a sponsor, an exhibitor, or a participant has helped us extend our outreach to customers. During the transition period ended June 30, 2018 and the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, we attended major domestic and international jewelry industry trade shows including JCK, North America’s largest annual jewelry trade event in Las Vegas, and the Hong Kong Gem and Jewellery Fair. We intend to continue investing in these important industry events in fiscal 2020. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Cooperative Advertising. We sometimes participate in the cooperative advertising programs of our distributor and retail partners, subject to the customer adhering to our branding guidelines and other conditions. In these programs, we subsidize a portion of their marketing costs in order to create awareness of and exposure for our gemstones and jewelry. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Distributing to the Traditional Channels Segment
 
We utilize a centralized distribution and fulfillment facility in Morrisville, North Carolina, to fill bulk orders to manufacturer, distributor, and retail customers.
 
  
• | Retail. In order to create awareness and exposure for our gemstones, jewelry, and brands, we sell loose moissanite jewels and finished jewelry featuring moissanite at wholesale prices to nationally recognized and emerging retail customers through a broad range of channels including jewelry chains and department stores. Wholesale orders are received by way of purchase orders and fulfilled from our centralized fulfillment center. In many cases, we have placed loose moissanite jewels and finished jewelry inventory in stores on a consignment basis. Under this consignment model, in accordance with our revenue recognition accounting policy, we recognize the revenue for these transactions after the retail partner has sold an item to a consumer or other contractual conditions are met. In other cases, a retailer purchases the goods, or a portion of the goods, under what we call an asset purchase model. Under the asset model, we recognize the sale and related revenue upon transfer of the goods to the retailer. Due to the maturity of certain retail relationships, we have recently migrated select brick-and mortar partners to a blended asset and consignment model account structure, which affords us more favorable customer payment terms that result in more favorable cash flow. We will continue to evolve our retail channel strategy as we optimize our methods and partnership arrangements.

• | Domestic Manufacturers and Distributors. In order to service the vast number of independent jewelers, jewelry stores, and smaller jewelry chains, we sell our loose moissanite jewels and finished jewelry to domestic wholesale distributors and finished jewelry manufacturers at distributor prices, that in turn resell the loose jewels or finished jewelry at a markup to independent jewelers and jewelry stores – whether brick-and-mortar, online, or both. In limited circumstances, we have placed loose moissanite jewels and finished jewelry inventory with select domestic distributors on a consignment basis. We continue to evaluate our channel strategy for domestic distributors, which may result in a change to our historical domestic distributor methods and partners.

• | International Manufacturers and Distributors. In order to create global awareness and exposure for our gemstones, jewelry, and brands, we sell loose moissanite jewels and finished jewelry featuring moissanite to international wholesale distributors and finished jewelry manufacturers at distributor prices, that in turn sell the actual loose jewels or set the loose jewels in mountings and sell the finished jewelry to brick-and-mortar and online retailers. We currently have numerous international wholesale distributors based in Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, India, the Netherlands, Russia, Singapore, South Africa, and the United Arab Emirates. Some of these distributors typically sell into neighboring countries and the extended geographic regions where they may be located. Additionally, from time to time, we have placed loose moissanite jewels and finished jewelry inventory with select international distributors on a consignment basis. We continue to evaluate our channel strategy for international distributors, which may result in a change to our historical international distributor methods and strategic partners. A portion of our international sales consists of finished jewels sold internationally that may be re-imported to U.S. retailers.

For a discussion of our largest customers for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, the transition period ended June 30, 2018 and the calendar year ended December 31, 2017, see Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data”, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 
Seasonality
 
Sales in the retail jewelry industry are typically seasonal due to increased consumer purchases during the calendar year-end holiday season. Because historically we have primarily sold our loose moissanite jewels and finished jewelry featuring moissanite at wholesale pricing to distributors, manufacturers, and retailers, our sales to support the holiday season have largely taken place during the third and beginning of the fourth calendar quarters, depending on the sales channel and the level of advanced planning and production our customers undertook. However, the effect of seasonality on our business is also impacted by the timing of orders we receive to support new or expanded distribution and the level of current inventory positions held by our customers. In recent years, we have experienced a higher degree of seasonality in the fourth calendar quarter than we have experienced in prior years primarily as a result of the holiday season sales to end consumers through our Online Channels segment. In future periods, as sales of our finished jewelry increase to retailers and directly to consumers, both in dollars and as a percentage of total sales, we anticipate a seasonality trend more typical with the retail jewelry industry, and these factors may significantly affect our results of operations in a given quarter.
 
In connection with the change in our fiscal year-end, the results of our fiscal quarters (three-month periods ended March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31 of each year) are expected to reflect the same effects of the seasonal trends on jewelry industry-related revenues discussed above, except that fiscal year-end periods beginning after June 30, 2018, are expected to reflect increased distributor, manufacturer and retailer sales activities relating to the calendar year-end holiday season impacting our results more predominately during our first and second fiscal quarters. Due to this change in our fiscal year-end, the effect of seasonality, particularly with respect to the effects of the year-end holiday season, on our business was less pronounced during the transition period ended June 30, 2018.
 
Moissanite
 
Over 120 years ago, Nobel Prize-winning chemist, Henri Moissan, Ph.D., first discovered the extremely rare mineral, SiC, in a meteorite crater in Arizona. Over a century after the discovery of SiC, and after years of experimentation, researchers from the Research Triangle Park in North Carolina developed and patented a thermal growing process for creating pure SiC crystals in a controlled laboratory environment. This long-sought-after breakthrough made possible the world’s first lab-created moissanite gemstone – posthumously named after its discoverer. With hardness rivaling any mineral on earth, and optical properties exceeding all mined and created gemstones, we believe moissanite is a brilliant jewel that is free from environmental and ethical issues, and capable of disrupting traditional definitions of fine jewelry.

  Table of Contents
Naturally-occurring moissanite is generally very small in size, dark green or black in color, and not a commercially viable source of gemstone material. Therefore, in order to create high quality moissanite material in desirable colors and across a range of carat sizes that will appeal to a consumer audience, we expect only lab-grown SiC crystals to provide a sustainable source of moissanite for gemstones. In addition to carat size, important characteristics of a gemstone are beauty, durability, and rarity. The beauty of a colorless or near-colorless gemstone is characterized by its color, brilliance, and fire. The brilliance of a gemstone is measured by its refractive index, or the extent to which, when coupled with the facet design, the gemstone reflects light. The fire of a gemstone, or the breaking of light rays into spectral colors, is measured by its dispersion. Durability is determined by a gemstone’s hardness, or resistance to scratching and toughness, or resistance to chipping or cleaving. Rarity is the availability or perceived availability of a gemstone. Moissanite jewels have a unique combination of brilliance, fire, durability, and rarity.
 
Moissanite’s beauty is objectively derived from its refractive index, which is higher than any other gemstone, including diamond. And its hardness is greater than all minerals, and all known gemstone materials with the exception of diamond. As a result, moissanite jewels, like diamond, can be cut with sharp, well-defined, and highly polished facets that accentuate their brilliance and fire. The cutting specifications (facet arrangement and proportions) for moissanite jewels are different than any other gemstone and designed to maximize the brilliance and fire of the raw material.
 
We evaluate the finished jewels to exacting standards with automated video-imaging equipment using internal and independent third-party certified gemologists. Due to the rare natural occurrence of moissanite and both the proprietary and technical limitations in producing mass quantities of gem-grade moissanite, we believe that moissanite is among the rarest of jewels.
 
The following table compares the physical properties of moissanite jewels with other fine gemstone materials:
 

Description | Refractive Index | | Dispersion | | Hardness (1) | Toughness
--------------------------------------+------------------+-----------+------------+-------+--------------+----------
Charles & Colvard Created Moissanite® | | 2.65-2.69 | | 0.104 | | | 9.25 – 9.5 | Excellent 
Diamond | | 2.42 | | 0.044 | | | 10 | Good to Excellent (2) 
Ruby | | 1.77 | | 0.018 | | | 9 | Excellent (3) 
Sapphire | | 1.77 | | 0.018 | | | 9 | Excellent (3) 
Emerald | | 1.58 | | 0.014 | | | 7.50 | Poor to Good 

 
(1) For purposes of this table, “hardness” is based on the Mohs Scale, which is a relative scale only. Quantitative comparisons of different gemstone materials cannot be made directly using the Mohs Scale. Moissanite jewels, while harder than all other known gemstones, are approximately one-half as hard as diamond.
 (2) In cleavage direction, toughness is “good”
 (3) Except twinned stones

Products and Product Development
 
Moissanite Jewels
 
Historically, Charles & Colvard primarily sold legacy moissanite jewels including Forever ClassicTM and Forever Brilliant®. We continue to offer these legacy products in limited shapes and sizes, and only when available, through our Traditional segment as well as through our Online Channels segment through drop ship retail, and direct-to-consumer e-commerce marketplace outlets. In 2015, we announced availability of our premier product, the first colorless moissanite jewel, Forever OneTM, which grades from colorless (D-E-F) to near-colorless (G-H-I) using the Gemological Institute of America’s, or GIA’s, color grading scale. Our limited launch was met with great enthusiasm from channel partners and consumers. In response to this demand, we continue to expand our Forever OneTM product line with additional shapes and sizes. Today, we offer Forever OneTM in 27 cuts, and a multitude of sizes ranging from melee accent stones as small as .002 carats to gemstones up to 6.13 carats, and our Exotics line of products that are as large as 15.55 carats diamond equivalent weight, or DEW.

In May 2018, we announced the availability of a new grade of gemstone, Moissanite by Charles & Colvard®. We believe that, with the exception of our own colorless moissanite jewel, Forever OneTM, our new gemstone is a cut above other moissanite on the market.  Created from the same patented SiC material that offers unparalleled clarity, we believe that Moissanite by Charles & Colvard® is truly a revolutionary value. The distinction between Forever OneTM and Moissanite by Charles & Colvard® is made through our applied expertise throughout the design and manufacturing process summarized below and described in more detail in “Manufacturing and Quality Assurance”. We believe that due to the discerning approach we take to ensure the quality of Forever OneTM, it remains far above any other offering available today. By closely evaluating clarity, color, and cut, we are able to determine which gemstones meet our exemplary standards for Forever OneTM, and those that fit within one of our multiple grade Moissanite by Charles & Colvard® gemstones.
 
Our manufacturing process starts with SiC material primarily manufactured by Cree through its patented process. This proprietary growing process creates a SiC material that is nearly free of micropipes – a type of inclusion sometimes found in lab-grown SiC material. However, based on the terms of the amended Supply Agreement with our strategic partner, we are permitted to purchase certain amounts of SiC materials from third parties under limited conditions. Either way, the SiC material comes to us as a boule, or a formed mass, that has the atomic structure of a single crystal. After beginning our manufacturing process, each boule is carefully inspected by our certified gemologists to ensure it meets our minimum standards for Charles & Colvard Created Moissanite® gemstones, including those for clarity and color grades. The products that meet appropriate minimum quality standards move forward on the journey to become our Charles & Colvard Created Moissanite® gemstones. From this point, as the product continues to move through our manufacturing process, it is subjected to further processing steps, such as cutting, faceting, and finishing. At the end of our manufacturing process, it’s the clarity and color designation, coupled with further inspection by our certified gemologists regarding the quality levels of the cutting, faceting, and finishing processes, that will ultimately determine if the product becomes one of our premier Forever OneTM gemstones or one our multiple grade Moissanite by Charles & Colvard® gemstones.
 
Moissanite Finished Jewelry
 
We began selling finished jewelry featuring moissanite in 2010. Our core designs included stud earrings, solitaire and three-stone rings, pendants, and bracelets. We are now selling an expanded selection of fashion-oriented, designer-inspired moissanite jewelry that we offer as an expansion to the core line of jewelry. The primary ingredients of our moissanite finished jewelry are loose moissanite jewels that we have on hand as part of our finished goods inventory, precious metal settings, and labor to mount the jewels into the settings.
Source of Raw Material
 
Our moissanite jewels are made from gem-grade SiC crystals. Our primary supplier of SiC crystals is Cree with which we have certain exclusive supply rights for SiC crystals to be used for gemstone applications. In addition, based on the terms of the Supply Agreement, as amended, with Cree described below, we are permitted to purchase certain amounts of SiC materials from third parties under limited conditions. We source the metals used for our finished jewelry, including white, yellow, and rose gold and sterling silver, from a number of domestic and international manufacturers located in the U.S, China, India, Mexico, Hong Kong, Vietnam, or Portugal. In line with our goal of providing socially and ethically-sourced products, we require suppliers to adhere to our stringent supplier guidelines, as well as to certify that their gold is coming from conflict free sources and that all precious metals supplied to us are responsibly sourced.

Exclusive Supply Agreement with Cree
 
On December 12, 2014, we entered into an exclusive supply agreement with Cree, or the Supply Agreement, which superseded and replaced our prior agreement with Cree. Under the Supply Agreement, subject to certain terms and conditions, we agreed to exclusively purchase from Cree, and Cree agreed to exclusively supply 100% of our required SiC materials in quarterly installments that must equal or exceed a set minimum order quantity. The initial term of the Supply Agreement was scheduled to expire on June 24, 2018. However, effective June 22, 2018, the Supply Agreement was amended to extend the expiration date to June 25, 2023. The Supply Agreement was also amended to (i) provide us with one option, subject to certain conditions, to unilaterally extend the term of the Supply Agreement for an additional two-year period following expiration of the initial term; (ii) establish a process by which Cree may begin producing alternate SiC material based on our specifications that will give us the flexibility to use the materials in a broader variety of our products; and (iii) permit us to purchase certain amounts of SiC materials from third parties under limited conditions. We believe that our Supply Agreement with Cree, which holds the U.S. patent for micropipe-free silicon carbide material and the related method of manufacture, provides us a superior quality core material above all other moissanite and one that possesses an unrivaled level of gemstone clarity. We also believe that the terms and conditions contained within the amended Supply Agreement are overall more favorable when compared with those in the Supply Agreement prior to the amendment. Our total purchase commitment under the Supply Agreement, as amended, until June 2023 is approximately $52.9 million, of which approximately $43.98 million remains to be purchased as of June 30, 2019.
Intellectual Property
 
We held a number of U.S. product and method patents for moissanite jewels that expired during 2015, under which we had broad, exclusive rights to manufacture, use, and sell moissanite jewels in the U.S. We held these same patents in 25 foreign jurisdictions, primarily across Asia and Europe, that expired in 2016, with one remaining in Mexico that expires in 2021. In addition, we have certain trademarks and pending trademark applications that support our moissanite branding strategy. Additionally, we have certain pending design patents that if approved we believe will differentiate our products in the gemstone and jewelry industry. Since the expiration of our patents we have noted new providers of moissanite entering the market. We know how challenging it is to create high-quality moissanite and anticipate it will take emerging providers significant time and investment to bring meaningful and competitive products to market. As we experienced ourselves, achieving the capacity to consistently produce a high-quality moissanite product at mass scale requires a careful balance of SiC-specific faceting skills and a well-tuned global supply chain. Therefore, in the foreseeable future, we do not anticipate direct moissanite competition in our superior quality gemstone ranges with consistent production volumes.
 
Our success and our ability to compete successfully depends in part upon our proprietary technology. In addition to our remaining international patent, we rely on trade secret laws and employee, consultant, and customer confidentiality agreements to protect certain aspects of our technology. We currently are not subject to any claims that our products or processes infringe on the proprietary rights of third parties. At the present time, we are also dependent on Cree’s technology for the production of SiC crystals.
 
Manufacturing and Quality Assurance
 
Moissanite Jewels
 
The production of Charles & Colvard Created Moissanite® jewels is an elaborate process developed over a number of years of collaborative research and development, acquired and learned knowledge from scientists, and considerable investment expense.
 
Following are the key manufacturing processes of our moissanite jewels:
 
  
• | Growing gem-grade raw SiC crystals;
--+------------------------------------


• | Manufacturing rough preforms;

Growing Gem-Grade Raw SiC Crystals. SiC crystal growth suitable for gem-grade usage at commercial quantities is proprietary both in design and in operational methodology. Cree has grown the majority of our SiC crystals in accordance with the terms of the Supply Agreement. We routinely evaluate the yield and quality of saleable moissanite jewels from SiC crystals. The yield of saleable jewels from each crystal is one of the most significant factors affecting the volume and cost of moissanite jewels available for sale. Yield is dependent on the quality of the crystals, and variations in crystal quality can adversely affect our gross margin percentage.

  Table of Contents
Manufacturing Rough Preforms. We have made considerable investment in the design, development, and customization of a proprietary manufacturing process that includes equipment, software, and procedures to maximize raw material yield. The result is production of intermediary shapes, called “preforms,” that vary depending upon the size and shape of the desired finished jewel. While we may not necessarily spend significant research and development funds during a specific operating period, we remain committed to invest research and development resources to improve raw material yield, including studying alternate preform shapes and cutting technologies, due to the dramatic effect such an improvement could have on our gross margin percentage.
 
Faceting and Polishing Jewels. Each preform is faceted and polished by our independent third-party gem-cutters to create what we believe to be our uniquely-faceted Revolutionary Cut™ gemstones based on master designs with multiple quality control measures built into the process. Gem-cutter training is a regimented program involving several months of progressive hands-on bench training. As we continue to expand the assortment of Forever One™, we will continue the process of certifying additional cutters to ensure sufficient scalability of our production capabilities to meet anticipated demand for this premium finished jewel.
 
Inspecting, Sorting, and Grading. Similar to other gemstones, each faceted moissanite jewel greater than 3.5 millimeters in size is individually graded against established master standards using our specially trained personnel. Additionally, as part of our overall quality assurance program, a representative sample from each batch of jewels is submitted to an image analyzer to ensure critical angles and other attributes designed to maximize moissanite’s optical properties are consistently maintained. This phase of manufacturing is relatively labor-intensive and requires skills not readily available in the general work force. In the future, we may elect to outsource certain portions of this stage of the manufacturing process to independent third parties that we will require to adhere to our rigorous quality control and monitoring standards.
 
Engraving. For moissanite gemstones that are four millimeters and larger in size, with certain exceptions Charles & Colvard laser inscribes an identifying code on the girdle of each Forever One™ and Moissanite by Charles & Colvard® gemstone that includes the Charles & Colvard Floret logo. This identifier matches a grading standard and is an important element in protecting the integrity of Charles & Colvard Created Moissanite® and ensuring the customer an authentic Charles & Colvard gemstone.
 
Finished Jewelry
 
Our line of finished jewelry featuring moissanite is developed by a team of industry experts integrating our moissanite jewels into many forms of jewelry, generally made of precious metals, either designed or purchased by us utilizing a core group of suppliers, manufacturers, and finishers. In addition to our Limited Lifetime Warranty offered on our moissanite jewels, we provide a twelve-month Limited Warranty on all finished jewelry featuring our moissanite, and on jewelry designs that do not contain our moissanite gemstones, such as men’s wedding bands.
 
All procured finished jewelry components are sourced from our approved suppliers, and each finished jewelry item is jobbed and/or tracked by stock keeping unit, or SKU, utilizing our enterprise resource planning system. The components of moissanite finished jewelry comprised in each job are then manufactured into finished jewelry by assemblers either in the U.S. or internationally in China, India, Mexico, Hong Kong, Vietnam, or Portugal. We are continuously working with our existing manufacturing partners, as well as identifying new manufacturing partners, to expand our assortments and efficiencies.
 
All finished jewelry produced by Charles & Colvard undergoes a multi-point inspection process. A representative sampling of manufactured finished jewelry items undergoes stone and metals testing to ensure that the items for sale are of the quality that we strive to maintain. Also, in line with our goal of providing socially and ethically-sourced products, we require suppliers of our gold to certify that the gold is coming from conflict free sources and that all precious metals supplied to us are responsibly sourced. If required by government ordinance or requested by a customer, we facilitate the inspection of our finished jewelry by internationally recognized testing facilities to comply with legal requirements and to ensure consumer confidence.

Working Capital Practices
 
Our primary source of working capital is cash on hand and cash generated by operations. Because we have a quarterly minimum purchase commitment under the Supply Agreement, we may be required to purchase SiC materials in excess of our immediate needs from time to time, which may result in inventories that are higher than we might otherwise maintain.
 
We have an effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3 on file with the SEC that allows us to periodically offer and sell, individually or in any combination, shares of common stock, shares of preferred stock, warrants to purchase shares of common stock or preferred stock, and units consisting of any combination of the foregoing types of securities, up to a total of $25.00 million, of which approximately $13.99 million remains available after giving effect to our June 2019 public offering, including the impact of the partial exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment option, described below. Our ability to issue equity securities under the shelf registration statement is subject to market conditions. In June 2019, we completed an underwritten public offering of 6,250,000 shares of our common stock at a price of $1.60 per share, which, together with the partial exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment option for an additional 630,500 shares in July, resulted in aggregate net proceeds of approximately $9.99 million, net of the underwriting discount and fees and expenses.
 
Payment terms on trade receivables for our Traditional segment customers are generally between 30 and 90 days, though we may offer extended terms with specific customers and on significant orders from time to time. We extend credit to our customers based upon a number of factors, including an evaluation of the customer’s financial condition and credit history that is verified through trade association reference services, the customer’s payment history with us, the customer’s reputation in the trade, and/or an evaluation of the customer’s opportunity to introduce our moissanite jewels or finished jewelry featuring moissanite to new or expanded markets.
 
Our returns policy for consumers on our charlesandcolvard.com website provides for the return of purchases for any reason generally within 60 days of shipment.

Competition
 
As competitive moissanite and lab-created diamond expand and grow their market presence, there is no more important time than now to confirm Charles & Colvard’s leadership position as the premier worldwide moissanite provider and to further establish our presence in emerging markets. We believe our leadership position is a product of more than 20 years of moissanite innovation, and is bolstered by the following strengths:

• | With our Forever OneTM gemstones, we believe that we have achieved a level of perfection that is rarely seen in any gemstone – featuring colorless grades with an innovative cut that we believe reveals optical properties unrivaled by any other jewel. This pinnacle of production is the outcome of continual improvement and artisan craft. Additionally, we believe that with our Moissanite by Charles & Colvard® gemstones we have brought forward a price-conscious alternative to competitive moissanite that we believe exceeds the quality of competitive moissanite – specifically in terms of clarity, as well as in cut and polish. The distinction between Forever OneTM and Moissanite by Charles & Colvard® is made through our applied expertise throughout the design and manufacturing processes and the discerning approach we believe we take to ensure the quality of Forever OneTM remains far above any other offering available today. By closely evaluating clarity, color, and cut, we are able to determine which gemstones meet our exemplary standards for Forever OneTM and those that should bear the Moissanite by Charles & Colvard® name.

• | With an exclusive SiC crystal Supply Agreement with Cree, which holds the U.S. patent for micropipe-free silicon carbide material and the related method of manufacture, we believe this core raw material empowers Charles & Colvard to rise above all other moissanite with an unrivaled level of gemstone clarity.

Competitive Gemstones and Jewelry
 
Gemstone materials can be grouped into three types:
 
  
• | Those found in nature, generally through mining techniques;

• | Synthetic gemstone, which has the same chemical composition and essentially the same physical and optical characteristics of natural gemstone but is created in a lab; and

Moissanite is a rare, naturally-occurring mineral. Our lab-created gemstones, Charles & Colvard Created Moissanite®, are considered a synthetic version of the naturally occurring moissanite mineral. Our moissanite jewels compete with fine gemstones such as ruby, sapphire, emerald, and tanzanite as well as with mined diamonds. We also face competition from synthetic diamonds, synthetic diamond films, and other sources of moissanite gemstones. Some suppliers of diamonds and other fine gemstones, as well as the suppliers of synthetic and lab-created gemstones, may have substantially greater financial, technical, manufacturing, and marketing resources and greater access to distribution channels than we do.
 
Competing with Mined Diamonds
 
The worldwide market for large, uncut, high-quality mined diamonds is significantly consolidated and controlled by the De Beers Group of Companies, or De Beers, (headquartered in South Africa), Alrosa (Russia), Rio Tinto (Australia), and BHP (Canada). These companies have a major impact on the worldwide supply and pricing of mined diamonds at both the wholesale and retail levels. While moissanite trades at a fraction of the cost of mined diamonds, diamond producers may undertake additional marketing or other activities designed to protect the mined diamond jewelry market against sales erosion from consumer acceptance of competing goods such as moissanite jewels.
 
We believe these indicators from the mined diamond trade show a change in consumer confidence in the diamond trade. In addition, in 2018 De Beers entered into the lab-created diamond trade – stating their intent to address market interest.
 
Competing with Lab-Created (Synthetic) Diamond
 
Lab-created diamond material has been synthesized since the early 1940s and made its way into industrial processes by the 1950s. Common applications such as diamond-tipped drill bits and abrasive processes led the way, followed by uses in solid-state electronics. In more recent years, lab-created diamonds have become accepted as a form of gemstone with companies such as Diamond Foundry, Pure Grown Diamonds and Lab Diamonds Direct gaining notoriety in the market.
 
In June 2018, De Beers – one of the world’s largest mined diamond sight holders – announced its initiative to launch a line of fashion jewelry with lab-created diamonds. We believe this step is a validation of the market opportunity for providing a socially and environmentally conscientious, quality alternative gemstone at a reasonable price compared to mined gemstones.
 
Consumer demand is driving the charge behind this recent adoption of lab-created gemstones. Today’s discerning consumer is seeking ethically-sourced options, better price points, and authenticity in the brands they choose to engage. We believe the recent rise in interest for lab-created diamond is creating a halo effect for the moissanite gemstone market. While we are experiencing growing traffic and interest in Charles & Colvard from the ongoing attention around lab-created gemstones, we may face future price point and consumer related demand pressures from the lab-created diamond industry. With current moissanite pricing averaging approximately 5% of mined diamond gemstones and approximately 10% of lab-created diamond, we believe that for the foreseeable future we will continue to be able to address an underserved segment of the market.
 
Competing with Other Moissanite Producers
 
Although we believe that our moissanite jewels have a leadership market position, we are beginning to face competition from other companies that develop competing SiC material. These products are emerging primarily from Eastern countries and are making their way into the U.S. market. Our ongoing research of the competitive landscape has identified competing moissanite, primarily in the “E-F” and below color range, according to the GIA’s grading scale. However, we have not yet identified competing moissanite that exhibits a consistent level of color, cut, clarity and polish that is competitive with the quality of our Forever OneTM gemstone.

We also have not identified competitive sources that have exhibited the ability to supply a consistent and high volume of quality moissanite substantial enough to address the considerable consumption needs of distributors and retailers that serve the jewelry trade. Achieving the capacity to consistently produce a high-quality moissanite product at mass scale requires a careful balance of SiC-specific faceting skills and a well-tuned global supply chain.
 
However, we are seeing a grade of moissanite material reaching the market that exhibits a lower color rating and/or lesser cut, clarity and polish standard compared to our Forever OneTM gemstone. This inferior product is coming to market at competitive price points, and we have subsequently been experiencing downward pricing pressures from price-sensitive purchasing channels. In May 2018, we entered the market with a value line of moissanite to compete directly with these lower-grade moissanite products. This new value line, known as Moissanite by Charles & Colvard®, is a competitively-priced line of gemstones that is fashioned from the same core material as our other created moissanite products. Finished gemstones that do not meet our meticulous grading standards for Forever OneTM – but do meet our high specifications for gemstones worthy of carrying the Charles & Colvard name – will now be offered to the market at a value priced option. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, 6% of our revenue was generated from Moissanite by Charles & Colvard® gemstones and finished jewelry – we believe this percentage of revenue is validating the market for this value-priced product line.
 
Competing with Simulants
 
While moissanite is a synthetic gemstone (a lab-created version of the naturally-occurring SiC mineral), we may also, to a lesser degree, face competition from simulant gemstones, including cubic zirconia and man-made crystals. Producers and sellers of these products may see the markets for these products being eroded by the market penetration of our moissanite jewels. We believe that the substantially lower price of these products is the primary basis upon which they will compete with our moissanite jewels; however, they are not considered fine gemstone or jewelry products.
Competing in the Finished Jewelry Space
 
The global fine jewelry market competition is fierce. Such well-known jewelry designers and manufacturers as James Allen, Brilliant Earth, and Blue Nile, among others, have a variety of jewelry collections featuring diamond and other precious and semi-precious gemstones, and enjoy strong brand recognition and a loyal consumer following. These companies also have greater financial resources than we do to develop and market their products.
 
We intend to expand our market share and compete with these well-known brands primarily on the basis of the combination of quality, design, and value, as moissanite is the highest quality, affordable alternative available to more expensive gemstones such as diamond. We believe that focusing on the clear advantages in moissanite’s retail price points, especially in the one-carat and larger sizes, will provide a key point of differentiation and value proposition to the end consumer who may not have had the opportunity to previously purchase fine jewelry due to limitations in discretionary spending income.
 
In addition, we believe that the Charles & Colvard Created Moissanite® suite, including moissanite jewels such as Forever OneTM and Moissanite by Charles & Colvard®, along with moissanite finished jewelry that we are developing pursuant to our marketing programs, may create a long-term competitive advantage for our products as we build brand recognition. We endeavor to partner with recognized designers and jewelry companies, in addition to developing our own proprietary brands of finished jewelry. While our finished jewelry business is still developing, our goal is to build multiple strong brands sought after by the end consumer. We propose to focus our marketing efforts on emphasizing our attractive designs, coupled with moissanite’s exceptional brilliance, fire, durability, and rarity, to establish moissanite as a primary consumer choice in fine jewelry.
 
Our design, manufacture and marketing of finished jewelry featuring moissanite for sale at wholesale pricing to distributors and retailers and at retail to end consumers through our charlesandcolvard.com and other Online Channels outlets may result in some of our current wholesale customers perceiving us as a competitor, despite our efforts to use primarily non-conflicting sales channels. As we continue to develop our finished jewelry business, we intend to increase distribution through new and existing channels similarly to how many other companies have executed cross-channel marketing and distribution strategies. Due to the size of the finished jewelry market, we believe that such sales channels can co-exist, with the overall end result being increased consumer and brand awareness of moissanite products and a corresponding increased demand for not only our products, but those of our distributor and manufacturer customers as well.

Government Regulation
 
We are subject to governmental regulations in the manufacture and sale of moissanite jewels and finished jewelry. In particular, in July 2018 the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, issued updated guidelines governing the description of lab-grown diamonds and other gemstones that require such gemstones to be clearly identified as to the gemstone’s lab-grown origin in any promotional or marketing materials. In addition, the precious metal in our finished jewelry may be subject to requirements, which vary by country and by state, such as hallmarking and alloy content. While we have a policy to ensure compliance with applicable regulations, if our actions are found to be in violation of FTC or other governmental regulations, we may be required to suspend marketing of our products and could incur significant expenses in developing new marketing strategies and materials that would not violate governmental regulations.
Employees
 
As of August 29, 2019, we had a total of 63 employees, all of whom were full-time and none of whom were part-time. None of our employees are represented by a labor union. We believe that our employee relations are good.
