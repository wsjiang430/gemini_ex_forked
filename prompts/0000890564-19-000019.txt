Item 1. Business
Overview and History
ASGN Incorporated (the "Company") (NYSE: ASGN) is one of the foremost providers of information technology ("IT") and professional staffing services in the technology, digital, creative, engineering and life sciences fields across commercial and government sectors. Operating through our Apex, Oxford and ECS segments, we help leading corporate enterprises and government organizations develop, implement and operate critical IT and business solutions through our integrated offering of professional staffing and IT solutions.
We were incorporated in 1985 and commenced operation of our first contract staffing line of business in the life sciences sector. Expansion into other professional staffing markets has been achieved through acquisitions and internal growth. The following is a summary of acquisitions in the past five years:

• | On April 2, 2018, we acquired ECS Federal, LLC ("ECS"), headquartered in Fairfax, Virginia. ECS delivers advanced solutions in cloud, cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, machine learning, software development, IT modernization and science and engineering and is primarily focused on federal government activities. ECS is reported as a separate operating segment.


• | On August 8, 2017, we acquired StratAcuity Staffing Partners, Inc. ("Stratacuity"), a provider of specialized clinical/scientific staffing solutions headquartered in Portsmouth, NH. Stratacuity is included in the Apex operating segment.

Industry and Market Dynamics
ASGN delivers IT and professional staffing services in the technology, digital, creative, engineering and life sciences fields across commercial and government sectors to clients through contingent labor and light deliverables-based professional services models with a combined addressable end market of $280.0 billion ($51.0 billion in professional staffing, $100.0 billion in commercial IT consulting/services and $129.0 billion in Federal IT and professional services).
The Staffing Industry Analysts (“SIA”) September 2018 Industry Forecast report estimates the U.S. staffing industry will grow its revenues four percent in 2018 and three percent in 2019 to $147.8 billion and $152.4 billion, respectively. The largest industry segment, temporary staffing, is forecast to grow its revenues at an annual rate of three percent in 2019 to $131.3 billion, up from $127.6 billion in 2018. Within the temporary staffing segment, professional staffing is expected to grow its revenues four percent in 2019 to $78.5 billion, up from $75.8 billion in 2018. The temporary staffing industry is historically cyclical and typically has a strong correlation to employment and gross domestic product (“GDP”) growth. Permanent placement services revenues are forecast to grow five percent in 2019 to $21.2 billion, up from $20.3 billion in 2018.
ASGN operates in the most attractive subsectors of the professional staffing market - technology, digital, creative, engineering and life sciences. SIA projects 2019 professional staffing revenue growth of three percent for IT, seven percent for digital and creative, four percent for engineering, four percent for clinical/scientific and five percent for permanent placement services.
Adjacent to professional staffing is the large and growing IT services market. ASGN serves this market by leveraging its expertise in contingent labor with a light deliverables-based professional services model whereby we perform certain project oversight functions. Through independent research, we estimate the size of this IT services market to be $100.0 billion based on the skill sets we provide.
Finally, the ECS acquisition expanded ASGN’s addressable end market as we now compete in the Federal IT and professional services sector. Independent research estimates the size of this market to be $129.0 billion based on the skill sets we provide. The Federal IT and professional services sector consists of both Civilian and Defense and is estimated to be $65.0 and $64.0 billion, respectively in 2018.

We believe the rate of adoption of our contingent labor and light deliverables-based professional services models will continue to expand, driven by a number of factors including constant technology change and specialization, increase in adoption and use of mobile applications and smartphones, increasing cybersecurity threats, increasing compliance requirements and immigration/H-1B visa reform. We anticipate our clients will increase their use of contract labor to meet the need for increases in their workforce. By using contract labor, these clients will benefit from cost structure advantages, improved flexibility to address fluctuating demand in business, access to greater expertise and protection from the misclassification of contract employees hired as independent contractors. Entry into the Federal IT and professional services sector nearly doubles
 our addressable end market and ECS’s highly specialized skill sets reinforce our positioning as a premium human capital provider and complements our highly technical IT offerings.
When clients use independent contractors, they face the potential risk of worker misclassification and the resulting liability of federal and state taxes, wage and hour, immigration, diversity, employee rights and other laws and regulations. By working with a reputable human capital provider like ASGN, clients can ensure compliance with federal and state employment laws and avoid employee misclassification and the related lawsuits and financial penalties.
Clients 
We serve our clients by effectively understanding their IT and professional services needs and providing them qualified professionals with the unique combination of skills, experience and expertise to meet those needs. We believe effective engagements of contract IT, engineering, digital, creative and scientific professionals require the people involved in making assignments to have significant knowledge of the client’s industry and the ability to assess the specific needs of the client as well as the contract professional’s qualifications. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we provided services to approximately 15,000 clients, including U.S. government agencies. In 2018, no single client represented more than six percent of our consolidated revenues. Contracts with the U.S. Army generated approximately 32 percent of our ECS Segment revenues.
Our clients set rigorous requirements for the talent they are seeking and we use our extensive databases and deep relationships with our contract professionals to quickly identify and pre-screen candidates whose qualifications meet those requirements. We are responsible for recruiting, verifying credentials upon request, hiring, administering pay and benefits, compliance and training as applicable. Clients select the candidate, provide on-the-job supervision and approve hours worked. 
Candidates 
We recruit candidates with backgrounds in IT, digital, creative, engineering and life sciences who seek contract work or permanent placement opportunities.
Hourly wage or contract rates for our contract professionals, both employees and subcontractors, are established based on their specific skills and whether or not the assignment involves travel away from their primary residence. For our contract professionals who are our employees, we pay the related costs of employment including social security taxes, federal and state unemployment taxes, workers’ compensation insurance and other similar costs. After achieving minimum service periods and/or hours worked, our contract employees are offered access to medical and other voluntary benefit programs (e.g., dental, vision, disability) and the right to participate in our 401(k) Retirement Savings Plan. Each contract professional’s employment relationship with us is terminable at will. 
Professionals looking for a permanent placement may apply directly for open positions within a company or partner with a staffing agency to ensure they receive the best opportunities available in their industry. Candidates may work with one or more staffing companies during this process and often develop long-term relationships with their recruiter for future career advancement. Once placed in a permanent position, the professional is paid and receives benefits directly through the employer.
Strategy
ASGN's strategy is to identify, enter and be a dominant player in the most attractive subsectors of the IT and professional staffing services markets through organic and acquisitive growth. We have set a revenue goal of $5.0 billion by 2022 while maintaining an attractive gross margin, earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) margin and earnings per share (“EPS”) growth. To achieve these goals we will continue to specialize in the large and growing technology, engineering, digital, creative and life sciences markets, reinforce our position as a dominant competitor in each, advance our pursuit of the IT services market with our light deliverables-based professional services model, invest primarily in domestic markets, and pursue further disciplined acquisitions.
Our strategic innovation efforts and technology investments focus on putting the best productivity tools in the hands of our account executives recruiters, candidates and clients which makes it easy for clients and consultants to work with us. We continually respond to emerging trends in digitization and candidate sourcing by using technology to better position our businesses and improve how we serve clients and consultants.
We consolidate our corporate support services (finance, accounting, human resources, legal, marketing and IT) in centralized locations where we can most effectively and efficiently perform these functions, allowing us to leverage our fixed costs and generate higher incremental earnings as our revenues grow. In addition, we invest in leasehold improvements as we expand, relocate and rationalize our branch facilities to increase the productivity of our staffing consultants. In 2018, we continued to focus on increasing market share in each of our businesses, expanded our service offerings and controlled our operating costs.

Competition
We compete with other large publicly-held and privately-owned providers of human capital in the IT and professional staffing services segments on a local, regional, national and international basis across commercial and government sectors.
The principal competitive factors in attracting qualified candidates for contract or permanent placements are contract rates, salaries and benefits; availability and variety of opportunities; quality, duration and location of assignments; and responsiveness to requests for placement. Many people seeking contract employment or permanent placements through us are also pursuing employment through other means, including other human capital providers. Therefore, the speed at which we assign prospective professionals and the availability of attractive and appropriate assignments are important factors in our ability to fill open positions. In addition to having high quality candidates to assign in a timely manner, the principal competitive factors in obtaining and retaining clients are properly assessing the clients’ specific job and project requirements, the appropriateness of the professional assigned to the client, the price of services and monitoring our clients’ satisfaction. Although we believe we compete favorably with respect to these factors, we expect competition to continue to increase.

Services are provided to clients in a wide range of industries from large companies that may, for example, be installing new enterprise-wide computer systems and have a need for a subject matter expert with a specific technical and industry-specific experience, to small and mid-sized companies, such as a medical device manufacturer who needs a specialized hardware engineer. Assignments for Oxford typically range from two months to 13 months.
