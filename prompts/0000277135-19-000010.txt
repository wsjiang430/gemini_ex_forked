Item 1: Business 
The Company 
W.W. Grainger, Inc., incorporated in the State of Illinois in 1928, is a broad line, business-to-business distributor of maintenance, repair and operating (MRO) products and services. W.W. Grainger, Inc.'s operations are primarily in North America, Europe and Japan. In this report, the words “Grainger” or “Company” mean W.W. Grainger, Inc. and its subsidiaries, except where the context makes it clear that the reference is only to W.W. Grainger, Inc. itself and not its subsidiaries.
Strategy 
In the large and fragmented MRO industry, Grainger holds an advantaged position with its supply chain infrastructure, broad in-stock product offering and deep customer relationships. Grainger's purpose is to help businesses keep their operations running and their people safe.
The Company competes with two models: the high-touch, high-service model and the endless assortment (single-channel) model. Competing with these two models allows Grainger to leverage its scale and advantaged supply chain to meet the changing needs of its customers. Grainger’s high-touch, high-service model serves customers with complex needs in North America and Europe. The endless assortment model is focused on customers with less-complex needs and includes the Zoro Tools, Inc. (Zoro) brand in the U.S. and MonotaRO Co., Ltd. (MonotaRO) in Japan.
