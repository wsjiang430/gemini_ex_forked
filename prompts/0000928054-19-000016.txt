Information about the Company’s one operating segment is below.
Energy Chemistry Technologies
The Energy Chemistry Technologies (“ECT”) segment designs, develops, manufactures, packages, distributes, delivers, and markets reservoir-centric fluid systems, including specialty and conventional chemistries, for use in oil and gas (“O&G”) well drilling, cementing, completion, remediation, and stimulation activities designed to maximize recovery in both new and mature fields. Flotek’s specialty 


chemistries possess enhanced performance characteristics and are manufactured to perform in a broad range of basins and reservoirs with varying downhole pressures, temperatures and other well-specific conditions customized to customer specifications. This segment has technical services laboratories and a research and innovation laboratory that focus on design improvements, development and viability testing of new chemistry formulations, and continued enhancement of existing products. Flotek’s flagship patented chemistry technologies include Complex nano-Fluid®, Pressure reducing Fluids®, and MicroSolv™.
Chemistries branded Complex nano-Fluid® technologies (“CnF® products”) are patented both domestically and internationally and are proven strategically cost-effective performance additives within both oil and natural gas markets. The CnF® product mixtures are stable mixtures of plant derived oils, water, and surface active agents which organize molecules into nano structures. The combined advantage of solvents, surface active agents and water, and the resultant nano structures, improve well treatment results as compared to the independent use of solvents and surface active agents. CnF® products are composed of renewable, plant-derived ingredients and oils that are certified as biodegradable. CnF® chemistries help achieve improved operational and financial results for the Company’s customers in low permeability sand and shale reservoirs.
Chemistries branded Pressure reducing Fluids® technologies (“PrF® products”) are a patented line of high molecular weight polymers used as friction reducers that reduce turbulence and maximize the use of the polymer at a lower loading rate. The products have proven efficacy in a broad range of water quality, including high brine and high iron environments.
Introduced in April 2018, chemistries branded MicroSolv™ are a patented line of microemulsion technologies designed to deliver cost-effective performance.
Discontinued Operations
Consumer and Industrial Chemistry Technologies. The Consumer and Industrial Chemistry Technologies (“CICT”) segment, reported as discontinued operations, sourced citrus oil domestically and internationally and processed citrus oils. Products produced from processed citrus oil include (1) high value compounds used as additives by companies in the flavors and fragrances markets and (2) environmentally friendly chemistries for use in the oil & gas industry and numerous other industries around the world. The CICT segment designed, developed, and manufactured products that were sold to companies in the flavor and fragrance industries and specialty chemical industry. These technologies are used within food and beverage, fragrance, and household and industrial cleaning products industries.
Drilling Technologies. The Drilling Technologies segment, reported as discontinued operations, provided downhole drilling tools for use in energy and mining activities. This segment assembled, rented, sold, inspected, and marketed 


specialized equipment used in energy, mining, and industrial drilling activities. Established tool rental operations were located throughout the United States (the “U.S.”) and in a number of international markets.
Production Technologies. The Production Technologies segment, reported as discontinued operations, provided pumping system components, electric submersible pumps (“ESPs”), gas separators, production valves, and complementary services. Through the Company’s acquisition of International Artificial Lift, LLC (“IAL”), the Company provided a line of next generation hydraulic pumping units that served to increase and maximize production for oil and natural gas wells.
Seasonality
Overall, operations are not significantly affected by seasonality; however, winter weather conditions can pose delays in clients’ activity levels, primarily in oil and gas. Certain working capital components build and recede throughout the year in conjunction with established purchasing and selling cycles that can impact operations and financial position. With respect to the Company’s discontinued CICT segment, citrus oil inventories increase during the first and second quarters in-line with the citrus crop harvest and processing season. The performance of certain services within the Company’s remaining ECT segment can be susceptible to both weather and naturally occurring phenomena, including, but not limited to, the following:

• | the severity and duration of winter temperatures in North America, which impacts natural gas storage levels, drilling activity, and commodity prices;


• | the timing and duration of the Canadian spring thaw and resulting restrictions that impact activity levels;


• | the timing and impact of hurricanes upon coastal and offshore operations; and


• | the adverse weather and disease that affect citrus crops in Florida and Brazil which can negatively impact the availability of citrus oils and increase raw material costs for the ECT business unit.

Product Demand and Marketing
Demand for the Company’s energy chemistry products and services is dependent on levels of conventional and non-conventional oil and natural gas well drilling and completion activity, both domestically and internationally. Products in the Energy Chemistry Technologies segment are marketed directly to customers through the Company’s own sales force and through certain contractual agency arrangements. Established customer relationships provide repeat sales opportunities. The Company participates in industry trade shows and publishes technical papers and case studies examining the performance of its chemistries and methodologies for evaluating chemistries more effectively. While the Company’s primary marketing efforts remain focused in North America, a growing amount of resources and effort are focused on emerging international markets, 


especially in the Middle East and North Africa (“MENA”) and South America. In addition to direct marketing and relationship development, the Company also markets products and services through the use of third party agents primarily in international markets.
Customers
The Company’s customers primarily include major integrated oil and natural gas companies, oilfield service companies, independent oil and natural gas companies, pressure pumping service companies, international supply chain management companies, and national and state-owned oil companies. In addition, customers in the discontinued operations at December 31, 2018, include household and commercial cleaning product companies, fragrance and cosmetic companies, and food and beverage manufacturing companies. In the one segment reported in continuing operations, the Company had two major customers for the year ended December 31, 2018, which accounted for 12% and 10% of consolidated revenue, one major customer for the year ended December 31, 2017, which accounted for 17% of consolidated revenue, and two major customers for the year ended December 31, 2016, which accounted for 22% and 16% of consolidated revenue. In aggregate, the Company’s largest three customers collectively accounted for 30%, 32%, and 48% of consolidated revenue for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.
Research and Innovation
The Company is engaged in research and innovation activities focused on the design of reservoir specific, customized chemistries in the Energy Chemistry Technologies segment. In this segment, for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, the Company incurred $10.4 million, $13.1 million, and $9.3 million, respectively, of research and innovation expense. In 2018, research and innovation expense was approximately 5.8% of consolidated revenue. The Company expects that its 2019 research and innovation investment will continue to remain a significant portion of overall spending to support new product development and customization initiatives for its clients.
Backlog
Due to the nature of the Company’s contractual customer relationships and the way they operate, the Company has historically not had significant backlog order activity.
Intellectual Property
The Company’s policy is to protect its intellectual property, both within and outside of the U.S. The Company considers patent protection for all products and methods deemed to have commercial significance and that may qualify for patent protection. The decision to pursue patent protection is dependent upon several factors, including whether patent protection can be obtained, cost-effectiveness, and alignment with operational and commercial interests. The Company believes its patent and trademark portfolio, combined with 


confidentiality agreements, trade secrets, proprietary designs, and manufacturing and operational expertise, are necessary and appropriate to protect its intellectual property and ensure continued strategic advantage. Within its continuing operations, the Company currently has 50 issued patents and over six dozen pending patent applications filed in the U.S. and abroad on various chemical compositions and methods and software methods. In addition, the Company currently has 55 registered trademarks and over a dozen pending trademark applications filed in the U.S. and abroad, covering a variety of its goods and services.
Competition
The ability to compete in the oilfield services industry is dependent upon the Company’s ability to differentiate its products and services, provide superior quality and service, and maintain a competitive cost structure with sufficient raw material supplies. Activity levels in the oil field goods and services industry are impacted by current and expected oil and natural gas prices, oil and natural gas drilling activity, production levels, and customer drilling and completion designated capital spending. Domestic and international regions in which Flotek operates are highly competitive. The unpredictability of the energy industry and commodity price fluctuations creates both increased risk and opportunity for the products and services of both the Company and its competitors. 
Certain oil and natural gas service companies competing with the Company are larger and have access to more resources. Such competitors could be better situated to withstand industry downturns, compete on the basis of price, and acquire and develop new equipment and technologies, all of which could affect the Company’s revenue and profitability. Oil and natural gas service companies also compete for customers and strategic business opportunities. Thus, competition could have a detrimental impact upon the Company’s business. 
Raw Materials
Materials and components used in the Company’s servicing and manufacturing operations, as well as those purchased for sale, are generally available on the open market from multiple sources. Collection and transportation of raw materials to Company facilities, however, could be adversely affected by extreme weather conditions. Additionally, certain raw materials are available from limited sources. Disruptions to supply could materially impact sales. The prices paid for raw materials vary based on energy, citrus, and other commodity price fluctuations, tariffs, duties on imported materials, foreign currency exchange rates, business cycle position, and global demand. Higher prices for chemistries, citrus, polymers, and other raw materials could adversely impact future sales and contract fulfillments.
Citrus-based terpene (d-limonene) is an important feedstock for many of the Company’s formulations. In addition, the Company utilizes naturally derived terpenes from other sources and bio-based solvents from other natural sources.

The Company is diligent in its efforts to identify alternate suppliers, in its contingency planning for potential supply shortages and in its proactive efforts to reduce costs through competitive bidding practices. When able, the Company uses multiple suppliers, both domestically and internationally, to purchase raw materials on the open market. In connection with the sale of the CICT segment, Flotek entered into a long-term supply agreement, which will secure Flotek’s long-term supply of d-limonene.
Citrus greening disease has adversely affected the availability of citrus crops around the world, thereby negatively impacting the supply and increasing the price of citrus terpenes. The Company’s market position, inventory, and forward purchases helps ensure availability for its patented CnF® technologies. As mentioned previously, the Company has also developed new CnF® formulations utilizing alternative solvents. These new formulations not only diversify the Company’s dependence on citrus terpenes, but they also provide certain performance benefits necessary for specific customer and reservoir challenges.
Government Regulations
The Company is subject to federal, state, and local environmental, occupational safety, and health laws and regulations within the U.S. and other countries in which the Company does business. These laws and regulations strictly govern the manufacture, storage, transportation, sale, use, and disposal of chemistry products. The Company strives to ensure full compliance with all regulatory requirements and is unaware of any material instances of noncompliance.
The Company continually evaluates the environmental impact of its operations and attempts to identify potential liabilities and costs of any environmental remediation, litigation, or associated claims. Several products of the Energy Chemistry Technologies and discontinued Consumer and Industrial Chemistry Technologies segments are considered hazardous materials. In the event of a leak or spill in association with Company operations, the Company could be exposed to risk of material cost, net of insurance proceeds, to remediate any contamination. No environmental claims are currently being litigated, and the Company does not expect that costs related to remediation requirements will have a significant adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position or results of operations.

Employees
At December 31, 2018, the Company had 273 employees in its continuing operations and 77 employees in its discontinued operations, exclusive of existing worldwide agency relationships. None of the Company’s employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement and labor relations are generally positive. Certain international locations have staffing or work arrangements that are contingent upon local work councils or other regulatory approvals.
