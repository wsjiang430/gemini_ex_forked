     Item 1. Business        Overview 
     YETI Holdings, Inc. is a designer, marketer, retailer, and distributor of a variety of innovative, branded, premium products to a wide‑ranging customer base. Our mission is to ensure that each YETI product delivers exceptional performance and durability in any environment, whether in the remote wilderness, at the beach, or anywhere else life takes our customers. By consistently delivering high‑performing products, we built a following of engaged brand loyalists throughout the United States, Canada, Australia, and elsewhere, ranging from serious outdoor enthusiasts to individuals who simply value products of uncompromising quality and design. Our relationship with customers continues to thrive and deepen as a result of our innovative new product introductions, expansion and enhancement of existing product families, and multifaceted branding activities.
     We were founded in 2006 by avid outdoorsmen, Roy and Ryan Seiders (our “Founders”), who were frustrated with equipment that could not keep pace with their interests in hunting and fishing. By utilizing forward-thinking designs and advanced manufacturing techniques, they developed a nearly indestructible hard cooler with superior ice retention. Our original hard cooler not only delivered exceptional performance, it anchored an authentic, passionate, and durable bond among customers and our company.
     Our principal corporate offices are located in Austin, Texas. We completed our initial public offering (“IPO”) in October 2018 and our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”) under the symbol “YETI.” Unless the context requires otherwise, references to “YETI,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our” used herein refer to YETI Holdings, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. 
     Initial Public Offering        On October 24, 2018, we completed our IPO of 16,000,000 shares of our common stock, including 2,500,000 shares of our common stock sold by us and 13,500,000 shares of our common stock sold by selling stockholders. The shares were sold at the IPO price of $18.00 per share for net proceeds of $42.4 million to us, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $2.6 million. On November 28, 2018, the underwriters exercised, in part, their option to purchase additional shares of common stock, in an amount of 918,830 shares, from the selling stockholders, at the public offering price, less the underwriting discount. We did not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock by the selling stockholders. Additionally, offering costs incurred by us were $4.6 million.
     Our Products 
     We have a track record of consistently broadening our high-performance, premium-priced product portfolio to meet our expanding customer base and their evolving pursuits. Our culture of innovation and success in identifying customer needs and wants drives our robust product pipeline. By employing the same approach that led to the success of our original hard coolers, we have broadened our product line to include soft coolers, drinkware, storage, outdoor products, and gear. Our current product portfolio is comprised of three categories: Coolers & Equipment; Drinkware; and Other.      Coolers & Equipment
     Our Coolers & Equipment family is comprised of hard coolers, soft coolers, storage, transport, outdoor living, and associated accessories. Coolers & Equipment could change over time as we add new product categories and incubate them within Coolers & Equipment. 
     Hard Coolers. Unlike conventional hard coolers, our hard coolers are built with seamless rotationally-molded, or rotomolded, construction, making them nearly indestructible. For superior ice retention, we pressure-inject up to two inches of commercial-grade polyurethane foam into the walls and lid and utilize a freezer-quality gasket to seal the lid. We offer five product ranges within our hard cooler category: YETI Tundra®, YETI Roadie®, Tundra Haul™, YETI TANK®, and YETI Silo™ 6G. We also offer related accessories, including locks, beverage holders, and other add-ons, to enhance our products’ versatility.

 Soft Coolers. The Hopper® is our line of soft coolers, which are designed to be leakproof and provide superior durability and ice retention compared to ordinary soft coolers. The Hopper soft cooler product line includes: the Hopper® Two, Hopper BackFlip™, and Hopper Flip®. Our soft coolers also include related accessory options such as the SideKick Dry gear case, MOLLE Zinger retractable lanyard, and a mountable MOLLE Bottle Opener.
     Storage, Transport, and Outdoor Living. Our storage, transport, and outdoor living product category includes: the Panga™ submersible duffel bag, LoadOut™ Bucket, Panga™ Backpack, Tocayo™ Backpack, Camino™ Carryall, Hondo™ Base Camp Chair, and Lowlands™ Blanket. We also offer a wide range of accessories, including bottle openers, lids, and storage organizers.
     Drinkware        Our Drinkware product family is made with durable, kitchen-grade, 18/8 stainless-steel, double-wall vacuum insulation, and our innovative No Sweat design. The result is high-performing drinkware products that keep beverages at their preferred temperature—whether hot or cold—for hours at a time without condensation. Our Drinkware product line currently includes eight product families including the Rambler Colster, Rambler Lowball, Rambler Wine Tumbler, Rambler Stackable Pints, Rambler Mug, Rambler Tumblers, Rambler Bottles, and Rambler Jug. Related accessories include the Rambler Bottle Straw Cap, Rambler Tumbler Handles, and Rambler Jug Mount. 
     Other
     We offer an array of YETI-branded gear, such as hats, shirts, bottle openers, ice substitutes, and dog bowls. 
     Segment Information
     We operate as one reportable segment.
     Sales Channels 
     We offer our products in the U.S., Canada, Australia, and Japan through a diverse omni-channel strategy, comprised of our wholesale and our direct-to-consumer (“DTC”) channels. In fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2017, our wholesale channel accounted for 63% and 70% of our net sales, respectively, and our DTC channel accounted for 37% and 30% of our net sales, respectively. As part of our commitment to premium positioning, we maintain supply discipline, consistently enforce our minimum advertised price (“MAP”) policy, and primarily sell through one-step distribution.
     In our wholesale channel, we sell to several large retailers with a national presence, including Dick’s Sporting Goods, REI, Academy Sports + Outdoors, Bass Pro Shops, and Ace Hardware, retailers with a large regional presence, and an assemblage of independent retail partners throughout the U.S., Canada, and Australia. We carefully evaluate and select retail partners that have an image and approach that are consistent with our premium brand and pricing, while also seeking new retail partners that create access to unique shopping experiences or customer bases. Our network of independent retail partners includes outdoor specialty, hardware, sporting goods, and farm and ranch supply stores, among others. As of December 29, 2018, we sold through a diverse base of nearly 4,800 independent retail partners. 
     We sell our products in our DTC channel to consumers on YETI.com, au.YETI.com, and YETI Authorized on the Amazon Marketplace, as well as customized products with licensed marks and original artwork through our corporate sales program and at YETIcustomshop.com. Additionally, we sell our full line of products in Austin, Texas at our first retail store, which opened during fiscal 2017, and most recently at our corporate store, which opened in late fiscal 2018. We are working diligently to open two new retail stores in Charleston, South Carolina, and Chicago, Illinois during 2019. Our DTC channel enables us to directly interact with our customers, more effectively control our brand experience, better understand consumer behavior and preferences, and offer exclusive products, content, and customization capabilities. We believe our control over our DTC channel provides our customers the highest level of brand engagement and further builds customer loyalty, while generating attractive margins.
     For fiscal 2018, Dick’s Sporting Goods was our largest single customer and represented approximately 16% of gross sales. In addition, YETI Authorized on the Amazon Marketplace represented approximately 10% of gross sales.

 Our Market
     Our premium products are designed for use in a wide variety of activities, from professional to recreational and outdoor to indoor, and can be used all year long. As a result, the markets we serve are broad as well as deep, including, for example, outdoor, housewares, home and garden, outdoor living, industrial, and commercial. While our product reach extends into numerous and varied markets we currently primarily serve the United States outdoor recreation market. The outdoor recreation products market is a large, growing, and diverse economic sector, which includes consumers of all genders, ages, ethnicities, and income levels.
     Additionally, we are expanding internationally as we continue to grow our presence in North America (including Canada), Australia and most recently in Japan. We are expanding internationally by focusing on brand awareness, dealer expansion, and our DTC channel. We believe there are meaningful growth opportunities by expanding into additional international markets, such as Europe and Asia, as many of the market dynamics and premium, performance-based consumer needs that we have successfully identified domestically are also valued in these markets.
     Product Design and Development
     We design and develop our products to provide superior performance and functionality in a variety of environments. Our products are carefully designed and rigorously tested to maximize performance while minimizing complexity, allowing us to deliver highly functional products with simple, clean, and distinct designs.
     We expand our existing product families and enter new product categories by designing solutions grounded in consumer insights and relevant product knowledge. We use high-quality materials, as well as advanced design and manufacturing processes, to create premium products that redefine consumer expectations and deliver best-in-class product performance. We continue to expand our product line by introducing anchor products, followed by product expansions, such as additional sizes and colorways, and then offering accessories.
     To ensure our continued success in bringing category-redefining products to market, our marketing and product development teams collaborate to identify consumer needs and wants to drive our robust product pipeline. We use our purpose-built, state-of-the-art research and development center to generate design prototypes and test performance. We follow a disciplined, stage-gate product development process that is designed to provide consistent quality control while optimizing speed-to-market. We collaborate with our YETI Ambassadors, a diverse group of men and women throughout the United States and select international markets, comprised of world-class anglers, hunters, rodeo cowboys, barbecue pitmasters, surfers, and outdoor adventurers who embody our brand, and industry professionals to test our prototypes and provide feedback that is incorporated into final product designs. Once we approve the final design and specifications of a new product, we partner with global suppliers and specialized manufacturers to produce our products according to our exacting performance and quality standards.
     Marketing
     We employ a wide range of marketing tactics and outlets to cultivate our relationships with experts, serious enthusiasts, and everyday consumers, including a combination of traditional, digital, social media, and grass-roots initiatives to support our premium brand, in addition to original short films and high-quality content for YETI.com.     Supply Chain and Quality Assurance
     We manage a global supply chain of highly qualified, third-party manufacturing and logistics partners to produce and distribute our products. The primary raw materials and components used by our manufacturing partners include polyethylene, polyurethane foam, stainless-steel, polyester fabric, zippers, and other plastic materials and coatings. We believe many of these materials are available from multiple vendors. We stipulate approved suppliers and control the specifications for key raw materials used in our products. We do not directly source significant amounts of these raw materials and components.
     We do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities. We match sourcing partnerships to deliver flexibility and scalability to support multiple product introductions and evolving channel strategies. Our global supply chain management team researches materials and equipment; qualifies raw material suppliers; vets potential manufacturing partners for advanced production and quality assurance processes; directs our internal demand and production planning; approves and manages product purchasing plans; and oversees product transportation. Additionally, we work closely with our manufacturing partners regarding product quality and manufacturing process efficiency.

 We have third-party manufacturing partners across our product lines located in the United States, China, Italy, Mexico, and the Philippines. To mitigate the concentration risk in our supply chain, we are pursuing a higher diversification of manufacturing partners, with both sourcing and geographical advantages and, over time, intend to shift the current allocation of production to a better balance among them. See Note 12 – Concentrations Risk and Geographic Information of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for further discussion of concentration risk. We hold our manufacturers to rigorous quality and product conformance standards through frequent involvement and regular product inspecting. We own the molds and tooling used in the production of our products, create and provide the specifications for our products, and work closely with our manufacturing partners to improve production yields and efficiency. Our manufacturers do not have unique skills, technologies, processes, or intellectual property that prevent us from migrating to other manufacturing partners. 
     To ensure consistent product quality, we provide detailed specifications for our products and inspect finished goods both at our manufacturing partners as well as upon delivery to our United States-based third-party logistics partner. As part of our quality assurance program, we have developed and implemented comprehensive product inspection and facility oversight processes that are performed by our employees and third-party service providers who work closely with our suppliers to assist them in meeting our quality standards, as well as improving their production yields and throughput.
     Distribution and Inventory Management 
     We utilize global third-party logistics providers to warehouse and distribute finished products from our distribution facility in Dallas, Texas to support our domestic operations, and in Australia and Canada to support our international operations. These logistics providers manage various distribution activities, including product receipt, warehousing, certain limited product inspection activities, and coordinating outbound shipping. We recently developed new technologies to track products leaving the YETI distribution centers, allowing us to trace potentially diverted and unauthorized product sales to the selling-source. 
    
We manage our inventory levels by analyzing product sell-through, forecasting demand, and placing orders with our manufacturers before we receive firm orders from customers to ensure sufficient availability. 
     Competition
     We compete in the large outdoor and recreation market and may compete in other addressable markets. Competition in our markets is based on a number of factors including product quality, performance, durability, styling, and price, as well as brand image and recognition. We believe that we have been able to compete successfully on the basis of our brand, superior design capabilities and product development, our DTC capabilities, as well as the breadth of our independent retail partners, national, and regional retail partners.
     In the Coolers & Equipment category, we compete against established, well-known, and legacy cooler brands, such as Igloo and Coleman, as well as numerous other brands and retailers that offer competing products. The popularity of YETI products and the YETI brand has attracted numerous new competitors including Pelican, OtterBox, and others, as well as private label brands. In the Drinkware category, we compete against well-known brands such as Tervis and HydroFlask, as well as numerous other brands and retailers that offer competing products. 
     The outdoor and recreation market is highly fragmented and highly competitive, with low barriers to entry. Our current and potential competitors may be able to develop and market superior products or sell similar products at lower prices. These companies may have competitive advantages, including larger retailer bases, global product distribution, greater financial strength, superior relations with suppliers and manufacturing partners, or larger marketing budgets and brand recognition. 
     Seasonality
     We believe that our sales include a seasonal component. We expect our net sales to be highest in our second and fourth quarters, with the first quarter generating the lowest sales. To date, however, it has been difficult to accurately analyze this seasonality due to fluctuations in our sales. In addition, due to our more recent, and therefore more limited experience, with bags, storage, and outdoor lifestyle products and accessories, we are continuing to analyze the seasonality of these products. We expect that this seasonality will continue to be a factor in our results of operations and sales.

 Intellectual Property and Brand Protection 
     We own the patents, trademarks, copyrights, and other intellectual property rights that support key aspects of our brand and products. We believe these intellectual property rights, combined with our innovation and distinctive product design, performance, and brand name and reputation, provide us with a competitive advantage. We protect our intellectual property rights in the United States and certain international jurisdictions on all new products.
     We aggressively pursue and defend our intellectual property rights to protect our distinctive brand, designs, and inventions. We have processes and procedures in place in an attempt to identify, protect, and optimize our intellectual property assets on a global basis. Our experienced legal and brand protection teams initiate claims and litigation to protect our intellectual property assets. In the future, we intend to continue to seek intellectual property protection for our new products and prosecute those who infringe on these valuable assets.
     All product designs, specifications, and performance characteristics are developed and documented. After these aspects of the process are complete, we often seek intellectual property protection, including applying for patents and for registration of trademarks and copyrights.
     We have a proactive online marketplace monitoring and seller/listing termination program to disrupt any online counterfeit offerings. In addition, we work to shut down counterfeit stand-alone sites through litigation. 
     Our Employees
     As of December 29, 2018, we had 647 employees worldwide. We believe our increasingly well-known brand, culture of innovation, collaboration, and personal development allow us to recruit top talent nationwide in all areas of our business.
     Our United States and Canadian personnel are co-employed by us and a professional employer organization (the “PEO”), which we utilize to manage payroll-related functions and to administer our employee benefit programs. We are directly responsible for all aspects of employee recruiting, compensation, management, retention, and supervision of our personnel. We believe this co-employment relationship allows us to leverage the scale and systems of the PEO to our benefit.
     None of our employees are currently covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have no labor-related work stoppages and believe our relations with our employees are positive and stable.
     Available Information
     We file annual, quarterly and current reports and other documents with the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). The public can obtain any documents that we file with the SEC at www.sec.gov. We also make available free of charge our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and any amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act as soon as reasonably practicable after filing such materials with, or furnishing such materials to, the SEC, on or through our internet website, www.YETI.com.
