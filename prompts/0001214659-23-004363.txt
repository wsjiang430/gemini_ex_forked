Legal Matters
 
On November 4, 2021, a lawsuit captioned CAMRON ELIZABETH v. MARK PALUMBO et al., Case No. CVPS2106116 was filed in the Superior Court of California, County of Riverside against the Company and certain of the former company’s (CannAssist International Corp.) executive officers (collectively, the “Defendants”). The Plaintiff and the former company (CannAssist International Corp.) entered into a Consulting Agreement dated November 20, 2020 (the “Consulting Agreement”), pursuant to which Plaintiff was engaged to provide certain sales and marketing services to that Company. As a condition of this Consulting Agreement, Plaintiff was paid a monthly fee and was granted restricted shares of the common stock of the former company that were subject to certain vesting conditions tied to Plaintiff’s service under the Consulting Agreement. The Consulting Agreement also contained provisions that enabled the former company to terminate the Consulting Agreement without cause after 10 days’ written notice. In September 2021, the former company exercised its right to terminate the Consulting Agreement because management of the former company at the time of termination was dissatisfied with the quality of Plaintiff’s services under the Consulting Agreement. Specifically, management of the former company at the time of termination received complaints from third parties that Plaintiff behaved inappropriately in meetings where Plaintiff made presentations to potential clients and vendors on behalf of the former company. In contrast, Plaintiff alleges, among other things, that the Defendants improperly misclassified Plaintiff as an independent contractor, that certain of the former company’s executive officers committed sexual harassment and defamation and that Defendants unlawfully terminated Plaintiff. A jury trial has been set for May 26, 2023. The Company believes it should not be a party to the lawsuit since the former company, including its operations, officers, employees, contractors, assets, and liabilities were all spun out as part of or as a result of the Spin Out Agreement dated July 23, 2021, and the Plaintiff never contracted with or was employed by the current Company. The Company believes that the lawsuit is without merit and intends to defend the lawsuit vigorously; however, there can be no assurance regarding the ultimate outcome of this lawsuit.
 
Other than as described above, we know of no other material, existing or pending legal proceedings against the Company, nor is it involved as a plaintiff in any material proceeding or pending litigation. Other than as described above, we know of no other proceedings in which our directors, officers or any affiliates, or any registered or beneficial shareholder, is an adverse party or has a material interest adverse to our interest.

Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act
 
In April, 2012, the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (“JOBS Act”) was enacted into law. The JOBS Act provides, among other things:
 
Exemptions for emerging growth companies from certain financial disclosure and governance requirements for up to five years and provides a new form of financing to small companies;
 
Amendments to certain provisions of the federal securities laws to simplify the sale of securities and increase the threshold number of record holders required to trigger the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934;
 
Relaxation of the general solicitation and general advertising prohibition for Rule 506 offerings;
 
Adoption of a new exemption for public offerings of securities in amounts not exceeding $50 million; and
 
Exemption from registration by a non-reporting company of offers and sales of securities of up to $1,000,000 that comply with rules to be adopted by the SEC pursuant to Section 4(6) of the Securities Act and exemption of such sales from state law registration, documentation or offering requirements.

In general, under the JOBS Act a company is an emerging growth company if its initial public offering (“IPO”) of common equity securities was effected after December 8, 2011 and the company had less than $1 billion of total annual gross revenues during its last completed fiscal year. A company will no longer qualify as an emerging growth company after the earliest of
 
(i) the completion of the fiscal year in which the company has total annual gross revenues of $1 billion or more,
 
(ii) the completion of the fiscal year of the fifth anniversary of the company’s IPO;
 
(iii) the company’s issuance of more than $1 billion in nonconvertible debt in the prior three-year period, or
 
(iv) the company becoming a “larger accelerated filer” as defined under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
 
The JOBS Act provides additional new guidelines and exemptions for non-reporting companies and for non-public offerings. Those exemptions that impact the Company are discussed below.
 
Financial Disclosure. The financial disclosure in a registration statement filed by an emerging growth company pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933 will differ from registration statements filed by other companies as follows:
 
(i) audited financial statements required for only two fiscal years;
 
(ii) selected financial data required for only the fiscal years that were audited;
 
(iii) executive compensation only needs to be presented in the limited format now required for smaller reporting companies.
 
(A smaller reporting company is one with a public float of less than $75 million as of the last day of its most recently completed second fiscal quarter)
 
However, the requirements for financial disclosure provided by Regulation S-K promulgated by the Rules and Regulations of the SEC already provide certain of these exemptions for smaller reporting companies. The Company is a smaller reporting company. Currently a smaller reporting company is not required to file as part of its registration statement selected financial data and only needs audited financial statements for its two most current fiscal years and no tabular disclosure of contractual obligations.
 
The JOBS Act also exempts the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm from complying with any rules adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (“PCAOB”) after the date of the JOBS Act’s enactment, except as otherwise required by SEC rule.
 
The JOBS Act also exempts an emerging growth company from any requirement adopted by the PCAOB for mandatory rotation of the Company’s accounting firm or for a supplemental auditor report about the audit.
 
Internal Control Attestation. The JOBS Act also provides an exemption from the requirement of the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm to file a report on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting, although management of the Company is still required to file its report on the adequacy of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.
 
Section 102(a) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from the requirements in §14A(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 for companies with a class of securities registered under the 1934 Act to hold shareholder votes for executive compensation and golden parachutes.
 
Other Items of the JOBS Act. The JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can communicate with potential investors that are qualified institutional buyers or institutions that are accredited to determine interest in a contemplated offering either prior to or after the date of filing the respective registration statement. The Act also permits research reports by a broker or dealer about an emerging growth company regardless if such report provides sufficient information for an investment decision. In addition, the JOBS Act precludes the SEC and FINRA from adopting certain restrictive rules or regulations regarding brokers, dealers and potential investors, communications with management and distribution of a research reports on the emerging growth company IPO.

-


Section 106 of the JOBS Act permits emerging growth companies to submit 1933 Act registration statements on a confidential basis provided that the registration statement and all amendments are publicly filed at least 21 days before the issuer conducts any road show. This is intended to allow the emerging growth company to explore the IPO option without disclosing to the market the fact that it is seeking to go public or disclosing the information contained in its registration statement until the company is ready to conduct a roadshow.
 
Election to Opt Out of Transition Period. Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a 1933 Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the 1934 Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standard.
 
The JOBS Act provides a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such an election to opt out is irrevocable. The Company has elected not to opt out of the transition period.
 
Reports to Security Holders
 
In July 2017, the Company (as Iris Grove Acquisition Corporation) filed a Form 10-12G general registration of securities pursuant to the Exchange Act and is a reporting company pursuant such Act and files with the SEC quarterly and annual reports and management shareholding information. The Company will voluntarily send a copy of the annual report, including audited financial statements, to any registered shareholder who requests the same.
 
The Company’s documents filed with the SEC may be inspected at the Commission’s principal office in Washington, D.C. Copies of all or any part of the registration statement may be obtained from the Public Reference Section of the SEC, 100 F Street N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549. Call the Commission at 1-800-SEC-0330 for further information on the operation of the public reference rooms. The SEC also maintains a web site at http://www.sec.gov that contains reports, proxy statements and information regarding registrants that file electronically with the Commission. All of the Company’s filings may be located under the CIK number 0001709542.
