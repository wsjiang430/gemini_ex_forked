ITEM 1 BUSINESS
Company History



Cryomass Technologies Inc (“Cryomass Technologies” or the “Company”) began as Auto Tool Technologies Inc., which was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on May 10, 2011. The Company’s name was changed to AFC Building Technologies Inc. effective January 10, 2014. Effective April 26, 2018, the Company changed its name to First Colombia Development Corp. Effective October 14, 2019, the Company changed its name to Redwood Green Corp. Effective September 1, 2020, the Company changed its name to Andina Gold Corp. On July 15, 2021, the Company changed its name to Cryomass Technologies Inc and subsequently changed its trading symbol changed to CRYM.



The Company’s principal office is located at 1001 Bannock St., Suite 612, Denver, CO 80204, and its telephone number is 303-416-7208. The Company’s website is www.cryomass.com. Information appearing on the website is not incorporated by reference into this report.



On May 10, 2018, the Company began to establish various business ventures in Colombia through its Colombian subsidiary, First Colombia Devco S.A.S (“Devco”).



On July 1, 2019, the Company acquired 100% of the membership interests in General Extract, LLC, a Colorado limited liability company, in exchange for the shares of Devco. The name of this subsidiary was subsequently changed to Cryomass LLC.



On July 15, 2019, the Company entered into a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement to acquire cannabis-related intellectual property and certain other assets, but not cannabis licenses, of Critical Mass Industries LLC (“CMI”), a Colorado limited liability company.



Effective December 31, 2021, the Company disposed of all CMI-related assets and extinguished any and all related obligations. Therefore, we determined that CMI no longer qualifies as a variable interest entity (“VIE”) as of December 31, 2021.



In August 2020, the Company established a wholly owned Colombian subsidiary, Andina Gold Colombia SAS for this purpose acquiring gold properties in Colombia. However, due to the untimely death of our top geologist, the Company determined that pursuit of gold exploration in Colombia was no longer a practical alternative. In Q1 2022 the respective subsidiary was closed.





On June 22, 2021, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with Cryocann USA Corp, a California corporation (“Cryocann”), pursuant to which Company acquired substantially all the assets of Cryocann. The aggregate purchase price was $3,500,000 million in cash and 10,000,000 shares of Company common stock. As part of the Cryocann Acquisition, we retained both Cryocann employees, who have expert knowledge of the industry, related participants, customers and the acquired patented technology. Under their employment agreements, each employee may receive compensation if specific performance targets are met in association with our future operating performance when the Cryocann technology enters the market. The technology and assets acquired from Cryocann are operated from the Company’s subsidiary, Cryomass LLC. The patented cryo-mechanical technology is for the separation of plant materials in the harvesting of hemp and cannabis, and potentially other high value crops such as hops. We believe this technology will reduce processing costs and increases the quality of extracted compounds. We are exploring the application of the underlying technology to a broad range of industries that handle high-value materials and that could benefit from our precision capture methods. We anticipate that cannabis and hemp will be the first in a series of such industries.




To develop and commercialize the technology, we contracted with an independent engineering and manufacturing firm to refine the design of our cryo-mechanical system for the handling of harvested hemp, cannabis and other high-value plants. The system exploits CryoMass’s U.S.-patented process for the controlled application of liquid nitrogen to stabilize and separate the structural elements of gross plant material. The device currently under development is scaled for highway transportability and is being optimized for the low-cost collection of fully intact hemp and cannabis trichomes. It can be used within minutes after plants have been cut and can also efficiently capture trichomes from fresh frozen or even dried plant parts, including trim. The device’s through-put capacity is expected to be approximately 600 kilograms of gross plant material per hour. The advanced design for the equipment has been completed, and testing of a prototype machine is currently underway. The engineering and manufacturing firm has indicated that it has the capacity to build 10 to 15 such devices per month.

Canadian Patent no. 3 064 896 “Cryogenic Separation of Plant Material” was filed on May 25, 2018 by two assignors, who assigned it, among other, various other intellectual property rights, to a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company as part of the Cryocann June 22, 2021 transaction. The respective Canadian patent was granted on April 19, 2022. Provided that all patent maintenance fees are paid, the Canadian patent no. 2 064 896 will expire on May 25, 2038.



In September 2021, we were granted an additional patent for our process from the Chinese Intellectual Property Office. We currently are taking steps to gain further protection for our intellectual property through the European Union Intellectual Property Office and several other international jurisdictions.



Management believes the CryoMass system will deliver a compelling combination of cost and time savings while enhancing product quality and quantity for largescale cultivators and processors of hemp and cannabis. The use of a CryoMass system – which can be trucked to and operated on the fields of most large hemp and cannabis growers or be permanently installed at a user’s processing facility – should eliminate many of the costs that come with traditional practices, especially the labor, fuel and capital costs of drying and curing hemp or cannabis that is grown for the extraction of end products. With traditional practices, harvested plants are transported to a specially constructed drying house and then treated for a week or longer under controlled conditions of temperature and humidity. It’s a costly method. With our system, harvested plants are simply fed into the front end of a CryoMass machine, and minutes later fully intact trichomes are collected at the back end of the machine. With traditional practices and their seven-to-ten days of handling and drying, a large share of a plant’s valuable trichomes break off and are lost. Then the remaining trichomes are damaged by long exposure to oxygen and by the evaporation of their volatile terpenes. The CryoMass system, on the other hand, stabilizes and collects fully intact trichomes at harvest, leaving no opportunity for such wasteful loss. Field-captured trichomes are the cleanest element of a hemp or cannabis plant because, unlike the rest of the plant, trichomes do not readily take up heavy metals, pesticides or other common soil contaminants. As a product for end-users, field-captured trichomes are closest to being contaminant free. As feedstock for manufacturers of extracts and oils, they are the key to the purest products possible.



Because the trichomes collected with CryoMass technology represent only 10% or so of a plant’s weight and volume, they are cheaper to ship and store than gross plant material. For the same reason and because trichomes are free of the waxes and other unwanted materials found in the rest of the plant, processing trichomes into oils and extracts can be far quicker, cheaper and easier than processing gross plant material. Even trichomes captured from dried or frozen plant parts deliver this cost-saving advantage to processors of oils and extracts. The three-dimensional advantage achievable with the CryoMass system – first-stage cost savings, product enhancement and downstream cost savings – can as much as double a crop’s wholesale value. And in some jurisdictions, users may enjoy a reduction in excise taxes levied on cannabis and hemp harvests, which typically are tied to the gross weight of hemp or cannabis that is removed from the field.



On November 17, 2021, we announced the completion of a $10.3 million equity financing. The financing and the earlier conversion of substantially all the company’s debt into common stock left the Company with adequate resources for our planned business development. In connection with the financing, 1,010,000 shares and 760,000 shares of CryoMass Technologies common stock were purchased by CEO Christian Noël and Chairman of the Board Delon Human, respectively, either individually or through entities controlled by them.




Market Size



Production and processing of hemp and cannabis is a huge, worldwide industry. In the U.S., for example, the wholesale value of the cannabis crop from just the 11 states permitting adult-use and medical cannabis exceeds $6 billion annually.Growth in the U.S. and in the worldwide market is likely fed in part by the growing acceptance of medicinal cannabis products and anticipated legislative changes in various jurisdictions worldwide.



Several other high-value plants, including species that are important for health and wellness products, wrap their valuable elements in trichomes. The technology we are developing for hemp and cannabis may have profitable application to those other species as well.
