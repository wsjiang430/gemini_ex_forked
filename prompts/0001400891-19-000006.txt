ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
The Company
iHeartMedia, Inc. (the “Company,” “we” or “us”) is one of the leading global media and entertainment companies specializing in radio, digital, outdoor, mobile, live events, social and on-demand entertainment and information services for local communities and providing premier opportunities for advertisers.
The Company was incorporated in May 2007 by private equity funds sponsored by Bain Capital Partners, LLC (“Bain Capital”) and Thomas H. Lee Partners, L.P. (“THL,” and together, the “Sponsors”) for the purpose of acquiring the business of iHeartCommunications, Inc., a Texas corporation (“iHeartCommunications”). The acquisition was completed on July 30, 2008 pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated November 16, 2006, as amended on April 18, 2007, May 17, 2007 and May 13, 2008 (the “Merger Agreement”). As a result of the merger, each issued and outstanding share of iHeartCommunications, other than shares held by certain of our principals that were rolled over and exchanged for shares of our Class A common stock, was either exchanged for (i) $36.00 in cash consideration or (ii) one share of our Class A common stock.  Prior to the consummation of our acquisition of iHeartCommunications, we had not conducted any activities, other than activities incident to our formation and in connection with the acquisition, and did not have any assets or liabilities, other than those related to the acquisition.
 On March 14, 2018, the Company, iHeartCommunications and certain of the Company's direct and indirect domestic subsidiaries (collectively, the “Debtors”) filed voluntary petitions for relief (the “Chapter 11 Cases”) under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code (the “Bankruptcy Code”), in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas, Houston Division (the “Bankruptcy Court”). Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings, Inc. (“CCOH”) and its direct and indirect subsidiaries did not file voluntary petitions for reorganization under the Bankruptcy Code and are not Debtors in the Chapter 11 Cases.
The Chapter 11 Cases are being administered under the caption In re: iHeartMedia, Inc., et. al, Case No. 18-31274 (MI). The Debtors continue to operate their businesses as “debtors-in-possession” under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and orders of the Bankruptcy Court.
In general, as debtors-in-possession under the Bankruptcy Code, we are authorized to continue to operate as an ongoing business, but may not engage in transactions outside the ordinary course of business without the prior approval of the Bankruptcy Court. Pursuant to first day motions filed with the Bankruptcy Court, the Bankruptcy Court authorized us to conduct our business activities in the ordinary course, including, among other things and subject to the terms and conditions of such orders, authorizing us to: (i) pay employees’ wages and related obligations; (ii) continue to operate our cash management system in a form substantially similar to prepetition practice; (iii) use cash collateral on an interim basis; (iv) continue to honor certain obligations related to on-air talent, station affiliates and royalty obligations; (v) continue to maintain certain customer programs; (vi) pay taxes in the ordinary course; (vii) continue our surety bond program; and (viii) maintain our insurance program in the ordinary course.
iHeartCommunications' filing of the Chapter 11 Cases constituted an event of default that accelerated its obligations under its debt agreements. Due to the Chapter 11 Cases, however, the creditors’ ability to exercise remedies under iHeartCommunications' debt agreements was stayed as of March 14, 2018, the date of the Chapter 11 petition filing, and continues to be stayed.
On April 28, 2018, the Debtors filed a plan of reorganization (as amended, the “Plan of Reorganization”) and a related disclosure statement (as amended, the “Disclosure Statement”) with the Bankruptcy Court. Thereafter, the Debtors filed a second, third and fourth amended Plan of Reorganization and amended versions of the Disclosure Statement. On September 20, 2018, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order approving the Disclosure Statement and related solicitation and notice procedures for voting on the Plan of Reorganization. On October 10, 2018, the Debtors filed a fifth amended Plan of Reorganization and a supplement to the Disclosure Statement (the “Disclosure Statement Supplement”). On October 18, 2018, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order approving the Disclosure Statement Supplement and the continued solicitation of holders of general unsecured claims for voting on the Plan of Reorganization. The deadline for holders of claims and interests to vote on the Plan of Reorganization was November 16, 2018. More than 90% of the votes cast by holders of claims and interests entitled to vote thereon accepted the Plan of Reorganization. 
On January 22, 2019, the Debtors filed a modified fifth amended Plan of Reorganization and the Bankruptcy Court entered an order confirming the Plan of Reorganization. The Plan of Reorganization is subject to certain conditions to its effectiveness, including the receipt of certain governmental approvals. Although the timing of when and if all such conditions will be satisfied or otherwise waived is inherently uncertain, we currently anticipate the Plan of Reorganization will become effective and we will emerge from Chapter 11 during the second quarter of 2019.
1

The Plan of Reorganization contemplates a restructuring of the Debtors that will reduce iHeartCommunications’ debt from approximately $16 billion to $5.75 billion, and will result in the separation (the “Separation”) of CCOH from the Company, creating two independent companies.
For more information about the Plan of Reorganization and the Chapter 11 Cases please see Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources.” 
Our corporate headquarters are in San Antonio, Texas and we have executive offices in New York, New York. Our headquarters are located at 20880 Stone Oak Parkway, San Antonio, Texas 78258 (telephone: (210) 822-2828).
Our Business Segments
We have three reportable business segments:  iHeartMedia (“iHM”); Americas outdoor advertising (“Americas outdoor”); and International outdoor advertising (“International outdoor”).  Our iHM segment provides media and entertainment services via broadcast and digital delivery and also includes our national syndication business.  Our Americas outdoor and International outdoor segments provide outdoor advertising services in their respective geographic regions using various digital and traditional display types. Our Americas outdoor segment consists of operations primarily in the United States and our International outdoor segment consists of operations primarily in Europe, Asia and Latin America. Our “Other” category includes our full-service media representation business, Katz Media Group (“Katz Media”), which is ancillary to our other businesses. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the iHM segment represented 54% of total revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2018, Americas outdoor represented 19% and International outdoor represented 24% of total revenues.
For more information about our revenue, gross profit and assets by segment and our revenue and long-lived assets by geographic area, see Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements located in Item 8 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
iHM
Our iHM operations include broadcast radio, digital, mobile, podcasts, social, live events including mobile platforms and products, program syndication, traffic, weather, news and sports data distribution and on-demand entertainment.  Our radio stations and content can be heard on AM/FM stations, HD digital radio stations, satellite radio, on the Internet at iHeartRadio.com and our radio stations’ websites, and through our iHeartRadio mobile application in enhanced automotive dashes, on tablets, wearables and smartphones, on gaming consoles, via in-home entertainment and voice-controlled devices. 
As of December 31, 2018, we owned 848 domestic radio stations servicing over 160 U.S. markets, including 45 of the top 50 markets and 82 of the top 100 markets.  We are also the beneficiary of Aloha Station Trust, LLC and Ocean Station Trust LLC (the “Ocean Trust”), which own and operates 13 and 3 radio stations, respectively, all of which we were required to divest in order to comply with Federal Communication Commission (“FCC”) media ownership rules, and which are being marketed for sale.
In addition to our local radio programming, we also operate Premiere Networks (“Premiere”), a national radio network that produces, distributes or represents more than 110 syndicated radio programs and serves more than 6,000 radio station affiliates.  We also deliver real-time traffic and weather information via navigation systems, radio and television broadcast media and wireless and Internet-based services through our traffic business, Total Traffic & Weather Network.
We also curate, promote, produce and televise nationally-recognized iHeartRadio-branded live music events for our listeners and advertising partners, including the iHeartRadio Music Festival, the iHeartRadio Music Awards, the iHeartRadio Wango Tango, the iHeartRadio Jingle Ball Tour, the iHeartCountry Festival, the iHeartRadio ALTer Ego, the iHeartRadio Podcast Awards and the iHeartRadio Fiesta Latina.
Strategy
Our iHM strategy centers on being everywhere our consumers are with the products and services they expect. This includes delivering entertaining and informative content across multiple platforms, including broadcast, mobile, digital, social, podcasts and live events all of which are built around strong consumer relationships. We are also focused on providing our marketing partners with the same digitally-focused, data driven ad-buying experience that once was only available from digital-only companies and enable our clients to better understand how our assets can successfully reach their target audiences and promote their advertising campaigns. We continue to invest in the latest technology solutions that enhance the transformation of our products and services for the benefit of our consumers, communities, partners and advertisers. Our primary source of revenue is derived from selling local and national advertising time on our 848 domestic radio stations, with contracts typically less than one year in duration. The programming formats of our radio stations are designed to reach audiences with targeted demographic characteristics. We also

generate revenues from network syndication, our digital radio platform iHeartRadio, station websites and our nationally recognized live music events.
Continue to Enhance the Listener Experience.  We intend to continue enhancing the listener experience by offering a wide variety of compelling content and providing the content our listeners desire on their preferred platforms.  Our investments have created a collection of leading on-air talent: for example, Premiere offers more than 110 syndicated radio programs and services for more than 6,000 radio station affiliates across the United States, including popular programs featuring top talent such as Ryan Seacrest, Big Boy, Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, Glenn Beck, Steve Harvey, Elvis Duran, Bobby Bones, the Breakfast Club and Delilah. Our distribution capabilities allow us to attract top talent and more effectively utilize programming, sharing our best and most compelling content across both iHM's and other companies' radio stations.
We continue to seek opportunities to enhance iHeartRadio, our all-in-one digital music, podcast, on demand and live streaming digital radio service across both existing and emerging devices and platforms. iHeartRadio is on more than 250 platforms and 2,000 devices including smart speakers, digital auto dashes, tablets, wearables, smartphones, virtual assistants, TVs and gaming consoles. With the acquisition of Stuff Media, LLC in September 2018, iHeartRadio became the largest commercial podcast publisher in the U.S. based on uniques. We believe that podcasting is to talk what streaming is to music and is the next strategic audio platform. We believe our podcasting platform will allow us to capture incremental revenue as well as extend station brands, personalities and events onto a new platform - extending and deepening our consumer relationships. 
Deliver Content via Multiple Distribution Technologies.  We continue to expand the choices for our listeners. We deliver music, news, talk, sports, traffic, podcasts and other content using an array of distribution technologies, including: broadcast radio; digitally via iHeartRadio.com and our stations' hundreds of websites; HD radio channels; satellite radio; and through two iHeartRadio on demand subscription services iHeartRadio Plus and iHeartRadio All Access. We continue to seek to expand our presence on popular user platforms. Some examples are as follows:

• | Streaming. We provide streaming content via the Internet, mobile and other digital platforms through our iHeartRadio platform and our stations' hundreds of websites. We rank among the top streaming networks in the U.S. with regards to Average Active Sessions (“AAS”), Session Starts (“SS”) and Average Time Spent Listening (“ATSL”). AAS and SS measure the level of activity while ATSL measures the ability to keep the audience engaged. 


• | Mobile and Internet Applications. We have developed mobile and Internet applications such as the iHeartRadio mobile application available on more than 250 device platforms and 2,000 devices including smart speakers, digital auto dashes, tablets, wearables, smartphones, virtual assistants, TV’s and gaming consoles. These mobile and Internet applications allow listeners to interact directly with stations, find titles/artists, request songs and create custom and personalized stations while providing an additional method for advertisers to reach consumers. As of December 31, 2018, our iHeartRadio mobile application has been downloaded over 2.0 billion times (including updates), with more than 125 million registered users. iHeartRadio provides a unique digital music experience by offering access to more than 2,700 broadcast and digital-only radio stations, plus user-created custom stations with broad social media integration and our on demand content from our premium talk partnerships and user generated talk shows. 


• | On Demand. iHeartRadio Plus and iHeartRadio All Access - provide the best of live radio combined with easy-to-use on demand functionality. iHeartRadio Plus transforms live and custom radio listening with the addition of replay and unlimited skip functionality, the ability to save songs directly to user playlists and search for songs from a library of millions of tracks; iHeartRadio All Access combines the interactive functionality of iHeartRadio Plus with a complete music collection and library linked seamlessly to the radio listening experience, with functionality including the ability to listen offline; build subscribers' personal music libraries; no playback cap; and the ability to delete and sequence their playlist experience as well as manage unlimited playlists. 

Promote Broadcast Radio Media Spending. Given the extensive reach and metrics of both the broadcast radio industry in general and iHM in particular, as well as the depth and breadth of our relationships with both media agencies and national and local advertisers, we believe we can drive broadcast radio's share of total media spending by using our dedicated sales teams to highlight the value of broadcast radio relative to other media. 
Continue to transform broadcast radio to become ‘digital’ for marketers. We have made and continue to make significant investments so we can provide the same ad-buying experience that once was only available from digital-only companies and to enable our clients to better understand how our assets can successfully reach their target audiences and promote their advertising campaigns. Our programmatic solution for broadcast radio, Soundpoint, provides improved planning and automated ad-buying by relying on sophisticated planning algorithms and a cloud-based network across all of iHeartMedia’s broadcast radio inventory to deliver highly optimized plans to our advertising customers. SmartAudio is our audio data analytics advertising product for broadcast radio which leverages the capabilities of Soundpoint. With SmartAudio, advertisers can do impression-based audience 
3

planning and dynamic radio advertising creative that utilizes real-time triggers such as weather, pollen counts, sports scores, mortgage rates and more to deploy different campaign messages based on what is happening in a specific market at a specific moment. SmartAudio has allowed brands to use broadcast radio advertisements to dynamically serve the most relevant message in each market, at each moment, just as they do with digital campaigns to ensure increased relevance and impact. In 2018, we launched iHeartMedia Analytics, the first fully-digital attribution service for broadcast radio that we believe will transform the way advertisers plan, buy and measure their audio campaigns to better optimize the extensive reach of radio.
Promote Local and National Advertising.  We intend to grow our iHM businesses by continuing to develop effective highly-rated programming, creating new solutions for our advertisers and agencies, fostering key relationships with advertisers and improving our local and national sales teams. We seek to maximize revenue by closely managing our advertising opportunities and pricing to compete effectively in local markets. We operate price and yield information systems, which provide detailed inventory information. These systems enable our station managers and sales directors to adjust commercial inventory and pricing based on local market demand, as well as to manage and monitor different commercial durations (60 second, 30 second, 15 second and five second) in order to provide more effective advertising for our customers at what we believe are optimal prices given market conditions.
Continue to Deliver Nationally-Recognized Live Events. We intend to continue to deliver nationally-recognized live events to our listeners, such as the iHeartRadio Music Festival, the iHeartRadio Music Awards, the iHeartRadio Wango Tango, the iHeartRadio Jingle Ball Tour, the iHeartCountry Festival, iHeartRadio ALTer Ego, the iHeartRadio Podcast Awards and the iHeartRadio Fiesta Latina, featuring some of the biggest names in the music industry.
We continue to work closely with advertisers, marketers and agencies to meet their needs through new products, events and services developed through optimization of our current portfolio of assets, as well as to develop tools to determine how effective broadcast radio is in reaching their desired audiences.
Sources of Revenue
Our iHM segment generated 54%, 56%, and 54% of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.  The primary source of revenue in our iHM segment is the sale of advertising on our broadcast radio stations for local and national advertising.  We also generate revenues from our Premiere syndicated content, Total Traffic & Weather Network, iHeartRadio platforms and our stations websites and national live events. These other sources of revenue supplement our traditional advertising revenue without increasing on-air advertising time.
Our advertisers cover a wide range of categories, including consumer services, retailers, entertainment, health and beauty products, telecommunications, automotive, media and political.  Our contracts with our advertisers range from less than one-year to multi-year terms.
Each radio station’s local sales staff solicits advertising directly from local advertisers or indirectly through advertising agencies.  Our ability to produce content that respond to the specific needs of our advertisers helps to build local direct advertising relationships.  We utilize national sales teams to generate national advertising sales.  National sales representatives obtain advertising principally from advertising agencies located outside the station’s market and receive commissions based on advertising sold. 
Advertising rates are principally based on the length of the spot and how many people in a targeted audience listen to our stations, as measured by independent ratings services.  A station’s format can be important in determining the size and characteristics of its listening audience, and advertising rates are influenced by the station’s ability to attract and target audiences that advertisers aim to reach.  The size of the market influences rates as well, with larger markets typically receiving higher rates than smaller markets.  Rates are generally highest during morning and evening commuting periods.

Radio Stations 
As of December 31, 2018, we owned 848 radio stations, including 239 AM and 609 FM radio stations.  All of our radio stations are located in the United States. No one station is material to our overall operations.  We believe that our properties are in good condition and suitable for our operations.
Radio broadcasting is subject to the jurisdiction of the FCC under the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the “Communications Act”).  As described in “Regulation of Our iHeartMedia Business” below, the FCC grants us licenses in order to operate our radio stations.  The following table provides the number of owned and operated radio stations in the top 25 Nielsen-ranked markets within our iHM segment.

Premiere Networks
We operate Premiere, a national radio network that produces, distributes or represents 117 syndicated radio programs and services for more than 6,000 radio station affiliates.  Our broad distribution capabilities enable us to attract and retain top programming talent. Some of our more popular syndicated programs feature top talent including Ryan Seacrest, Big Boy, Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, Glenn Beck, Steve Harvey, Elvis Duran, Bobby Bones, Breakfast Club and Delilah.  We believe recruiting and retaining top talent is an important component of the success of our radio networks.

Total Traffic & Weather Network
Total Traffic & Weather Network delivers real-time local traffic flow and incident information along with weather updates, sports and news to more than 2,100 radio stations and approximately 100 television affiliates, as well as through Internet and mobile partnerships, reaching over 210 million consumers each month. Total Traffic & Weather Network services more than 220 markets in the United States and Canada. It operates the largest broadcast traffic navigation network in North America.
iHeartRadio Platform
iHeartRadio is our digital radio platform that offers users streaming music, radio and on-demand and podcasts. It is available on over 250 platforms and over 2,000 devices including smart speakers, digital auto dashes, tablets, wearables, smartphones, virtual assistants, and TVs and gaming consoles.
Live Events
We also curate, promote, produce and televise nationally-recognized iHeartRadio-branded live music events for our listeners and advertising partners, including the iHeartRadio Music Festival, the iHeartRadio Music Awards, the iHeartRadio Wango Tango, the iHeartRadio Jingle Ball Tour, the iHeartCountry Festival, iHeartRadio ALTer Ego, the iHeartRadio Podcast Awards and the iHeartRadio Fiesta Latina.
Competition
Our broadcast radio stations, as well as our websites and mobile applications, syndicated content and our traffic business, compete for listeners and advertising revenues directly with other radio stations within their respective markets, as well as with other advertising media, including broadcast and cable television, Internet, print media, outdoor advertising, satellite radio, direct mail and other forms of advertisement.  In addition, the radio broadcasting industry is subject to competition from services that use media technologies such as Internet-based media, mobile applications and other digital radio services. Such services reach national and local audiences with multi-channel, multi-format, digital radio services.
Our broadcast radio stations compete for listeners primarily on the basis of program content that appeals to a particular demographic group.  Our targeted listener base of specific demographic groups in each of our markets allows us to attract advertisers seeking to reach those listeners.
Americas Outdoor Advertising
We are one of the largest outdoor advertising companies in the United States.  As of December 31, 2018, we owned or operated  approximately 79,000 display structures in the United States with operations in 44 of the 50 largest markets, including all of the 20 largest markets.
Our Americas outdoor assets consist of printed and digital billboards, transit displays, including airports, street furniture and wallscapes and other spectaculars. Our Americas outdoor advertising business is focused on metropolitan areas with dense populations.
Strategy
We seek to capitalize on our Americas outdoor network and diversified product mix to maximize revenue. Our outdoor strategy focuses on leveraging our diversified product mix and long-standing presence in our existing markets as well as pursuing the technology of digital displays, which provides us with the ability to launch new products and test new initiatives in a reliable and cost-effective manner.
Promote Outdoor Media Spending.  Given the attractive industry fundamentals of outdoor media and our depth and breadth of relationships with our advertisers, we believe we can drive outdoor advertising’s share of total media spending by using our dedicated sales team to highlight the value of outdoor advertising relative to other media. Americas outdoor has made and continues to make significant investments in research tools like CCO RADAR with mobile insights from third-party providers. The CCO RADAR suite of out-of-home industry-first solutions applies aggregated and anonymized mobile insights to advertising campaign planning, amplification and attribution. Armed with these insights, CCO RADAR helps brands reach desired audiences, reengage those exposed to out-of-home printed and digital displays across other media platforms and measure what happens after exposure to optimize campaign delivery. Through RADARview, Americas outdoor is bringing mobile location data insights online, allowing advertisers to explore Americas outdoor’s media as mapped to audience behaviors, demos and location. In addition, Americas outdoor is experimenting with integrated social and mobile campaigns and Augmented Reality as supplements to its core medium.

Differentiate through Innovation, Sales and Services. Over the last several years, we have developed and hired talent who are helping to redefine how outdoor media is bought and sold. We are working closely with clients, advertising agencies and other diversified media companies to develop more sophisticated approaches to delivering the right audience in the right location at the right time. One example is our programmatic effort to sell digital billboard advertisements using automated advertisement sales technology to introduce ease and efficiency to the out-of-home advertising sales process and enable better targeting of digital billboard advertising. Another is our Proposal Team, which provides proposal preparation and marketing support for our key multi-market sales efforts. A third area is our proof of performance delivery platform that is leading the industry in providing transparency when the advertising is delivered, accessible via API to allow partners to pull proof of performance information into whatever system they choose.
Capital allocation. A core element of Americas outdoor capital allocation strategy focuses on the digitization of its network. Americas outdoor long-term strategy for its outdoor advertising businesses includes pursuing the technology of digital displays, including flat screens, LCDs and LEDs, as additions to traditional methods of displaying clients’ advertisements. Digital advertising provides significant advantages over traditional outdoor media. Americas outdoor electronic displays are linked through centralized systems to simultaneously and rapidly change advertising copy on a large number of displays, allowing Americas outdoor to sell more advertising opportunities to advertisers. The ability to change copy by time of day and quickly change messaging based on advertisers’ needs creates additional flexibility for Americas outdoor customers. Digital displays allow for high frequency, 24-hour advertising changes in high-traffic locations and allow Americas outdoor to offer its clients optimal flexibility, distribution, circulation and visibility.
Capitalize on Product and Geographic Opportunities. In the United States, Americas outdoor has operations in 44 of the top 50 largest markets, including all of the 20 largest markets. However, Americas outdoor is focused on growing their relevance to its advertising customers by continuously optimizing its portfolio and targeting investments in its existing markets or expanding to new markets.
Sources of Revenue
Americas outdoor generated 19%, 19% and 19% of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.  Americas outdoor revenue is derived from the sale of advertising copy placed on our printed and digital displays.  Our display inventory consists primarily of billboards, transit displays and street furniture.  The margins on our billboard contracts, including those related to digital billboards, tend to be higher than those on contracts for other displays, due to their greater size, impact and location along major roadways that are highly trafficked.  Billboards comprise approximately two-thirds of our display revenues.  The following table shows the approximate percentage of revenue derived from each category for our Americas outdoor inventory:

 | Year Ended December 31,
 | 2018 | | 2017 | | 2016
Billboards: | | | | | 
Bulletins | 61 | % | | 60 | % | 60 | %
Posters | 11 | % | | 11 | % | 11 | %
Transit displays | 16 | % | | 17 | % | 17 | %
Street furniture displays | 4 | % | | 4 | % | 4 | %
Spectaculars/wallscapes | 4 | % | | 4 | % | 4 | %
Other | 4 | % | | 4 | % | 4 | %
Total | 100 | % | | 100 | % | 100 | %

Our Americas outdoor segment generates revenues from local and national sales.  Our advertising rates are based on a number of different factors including location, competition, size of display, illumination, market and gross ratings points.  Gross ratings points are the total number of impressions delivered, expressed as a percentage of a market population, of a display or group of displays.  The number of impressions delivered by a display is measured by the number of people passing the site during a defined period of time.  For all of our billboards in the United States, we use independent, third-party auditing companies to verify the number of impressions delivered by a display. 
While location, price and availability of displays are important competitive factors, we believe that providing quality customer service and establishing strong client relationships are also critical components of sales.  In addition, we have long-standing relationships with a diversified group of advertising brands and agencies that allow us to diversify client accounts and establish continuing revenue streams.

Billboards
Our billboard inventory primarily includes bulletins and posters.

• | Bulletins. Bulletins vary in size, with the most common size being 14 feet high by 48 feet wide. Digital bulletins display static messages that resemble standard printed bulletins when viewed, but also allow advertisers to change messages throughout the course of a day and may display advertisements for multiple customers. Our digital displays are linked through centralized systems to instantaneously and simultaneously change advertising copy as needed. Because of their greater size, impact and high-frequency advertising changes, we typically receive our highest rates for digital bulletins. Almost all of the advertising copy displayed on printed bulletins is computer printed on vinyl and transported to the bulletin where it is secured to the display surface. Bulletins generally are located along major expressways, primary commuting routes and main intersections that are highly visible and heavily trafficked. Our clients may contract for individual bulletins or a network of bulletins, meaning the clients’ advertisements are rotated among bulletins to increase the reach of the campaign. Our client contracts for bulletins, either printed or digital, generally have terms ranging from four weeks to one year. 


• | Posters. Printed posters can vary in size, but are commonly approximately 11 feet high by 23 feet wide, and the printed junior posters are approximately 5 feet high by 11 feet wide. Digital posters are available in addition to the traditional poster-size and junior poster-size. Similar to digital bulletins, digital posters display static messages that resemble standard printed posters when viewed and are linked through centralized computer systems to instantaneously and simultaneously change messages throughout the course of a day. Advertising copy for printed posters is digitally printed on a single piece of polyethylene material that is then transported and secured to the poster surfaces. Posters generally are located in commercial areas on primary and secondary routes near point-of-purchase locations, facilitating advertising campaigns with greater demographic targeting than those displayed on bulletins. Our poster rates typically are less than our bulletin rates, and our client contracts for posters generally have terms ranging from four weeks to one year. Premiere displays, which consist of premiere panels and squares, are innovative hybrids between bulletins and posters that we developed to provide our clients with an alternative for their targeted marketing campaigns. The premiere displays use one or more poster panels, but with vinyl advertising stretched over the panels similar to bulletins. Our intent is to combine the creative impact of bulletins with the additional reach and frequency of posters. 

Transit Displays
Our transit displays are advertising surfaces on various types of vehicles or within transit systems, including on the interior and exterior sides of buses, trains, trams, and within the common areas of rail stations and airports, and are available in both printed and digital formats.  Similar to street furniture, contracts for the right to place our displays on such vehicles or within such transit systems and to sell advertising space on them generally are awarded by municipal and public transit authorities in competitive bidding processes governed by local law or are negotiated with private transit operators.  As compensation for the right to sell advertising space on transit displays, we pay the municipality or transit authority a fee or revenue share that is either a fixed amount or a percentage of the revenue derived from the transit displays. Typically, these revenue sharing arrangements include payments by us of minimum guaranteed amounts. Generally, these contracts have terms ranging from five to ten years.  Our client contracts for transit displays generally have terms ranging from four weeks to one year, or longer.
Street Furniture Displays
Our street furniture displays include advertising surfaces on bus shelters, information kiosks, freestanding units and other public structures, are available in both printed and digital formats, and are primarily located in major metropolitan areas and along major commuting routes.  Generally, we are responsible for the construction and maintenance of street furniture structures.  Contracts for the right to place our street furniture displays in the public domain and sell advertising space on them are awarded by municipal and transit authorities in competitive bidding processes governed by local law.  Generally, these contracts have terms ranging from 10 to 20 years.  As compensation for the right to sell advertising space on our street furniture structures, we pay the municipality or transit authority a fee or revenue share that is either a fixed amount or a percentage of the revenue derived from the street furniture displays.  Typically, these revenue sharing arrangements include payments by us of minimum guaranteed amounts.  Client contracts for street furniture displays typically have terms ranging from four weeks to one year and are typically for network packages of multiple street furniture displays.
Other Displays
The balance of our display inventory consists of spectaculars and wallscapes.  Spectaculars are customized display structures that often incorporate video, multidimensional lettering and figures, mechanical devices and moving parts and other embellishments to create special effects.  The majority of our spectaculars are located in Los Angeles, San Francisco and New York City's Times Square.  Client contracts for spectaculars typically have terms of one year or longer.  A wallscape is a display

that drapes over or is suspended from the sides of buildings or other structures.  Generally, wallscapes are located in high-profile areas where other types of outdoor advertising displays are limited or unavailable.  Clients typically contract for individual wallscapes for four weeks to one year. 
Advertising Inventory and Markets
As of December 31, 2018, we owned or operated  approximately 79,000 display structures in our Americas outdoor advertising segment with operations in 44 of the 50 largest markets in the United States, including all of the 20 largest markets.  Therefore, no one property is material to our overall operations.  We believe that our properties are in good condition and suitable for our operations.
Our displays are located on land we own, lease or for which we have acquired permanent easements or executed long-term management agreements.  The majority of the advertising structures on which our displays are mounted require permits.  Permits are granted for the right to operate an advertising structure as long as the structure is used in compliance with state and local laws and regulations.
Production
In a majority of our markets, our local production staff performs the full range of activities required to create and install advertising copy.  Production work includes creating the advertising copy design and layout, coordinating its printing and installing the copy on displays.  We provide creative services to smaller advertisers and to advertisers not represented by advertising agencies.  National advertisers often use preprinted designs that require only installation.  Our creative and production personnel typically develop new designs or adopt copy from other media for use on our inventory.  Our creative staff also can assist in the development of marketing presentations, demonstrations and strategies to attract new clients.
Construction and Operation
We typically own the physical structures on which our clients’ advertising copy is displayed.  We manage the construction of our structures centrally and erect them on sites we either lease or own or for which we have acquired permanent easements.  The site lease terms generally range from one to 20 years.  In addition to the site lease, we must obtain a permit to build new signs or convert existing signs to digital format.  Permits are typically granted in perpetuity by the state and/or local government and typically are transferable or renewable for a minimal, or no, fee. Printed bulletin and poster advertising copy is primarily printed with computer generated graphics on a single sheet of vinyl supplied by the advertiser.  These advertisements are then transported to the site and wrapped around the face of the site or affixed to a hardware anchoring system on the display site.  The operational process also includes conducting visual inspections of the inventory for display defects and taking the necessary corrective action within a reasonable period of time. 
Client Categories
In 2018, the top five client categories in our Americas outdoor segment were business services, retail, media, healthcare/medical and banking/financial services.
Competition
The outdoor advertising industry in the Americas is fragmented, consisting of several large companies involved in outdoor advertising, such as OUTFRONT Media Inc. and Lamar Advertising Company, as well as numerous smaller and local companies operating a limited number of displays in a single market or a few local markets.  We also compete with other advertising media in our respective markets, including broadcast and cable television, radio, print media, direct mail, mobile, social media, Internet and other forms of advertisement.  Outdoor advertising companies compete primarily based on ability to reach consumers, which is driven by location of the display.
International Outdoor Advertising
Our International outdoor business segment includes our operations in Europe, Asia and Latin America.  As of December 31, 2018, we owned or operated more than 380,000 displays across 22 countries.
Our International outdoor assets consist of street furniture, billboards, transit displays, retail displays, public bike programs and other spectaculars, which we own or operate under lease or license agreements. Our International business is focused on densely-populated metropolitan areas.

Strategy
Similar to our Americas outdoor advertising business, we believe our International outdoor advertising business has attractive industry fundamentals, including the ability to reach a broad audience and drive foot traffic to the point-of-sale, making outdoor a cost-effective medium for advertisers as measured by cost per thousand persons reached compared to other traditional media.  Our International business focuses on the following strategies:
Promote Overall Outdoor Media Spending.  Our strategy is to promote growth in outdoor advertising’s share of total media spending by demonstrating the strength of our medium.  We believe that outdoor advertising is strongly positioned to compete with other media, in particular traditional content-based media such as press, TV, radio and magazines, whose audiences are fragmenting to online sources of that content, as well as competing with Internet media channels. As part of our effort to promote growth in outdoor advertising’s share of total media, we are focusing on developing and implementing improved outdoor audience delivery measurement systems (such as our C.A.S.T. system in France) to provide advertisers with tools to plan their campaigns and determine how effectively their message is reaching the desired audience.
Differentiate on Sales and Marketing. For over five years, we have spent time and resources building commercial capabilities through a company-wide sales force effectiveness program and an upgrade in our sales and marketing talent. These capabilities allow us to build and nurture relationships with our clients and their agencies as well as to offer packages and products that meet our clients’ advertising needs. Going forward, areas of focus include pricing, packaging and programmatic selling; in particular pricing and packaging models that leverage the capabilities and benefits of digital display networks. Expanding our proprietary programmatic platform, which enables marketers to buy their out-of-home inventory in audience-based packages, giving them the ability to manage their campaigns on a self-service basis. 
Capital Allocation. A core element of our capital allocation strategy focuses on the digitization of our network. Our digital displays are a dynamic medium, which enables our customers to engage in real-time, tactical, topical and flexible advertising. We will continue our focused and dedicated digital strategy and remain committed to the development of digital out-of-home communication solutions. Through our digital brands, including Clear Channel Play and Adshel Live, we are able to offer networks of digital displays in multiple formats and multiple environments including bus shelters, billboards, airports, transit, malls and flagship locations. Part of our long-term strategy is to pursue the diversification of our product offering by introducing technologies, such as beacons, small cells, wayfinding stations and provision of Wi-Fi in our street furniture network, as additions to traditional methods of displaying our clients’ advertisements.
Capitalize on Product and Geographic Opportunities. We are also focused on growing our relevance to our advertising customers by continuously optimizing our display portfolio and targeting investments in promising market segments. We have continued to innovate and introduce new products in our markets—such as the digital telephone kiosks in the United Kingdom (the "U.K."). Our street furniture business generates the largest portion of our revenue and that is where we plan to focus much of our investment. We plan to continue to evaluate municipal contracts that may come up for bid and will make prudent investments where we believe we can generate attractive returns.
Sources of Revenue
Our International outdoor segment generated 24%, 23% and 24% of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.  Our International outdoor display inventory consists primarily of street furniture displays, billboards, transit displays and other out-of-home advertising displays. The following table shows the approximate percentage of revenue derived from each inventory category of our International outdoor segment:

 | Year Ended December 31,
 | 2018 | | 2017 | | 2016
Street furniture displays | 52 | % | | 51 | % | 52 | %
Billboards | 18 | % | | 20 | % | 20 | %
Transit displays | 11 | % | | 10 | % | 9 | %
Other(1) | 19 | % | | 19 | % | 19 | %
Total | 100 | % | | 100 | % | 100 | %


(1) | Includes advertising revenue from retail displays, other small displays, and non-advertising revenue from sales of street furniture equipment, cleaning and maintenance services, operation of public bike programs and production revenue.

Our International outdoor segment generates the majority of its revenue from the sale of advertising space on street furniture displays, billboards, retail displays and transit displays. Similar to our Americas outdoor business, advertising rates generally are based on the gross ratings points of a display or group of displays. In some of the countries where we have operations, the number of impressions delivered by a display is weighted to account for such factors as illumination, proximity to other displays and the speed and viewing angle of approaching traffic.
While location, price and availability of displays are important competitive factors, we believe that providing quality customer service and establishing strong client relationships are also critical components of sales.  Our entrepreneurial culture allows local management to operate their markets as separate profit centers, encouraging customer cultivation and service.
Street Furniture Displays
Our International street furniture displays, available in printed and digital formats, are substantially similar to their Americas street furniture counterparts, and include bus shelters, freestanding units, various types of kiosks, telephone boxes and other public structures.  Internationally, contracts with municipal and transit authorities for the right to place our street furniture in the public domain and sell advertising on such street furniture typically provide for terms ranging up to 15 years. The major difference between our International and Americas street furniture businesses is in the nature of the municipal contracts.  In our International outdoor business, these contracts typically require us to provide the municipality with a broader range of metropolitan amenities such as bus shelters with or without advertising panels, information kiosks and public wastebaskets, as well as space for the municipality to display maps or other public information.  In exchange for providing such metropolitan amenities and display space, we are authorized to sell advertising space on certain sections of the structures we erect in the public domain.  We pay the municipality or transit authority a fee or revenue share that is either a fixed amount or a percentage of the revenue derived from the street furniture displays. Typically, these revenue sharing arrangements include payments by us of minimum guaranteed amounts. Our International print street furniture is typically sold to clients as network packages of multiple street furniture displays, with contract terms ranging from one to two weeks. Due to its dynamic and real time delivery capabilities, digital street furniture can be sold flexibly, allowing advertisers to buy solutions on a ‘play and impact’ audience-based model to reach and engage their audiences with dynamic, contextually relevant and targeted messages.
Billboards
The sizes of our International billboards are not standardized.  The billboards vary in both format and size across our networks, with the majority of our International billboards being similar in size to our posters used in our Americas outdoor business. 
Our billboard inventory is primarily comprised of premium billboards and classic billboards and is available in printed and digital formats.

• | Premium. Digital premium billboards allow advertisers to dynamically change messages throughout the course of a day to more effectively target and engage audiences in key locations and may display advertisements for multiple customers. Our electronic displays are linked through centralized computer systems to instantaneously and simultaneously change messages throughout the course of a day. Because of their greater size, impact, high frequency and 24-hour advertising changes, digital premium billboards typically deliver our highest rates. Almost all of the advertising copy displayed on printed premium billboards is digitally-printed and transported to the billboard where it is secured to the display surface. Premium billboards generally are located along major expressways, primary commuting routes and main intersections that are highly visible and heavily trafficked. Our clients may contract for individual billboards or a network of billboards.


• | Classic. Digital and printed classic billboards are available in a variety of formats across our markets. Similar to digital premium billboards, classic digital billboards are linked through centralized computer systems to instantaneously and simultaneously change messages throughout the course of a day. Advertising copy for printed classic billboards is digitally printed then transported and secured to the poster surfaces. Classic billboards generally are located in commercial areas on primary and secondary routes near point-of-purchase locations, facilitating advertising campaigns with greater demographic targeting than those displayed on premium billboards. Classic billboards typically deliver lower rates than our premium billboards. Our intent is to combine the creative impact of premium billboards with the additional reach and frequency of classic billboards.

Our billboards are primarily sold to clients as network packages with contract terms typically ranging from one to two weeks. Long-term client contracts are also available and typically have terms of up to one year. We lease the majority of our billboard sites from private landowners, usually for one to ten years.
11

Transit Displays
Our International transit display contracts are substantially similar to their Americas transit display counterparts.  They are advertising surfaces on various types of vehicles or within transit systems, including on the interior and exterior sides of buses, trains, trams and within the common areas of rail stations and airports, and are available in both printed and digital formats. Similar to street furniture, contracts for the right to place our displays on such vehicles or within such transit systems and to sell advertising space on them generally are awarded by public transit authorities in competitive bidding processes or are negotiated with private transit operators. Contracts with public transit authorities or private transit operators typically have terms ranging from two to five years. Our client contracts for transit displays, either printed or digital, generally have terms ranging from one week to one year, or longer. Due to its dynamic and real time delivery capabilities, digital transit can be sold flexibly, allowing advertisers to buy solutions on a ‘play and impact’ audience-based model to reach and engage their audiences with dynamic, contextually relevant and targeted messages.
Retail Displays
Our retail displays are mainly standalone advertising structures in or in close proximity to retail outlets such as malls and supermarkets. The right to place our displays in these locations and to sell advertising space on them generally is awarded by retail outlet operators such as large retailers or mall operators either through private tenders or bilateral negotiations. Upfront investment and ongoing maintenance costs vary across contracts. Contracts with mall operators and retailers generally have terms ranging from three to ten years. Our client contracts for retail displays, either printed or digital, generally have terms ranging from one week to two weeks. Due to its dynamic and real time delivery capabilities, digital retail displays can be sold flexibly, allowing advertisers to buy solutions on a ‘play and impact’ audience-based model to reach and engage their audiences with dynamic, contextually relevant and targeted messages.
Other International Displays and Services
The balance of our revenue from our International outdoor segment consists primarily of advertising revenue from other small displays and non-advertising revenue from sales of street furniture equipment, cleaning and maintenance services and production and creative services revenue.  Our International inventory includes other small displays that are counted as separate displays since they form a substantial part of our network and International outdoor advertising revenue.  We also have a public bicycle rental program which provides bicycles for rent to the general public in several municipalities.  In exchange for operating these bike rental programs, we generally derive revenue from advertising rights to the bikes, bike stations, additional street furniture displays, and/or a share of rental income from the local municipalities.  In several of our International markets, we sell equipment or provide cleaning and maintenance services as part of street furniture contracts with municipalities.
Advertising Inventory and Markets
As of December 31, 2018, we owned or operated more than 380,000 displays in our International outdoor segment, with operations across 22 countries.  Our International outdoor display count includes display faces, which may include multiple faces on a single structure, as well as small, individual displays.  As a result, our International outdoor display count is not comparable to our Americas outdoor display count, which includes only unique displays.  No one property is significant to our overall operations.  We believe that our properties are in good condition and suitable for our operations.
Production
The majority of our International clients are advertisers targeting national or regional audiences whose business generally is placed with us through media or advertising agencies. These agencies often provide to our International clients creative services to design and produce the advertising copy, which is delivered to us either in digital format or in the traditional format of physical printed advertisements. For digital advertising campaigns, the digital advertisement is received by our content management system and is then distributed to our digital displays. For traditional advertising campaigns, the printed advertisement - whether in paper or vinyl - is shipped to centralized warehouses operated by us or third parties. The copy is then sorted and delivered to sites where it is installed on our displays.
12

Construction and Operation
The International manufacturing process largely consists of two elements: (1) the manufacture and installation of advertising structures and (2) the weekly preparation of advertising posters for distribution throughout our networks. We generally outsource the manufacturing of advertising structures to third parties and regularly seek competitive bids. We use a wide range of suppliers located in many of our markets, although much of our inventory is manufactured in China and the U.K. The design of street furniture structures (such as bus shelters, bicycle racks and kiosks) is typically done in conjunction with a third party supplier. Our street furniture sites are posted by our own employees or subcontractors who also clean and maintain the sites. The decision to use our own employees or subcontractors is made on a market-by-market basis taking into consideration the mix of products in the market and local labor costs. Digital displays generally use LCD or LED technology. The manufacture and installation process is generally the same as for traditional sites, however, specialist suppliers are used to supply the LED tiles or LCD screen displays, and there may be additional factors, such as electrical supply and network connectivity, involved during design and construction.
Client Categories
In 2018, the top five client categories in our International segment were retail, telecommunications, Internet/E-Commerce, food/food products and entertainment.
Competition
The international outdoor advertising industry is highly competitive, consisting of several large companies involved in outdoor advertising, such as JCDecaux SA and Global Media & Entertainment (who recently acquired ExterionMedia (UK) Limited), as well as numerous smaller and local companies operating a limited number of displays in a single market or a few local markets.  We also compete with other advertising media in our respective markets, including broadcast and cable television, radio, print media, direct mail, Internet, mobile and other forms of advertisement.  Outdoor companies compete primarily based on ability to reach consumers, which is driven by location of the display.
Our business requires us to obtain and renew contracts with municipalities and other governmental entities, which frequently require us to participate in competitive bidding processes at each renewal. Many of these contracts typically have terms ranging up to 15 years and have revenue share, capital expenditure requirements and/or fixed payment components. Competitive bidding processes are complex and sometimes lengthy.  Substantial costs may be incurred in connection with preparing bids for such processes. Our competitors, individually or through relationships with third parties, may be able to provide municipalities with different or greater capabilities or prices or benefits than we can provide. In the past we have not, and most likely in the future will not, be awarded all of the contracts on which we bid. There can be no assurance that we will win any particular bid, or that we will be able to replace any revenues lost upon expiration or completion of a contract. Our inability to renew existing contracts can also result in significant expenses from the removal of our displays. Furthermore, if and when we do obtain a contract, we are generally required to incur significant start-up expenses. The costs of bidding on contracts and the start-up costs associated with new contracts we may obtain may significantly reduce our cash flow and liquidity. The success of our business also depends generally on our ability to obtain and renew contracts with private landlords.
Other
Our Other category includes our media representation firm, Katz Media, which is ancillary to our other businesses.
Katz Media, a leading media representation firm in the U.S. for radio and television stations, sells national spot advertising time for clients in the radio and television industries.  As of December 31, 2018, Katz Media represented more than 3,000 radio stations and more than 800 television and digital multicast stations throughout the United States.
Katz Media generates revenue primarily through contractual commissions realized from the sale of national spot and online advertising.  National spot advertising is commercial airtime sold to advertisers on behalf of radio and television stations.  Katz Media represents its media clients pursuant to media representation contracts, which typically have terms ranging from 3 to 5 years in length.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately 14,000 domestic employees and approximately 4,300 international employees, of which approximately 16,700 were in direct operations and 1,600 were in administrative or corporate related activities.  Approximately 800 of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements in their respective countries. We are a party to numerous collective bargaining agreements, none of which represent a significant number of employees.  We believe that our relationship with our union and non-union employees is good.

Outdoor Industry
We also compete with other advertising media in our respective markets, including broadcast and cable television, radio, print media, direct mail, mobile, social media, online and other forms of advertisement. Because we do not use content to attract audiences, we believe we are not subject to the same headwinds as many other media. According to data published by Magna Global, since the emergence of the Internet in the late 1990s, online advertising has gained market share from traditional content-based mediums. Initially, online advertising gained market share mostly from newspapers and magazines, but more recently it has also gained market share from television in some markets, as the Internet has begun to provide alternative sources of content. We believe the outdoor advertising industry is relatively distinct because it does not rely on content, such as news, television shows or editorials, to attract an audience and then interrupt that content with advertising messages. According to data published by Magna Global, throughout the Internet-driven transformation of the advertising ecosystem, outdoor advertising has been relatively immune to fragmentation of audiences, maintaining its share of the market. We anticipate that, while the proliferation of content and distribution models will continue to fragment content-based media audiences, outdoor advertising’s distinct model will remain relatively immune to this trend. According to Magna Global, outdoor advertising’s compounded annual growth rate is expected to be 2.8% between 2019 and 2023.
Outdoor advertising’s share of the advertising market varies by country based on a number of factors, including regulation, sophistication, sociocultural aspects and historic media buying trends. Historically, outdoor advertising has had a larger market share in Western Europe (approximately 8% of the media mix, excluding search advertising, according to Magna Global) than in the United States (approximately 5%, excluding search advertising, according to Magna Global). We believe this is the result of the more urban nature of the outdoor advertising market in Europe.
Regulation of our iHeartMedia Business
General
The following is a brief summary of certain statutes, regulations, policies and proposals affecting our iHM business.  For example, radio broadcasting is subject to the jurisdiction of the FCC under the Communications Act.  The Communications Act permits the operation of a radio broadcast station only under a license issued by the FCC upon a finding that grant of the license would serve the public interest, convenience and necessity.  Among other things, the Communications Act empowers the FCC to: issue, renew, revoke and modify broadcasting licenses; assign frequency bands for broadcasting; determine stations’ frequencies, locations, power and other technical parameters; impose penalties for violation of its regulations, including monetary forfeitures and, in extreme cases, license revocation; impose annual regulatory and application processing fees; and adopt and implement regulations and policies affecting the ownership, program content, employment practices and many other aspects of the operation of broadcast stations.
This summary does not comprehensively cover all current and proposed statutes, regulations and policies affecting our iHM business.  Reference should be made to the Communications Act and other relevant statutes, regulations, policies and proceedings for further information concerning the nature and extent of regulation of our iHM business.  Finally, several of the following matters are now, or may become, the subject of court litigation, and we cannot predict the outcome of any such litigation or its impact on our iHM business.
License Assignments
The Communications Act prohibits the assignment of a license or the transfer of control of an FCC licensee without prior FCC approval.  Applications for license assignments or transfers involving a substantial change in ownership are subject to a 30-day period for public comment, during which petitions to deny the application may be filed and considered by the FCC.
License Renewal
The FCC grants broadcast licenses for a term of up to eight years.  The FCC will renew a license for an additional eight-year term if, after consideration of the renewal application and any objections thereto, it finds that the station has served the public interest, convenience and necessity and that, with respect to the station seeking renewal, there have been no serious violations of either the Communications Act or the FCC’s rules and regulations by the licensee and no other such violations which, taken together, constitute a pattern of abuse.  The FCC may grant the license renewal application with or without conditions, including renewal for a term less than eight years.  The vast majority of radio licenses are renewed by the FCC for the full eight-year term.  While we cannot guarantee the grant of any future renewal application, our stations’ licenses historically have been renewed for the full eight-year term.
14

Ownership Regulation
FCC rules and policies define the interests of individuals and entities, known as “attributable” interests, which implicate FCC rules governing ownership of broadcast stations.  Under these rules, attributable interests generally include: (1) officers and directors of a licensee and of its direct and indirect parents; (2) general partners; (3) limited partners and limited liability company members, unless properly “insulated” from management activities; (4) a 5% or more direct or indirect voting stock interest in a corporate licensee or parent, except that, for a narrowly defined class of passive investors, the attribution threshold is a 20% or more voting stock interest; and (5) combined equity and debt interests in excess of 33% of a licensee’s total asset value, if the interest holder provides over 15% of the licensee station’s total weekly programming, or has an attributable same-service (radio or television) broadcast interest in the same market (the “EDP Rule”).  An entity that owns one or more radio stations in a market and programs more than 15% of the broadcast time, or sells more than 15% per week of the advertising time, on a radio station in the same market is generally deemed to have an attributable interest in that station.
Debt instruments, non-voting corporate stock, minority voting stock interests in corporations having a single majority stockholder, and properly insulated limited partnership and limited liability company interests generally are not subject to attribution unless such interests implicate the EDP Rule.  To the best of our knowledge at present, none of our officers, directors or 5% or greater stockholders holds an interest in another broadcast station that is inconsistent with the FCC’s ownership rules.
The current FCC ownership rules relevant to our business are summarized below.

• | Local Radio Ownership Rule. The maximum allowable number of radio stations that may be commonly owned in a market is based on the size of the market. In markets with 45 or more stations, one entity may have an attributable interest in up to eight stations, of which no more than five are in the same radio service (AM or FM). In markets with 30-44 stations, one entity may have an attributable interest in up to seven stations, of which no more than four are in the same service. In markets with 15-29 stations, one entity may have an attributable interest in up to six stations, of which no more than four are in the same service. In markets with 14 or fewer stations, one entity may have an attributable interest in up to five stations, of which no more than three are in the same service, so long as the entity does not have an interest in more than 50% of all stations in the market. To apply these ownership tiers, the FCC relies on Nielsen Metro Survey Areas, where they exist, and a signal contour-overlap methodology where they do not exist. An FCC rulemaking is pending to determine how to define radio markets for stations located outside Nielsen Metro Survey Areas. 


• | Newspaper-Broadcast Cross-Ownership Rule. FCC rules formerly prohibited an individual or entity from having an attributable interest in either a radio or television station and a daily newspaper located in the same market. As noted below, the FCC has adopted an order eliminating this prohibition, although the order remains subject to pending court appeals.


• | Radio-Television Cross-Ownership Rule. FCC rules formerly limited the common ownership of television same-market radio stations. As noted below, the FCC has adopted an order eliminating limitations on radio-television cross-ownership, although the order remains subject to pending court appeals. 

The FCC is required to conduct periodic reviews of its media ownership rules. In August 2016, the FCC concluded its 2010 and 2014 quadrennial reviews with a decision retaining the local radio ownership rules, the radio-television cross-ownership rule and the prohibition on newspaper-broadcast cross-ownership without significant change. In November 2017, however, the FCC adopted an order reconsidering the August 2016 decision and modifying it in a number of respects. The November 2017 order on reconsideration did not significantly modify the August 2016 decision with respect to the local radio ownership limits. It did, however, eliminate the FCC's previous limits on radio-television cross-ownership and newspaper-broadcast cross-ownership. These rule changes became effective on February 7, 2018, but the November 2017 order on reconsideration has been appealed. In December 2018, the FCC commenced its 2018 quadrennial review of its media ownership regulations. Among other things, the FCC is seeking comment on all aspects of the local radio ownership rule’s implementation and whether the current version of the rule remains necessary in the public interest. We cannot predict the outcome of the FCC's media ownership proceedings or their effects on our business in the future.
Irrespective of the FCC's media ownership rules, the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice ("DOJ") and the U.S. Federal Trade Commission ("FTC") have the authority to determine that a particular transaction presents antitrust concerns. In particular, where the proposed purchaser already owns one or more radio stations in a particular market and seeks to acquire radio stations in that market, the DOJ has, in some cases, obtained consent decrees requiring radio station divestitures.
15

Alien Ownership Restrictions
The Communications Act restricts foreign entities or individuals from owning or voting more than 20% of the equity of a broadcast licensee directly.  It also restricts foreign entities or individuals from owning or voting more than 25% of a licensee’s equity indirectly (i.e., through a parent company), unless the FCC has made a finding that greater indirect foreign ownership is in the public interest. Since we serve as a holding company for FCC licensee subsidiaries, we are effectively restricted from having more than one-fourth of our stock owned or voted directly or indirectly by foreign entities or individuals.  The FCC will entertain and authorize, on a case-by-case basis and upon a sufficient public interest showing, proposals to exceed the 25% foreign ownership limit in broadcasting holding companies.  In September 2016, the FCC adopted rules to simplify and streamline the process for requesting authority to exceed the 25% indirect foreign ownership limit and reformed the methodology that publicly-traded broadcasters may use to assess their compliance with the foreign ownership restrictions. 
Indecency Regulation
Federal law regulates the broadcast of obscene, indecent or profane material.  Legislation enacted by Congress provides the FCC with authority to impose fines of up to $325,000 per utterance with a cap of $3.0 million for any violation arising from a single act.  In June 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled on the appeals of several FCC indecency enforcement actions.  While setting aside the particular FCC actions under review on narrow due process grounds, the Supreme Court declined to rule on the constitutionality of the FCC’s indecency policies, and the FCC has since solicited public comment on those policies.  We have received, and may receive in the future, letters of inquiry and other notifications from the FCC concerning complaints that programming aired on our stations contains indecent or profane language.  We cannot predict the outcome of any outstanding or future letters of inquiry and notifications from the FCC or the nature or extent of future FCC indecency enforcement actions.
Equal Employment Opportunity
The FCC’s rules require broadcasters to engage in broad equal employment opportunity recruitment efforts, retain data concerning such efforts and report much of this data to the FCC and to the public via periodic reports filed with the FCC or placed in stations’ public files and websites.  Broadcasters could be sanctioned for noncompliance.
Technical Rules
Numerous FCC rules govern the technical operating parameters of radio stations, including permissible operating frequency, power and antenna height and interference protections between stations.  Changes to these rules could negatively affect the operation of our stations.  For example, in October 2015, the FCC proposed rules which could reduce the degree of interference protection afforded to certain of our AM radio stations that serve wide areas. The FCC is also considering the adoption of rules which may limit our ability to prevent interference by FM translators to the reception of our full-power radio stations.
Content, Licenses and Royalties
We must pay royalties to copyright owners of musical compositions (typically, songwriters and publishers) whenever we broadcast or stream musical compositions.  Copyright owners of musical compositions most often rely on intermediaries known as performing rights organizations (“PROs”) to negotiate licenses with copyright users for the public performance of their compositions, collect royalties under such licenses and distribute them to copyright owners. We have obtained public performance licenses from, and pay license fees to, the three major PROs in the United States, which are the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (“ASCAP”), Broadcast Music, Inc. (“BMI”) and SESAC, Inc. (“SESAC”).  There is no guarantee that a given songwriter or publisher will remain associated with ASCAP, BMI or SESAC or that additional PROs will not emerge.  In 2013, a new PRO was formed named Global Music Rights (“GMR”).  GMR has secured the rights to certain copyrights and is seeking to negotiate individual licensing agreements with radio stations for songs in its repertoire. GMR and the Radio Music License Committee, Inc. ("RMLC"), which negotiates music licensing fees with PROs on behalf of many U.S. radio stations, have instituted antitrust litigation against one another. The litigation is ongoing. The withdrawal of a significant number of musical composition copyright owners from the three established PROs; the emergence of one or more additional PROs; and the outcome of the GMR/RMLC litigation could impact, and in some circumstances increase, our royalty rates and negotiation costs.
To secure the rights to stream music content over the Internet, we also must obtain performance rights licenses and pay public performance royalties to copyright owners of sound recordings (typically, performing artists and record companies).  Under Federal statutory licenses, we are permitted to stream any lawfully released sound recordings and to make ephemeral reproductions of these recordings on our computer servers without having to separately negotiate and obtain direct licenses with each individual copyright owner as long as we operate in compliance with the rules of those statutory licenses and pay the applicable royalty rates to SoundExchange, the organization designated by the Copyright Royalty Board (“CRB”) to collect and distribute royalties under these statutory licenses.  Sound recordings fixed on or after February 15, 1972 are protected by federal copyright law.  Sound recording copyright owners have asserted that state law provides copyright protection for recordings fixed before that date (“pre-72 recordings”).  Sound recording copyright owners have sued radio broadcasters and digital audio transmission services (including

us) for unauthorized public performances and reproductions of pre-72 recordings under various state laws. In October 2018, federal legislation was signed into law that applies a statutory licensing regime to pre-72 recordings similar to that which governs post-72 recordings. Among other things, the new law extends remedies for copyright infringement to owners of pre-72 recordings when recordings are used without authorization. The new law creates a public performance right for pre-72 recordings streamed online that may increase our licensing costs.
The rates at which we pay royalties to copyright owners are privately negotiated or set pursuant to a regulatory process.  In addition, we have business arrangements directly with some copyright owners to receive deliveries of and, in some cases, to directly license their sound recordings for use in our Internet operations.  There is no guarantee that the licenses and associated royalty rates that currently are available to us will be available to us in the future.  Congress may consider and adopt legislation that would require us to pay royalties to sound recording copyright owners for broadcasting those recordings on our terrestrial radio stations. In addition, the CRB has issued a final determination establishing copyright royalty rates for the public performance and ephemeral reproduction of sound recordings by various non-interactive webcasters, including radio broadcasters that simulcast their terrestrial programming online, to apply to the period January 1, 2016-December 31, 2020 under the so-called webcasting statutory license.  A proceeding to establish the rates for 2021-2025 is expected to begin in 2019. Increased royalty rates could significantly increase our expenses, which could adversely affect our business.  Additionally, there are conditions applicable to the webcasting statutory license. Some, but not all, record companies have agreed to waive or provide limited relief from certain of these conditions under certain circumstances for set periods of time.  Some of these conditions may be inconsistent with customary radio broadcasting practices.
Other
Congress, the FCC and other government agencies and regulatory bodies may in the future adopt new laws, regulations and policies that could affect, directly or indirectly, the operation, profitability and ownership of our broadcast stations and Internet-based audio music services.  In addition to the regulations, proceedings and procedures noted above, such matters may include, for example:  proposals to impose spectrum use or other fees on FCC licensees; changes to the political broadcasting rules, including the adoption of proposals to provide free air time to candidates; restrictions on the advertising of certain products, such as beer and wine; frequency allocation, spectrum reallocations and changes in technical rules; and the adoption of significant new programming and operational requirements designed to increase local community-responsive programming and enhance public interest reporting requirements.
Regulation of our Americas and International Outdoor Advertising Businesses 
The outdoor advertising industry in the United States is subject to governmental regulation at the federal, state and local levels. These regulations may include, among others, restrictions on the construction, repair, maintenance, lighting, upgrading, height, size, spacing and location and permitting of and, in some instances, content of advertising copy being displayed on outdoor advertising structures.  In addition, international regulations have a significant impact on the outdoor advertising industry.  International regulation of the outdoor advertising industry can vary by municipality, region and country, but generally limits the size, placement, nature and density of out-of-home displays. Other regulations may limit the subject matter and language of out-of-home displays.
From time to time, legislation has been introduced in both the United States and foreign jurisdictions attempting to impose taxes on revenue from outdoor advertising or for the right to use outdoor advertising assets or for the privilege of engaging in the outdoor advertising business. Several jurisdictions have imposed such taxes as a percentage of our outdoor advertising revenue generated in that jurisdiction or based on the size the billboard and type of display technology.  In addition, some jurisdictions have taxed our personal property and leasehold interests in advertising locations using various valuation methodologies. We expect U.S. and foreign jurisdictions to continue to try to impose such taxes as a way of increasing revenue.  In recent years, outdoor advertising also has become the subject of targeted taxes and fees.  These laws may affect prevailing competitive conditions in our markets in a variety of ways.  Such laws may reduce our expansion opportunities or may increase or reduce competitive pressure from other members of the outdoor advertising industry.  No assurance can be given that existing or future laws or regulations, and the enforcement thereof, will not materially and adversely affect the outdoor advertising industry.  However, we contest laws and regulations that we believe unlawfully restrict our constitutional or other legal rights and may adversely impact the growth of our outdoor advertising business.
In the United States, federal law, principally the Highway Beautification Act (“HBA”), regulates outdoor advertising on Federal-Aid Primary, Interstate and National Highway Systems roads within the United States (“controlled roads”). The HBA regulates the size and placement of billboards, requires the development of state standards, mandates a state’s compliance program, promotes the expeditious removal of illegal signs and requires just compensation for takings on controlled roads.
To satisfy the HBA’s requirements, all states have passed billboard control statutes and regulations that regulate, among other things, construction, repair, maintenance, lighting, height, size, spacing and the placement and permitting of outdoor 
17

advertising structures.  We are not aware of any state that has passed control statutes and regulations less restrictive than the prevailing federal requirements on the federal highway system, including the requirement that an owner remove any non-grandfathered, non-compliant signs along the controlled roads, at the owner’s expense and without compensation.  Local governments generally also include billboard control as part of their zoning laws and building codes regulating those items described above and include similar provisions regarding the removal of non-grandfathered structures that do not comply with certain of the local requirements.  Some local governments have initiated code enforcement and permit reviews of billboards within their jurisdiction. In some instances we have had to remove billboards as a result of such reviews.
As part of their billboard control laws, state and local governments regulate the construction of new signs.  Some jurisdictions prohibit new construction, some jurisdictions allow new construction only to replace or relocate existing structures and some jurisdictions allow new construction subject to the various restrictions discussed above.  In certain jurisdictions, restrictive regulations also limit our ability to relocate, rebuild, repair, maintain, upgrade, modify or replace existing legal non-conforming billboards.
U.S. federal law neither requires nor prohibits the removal of existing lawful billboards, but it does mandate the payment of compensation if a state or other government agency or entity compels the removal of a lawful billboard along the controlled roads.  In the past, state governments have purchased and removed existing lawful billboards for beautification purposes using federal funding for transportation enhancement programs, and these jurisdictions may continue to do so in the future. From time to time, state and local government authorities use the power of eminent domain and amortization to remove billboards.  Amortization is the required removal of legal non-conforming billboards (billboards which conformed with applicable laws and regulations when built, but which do not conform to current laws and regulations) or the commercial advertising placed on such billboards after a period of years. Pursuant to this concept, the governmental body asserts that just compensation is earned by continued operation of the billboard over that period of time. Although amortization is prohibited along all controlled roads, amortization has been upheld along non-controlled roads in limited instances where permitted by state and local law. Thus far, we have been able to obtain satisfactory compensation for, or relocation of, our billboards purchased or removed as a result of these types of governmental action, although there is no assurance that this will continue to be the case in the future.
We have introduced and intend to expand the deployment of digital billboards that display static digital advertising copy from various advertisers that change up to several times per minute. We have encountered some existing regulations in the U.S. and across some international jurisdictions that restrict or prohibit these types of digital displays.  However, since digital technology for changing static copy has only recently been developed and introduced into the market on a large scale, and is in the process of being introduced more broadly in our international markets, existing regulations that currently do not apply to digital technology by their terms could be revised to impose greater restrictions. These regulations, or actions by third parties, may impose greater restrictions on digital billboards due to alleged concerns over aesthetics or driver safety.
Privacy and Data Protection
We obtain certain types of information from users of our technology platforms, including, without limitation, our websites, web pages, interactive features, applications, social media pages, and mobile application (“Platforms”), in accordance with the privacy policies and terms of use posted on the applicable Platform.  We collect personally identifiable information directly from Platform users in several ways, including when a user purchases our products or services, registers to use our services, fills out a listener profile, posts comments, uses our social networking features, participates in polls and contests and signs up to receive email newsletters.  We also may obtain information about our listeners from other listeners and third parties.  We use and share this information for a variety of business purposes including for analytics, attribution and advertising purposes. Outside our radio business, we collect personally identifiable information from our employees, from users of our public bike services, from our business partners and from consumers who interact with our digital panels, including the use of behavioral analysis software. In addition, we obtain anonymous and aggregated audience behavior information from third-party data providers who represent to us that they are compliant with applicable laws.
We are subject to a number of laws and regulations relating to consumer protection, information security, data protection and privacy.  Many of these laws and regulations are still evolving (such as the new California Consumer Privacy Act) and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business or limit the services we are able to offer.  In the area of information security and data protection, the laws in several states in the United States and most countries require companies to implement specific information security controls and legal protections to protect certain types of personally identifiable information.  Likewise, most states in the United States and most countries have laws in place requiring companies to notify users if there is a security breach that compromises certain categories of their personally identifiable information.  Any failure on our part to comply with these laws may subject us to significant liabilities.
We regularly review and implement commercially reasonable organizational and technical physical and electronic security measures that are designed to protect against the loss, misuse, and alteration of our listeners’, employees', clients' and customers' 
18

personally identifiable information and to protect our proprietary business information. In Europe, we have appointed a Chief Data Protection Officer with respect to our European outdoor businesses and are implementing a comprehensive legal and information security-led approach to compliance with the new European Union ("E.U.")-wide General Data Protection Regulation (the "GDPR") in line with our obligations and our risk profile.  Despite our best efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable.  Any failure or perceived failure by us to protect our information or information about our listeners, employees, clients and customers or to comply with our policies or applicable regulatory requirements could result in damage to our business and loss of confidence in us, damage to our brands, the loss of users of our services, including listeners, consumers, business partners and advertisers, as well as proceedings against us by governmental authorities or others, which could harm our business.
