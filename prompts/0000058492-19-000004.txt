Summary

Leggett & Platt, Incorporated was founded as a partnership in Carthage, Missouri in 1883 and was incorporated in 1901. The Company, a pioneer of the steel coil bedspring, has become an international diversified manufacturer that conceives, designs and produces a wide range of engineered components and products found in many homes, offices, automobiles and aircraft. As discussed below, our operations are organized into 15 business units, which are divided into ten groups under our four segments: Residential Products; Industrial Products; Furniture Products; and Specialized Products.
 Overview of Our Segments

Residential Products Segment

BEDDING GROUP 
U.S. Spring 
International Spring 
Specialty Foam 1 
FABRIC & FLOORING PRODUCTS GROUP

MACHINERY GROUP 
Machinery 


  1 Formed January 16, 2019, with the acquisition of Elite Comfort Solutions, Inc. (ECS)
Our Residential Products segment began in 1883 with the manufacture of steel coil bedsprings. Today, we supply a variety of components and machinery used by bedding manufacturers in the production and assembly of their finished products, as well as producing private-label finished mattresses for bedding brands. Our range of products offers our customers a single source for many of their component and finished product needs. We also produce or distribute carpet cushion, hard surface flooring underlayment, fabric, and geo components.
Innovative proprietary products and low cost have made us the largest U.S. manufacturer in many of these businesses. We strive to understand what drives consumer purchases in our markets and focus our product development activities on meeting end-consumer needs. We attain a cost advantage from efficient manufacturing methods, internal production of key raw materials, purchasing leverage, and large-scale production. Sourcing components from us allows our customers to focus on designing, merchandising and marketing their products. 
 On January 16, 2019, we completed the acquisition of ECS for cash consideration of approximately $1.25 billion. ECS, headquartered in Newnan, Georgia, is a leader in proprietary specialized foam technology, primarily for the bedding and furniture industries. With 16 facilities across the United States, ECS operates a vertically integrated model, developing many of the chemicals and additives used in foam production, producing specialty foam, and manufacturing private-label finished products. These innovative specialty foam products include finished mattresses sold through both traditional and

Strategic Direction

Primary Financial Metric

Total Shareholder Return (TSR), relative to peer companies, is a primary financial measure that we use to assess long-term performance. TSR = (Change in Stock Price + Dividends)/Beginning Stock Price. Our goal is to achieve TSR in the top third of the S&P 500 companies over rolling three-year periods through an approach that employs four TSR drivers: revenue growth, margin expansion, dividends, and share repurchases. 
Our incentive programs reward return generation and profitable growth. Senior executives participate in a TSR-based incentive program (based on our performance compared to a group of approximately 320 peers). 
For information about our TSR targets, see the discussion under "Total Shareholder Return" in Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations on page 29. 
Returning Cash to Shareholders

During the past three years, we generated $1.44 billion of operating cash, and we returned much of this cash to shareholders in the form of dividends ($557 million) and share repurchases ($468 million). Our top priorities for use of cash are organic growth (capital expenditures), dividends, and strategic acquisitions. Historically, after funding those priorities, we generally repurchased stock with remaining available cash. Currently, in connection with the ECS acquisition our debt levels increased, and we expect to focus on deleveraging by temporarily limiting share repurchases, reducing acquisition spending, and using operating cash flow to repay debt.
For information about dividends and share repurchases, see the discussion under "Pay Dividends" and "Repurchase Stock" in Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations beginning on page 44.

PART I

Portfolio Management

We utilize a rigorous strategic planning process to help guide decisions regarding business unit roles, capital allocation priorities, and areas in which to grow. We review the portfolio classification of each unit on an annual basis to determine its appropriate role (Grow, Core, Fix or Divest). This review includes criteria such as competitive position, market attractiveness, business unit size, and fit within our overall objectives, as well as financial indicators such as business unit return, growth of EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes), EBIT margin, EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization), and operating cash flows. Business units in the Grow category should provide avenues for profitable growth from competitively advantaged positions in attractive markets. Core business units are expected to enhance productivity, improve market share, and generate cash flow from operations while using minimal capital. To remain in the portfolio, business units are expected to consistently generate after-tax returns in excess of our cost of capital. Business units that fail to consistently attain minimum return goals will be moved to the Fix or Divest categories.
Disciplined Growth

We revised our TSR framework in 2016 to moderately increase the expected long-term contribution from revenue growth to 6-9% (from 4-5% previously). Over the last three years, the Company has generated combined unit volume and acquisition growth of 4% per year on average, but this growth was slightly offset by divestitures, commodity deflation and currency impact. 
Our long-term 6-9% annual revenue growth objective envisions periodic acquisitions. We primarily seek acquisitions within our Grow businesses, and look for opportunities to enter new, higher growth markets (carefully screened for sustainable competitive advantage). We expect all acquisitions to (a) have a clear strategic rationale, a sustainable competitive advantage, a strong fit with the Company, and be in an attractive and growing market; (b) create value by enhancing TSR; (c) for stand-alone businesses: generally possess annual revenue in excess of $50 million, strong management and future growth opportunities with a strong market position in a market growing faster than GDP; and (d) for bolt-on businesses: generally possess annual revenue in excess of $15 million, significant synergies, and a strategic fit with an existing business unit. With the consummation of the ECS acquisition, the Company expects to temporarily reduce acquisition spending and use its operating cash flow to repay debt. 
Acquisitions

2019
 On January 16, 2019, we completed the acquisition of Elite Comfort Solutions, Inc. (ECS) for cash consideration of approximately $1.25 billion. This business had revenues of $611 million for fiscal year ended September 2018. ECS is a leader in proprietary specialized foam technology, primarily for the bedding and furniture industries. ECS operates a vertically integrated model, developing many of the chemicals and additives used in foam production, producing specialty foam, and manufacturing private-label finished products. These innovative specialty foam products include finished mattresses sold through both traditional and online channels, mattress components, mattress toppers and pillows, and furniture foams. ECS operates as a new business unit titled Specialty Foam within the Residential Products segment.
 2018
 In January 2018, we acquired Precision Hydraulic Cylinders (PHC), a leading global manufacturer of
engineered hydraulic cylinders primarily for the materials handling market. The total consideration paid was $87 million. PHC serves a market of mainly large OEM customers utilizing highly engineered components with long product life-cycles that represent a small part of the end product’s cost. PHC represents a new growth platform and formed a new business group titled Hydraulic Cylinders within the Specialized Products segment.
 We also acquired two small Geo Components businesses for total consideration of $22 million. They manufacture and distribute silt fencing and home and garden products.

Distribution of Products

In each of our segments, we sell and distribute our products primarily through our own personnel. However, many of our businesses have relationships and agreements with outside sales representatives and distributors. We do not believe any of these agreements or relationships would, if terminated, have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition, operating cash flows or results of operations of the Company.
Raw Materials

The products we manufacture require a variety of raw materials. We believe that worldwide supply sources are readily available for all the raw materials we use. Among the most important are:

• | Various types of steel, including scrap, rod, wire, sheet and stainless
• | Chemicals used in foam production 
• | Foam scrap 
• | Woven and non-woven fabrics 
• | Titanium and nickel-based alloys and other high strength metals 

We supply our own raw materials for many of the products we make. For example, we produce steel rod that we make into steel wire, which we then use to manufacture:

• | Innersprings and foundations for mattresses 
• | Springs and seat suspensions for chairs and sofas
• | Automotive seating suspension systems 

We supply a substantial majority of our domestic steel rod requirements through our own rod mill. Our wire drawing mills supply nearly all of our U.S. requirements for steel wire.

Customer Concentration

We serve thousands of customers worldwide, sustaining many long-term business relationships. In 2018, our largest customer accounted for approximately 6% of our consolidated revenues. Our top 10 customers accounted for approximately 32% of these consolidated revenues. The loss of one or more of these customers could have a material adverse effect on the Company as a whole, or on the respective segment in which the customer’s sales are reported, including our Residential Products, Specialized Products and Furniture Products segments. 
Patents and Trademarks

The chart below shows the number of patents issued, patents in process, trademarks registered and trademarks in process held by our operations as of December 31, 2018. No single patent or group of patents, or trademark or group of trademarks, is material to our operations as a whole. Substantially all of our patents relate to products manufactured by the Specialized Products, Furniture Products, and Residential Products segments, while over half of our trademarks relate to products manufactured by the Residential Products segment. We had 1,427 patents issued and 598 in process, and 980 trademarks registered and 143 in process. 
In addition to the above patents and trademarks, in January 16, 2019, we added, through the ECS acquisition, intellectual property related to the protection of technology around various foam applications including specialty polyols and additives that enhance foam performance by reducing heat retention, improving durability and diminishing odor. 

13

PART I

Some of our most significant trademarks include: 

• | ComfortCore®, Mira-Coil®, VertiCoil®, Quantum®, Nanocoil®, Softech®, Lura-Flex®, Superlastic® and Active Support Technology® (mattress innersprings) 
• | Energex® Coolflow® (specialty foam products) 
• | Semi-Flex® (box spring components and foundations) 
• | Spuhl® (mattress innerspring manufacturing machines) 
• | Wall Hugger® (recliner chair mechanisms) 
• | Super Sagless® (motion and sofa sleeper mechanisms) 
• | No-Sag® (wire forms used in seating) 
• | LPSense® (capacitive sensing) 
• | Hanes® (fabric materials) 
• | Schukra®, Pullmaflex® and Flex-O-Lator® (automotive seating products) 
• | Gribetz® and Porter® (quilting and sewing machines) 

Product Development
One of our strongest performing product categories across the company is ComfortCore®, our fabric-encased innerspring coils used in hybrid and other mattresses.  Our ComfortCore® volume continues to grow, and represented over 45% of our total innerspring units by the end of 2018.  A growing number of our ComfortCore® innersprings contain a feature we call Quantum® Edge. These are narrow-diameter, fabric-encased coils that form a perimeter around a innerspring set, replacing foam in a finished mattress.  Over 35% of our ComfortCore® innersprings have the Quantum® Edge feature, and Quantum® Edge continues to grow.  We have also developed very low height ComfortCore® innersprings used as comfort layers in the top of mattresses that are a fast growing product.  In 2018, sales of these low height innersprings increased over 60%. We are investing in capacity and adding machinery, supplied by our Spuhl® operation, to support the growth in ComfortCore® and Quantum® Edge.
  With our January 2019 acquisition of Elite Comfort Solutions, Inc. (ECS), we gained important proprietary technologies in the production of specialty foams, primarily for the bedding and furniture industries.  ECS formulates many of the chemicals and additives used in foam production.  These branded, specialty polyols and additives enhance foam performance by reducing heat retention, improving durability and diminishing odor.  These innovations enable us to create quality mattresses that can be compressed, and we have a significant amount of intellectual property around these specialty chemical formulations.
Many of our other businesses are engaged in product development activities to protect our market position and support ongoing growth. 
Employees

At December 31, 2018, we had approximately 22,000 employees, of which 15,900 were engaged in production. Of the 22,000, approximately 12,500 were international employees (5,900 in China). Approximately 14% of our employees are represented by labor unions that collectively bargain for work conditions, wages or other issues. We did not experience any work stoppage related to contract negotiations with labor unions during 2018. Management is not aware of any circumstances likely to result in a material work stoppage related to contract negotiations with labor unions during 2019. We had approximately 8,200 employees in Specialized Products; 6,300 in Residential Products; 5,600 in Furniture Products; and 1,100 in Industrial Products.
14

PART I

At December 31, 2017, we had approximately 22,200 employees.
As previously disclosed, the Company acquired ECS on January 16, 2019. ECS had 980 employees on the acquisition date.
Competition

Many companies offer products that compete with those we manufacture and sell. The number of competing companies varies by product line, but many of the markets for our products are highly competitive. We tend to attract and retain customers through innovation, product quality, competitive pricing and customer service. Many of our competitors try to win business primarily on price but, depending upon the particular product, we experience competition based on quality and performance as well. In general, our competitors tend to be smaller, private companies. 
We believe we are the largest U.S.-based manufacturer, in terms of revenue, of the following:

• | Bedding components 
• | Automotive seat support and lumbar systems 
• | Specialty bedding foams and private-label finished mattresses
• | Components for home furniture and work furniture 
• | Flooring underlayment 
• | Adjustable beds 
• | High-carbon drawn steel wire 
• | Bedding industry machinery 

We continue to face pressure from foreign competitors as some of our customers source a portion of their components and finished products offshore. In addition to lower labor rates, foreign competitors benefit (at times) from lower raw material costs. They may also benefit from currency factors and more lenient regulatory climates. We typically remain price competitive, even versus many foreign manufacturers, as a result of our efficient operations, low labor content, vertical integration in steel and wire, logistics and distribution efficiencies, and large scale purchasing of raw materials and commodities. However, we have also reacted to foreign competition in certain cases by selectively adjusting prices, and by developing new proprietary products that help our customers reduce total costs.

PART I

For information about antidumping duty orders regarding innerspring, steel wire rod and mattress imports, please see "Competition" in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations on page 31.
Seasonality

As a diversified manufacturer, we generally have not experienced significant seasonality. However, unusual economic factors in any given year, along with acquisitions and divestitures, can create sales variability and obscure the underlying seasonality of our businesses. Historically, our operating cash flows are stronger in the fourth quarter primarily related to the timing of cash collections from customers and payments to vendors.
Backlog

Our customer relationships and our manufacturing and inventory practices do not create a material amount of backlog orders for any of our segments. Production and inventory levels are geared primarily to the level of incoming orders and projected demand based on customer relationships.
Working Capital Items

For information regarding working capital items, please see the discussion of "Cash from Operations" in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations on page 41.
Government Contracts

The Company does not have a material amount of sales derived from government contracts subject to renegotiation of profits or termination at the election of any government.
Environmental Regulation

Our operations are subject to federal, state, and local laws and regulations related to the protection of the environment. We have policies intended to ensure that our operations are conducted in compliance with applicable laws. While we cannot predict policy changes by various regulatory agencies, management expects that compliance with these laws and regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, capital expenditures, financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.
Internet Access to Information

We routinely post information for investors under the Investor Relations section of our website (www.leggett.com). Our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and all amendments to those reports are made available, free of charge, on our website as soon as reasonably practicable after electronically filed with, or furnished to, the SEC. In addition to these reports, the Company’s Financial Code of Ethics, Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, and Corporate Governance Guidelines, as well as charters for the Audit, Compensation, and Nominating & Corporate Governance Committees of our Board of Directors, can be found on our website under the Corporate Governance section. Information contained on our website does not constitute part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
