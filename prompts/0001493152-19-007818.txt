Item 1. Business 
Overview
 
We are a developing player in the mobile marketing and loyalty industry, providing cutting-edge mobile marketing solutions, rewards and loyalty to our clients. With a powerful yet intuitive suite of services, clients are able to reach more customers faster and reward them for repeat business. We help clients reach their marketing and revenue goals by educating clients with the most effective tools in mobile marketing, rewards, paperless redemption and loyalty.
 
In the past 4 years, we have grown to over 765 clients and more than 950 different locations in the United States and Canada. We have achieved this with an expanded focus on a variety of industries, including restaurants, retailers, entertainment venues and other partnership opportunities. We are looking to open new SMS markets in Europe and Asia based on new client relationships. We have decided to focus our energy on the gym, health and fitness club market. However, we are also working with Quick Service Restaurants (QSR), Beauty/Tanning salons, hospitality, entertainment, digital marketing and sporting events. Our new Smart Automated Messaging (SAM) platform is fully operational and has completely replaced our legacy software platform. The SAM platform has the capacity to bring on several thousand new clients while adding new functionality such as Rich Communication Services (RCS) and Artificial Intelligence (AI). We will be introducing RCS to SAM in April 2019 and the AI functionality in the second half of 2019.
 
Our new software platform provides a powerful nonintrusive and valued-added engagement tool capable of delivering more than one billion SMS per month. CIOReview Magazine recognized Textmunication as one of the “Top 20 Most Promising Digital Marketing Solution Providers” in its annual 2018 edition. We offer cutting-edge technology with upcoming solutions such as Rich Communication Services (RCS). We were chosen as an early adopter of RCS by a​leading mobile messaging provider, OpenMarket, which could create a paradigm shift in the text messaging world with rich images, videos, chat box features and multi-media in a single text.
 
We have built an advanced “Communication Platform as a Service” (CPaaS) backbone enabling developers to add real-time communication features in their own applications without needing to build backend infrastructure and interfaces. We are working to develop “Messaging as a Platform” (MaaP). A MaaP platform combines advanced messaging with standardized interfaces to plugins creating a richer experience for consumers, such as RCS. Textmunication is targeting its RCS solution for April 2019. Textmunication expanded its White Label program allowing companies of all sizes to implement an “out-of-the-box” solution “Powered by Textmunication”. In addition to White Label, the company offers standalone Application Programming Interfaces or APIs, integrated API solutions and non-integrated services.
 
API development is a major focus for 2019. We can produce a new API in 2-4 weeks for each new client. We now have 7 of the top 8 Health Club Management Software (CMS) companies using our integrated SMS fitness solution. There is no other automated health and fitness solution offering a completed end-to-end solution similar to ours. We now have access to more than 25,000 health clubs in North America and will focus on converting new clubs to our solution in the next 12 months.
 
By adding RCS and AI, we can add customer value and higher priced solutions to any vertical we are pursuing. The evolution of SMS into RCS will establish Textmunication as an innovator of new technology and upgraded services. We are pursuing AI assets to add to SAM which will establish us as a pure technology company with an advanced communication platform. We feel the transformation into a technology company with AI will open new revenue streams and add value to our technology assets.
 
We have also entered into the IT consulting business through our acquisition of a minority interest in Aspire Consulting, LLC. We plan to assist our controlling partner in the development of this consulting business in addition to improving the market position of our mobile marketing business.
 
Our principal executive office is located at 1940 Contra Costa Blvd. Pleasant Hill, CA 94523 and our telephone number is (925-777-2111).

Mobile Marketing Business
 
Principal Products and Services
 
We are an online mobile marketing platform service that will connect merchants with their customers and allow them to drive loyalty and repeat business in a non-intrusive, value added medium. We provide a mobile marketing platform where merchants can send customers the most up-to-date offers, discounts, alerts and events schedules, such as, for instance, happy hours, trivia night, and other campaigns. The consumer can also access specials and promotions that merchants choose to distribute through us by opting keywords designated to the merchant’s keywords. This allows consumers to take their information wherever they go and learn about the latest buzz as soon as it is available, providing the consumer with events, deals, and messages on their cellphone via SMS messaging. We are a mobile marketing platform that connects the mass consumer to the content that they crave – anywhere, anytime, through virtually any mobile device for all local events and promotions.
 
Our mobile marketing solutions apply to any industry, offering a new and innovative way to reach out to a merchant’s customer base. Some examples include:
 

● | Gyms – guest promotions, reminders, new rates, fitness tips; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Bars – happy hours, special events, discount pricing; 
● | Boutiques – invite only trunk show, spring sale, discount on a clothing line, carrying a new line of clothes; 
● | Dentists – special promotion for teeth whitening; 
● | Investor Relations – sending notifications to investors on news alerts and company updates; 
● | Digital Marketing – promoting marketing updates from global clients using SMS in their portfolio; 
● | Salons – promotion on products, new line of products, introducing a new stylist; 
● | Restaurants – Dine about town participation, discount coupons; and 
● | Real Estate Agents – Introducing a new home on the market, price reduction, or an open house event. 

 
Additionally, we are a mobile marketing platform that allows merchants to get more impact out of their promotions. Our merchants will be able to recommend promotions to their customers proactively, which will help merchants increase foot traffic and revenue. Utilizing the information that is being collected, our merchants can better target their clients. This system empowers merchants and enables them to adjust programs at a moment’s notice.
 
Our Focus
 
We began providing SMA text advertising in 2009 to small businesses, including bars, salons, restaurants and medical professionals. We have changed our strategy and decided that instead of directing our energy on smaller businesses we will focus on larger chain and franchise businesses in the Gym, Health and Fitness Club market place offering unique automated solutions to help clubs communicate with their members and increase membership. In order to entrench ourselves as firmly as possible in this marketplace we have add-on service provided with companies that provide billing solutions to the Gym, Health & Fitness Club market place. We now have relationships with the following Gym, Health & Fitness Club billing providers: ASF Payment Solutions, ClubSystems, ABC Financial, Motionsoft, Paramount Acceptance and Jonas Fitness. These sources have access to a combined 17,000 gyms and fitness centers.
 
Below is a list of services that we intend to perform for the health and fitness industry:
 
SMS Texting
 
New Sales:
 

● | Leads/Inquiries (e.g., Text gym to 87365 for a 7-day pass) 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | Referrals/Referral programs 
● | Gym locator & directions (e.g., find your nearest club Text zip code to 87365)

--+--------------------------------------------------
● | Cancelled accounts (automated) 
● | Surveys/feedback 
● | Expired credit card notifications (automated) 

 
Our goal is to partner with the industry leading enterprise software providers to the Health and Fitness Industry. We believe the top five enterprise software providers in the health and fitness industry account for more than 50% of the total gyms and fitness centers worldwide. By integrating our web-based platform into the existing infrastructure of an enterprise software provider, we can then uniquely market our service to gyms and fitness centers on a ‘turnkey’ basis. We believe this provides a significant competitive advantage to us. Our monthly billing rates range between $49-$299 per club. Over the next 24 months our goal is to become an add-on component to the billing features of at least 50% of the gym billing providers so that we can attract as many as 5,000 Gym, Health & Fitness clubs in the US. We then intend to expand internationally where there are as many as 165,000 Gyms, Health & Fitness clubs as of 2013. In addition, we plan on utilizing the same strategy in the salon, entertainment, hospitality, sporting event and healthcare markets. We are also looking at new technologies and services such as Rich Communication Services (RCS) which will help us expand our leadership in the health and fitness market.

Textmunication has positioned itself as the SMS mobile marketing leader in both the fitness and salon markets. By integrating with software management systems, the clubs and salons using the software platform will have the SMS option easily available to them. Our new White Label program takes our strategic partnerships to the next level. Our White Label program is owned by our partners on the front-end while we support the technology and database. This provides a solution controlled by our partners allowing for more visibility to their end clients.
Marketing Plan and Personnel
 
The goal is to build engaging content for potential clients to make it clear what we do and that we excel at it.

Competition
 
In the past few years, the number of mobile marketing options and companies have grown rapidly. The markets for the products and services that we offer are very competitive, are rapidly evolving and have relatively low barriers to entry. We compete with all general advertising and marketing companies who eventually will want to include mobile marketing in their suite of product offerings, and who may develop their own similar products and compete with us for market share. These potential competitors may have more mature lines of distribution than us, be better financed than us, or may create a product offering that is superior to ours. Any of these factors can cause a competitor to take market share away from us or otherwise substantially hurt our business. We believe that competition in our market is based predominantly on:

● | Price; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------
● | Brand recognition; 
● | Product and service components and deliverables; 
● | Track record of creating and keeping satisfied clients; 
● | Success of underlying marketing programs; and 
● | Order delivery performance and customer service. 

Government Regulation
 
We are subject to a number of laws and regulations that affect companies generally and specifically those conducting business in the mobile messaging market, many of which are still evolving and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business. Existing and future laws and regulations may impede our growth. These regulations and laws may cover online marketing, e-mail marketing, telemarketing, taxation, privacy, data protection, pricing, content, copyrights, distribution, mobile communications, electronic contracts and other communications, consumer protection, web services, the provision of online payment services, unencumbered internet access to our services, the design and operation of websites, and the characteristics and quality of products and services. It is not clear how existing laws governing issues such as property ownership, libel, and personal privacy apply to the internet, e-commerce, digital content, and web services. Unfavorable regulations and laws could diminish the demand for our products and services and increase our cost of doing business.
 
We expect that the regulation of our industry generally will continue to increase and that we will be required to devote increasing amounts of legal and other resources to address this regulation. In addition, the application of existing domestic and international laws and regulations relating to issues such as user privacy and data protection, marketing, advertising, consumer protection and mobile disclosures in many instances is unclear or unsettled.
 
In addition to its regulation of wireless telecommunications providers generally, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission, or FCC, has examined, or is currently examining, how and when consumers enroll in mobile services, what types of disclosures consumers receive, what services consumers are purchasing and how much consumers are charged. In addition, the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, has been asked to regulate how mobile marketers can use consumers’ personal information. Consumer advocates claim that many consumers do not know when their information is being collected from cell phones and how such information is retained, used and shared with other companies. Consumer groups have asked the FTC to: identify practices that may compromise privacy and consumer welfare; examine opt-in procedures to ensure consumers are aware of what data is at issue and how it will be used; investigate marketing tactics that target children; and create policies to halt abusive practices. The FTC has expressed interest in particular in the mobile environment and services that collect sensitive data, such as location-based information.
 
The principal laws and regulations that pertain to us and our customers in connection with their utilization of our platform, include:
 

● | Deceptive Trade Practice Law in the U.S. The FTC and state attorneys general are given broad powers by legislatures to curb unfair and deceptive trade practices. These laws and regulations apply to mobile marketing campaigns and behavioral advertising. The general guideline is that all material terms and conditions of the offer must be “clearly and conspicuously” disclosed to the consumer prior to the buying decision. The balancing of the desire to capture a potential customer’s attention, while providing adequate disclosure, can be challenging in the mobile context due to the lack of screen space available to provide required disclosures. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Behavioral Advertising. Behavioral advertising is a technique used by online publishers and advertisers to increase the effectiveness of their campaigns. Behavioral advertising uses information collected from an individual’s web-browsing behavior, such as the pages they have visited or the searches they have made, to select which advertisements to display to that individual. This data can be valuable for online marketers looking to personalize advertising initiatives or to provide geo-tags through mobile devices. Many businesses adhere to industry self-governing principles, including an opt-out regime whereby information may be collected until an individual indicates that he or she no longer agrees to have this information collected. The FTC is considering regulations in this area, which may include implementation of a more rigorous opt-in regime. An opt-in policy would prohibit businesses from collecting and using information from individuals who have not voluntarily consented. Among other things, the implementation of an opt-in regime could require substantial technical support and negatively impact the market for our mobile advertising products and services. A few states have also introduced bills in recent years that would restrict behavioral advertising within the state. These bills would likely have the practical effect of regulating behavioral advertising nationwide because of the difficulties behind implementing state-specific policies or identifying the location of a particular consumer. There have also been a large number of class action suits filed against companies engaged in behavioral advertising.

● | Behavioral Advertising-Privacy Regulation. Our business is affected by U.S. federal and state laws and regulations governing the collection, use, retention, sharing and security of data that we receive from and about our users. In recent years, regulation has focused on the collection, use, disclosure and security of information that may be used to identify or that actually identifies an individual, such as an Internet Protocol address or a name. Although the mobile and Internet advertising privacy practices are currently largely self-regulated in the U.S., the FTC has conducted numerous discussions on this subject and suggested that more rigorous privacy regulation is appropriate, including regulation of non-personally identifiable information which could, with other information, be used to identify an individual. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Marketing-Privacy Regulation. In addition, there are U.S. federal and state laws that govern SMS and telecommunications-based marketing, generally requiring senders to transmit messages (including those sent to mobile devices) only to recipients who have specifically consented to receiving such messages. U.S. federal laws also govern e-mail marketing, generally imposing an opt-out requirement for emails sent within an existing business relationship. 
● | SMS and Location-Based Marketing Best Practices and Guidelines. We are a member of the Mobile Marketing Association, or MMA, a global association of 700 agencies, advertisers, mobile device manufacturers, wireless operators and service providers and others interested in the potential of marketing via the mobile channel. The MMA has published a code of conduct and best practices guidelines for use by those involved in mobile messaging activities. The guidelines were developed by a collaboration of the major carriers and they require adherence to them as a condition of service. We voluntarily comply with the MMA code of conduct. In addition, the Cellular Telephone Industry Association, or CTIA, has developed Best Practices and Guidelines to promote and protect user privacy regarding location-based services. We also voluntarily comply with those guidelines, which generally require notice and user consent for delivery of location-based services. 
● | The United States Telephone Consumer Protection Act. The TCPA prohibits unsolicited voice and text calls to cell phones through the use of an automatic telephone-dialing system (ATDS) unless the recipient has given prior consent. The statute also prohibits companies from initiating telephone solicitations to individuals on the national Do-Not-Call list and restricts the hours when such messages may be sent. Violations of the TCPA can result in statutory damages of $500 per violation (i.e., for each individual text message). U.S. state laws impose additional regulations on voice and text calls. We believe that our platform does not employ an ATDS within the meaning of the TCPA based on case law construing that term. 
● | CAN-SPAM. The U.S. Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act, or CAN SPAM Act, prohibits all commercial e-mail messages, as defined in the law, to mobile phones unless the device owner has given “express prior authorization.” Recipients of such messages must also be allowed to opt-out of receiving future messages the same way they opted-in. Senders have ten business days to honor opt-out requests. The FCC has compiled a list of domain names used by wireless service providers to which marketers may not send commercial e-mail messages. Senders have 30 days from the date the domain name is posted on the FCC site to stop sending unauthorized commercial e-mail to addresses containing the domain name. Violators are subject to fines of up to $6.0 million and up to one year in jail for some spamming activities. Carriers, the FTC, the FCC, and State Attorneys General may bring lawsuits to enforce alleged violations of the Act. 
● | Communications Privacy Acts. Foreign and U.S. federal and state laws impose liability for intercepting communications while in transit or accessing the contents of communications while in storage. 
● | Security Breach Notification Requirements. In the U.S., various states have enacted data breach notification laws, which require notification of individuals and sometimes state regulatory bodies in the event of breaches involving certain defined categories of personal information. This new trend suggests that breach notice statutes may be enacted in other jurisdictions, including by the U.S. at the federal level, as well. 
● | Children. The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act prohibit the knowing collection of personal information from children under the age of 13 without verifiable parental consent, and strictly regulate the transmission of requests for personal information to such children. Other countries do not recognize the ability of children to consent to the collection of personal information. In addition, it is likely that behavioral advertising regulations will impose special restrictions on use of information collected from minors for this purpose.

Intellectual Property
 
Although we believe that our business methodology is proprietary in terms of how we deliver our service to our client, and how we use mobile marketing, we currently hold no patents, copyrights or trademarks. It is our plan to trademark our key products as we develop them, subject to applicable laws and regulations, however, we have not filed for any such protection as of yet. It is our policy to enter into confidentiality agreements with any outsourced sales or service providers so that our proprietary methodology, customer’s lists and business information are contractually protected, and we intend to enforce any such contractual provisions as the law allows in the event of a breach. We cannot assure you that these contractual arrangements will prevent third parties from acquiring or using our proprietary business information to compete against us.
 
IT Consulting
 
We own a minority 49% interest in Aspire Consulting, LLC.
 
Aspire is headquartered in Gaithersburg, Maryland. It provides IT consulting and solution-based services as a Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business Concern (SDVOSBC) to commercial, state and federal contractors. Aspire’s leadership and advisory board consists of executives from Cyber Security, Healthcare, Quality Management, Unified Communications and Financial Services.
 
On December 16, 2003, the Veterans Benefits Act (the “Act”) was passed by Congress. Section 308 of the Act established a procurement program for SDVOSBCs. This procurement program provides that federal contracting officers may restrict competition to SDVOSBCs and award a sole source or set-aside contract where certain criteria are met.
 
The purpose of the procurement program is to provide procuring agencies with the authority to set acquisitions aside for exclusive competition among SDVOSBCs, as well as the authority to make sole source awards to SDVOSBCs if certain conditions are met.
 
Aspire meets the requirements of a SDVOSBC and is eligible for the procurement program. Aspire was verified as SDVOSB by U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), Center for Verification and Evaluation (CVE) on December 2, 2015. This verification allows Aspire to compete for SDVOSB set-aside contracts in both federal and state government sectors. Acceptance into the Veterans First Contracting Program within the VA System ensures legitimately owned and controlled VOSBs and SDVOSBs are able to compete for VA VOSB and SDVOSB set-aside contracts and are credited by VA’s large prime contractors for subcontract plan achievements.

We hope to eventually have a team in place for each our targeted customer groups, which are as follows:
 

● | Lifestyle: salons, spas, health clubs, gyms, fitness centers, massage, hotels, etc. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Entertainment: golf, comedy, bars & nightclubs, casinos, bowling, etc. 
● | Food & restaurant: QSR and restaurant style 
● | Retail: automotive, clothing, apparel, car washes 
● | Marketing: digital marketing and Investor Relation (IR) firms 

 
As we continue to grow, sales teams will be added in each targeted customer group according to geographic region.
 
From our past experience, one team should be able to reach out to 1,600 contacts and yield 60 demos per month. With this forecast, which is really just an estimate, one team could generate $6,000 in new sales per month. We hope to hire 2 teams for a total of $100,000 in the next twelve months.
 
We will have one VP of Sales over teams and more may be added as our company grows and our geographical customer base expands. The sales Director is responsible for leading and developing the sales team, organizing and assigning industry specifics and regions, and working hand in hand with current and new partners for sustained growth. We have one Sales Director already.
