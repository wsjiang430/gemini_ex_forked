 1


The Company’s portfolio of subscription-based solutions provides actionable information and analysis to healthcare organizations across a range of mission-critical, constituent-related elements, including patient experience, service recovery, care transitions, health risk assessments, employee engagement, reputation management and brand loyalty. NRC Health partners with clients across the continuum of healthcare services. The Company’s clients include integrated health systems, post-acute providers and payer organizations. The Company believes this cross-continuum positioning is a unique and an increasingly important capability as evolving payment models drive healthcare providers and payers towards a more collaborative and integrated service model.
 
NRC Health has achieved a market leadership position through its more than 37 years of industry innovation and experience, as well as its long-term, recurring revenue relationships (solutions that are used or required by a client each year) with many of the healthcare industry’s largest organizations. Since its founding in 1981, the Company has focused on meeting the evolving information needs of the healthcare industry through internal product development, as well as select acquisitions. The Company is a Wisconsin corporation headquartered in Lincoln, Nebraska.
 
Industry and Market Opportunity
 
According to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”), health expenditures in the United States were approximately $3.5 trillion in 2017, or $10,739 per person. In total, health spending accounted for 17.9% of the nation’s Gross Domestic Product in 2017. Addressing this growing expenditure burden continues to be a major policy priority at both federal and state levels. In addition, increased co-pays and deductibles in healthcare plans have focused even more consumer attention on health spending and affordability. In the public sector, Medicare provides health coverage for individuals aged 65 and older, while Medicaid provides coverage for low income families and other individuals in need. Both programs are administered by the CMS. With the aging of the U.S. population, Medicare enrollment has increased significantly.  In addition, longer life spans and greater prevalence of chronic illnesses among both the Medicare and Medicaid populations have placed tremendous demands on the health care system.
 
An increasing percentage of Medicare reimbursement and reimbursement from commercial payers will be determined under value payment models, based on factors such as patient readmission rates and provider adherence to certain quality-related protocols. At the same time, many hospitals and other providers are creating new models of care delivery to improve patient experience, reduce cost and provide better clinical outcomes. These new models are based on sharing financial risk and managing the health and behaviors of large populations of patients and consumers. This transformation towards value-based payment models and increased engagement of healthcare consumers is resulting in a greater need for existing healthcare providers to deliver more customer-centric healthcare. At the same time, organizations that have successfully developed effective customer service models and brand loyalty in other industry verticals are entering the healthcare services market.
 
NRC Health believes that its current portfolio of solutions is uniquely aligned to address these healthcare market trends and related business opportunity. The Company provides tools and solutions to capture, interpret and improve the Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems ("CAHPS") data required by CMS as well as real time feedback that enables clients to better understand what matters most to people at key moments in their relationship with a health organization. NRC Health’s solutions enable its clients to both satisfy patient survey compliance requirements and design experiences to build loyalty and improve the wellbeing of the people and communities they care for.
 
NRC Health’s Solutions
 
NRC Health’s portfolio of solutions represent a unique set of capabilities that individually and collectively provide value to its clients. The solutions are offered at an enterprise level through the Voice of the Customer platform, The Governance Institute, and legacy Experience solutions.
Voice of the Customer Platform Solutions
 
The Voice of the Customer (“VoC”) platform represents a portfolio of solutions that collectively provide a comprehensive set of capabilities that enable healthcare providers to collect, measure and analyze data collected across the patient journey to understand the preferences, experiences and needs of the people they serve. The digital platform consists of three primary solution categories which can be implemented both collectively as an enterprise solution or individually to meet specific needs within the organization. The primary solution categories include Market Insights solutions, Transparency solutions, and certain Experience solutions.
NRC Health’s Market Insights Solutions – NRC Health’s Market Insights solutions are subscription-based services that allow for improved tracking of awareness, perception, and consistency of healthcare brands; real-time assessment of competitive differentiators; and enhanced segmentation tools to evaluate the needs, wants, and behaviors of communities through real-time competitive assessments and enhanced segmentation tools. NRC Health’s Market Insights is the largest U.S. healthcare consumer database of its kind, measuring the opinions and behaviors of more than 292,000 healthcare consumers in the top 300 markets across the country annually. NRC Health’s Market Insights is a syndicated survey that provides clients with an independent third-party source of information that is used to understand consumer perception and preferences and optimize marketing strategies. NRC Health’s Market Insights solutions provide clients with on-demand tools to measure brand value and build brand equity in their markets, evaluate and optimize advertising efficacy and consumer recall, and tailor research to obtain the real time voice of customer feedback to support branding and loyalty initiatives. The Company’s Market Insights solutions were historically marketed under the Healthcare Market Guide and Ticker brands.

NRC Health’s Experience Solutions – NRC Health’s Experience solutions are provided on a subscription basis via a cross-continuum VoC platform that collects and measures data and then delivers business intelligence that the Company’s clients utilize to improve patient experience, engagement and loyalty. Patient experience data can also be collected on a periodic basis using CAHPS compliant mail and telephone survey methods for regulatory compliance purposes and to monitor and measure improvement in CAHPS survey scores. CAHPS survey data can be collected and measured as an integrated service within the VoC platform or independently as a legacy service offering. NRC Health’s Experience solutions provide hospitals and healthcare providers the ability to receive and take action on customer and employee feedback across all care settings in real-time. Experience solutions include patient and resident experience, workforce engagement, health risk assessments, transitions, and improvement tools, which are provided through the Experience, Transitions and National Research Canada Corporation operating segments. These solutions enable clients to comply with regulatory requirements and to improve their reimbursement under value-based purchasing models. More importantly, NRC Health’s Experience solutions provide quantitative and qualitative real-time feedback, improvement plans, and coaching tools to enable clients to improve the experiences of patients, residents, physicians and staff.   By illuminating the complete care journey in real time, the Company’s clients are able to ensure each individual receives the care, respect, and experience he or she deserves. Developing a longitudinal profile of what healthcare customers want and need allows for organizational improvement, increased clinician and staff engagement, loyal relationships and personal well-being. These solutions have previously been marketed under NRC Picker, My InnerView (“MIV”), Customer-Connect LLC (doing business as Connect), and NRC Canada.
 
NRC Health’s Health Risk Assessment solutions (formerly Payer solutions) enable the Company’s clients to understand the health risks associated with populations of patients, analyze and address readmission risks, and efficiently reach out to patients to impact their behaviors outside of the healthcare provider settings. These health risk assessment solutions enable clients to effectively segment populations and manage care for those who are most at-risk, engage individuals, increase preventative care and manage wellness programs to improve patient experience and outcomes.
 
NRC Health’s Transitions solutions are provided to healthcare organizations on a subscription basis to drive effective communication between healthcare providers and patients in the critical 24-72 hours post discharge using a discharge call program. Through preference-based communications and real-time alerts, these solutions enable organizations to identify and manage high-risk patients to reduce readmissions, increase patient satisfaction and support safe care transitions. Tracking, trending and benchmarking tools isolate the key areas for process improvement allowing organizations to implement changes and reduce future readmissions. NRC Health’s Transitions solutions were previously provided by Connect. Connect was formed in June 2013 to develop and provide patient outreach and discharge call solutions. NRC Health originally had a 49% ownership interest in Connect but by March 2016 had acquired all of the remaining interest and subsequently dissolved Customer-Connect LLC in June 2016.
 
NRC Health’s Transparency Solutions – NRC Health’s Transparency solutions allow healthcare organizations to share a picture of their organization and ensure that timely and relevant content informs better consumer decision-making. NRC Health’s Star Ratings solution (formerly Reputation) enables clients to publish a five-star rating metric and verified patient feedback derived from actual patient survey data to complement their online physician information. Sharing this feedback not only results in better-informed consumer decision-making but also has the ability to drive new patient acquisition and grow online physician reputation. NRC Health’s reputation monitoring solution alerts clients to ratings and reviews on third-party websites and provides workflows for response and service recovery. These solutions raise physician awareness of survey results and provide access to improvement resources and educational development opportunities designed to improve the way care is delivered.
The Governance Institute
 
NRC Health’s Governance solutions, branded as The Governance Institute (“TGI”), serves not-for-profit hospital and health system boards of directors, executives, and physician leadership. TGI’s subscription-based, value-driven membership services are provided through national conferences, publications, advisory services, and an on-line portal designed to improve the effectiveness of hospital and healthcare systems by continually strengthening their board governance, strategic planning, medical leadership, management performance, and transparency positioning. TGI also conducts research studies and tracks industry trends showcasing emerging healthcare trends and best practice solutions of healthcare boards across the country. TGI thought leadership helps its client board members and executives inform and guide their organization’s strategic priorities in alignment with the rapidly changing healthcare market.

NRC Health’s Competitive Strengths
 
The Company believes that its competitive strengths include the following:
 
A leading provider of patient experience solutions for healthcare providers, payers and other healthcare organizations. The Company’s history is based on capturing the voice of the consumer in healthcare markets. The Company’s solutions build on the “Eight Dimensions of Patient-Centered Care,” a philosophy developed by noted patient advocate Harvey Picker, who believed patients’ experiences are integral to quality healthcare. This foundation has been enhanced through the digital VoC platform offering that provides the delivery of data and insights on a real time basis.
 
Premier client portfolio across the care continuum. NRC Health’s client portfolio encompasses leading healthcare organizations across the healthcare continuum, from acute care hospitals and post-acute providers to healthcare payers. The Company’s client base is diverse, with its top ten clients representing approximately 17% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018 and no single client representing more than 4% of the Company’s revenue.
 
Highly scalable and visible revenue model. The Company’s solutions are offered to healthcare providers, payers and other healthcare organizations primarily through subscription-based service agreements. The solutions NRC Health provides are also recurring in nature, which enables an ongoing relationship with its clients. This combination of subscription-based revenue, a base of ongoing client renewals and automated platforms creates a highly visible and scalable revenue model for the Company.
 
Comprehensive portfolio of solutions. NRC Health offers a portfolio of solutions that provide insights across the patient journey, which is unique in the healthcare industry, enabling its clients to initially establish an enterprise relationship utilizing the entire portfolio or begin with an individual solution and increase the scope of services over time, increasing overall contract value.
 
Exclusive focus on healthcare. The Company focuses exclusively on healthcare and serving the unique needs of healthcare organizations across the continuum, which NRC Health believes gives it a distinct competitive advantage compared to other survey and analytics software providers. The Company’s platform includes features and capabilities built specifically for healthcare providers, including a library of performance improvement content which can be tailored to the provider based on their specific customer feedback profile.
  Experienced senior management team led by NRC Health’s founder. NRC Health’s senior management team has extensive industry and leadership experience. Michael D. Hays, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, founded NRC Health in 1981. Prior to launching the Company, Mr. Hays served as Vice President and as a Director of SRI Research Center, Inc. (now known as the Gallup Organization). The Chief Financial Officer, Kevin Karas, CPA, has extensive financial experience having served as CFO at two previous companies, along with healthcare experience at Rehab Designs of America, Inc. and NovaCare, Inc. Steven D. Jackson, the Company’s President, served as Chief Strategy Officer for Vocera Communications, and he also served as Chief Operating Officer for ExperiaHealth.
 
Competition
 
The healthcare information and market research services industry is highly competitive. The Company has traditionally competed with healthcare organizations’ internal marketing, market research, and/or quality improvement departments which create their own performance measurement tools, and with relatively small specialty research firms which provide survey-based healthcare market research and/or performance assessment. The Company’s primary competitors among such specialty firms include Press Ganey, which has significantly higher annual revenue than the Company, and several other organizations that NRC Health believes have less annual revenue than the Company. The Company, to a certain degree, currently competes with, and anticipates that in the future it may increasingly compete with, (1) market research firms and technology solutions which provide survey-based, general market research or voice of the customer feedback capabilities and (2) firms which provide services or products that complement healthcare performance assessments such as healthcare software or information systems. Although only a few of these competitors have offered specific services that compete directly with the Company’s solutions, many of these competitors have substantially greater financial, information gathering, and marketing resources than the Company and could decide to increase their resource commitments to the Company’s market. There are relatively few barriers to entry into the Company’s market, and the Company expects increased competition in its market which could adversely affect the Company’s operating results through pricing pressure, increased marketing expenditures, and market share losses, among other factors. There can be no assurance that the Company will continue to compete successfully against existing or new competitors.
 
The Company believes the primary competitive factors within its market include quality of service, timeliness of delivery, unique service capabilities, credibility of provider, industry experience, and price. NRC Health believes that its industry leadership position, exclusive focus on the healthcare industry, cross-continuum presence, comprehensive portfolio of solutions and relationships with leading healthcare payers and providers position the Company to compete in this market.

Growth Strategy
 
NRC Health believes that the value proposition of its current solutions, combined with the favorable alignment of its solutions with emerging market demand, positions the Company to benefit from multiple growth opportunities. The Company believes that it can accelerate its growth through (1) increasing scope of services and sales of its existing solutions to its existing clients (or cross-selling), (2) winning additional new clients through market share growth in existing market segments, (3) developing and introducing new solutions to new and existing clients, and (4) pursuing acquisitions of, or investments in, firms providing products, solutions or technologies which complement those of the Company.
 
Increasing contract value with existing clients. Approximately 24% of the Company’s existing clients purchase more than one of its solutions. NRC Health’s sales organization actively identifies and pursues cross-sell opportunities for clients to add additional solutions in order to accelerate the growth of the Company. Organic contract value growth is also realized by the increased scope of solution adoption as the size of client organizations increase from market expansion and consolidation.
 
Adding new clients. NRC Health believes that there is an opportunity to add new clients across all existing market segments. The Company’s sales organization is actively identifying and engaging new client prospects with a focus on demonstrating the economic value derived from adopting the portfolio of solutions in alignment with the prospect’s strategic objectives.
 
Adding new solutions. The need for effective solutions in the market segments that NRC Health serves is evolving to align with emerging healthcare consumerism trends. The evolving market creates an opportunity for the Company to introduce new solutions that leverage and extend its existing core competencies. The Company believes that there is an opportunity to drive sales growth with both existing and new clients, across all of the market segments that it serves, through the introduction of new solutions.
 
Pursue strategic acquisitions and investments. The Company has historically complemented its organic growth with strategic acquisitions, having completed seven such transactions over the past seventeen years. These transactions have added new capabilities and access to market segments that are adjacent and complementary to the Company’s existing solutions and market segments. NRC Health believes that additional strategic acquisition and/or investment opportunities exist for the Company to complement its organic growth by further expanding its service capabilities, technology offerings and end markets.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
The Company generates the majority of its revenue from the renewal of subscription-based client service agreements, supplemented by sales of additional solutions to existing clients and the addition of new clients. NRC Health sales activities are carried out by a direct sales organization staffed with professional, trained sales associates.
 
NRC Health engages in marketing activities that enhance the Company’s brand visibility in the marketplace, generate demand for its solutions and engage existing clients. Strategic campaigns and programs focus on (1) ensuring coverage of prospective clients via targeted advertising and account-based campaigns, (2) elevating client value evidence and success stories to an executive level profile, (3) engaging key stakeholders with content, programming and events and (4) amplifying thought leadership through public and media relations programs that include earning placement in national media and trade publications, securing podium presentations at key industry events and winning awards on behalf of the Company and its executives.
 
Clients
 
NRC Health partners with clients across the continuum of healthcare services. The Company’s clients include integrated health systems, post-acute providers and payer organizations. The Company’s ten largest clients accounted for 17%, 19%, and 17% of the Company’s total revenue in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Approximately 4%, 4% and 5% of the Company’s revenue was derived from foreign customers in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.
 
 5


Intellectual Property and Other Proprietary Rights
 
The Company’s success depends in part upon its data collection processes, research methods, data analysis techniques and internal systems, and procedures that it has developed specifically to serve clients in the healthcare industry. The Company has no patents. Consequently, it relies on a combination of copyright and trade secret laws and associate nondisclosure agreements to protect its systems, survey instruments and procedures. There can be no assurance that the steps taken by the Company to protect its rights will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of such rights or that third parties will not independently develop functionally equivalent or superior systems or procedures. The Company believes that its systems and procedures and other proprietary rights do not infringe upon the proprietary rights of third parties. There can be no assurance, however, that third parties will not assert infringement claims against the Company in the future or that any such claims will not result in protracted and costly litigation, regardless of the merits of such claims or whether the Company is ultimately successful in defending against such claims.
Associates
 
As of December 31, 2018, the Company employed a total of 434 persons on a full-time basis. In addition, as of such date, the Company had 25 part-time associates primarily in its survey operations, representing approximately 13 full-time equivalent associates. None of the Company’s associates are represented by a collective bargaining unit. The Company considers its relationship with its associates to be good.
