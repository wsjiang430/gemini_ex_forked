 Markets
     Our array of process equipment systems are used in the production of a broad range of microelectronic components, including LEDs, micro-electro mechanical systems (“MEMS”), radio frequency (“RF”) filters and amplifiers, power electronics, thin film magnetic heads (“TFMHs”), laser diodes, 3D NAND, DRAM, logic, and other semiconductor devices. Many of our systems are used to directly deposit precision materials critical to the operation of the device.  Some of our systems are involved in the precision removal of critical materials. Still other systems are used in the advanced packaging process flow of microelectronic components such as flip chip, Fan out Wafer Level Packaging (“FOWLP”), and other wafer level packaging approaches used in the modern integration of diverse semiconductor products, especially used in consumer electronics. Some of our customers are interested in purchasing different types of systems from us for different applications in the same process line. In general, our customers purchase our systems to both produce current generation devices in volume and to develop next generation products which deliver more efficient, cost effective, and advanced technological solutions. We operate in several highly cyclical business environments, and our customers’ buying patterns are dependent upon industry trends respective to that particular market. As our products are sold into multiple markets, the following discussion focuses on the trends that most influence our business within each of those markets.
     Advanced Packaging, MEMS & RF Filters
     Advanced Packaging includes a portfolio of wafer-level assembly technologies that enable improved performance of electronic products, such as smartphones, high end servers, and graphical processors.
     Demand for higher performance, increased functionality, smaller form factors, and lower power consumption in mobile devices, consumer electronics, and high performance computing is driving the adoption of advanced packaging technologies. Semiconductor Foundries (“Foundries”), Independent Device Manufacturers (“IDMs”), and Outsourced Semiconductor Assembly and Test (“OSATs”) companies are implementing multiple advanced packaging approaches including FOWLP, recently deployed in high-volume manufacturing, and copper-pillar to enable stacked memory devices. This increasing demand trend in Advanced Packaging is encouraging as our Lithography and Precision Surface Processing (“PSP”) wet etch and clean systems enable several process steps for Advanced Packaging.
     MEMS devices are used for an increasing number of applications, including accelerometers for automobile airbags, pressure sensors for medical uses, and gyroscopes for a variety of consumer products, such as gaming consoles and mobile devices.
     One of the fastest growing MEMS applications has been RF filters for mobile devices, driven by increasingly complex wireless standards, the proliferation of an increasing number of communication bands, the exponential growth of mobile data, and carrier aggregation. These trends are positive for us, particularly for our PSP products, where our technology is enabling some of the most challenging process steps, as well as our Ion Beam Etch (“IBE”) and MBE systems, which are used to create Bulk Acoustic Wave (“BAW”) and Surface Acoustic Wave (“SAW”) RF filters.
     LED Lighting, Display & Compound Semiconductor
     The LED industry has experienced multiple growth cycles brought on by the adoption of LED technology using Gallium Nitride (“GaN”) that created a low cost blue LED to produce white light for consumer and commercial applications. The first wave of LED growth was driven by mobile phones, which implemented the use of LED technology for display backlighting. The LED industry experienced its second period of rapid growth as LEDs were adopted for TV display backlighting. The adoption of LEDs for solid state, general lighting gave rise to a third wave of demand. Future growth is anticipated in the compound semiconductor market driven by optical communication and industrial applications requiring laser diodes, 3D sensing and world facing vertical cavity surface emitting lasers (“VCSELs”), micro-LED displays, 5G RF infrastructure adoption, and power electronics.
     Our MOCVD technology is at the core of the manufacturing process for GaN-based LEDs. We have benefited with each growth cycle, as LED producers invested in MOCVD process equipment to capture share in these markets. Demand for our equipment has historically been cyclical in nature, influenced by multiple factors, including: macroeconomic 

 
  4

 
conditions; prices for LED chips; supply and demand dynamics; competition; and our customers’ manufacturing plans. Given the recent competitive trends in China, the general lighting and backlighting markets have become commoditized and we do not expect significant revenue from these markets going forward.
     MOCVD technology is also important in the manufacturing of red, orange, and yellow (“ROY”) LEDs, which are used increasingly for fine-pitch digital signage and automotive lighting applications. For these applications, our MOCVD technology is used to deposit highly uniform Arsenides and Phosphides (“As/P”) films which create amber and red output colors. 
     The Display market refers to LEDs or micro LEDs used directly for displays. Our MOCVD systems are well suited for the display market.
     The Compound Semiconductor market broadly refers to the deposition of GaN or As/P based thin film compounds on a variety of substrates including Silicon, Gallium Arsenide (“GaAs”), Indium Phosphide (“InP”), and Silicon Carbide (“SiC”) to enable a variety of power electronics, RF, and photonics devices. 
     Global demand is increasing for advanced power electronics with greater energy efficiency, a smaller form factor, ability to operate at higher temperatures, faster switching capabilities, and greater reliability. These devices support many applications, including more efficient IT servers, electrical motors, faster charging stations for electric vehicles, wind turbines, and photovoltaic power inverters. While silicon-based transistors are widely used in power electronic devices today, GaN based power electronics developed on MOCVD systems can potentially deliver higher performance (e.g., smaller power supply form factors, higher efficiency, and faster switching speeds). In addition to depositing the critical GaN layer with our MOCVD products, our wet etch and clean products address multiple etch and clean steps required to manufacture these advanced power electronics devices. In recent years, global industry leaders in power electronics have focused on research and development programs to commercialize this new technology. We anticipate device manufacturers will likely begin to transition from development to production of these devices over the next couple of years; we can benefit from this transition as our customers invest in process equipment to support this production ramp-up.
     Demand for RF power amplifiers in mobile devices drives the RF device portion of the Compound Semiconductor market. Our GaN and As/P technologies are used to deposit critical thin film layers for the production of RF amplifiers.  Our wet etch and clean systems are used for process steps such as metal lift off and photo resist strip for devices such as heterojunction bipolar transistors (“HBTs”) used in smartphones. We believe GaN and As/P based devices will enable the evolution of wireless technology to the fifth generation (“5G”). It is expected that the transition to 5G will take several years to become fully adopted.
     Examples of important photonics devices are infrared LEDs and VCSELs used for optical data communication, 3D sensing, and world facing applications (augmented reality and automotive light detection and ranging (“LIDAR”)). In addition to film deposition, photonics device manufacturers also employ cleaning and etching process steps supported by our wet etch and clean technologies.
     Front-End Semiconductor
     Front-End Semiconductor refers to early process steps where transistors are formed directly on silicon. There are many different process steps in forming integrated circuits, such as Deposition, Etching, Masking, and Doping, where the microchips are created but still remain on the silicon wafer. Our Laser Spike Annealing systems enable precision doping of materials at a controlled temperature in the semiconductor manufacturing process. Our IBE for front-end semiconductor has been demonstrated in Spin Torque Transfer Magnetic Random Access Memory (“STT-MRAM”) applications. STT-MRAM has many benefits over traditional random access memory such as its non-volatility, speed, endurance, and power consumption. Our Ion Beam Deposition (“IBD”) products have been adopted for the manufacturing of Extreme Ultraviolet (“EUV”) mask blanks. Our ability to precisely deposit high quality films with extremely low particulate levels make our IBD technology ideal for manufacturing defect-free EUV photomask blanks. The front-end semiconductor industry is in the process of adopting EUV lithography to meet leading edge device requirements. Future growth will depend on overall adoption of EUV lithography by IDMs and Foundries. Our

inspection products are used for shape inspection of 3D topographies in memory and logic applications, which helps our customers improve their lithography and deposition processes.
     Scientific & Industrial
     The Scientific and Industrial market includes advanced materials research and a broad range of manufacturing applications including high-power fiber lasers, infrared detectors, thin film magnetic heads on hard disk drives (“HDDs”), and optical coatings.
     Our MBE systems are used by scientific research organizations and universities to drive new discoveries in the areas of materials science. MBE enables precise epitaxial crystal growth for a very wide variety of materials, which supports the development of new performance materials used for emerging technologies. MBE technology is also used in the manufacturing of specialized, lower volume products such as high-power lasers and infrared sensors. Our fully automated process equipment systems create highly uniform, and high purity GaAs or InP film layers, which are critical to the performance of these devices. Our wet etch and clean systems are also used in the manufacture of infrared sensors.
     Our Ion Beam Deposition, Ion Beam Etch, Physical Vapor Deposition (“PVD”), and lapping and dicing tools are used in data storage applications, including HDDs that will continue to provide significant value for mass storage and will remain an important part of large capacity storage applications. This is especially true for data center applications where large volumes of data storage are required to serve an increasingly mobile population. In addition, our IBD tools are used to produce high quality optical films for multiple applications including laser mirrors, optical filters, and anti-reflective coatings. Our tools deposit thin layers of advanced materials on various substrates to alter how light is reflected and transmitted.
     Our atomic layer deposition (“ALD”) systems are sold into a variety of Scientific & Industrial market applications including optical, semi/nano-electronics, MEMS, nanostructures, and biomedical.

     Precision Surface Processing Systems (Wet Etch and Clean)
     We offer single wafer wet etch and clean, and surface preparation systems which target high growth segments in advanced packaging, MEMS, LEDs, and compound semiconductor markets. The WaferStorm platform is based on PSP’s unique ImmJET™ technology, which provides improved performance at a lower cost of ownership than conventional wet bench-only or spray-only approaches. This highly flexible platform targets solvent based cleaning applications that require a significant level of process control and flexibility. The WaferEtch® platform provides highly uniform, selective etching with onboard end point detection for improved process control and yield in bumping applications. In addition, PSP has developed a state-of-the-art solution with the WaferEtch platform to address the requirements of TSV reveal, in which the backside of a wafer is thinned to reveal the copper interconnects. PSP’s TSV technology offers a significant cost of ownership reduction compared with dry etch processing by replacing up to four separate process steps.     Laser Annealing Systems
     The progression of Moore’s law has led semiconductor manufacturers to implement a variety of material and process changes to overcome the technical hurdles related to shrinking of feature sizes in integrated circuits. Along with new materials and smaller dimensions have come new process challenges. One such challenge has been new constraints on thermal annealing processes. One example is the thermal annealing of dopants for activation, in order to form the transistor junction, critical to the function and performance of a complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (“CMOS”) logic integrated circuit. In this and other thermal process steps, traditional lamp-based annealing techniques have challenges meeting the thermal budget (time/temperature regime) required by new materials and designs. Our Laser Spike Annealing (“LSA”) systems meet the industry demand for millisecond time-scale annealing, heating the wafer up to temperatures just below the silicon melting point over a range of ultra-short timeframes (microseconds to milliseconds), enabling thermal annealing solutions at the 65nm technology node and below. This advanced annealing technology provides solutions to the difficult challenge of fabricating ultra-shallow junctions and highly activated source/drain contacts at these advanced logic nodes. In addition, our proprietary hardware design enables outstanding temperature uniformity across the wafer and die, by minimizing the pattern-density effect, thus reducing absorption variations.
     We have also developed a next generation melt anneal technology (“MELT”) targeted for annealing advanced logic devices at 7nm and below. As FinFET devices scale below the 10nm node, achieving the performance targets has become a challenge. To continue the roadmap, the industry is looking at new materials and the use of thermal processes that require nanosecond time-scale thermal annealing with temperatures exceeding the melting point. To help address this concern we have developed a unique (and patented) approach to nanosecond-scale thermal annealing. Our design utilizes two lasers; a millisecond laser as a low thermal budget localized preheat and a nanosecond laser “on top” of the millisecond laser to raise the peak temperature to the melt temperature of the material being processed beyond silicon melt. Similar to LSA, the MELT system architecture is targeted to reduce pattern effects and increase the process window. It is believed that nanosecond annealing will be required to meet the device targets at 7nm and below; the initial application being explored by customers is contact annealing aimed to improve reduce source/drain contact resistance, which has become a performance bottleneck at the most advanced FinFET nodes, and as devices continue to scale, we see the application space for our melt product expanding.
     Ion Beam Deposition and Etch Systems
     Our NEXUS® IBD systems use ion beam technology to deposit precise layers of thin films. IBD systems deposit high purity thin film layers and provide excellent uniformity and repeatability. Our NEXUS IBE systems utilize a charged particle beam consisting of ions to etch precise, complex features. The NEXUS systems may be included on our cluster system platform to allow either parallel or sequential deposition/etch processes. These systems are used primarily by data storage, semiconductor, and telecommunications device manufacturers in the fabrication of discrete and integrated microelectronic devices.

We also provide a broad array of ion beam sources. These technologies are applicable in the HDD industry as well as for optical coatings and other end markets.
     Molecular Beam Epitaxy Systems
     Molecular beam epitaxy is the process of precisely depositing epitaxially-aligned atomically-thin crystalline layers, or epilayers, of elemental materials onto a substrate in an ultra-high vacuum environment. We are a leading supplier of MBE systems worldwide.
     Our MBE systems, sources, and components are used to develop and manufacture compound semiconductor devices in a wide variety of applications such as high-power fiber lasers, infrared detectors, mobile phones, radar systems, high efficiency solar cells, and basic materials science research. For many compound semiconductors, MBE is the critical step of the fabrication process, ultimately determining device functionality and overall performance. We offer a full complement of MBE systems customized for the specific end application depositing on single 3” substrates up to fully automated production systems that can deposit on seven 6” substrates simultaneously. The GENxplor® MBE system creates high quality epitaxial layers and is ideal for cutting-edge research on a wide variety of materials including GaAs, antimonides, nitrides, and oxides. The GENxcel® MBE system extends the same performance of the GENxplor to 4” diameter substrates.
     3D Wafer Inspection Systems
     As the semiconductor industry continues its pursuit of increased productivity and performance by shrinking device dimensions along Moore’s law, manufacturers are running into bottlenecks limited by fundamental materials properties and lithographic resolution. The industry has opted for 3D integration schemes to circumvent these limitations (e.g. Vertical NAND, HAR DRAM, Logic FinFET). The high volume manufacturing ramp of these 3D schemes requires low cost, high performance 3D wafer inspection systems. The Superfast 3D Wafer Inspection System is a Coherent Gradient Sensing (“CGS”) based 3D wafer inspection system that enables the wafer fab to inspect the patterned wafer at key processing steps, enabling statistical process control as well as advanced process control (“APC”) for topography, displacement, and stress.
