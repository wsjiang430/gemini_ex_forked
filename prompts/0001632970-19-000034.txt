Item 1. Business.
The use of the words “we,” “us” or “our” refers to Griffin-American Healthcare REIT IV, Inc. and its subsidiaries, including Griffin-American Healthcare REIT IV Holdings, LP, except where otherwise noted.
Company
Griffin-American Healthcare REIT IV, Inc., a Maryland corporation, was incorporated on January 23, 2015 and therefore we consider that our date of inception. We were initially capitalized on February 6, 2015. We invest in a diversified portfolio of real estate properties, focusing primarily on medical office buildings, hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, senior housing and other healthcare-related facilities. We also operate healthcare-related facilities utilizing the structure permitted by the REIT Investment Diversification and Empowerment Act of 2007, which is commonly referred to as a “RIDEA” structure (the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, authorizing the RIDEA structure were enacted as part of the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008). We may also originate and acquire secured loans and real estate-related investments on an infrequent and opportunistic basis. We generally seek investments that produce current income. We qualified to be taxed as a real estate investment trust, or REIT, under the Code for federal income tax purposes beginning with our taxable year ended December 31, 2016, and we intend to continue to qualify to be taxed as a REIT.
On February 16, 2016, we commenced our initial public offering, or our offering, in which we were initially offering to the public up to $3,150,000,000 in shares of our Class T common stock, consisting of up to $3,000,000,000 in shares of our Class T common stock at a price of $10.00 per share in our primary offering and up to $150,000,000 in shares of our Class T common stock for $9.50 per share pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan, as amended, or the DRIP. Effective June 17, 2016, we reallocated certain of the unsold shares of Class T common stock being offered and began offering shares of Class I common stock, such that we were offering up to approximately $2,800,000,000 in shares of Class T common stock and $200,000,000 in shares of Class I common stock in our primary offering, and up to an aggregate of $150,000,000 in shares of our Class T and Class I common stock pursuant to the DRIP, aggregating up to $3,150,000,000, or the maximum offering amount. 
The shares of our Class T common stock in our primary offering were being offered at a price of $10.00 per share prior to April 11, 2018. The shares of our Class I common stock in our primary offering were being offered at a price of $9.30 per share prior to March 1, 2017 and $9.21 per share from March 1, 2017 to April 10, 2018. The shares of our Class T and Class I common stock issued pursuant to the DRIP were sold at a price of $9.50 per share prior to January 1, 2017 and $9.40 per share from January 1, 2017 to April 10, 2018. On April 6, 2018, our board of directors, at the recommendation of the audit committee of our board of directors, comprised solely of independent directors, unanimously approved and established an estimated per share net asset value, or NAV, of our common stock of $9.65. As a result, on April 6, 2018, our board of directors unanimously approved revised offering prices for each class of shares of our common stock to be sold in the primary portion of our initial public offering based on the estimated per share NAV of our Class T and Class I common stock of $9.65 plus any applicable per share up-front selling commissions and dealer manager fees funded by us, effective April 11, 2018. Accordingly, the revised offering price for shares of our Class T common stock and Class I common stock sold pursuant to our primary offering on or after April 11, 2018 was $10.05 per share and $9.65 per share, respectively. Effective April 11, 2018, the shares of our Class T and Class I common stock issued pursuant to the DRIP were sold at a price of $9.65 per share, the most recent estimated per share NAV approved and established by our board of directors.
As of December 31, 2018, we had received and accepted subscriptions in our offering for 66,755,516 aggregate shares of our Class T and Class I common stock, or approximately $665,403,000, and a total of $27,097,000 in distributions were reinvested that resulted in 2,846,786 shares of our common stock being issued pursuant to the DRIP. On February 15, 2019, we terminated our offering. As of February 15, 2019, we had received and accepted subscriptions in our offering for 75,625,285 aggregate shares of our Class T and Class I common stock, or approximately $753,975,000, and a total of $31,021,000 in distributions were reinvested that resulted in 3,253,543 shares of our common stock being issued pursuant to the DRIP. 
On January 18, 2019, we filed a Registration Statement on Form S-3 under the Securities Act of 1933, or the Securities Act, to register a maximum of $100,000,000 of additional shares of our common stock to be issued pursuant to the DRIP, or the 2019 DRIP Offering. The shares of our Class T and Class I common stock issued pursuant to the 2019 DRIP Offering are sold at a price of $9.65 per share, the most recent estimated per share NAV approved and established by our board of directors. The Registration Statement on Form S-3 was automatically effective with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, upon its filing; we commenced offering shares pursuant to the 2019 DRIP Offering on March 1, 2019.

We conduct substantially all of our operations through Griffin-American Healthcare REIT IV Holdings, LP, or our operating partnership. We are externally advised by Griffin-American Healthcare REIT IV Advisor, LLC, or our advisor, pursuant to an advisory agreement, or the Advisory Agreement, between us and our advisor.

Our advisor uses its best efforts, subject to the oversight and review of our board of directors, to, among other things, research, identify, review and make investments in and dispositions of properties and securities on our behalf consistent with our investment policies and objectives. Our advisor performs its duties and responsibilities under the Advisory Agreement as our fiduciary. Our advisor is 75.0% owned and managed by American Healthcare Investors, LLC, or American Healthcare Investors, and 25.0% owned by a wholly owned subsidiary of Griffin Capital Company, LLC, or Griffin Capital, or collectively, our co-sponsors. American Healthcare Investors is 47.1% owned by AHI Group Holdings, LLC, or AHI Group Holdings, 45.1% indirectly owned by Colony Capital, Inc. (NYSE: CLNY), or Colony Capital, and 7.8% owned by James F. Flaherty III, a former partner of Colony Capital. We are not affiliated with Griffin Capital, Griffin Capital Securities, LLC, or our dealer manager, Colony Capital or Mr. Flaherty; however, we are affiliated with Griffin-American Healthcare REIT IV Advisor, LLC, American Healthcare Investors and AHI Group Holdings.

The Registration Statement on Form S-3 was automatically effective with the SEC upon its filing; we commenced offering shares pursuant to the 2019 DRIP Offering on March 1, 2019.


• | On November 20, 2018, we entered into a new credit agreement, or the 2018 Credit Agreement, with Bank of America, N.A., KeyBank, National Association, Citizens Bank, National Association, Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated and KeyBanc Capital Markets to obtain a credit facility with an aggregate maximum principal amount of $400,000,000, or the 2018 Credit Facility.

Investment Objectives
Our investment objectives are:

• | to preserve, protect and return our stockholders’ capital contributions;


• | to pay regular cash distributions; and


• | to realize growth in the value of our investments upon our ultimate sale of such investments.

We may not attain these objectives. Our board of directors may change our investment objectives if it determines it is advisable and in the best interest of our stockholders.
During the term of the Advisory Agreement, decisions relating to the purchase or sale of investments will be made by our advisor, subject to oversight by our advisor’s investment committee and our board of directors.
Investment Strategy
We have and we may continue to use substantially all of the net proceeds from our offering to invest in a diversified portfolio of real estate properties, focusing primarily on medical office buildings, hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, senior housing and other healthcare-related facilities. On an infrequent and opportunistic basis, we also may originate or acquire real estate-related investments such as mortgage, mezzanine, bridge and other loans, common and preferred stock of, or other interests in, public or private unaffiliated real estate companies, commercial mortgage-backed securities, and certain other securities, including collateralized debt obligations and foreign securities. We generally seek investments that produce current income.
We seek to maximize long-term stockholder value by generating sustainable growth in cash flows and portfolio value. In order to achieve these objectives, we may invest using a number of investment structures which may include direct acquisitions, joint ventures, leveraged investments, issuing securities for property and direct and indirect investments in real estate. In order to maintain our exemption from regulation as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the Investment Company Act, we may be required to limit our investments in certain types of real estate-related investments. See “Investment Company Act Considerations” below for a further discussion.
In addition, when and as determined appropriate by our advisor, our portfolio may also include properties in various stages of development other than those producing current income. These stages would include, without limitation, unimproved land both with and without entitlements and permits, property to be redeveloped and repositioned, newly constructed properties and properties in lease-up or other stabilization, all of which will have limited or no relevant operating histories and no current income. Our advisor will make this determination based upon a variety of factors, including the available risk-adjusted returns for such properties when compared with other available properties, the appropriate diversification of the portfolio, and our objectives of realizing both current income and capital appreciation upon the ultimate sale of properties.
For each of our investments, regardless of property type, we seek to invest in properties with the following attributes:

• | Quality. We seek to acquire properties that are suitable for their intended use with a quality of construction that is capable of sustaining the property’s investment potential for the long-term, assuming funding of budgeted maintenance, repairs and capital improvements.


• | Location. We seek to acquire properties that are located in established or otherwise appropriate markets for comparable properties, with access and visibility suitable to meet the needs of its occupants. In addition to U.S. properties, we also seek to acquire international properties that meet our investment criteria.


• | Market; Supply and Demand. We focus on local or regional markets that have potential for stable and growing property level cash flows over the long-term. These determinations are based in part on an evaluation of local and regional economic, demographic and regulatory factors affecting the property. For instance, we favor markets that indicate a growing population and employment base or markets that exhibit potential limitations on additions to supply, such as barriers to new construction. Barriers to new construction include lack of available land and stringent zoning restrictions. In addition, we generally seek to limit our investments in areas that have limited potential for growth.


• | Predictable Capital Needs. We seek to acquire properties where the future expected capital needs can be reasonably projected in a manner that would enable us to meet our objectives of growth in cash flows and preservation of capital and stability.

6


• | Cash Flows. We seek to acquire properties where the current and projected cash flows, including the potential for appreciation in value, would enable us to meet our overall investment objectives. We evaluate cash flows as well as expected growth and the potential for appreciation.

We will not invest more than 10.0% of the proceeds available for investment from our offering in unimproved or non-income producing properties or in other investments relating to unimproved or non-income producing property. A property will be considered unimproved or a non-income producing property for purposes of this limitation if it: (i) is not acquired for the purpose of currently producing rental or other operating income; or (ii) has no development or construction in process at the date of acquisition or planned in good faith to commence within one year of the date of acquisition.
We will not invest more than 10.0% of the proceeds available for investment from our offering in commercial mortgage-backed securities. In addition, we will not invest more than 10.0% of the proceeds available for investment from our offering in equity securities of public or private real estate companies.
We are not limited as to the geographic areas where we may acquire properties and may acquire properties domestically as well as internationally. We are not specifically limited in the number or size of properties we may acquire or on the percentage of our assets that we may invest in a single property or investment. The number and mix of properties and real estate-related investments we will acquire will depend upon real estate and market conditions and other circumstances existing at the time we are acquiring our properties and making our investments, the amount we raised in our offering and any potential future offerings and the amount of debt financing available.
Real Estate Investments
We have invested, and will continue to invest, in a diversified portfolio of real estate investments, focusing primarily on medical office buildings, hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, senior housing and other healthcare-related facilities. We generally seek investments that produce current income. Our investments may include:

• | medical office buildings;


• | hospitals;


• | skilled nursing facilities;


• | senior housing facilities;


• | healthcare-related facilities operated utilizing a RIDEA structure;


• | long-term acute care facilities;


• | surgery centers;


• | memory care facilities;


• | specialty medical and diagnostic service facilities;


• | laboratories and research facilities;


• | pharmaceutical and medical supply manufacturing facilities; and


• | offices leased to tenants in healthcare-related industries.

Our advisor generally seeks to acquire real estate on our behalf of the types described above that will best enable us to meet our investment objectives, taking into account the diversification of our portfolio at the time, relevant real estate and financial factors, the location, the income-producing capacity, and the prospects for long-range appreciation of a particular property and other considerations. As a result, we may acquire properties other than the types described above. In addition, we may acquire properties that vary from the parameters described above for a particular property type.
The consideration for each real estate investment must be authorized by a majority of our directors or a duly authorized committee of our board of directors, and ordinarily is based on the fair market value of the investment. If the majority of our independent directors or a duly authorized committee of our board of directors so determines, or if the investment is to be acquired from one of our co-sponsors, our advisor, any of our directors or an affiliate thereof, the fair market value determination must be supported by an appraisal obtained from a qualified, independent appraiser selected by a majority of our independent directors.
Our real estate investments generally take the form of holding fee title or long-term leasehold interests. Our investments may be made either directly through our operating partnership or indirectly through investments in joint ventures, limited liability companies, general partnerships or other co-ownership arrangements with the developers of the properties, affiliates of our advisor or other persons. See “Joint Ventures” below for a further discussion.
7

In addition, we have and may continue to purchase real estate investments and lease them back to the sellers of such properties. Our advisor will use its best efforts to structure any such sale-leaseback transaction such that the lease will be characterized as a “true lease” and so that we will be treated as the owner of the property for federal income tax purposes.
Our obligation to close a transaction involving the purchase of real estate is generally conditioned upon the delivery and verification of certain documents from the seller or developer, including, where appropriate:

• | plans and specifications;


• | environmental reports (generally a minimum of a Phase I investigation);


• | building condition reports;


• | surveys;


• | evidence of marketable title subject to such liens and encumbrances as are acceptable to our advisor;


• | audited financial statements covering recent operations of real properties having operating histories unless such statements are not required to be filed with the SEC and delivered to stockholders;


• | title insurance policies; and


• | liability insurance policies.

In determining whether to purchase a particular real estate investment, we may, in circumstances in which our advisor deems it appropriate, obtain an option on such property, including land suitable for development. The amount paid for an option is normally surrendered if the real estate is not purchased, and is normally credited against the purchase price if the real estate is purchased. We also may enter into arrangements with the seller or developer of a real estate investment whereby the seller or developer agrees that if, during a stated period, the real estate investment does not generate specified cash flows, the seller or developer will pay us cash in an amount necessary to reach the specified cash flows level, subject in some cases to negotiated dollar limitations.
We will not purchase or lease real estate in which one of our co-sponsors, our advisor, any of our directors or any of their affiliates have an interest without a determination by a majority of our disinterested directors and a majority of our disinterested independent directors that such transaction is fair and reasonable to us and at a price to us no greater than the cost of the real estate investment to the affiliated seller or lessor, unless there is substantial justification for the excess amount and the excess amount is reasonable. In no event will we acquire any such real estate investment at an amount in excess of its current appraised value.
We have obtained and we intend to continue to obtain adequate insurance coverage for all real estate investments in which we invest.
We have acquired and we intend to continue to acquire leased properties with long-term leases and we generally do not intend to operate any healthcare-related facilities directly. As a REIT, we are prohibited from operating healthcare-related facilities directly; however, from time to time we have leased and may continue to lease a healthcare-related facility that we acquire to a wholly-owned taxable REIT subsidiary, or TRS. In such an event, our TRS will engage a third party in the business of operating healthcare-related facilities to manage the property utilizing a RIDEA structure.
Joint Ventures
We have entered into and we may continue to enter into joint ventures, general partnerships and other arrangements with one or more institutions or individuals, including real estate developers, operators, owners, investors and others, some of whom may be affiliates of our advisor, for the purpose of acquiring real estate. Such joint ventures may be leveraged with debt financing or unleveraged. We have entered into and may continue to enter into joint ventures to further diversify our investments or to access investments which meet our investment criteria that would otherwise be unavailable to us. In determining whether to invest in a particular joint venture, our advisor will evaluate the real estate that such joint venture owns or is being formed to own under the same criteria described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the selection of our other properties. However, we will not participate in tenant in common syndications or transactions. 
Joint ventures with unaffiliated third parties may be structured such that the investment made by us and the co-venturer are on substantially different terms and conditions. For example, while we and a co-venturer may invest an equal amount of capital in an investment, the investment may be structured such that we have a right to priority distributions of cash flows up to a certain target return while the co-venturer may receive a disproportionately greater share of cash flows than we are to receive once such target return has been achieved. This type of investment structure may result in the co-venturer receiving more of the cash flows, including appreciation, of an investment than we would receive. See Item 1A, Risk Factors — Risks Related to Joint Ventures, for a further discussion.
8

We may invest in general partnerships or joint ventures with other Griffin Capital programs or American Healthcare Investors-sponsored programs or affiliates of our advisor to enable us to increase our equity participation in such ventures, so that ultimately we own a larger equity percentage of the property. Our entering into joint ventures with our advisor or any of its affiliates will result in certain conflicts of interest. See Item 1A, Risk Factors — Risks Related to Conflicts of Interest — We have entered into and may continue to enter into joint ventures with affiliates and may face conflicts of interest or disagreements with our joint venture partners that may not be resolved as quickly or on terms as advantageous to us as would be the case if the joint venture had been negotiated at arm’s-length with an independent joint venture partner.
We may only enter into joint ventures with other Griffin Capital programs or American Healthcare Investors-sponsored programs, affiliates of our advisor or any of our directors for the acquisition of properties if:

• | a majority of our directors, including a majority of our independent directors, not otherwise interested in such transaction, approves the transaction as being fair and reasonable to us; and


• | the investment by us and such affiliates are on substantially the same terms and conditions.

Real Estate-Related Investments
In addition to our acquisition of medical office buildings, hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, senior housing and other healthcare-related facilities, on an infrequent and opportunistic basis, we also may invest in real estate-related investments, including loans (mortgage, mezzanine, bridge and other loans) and securities investments (common and preferred stock of or other interests in public or private unaffiliated real estate companies, commercial mortgage-backed securities, and certain other securities, including collateralized debt obligations and foreign securities).
Investing In and Originating Loans
Our criteria for making or investing in loans will be substantially the same as those involved in our investment in properties. We do not intend to make loans to other persons, to underwrite securities of other issuers or to engage in the purchase and sale of any types of investments other than those relating to real estate. We will not make or invest in mortgage loans, including a construction loan, on any one property if the aggregate amount of all mortgage loans outstanding on the property, including our loan, would exceed an amount equal to 85.0% of the appraised value of the property, as determined by appraisal, unless we find substantial justification due to other underwriting criteria; however, our policy generally will be that the aggregate amount of all mortgage loans outstanding on the property, including our loan, would not exceed 75.0% of the appraised value of the property. We may find such justification in connection with the purchase of loans in cases in which we believe there is a high probability of our foreclosure upon the property in order to acquire the underlying assets and in which the cost of the loan investment does not exceed the fair market value of the underlying property. We will not invest in or make loans unless an appraisal has been obtained concerning the underlying property, except for those loans insured or guaranteed by a government or government agency. In cases in which a majority of our independent directors so determine and in the event the transaction is with one of our co-sponsors, our advisor, any of our directors or any of their respective affiliates, the appraisal will be obtained from a certified independent appraiser to support its determination of fair market value.
We may invest in first, second and third mortgage loans, mezzanine loans, bridge loans, wraparound mortgage loans, construction mortgage loans on real property, and loans on leasehold interest mortgages. However, we will not make or invest in any loans that are subordinate to any mortgage or equity interest of our advisor, any of our directors, one of our co-sponsors, or any of our affiliates. We also may invest in participations in mortgage loans. A mezzanine loan is a loan made in respect of certain real property but is secured by a lien on the ownership interests of the entity that, directly or indirectly, owns the real property. A bridge loan is short term financing, for an individual or business, until permanent or the next stage of financing can be obtained. Second mortgage and wraparound loans are secured by second or wraparound deeds of trust on real property that is already subject to prior mortgage indebtedness. A wraparound loan is one or more junior mortgage loans having a principal amount equal to the outstanding balance under the existing mortgage loan, plus the amount actually to be advanced under the wraparound mortgage loan. Under a wraparound loan, we would generally make principal and interest payments on behalf of the borrower to the holders of the prior mortgage loans. Third mortgage loans are secured by third deeds of trust on real property that is already subject to prior first and second mortgage indebtedness. Construction loans are loans made for either original development or renovation of property. Construction loans in which we would generally consider an investment would be secured by first deeds of trust on real property for terms generally ranging from six months to two years. Loans on leasehold interests are secured by an assignment of the borrower’s leasehold interest in the particular real property. These loans are generally for terms of from six months to 15 years. The leasehold interest loans are either amortized over a period that is shorter than the lease term or have a maturity date prior to the date the lease terminates. These loans would generally permit us to cure any default under the lease. Mortgage participation investments are investments in partial interests of mortgages of the type described above that are made and administered by third-party mortgage lenders.

In evaluating prospective loan investments, our advisor will consider factors such as the following:

• | the ratio of the investment amount to the underlying property’s value;


• | the property’s potential for capital appreciation;


• | expected levels of rental and occupancy rates;


• | the condition and use of the property;


• | current and projected cash flows of the property;


• | potential for rent increases;


• | the degree of liquidity of the investment;


• | the property’s income-producing capacity;


• | the quality, experience and creditworthiness of the borrower;


• | general economic conditions in the area where the property is located;


• | in the case of mezzanine loans, the ability to acquire the underlying real property; and


• | other factors that our advisor believes are relevant.

In addition, we will seek to obtain a customary lender’s title insurance policy or commitment as to the priority of the mortgage or condition of the title. Because the factors considered, including the specific weight we place on each factor, will vary for each prospective loan investment, we do not, and are not able to, assign a specific weight or level of importance to any particular factor.
We may originate loans from mortgage brokers or personal solicitations of suitable borrowers, or may purchase existing loans that were originated by other lenders. We may purchase existing loans from affiliates, and we may make or invest in loans in which the borrower is an affiliate. Our advisor will evaluate all potential loan investments to determine if the security for the loan and the loan-to-value ratio meets our investment criteria and objectives. Most loans that we will consider for investment would provide for monthly payments of interest and some may also provide for principal amortization, although many loans of the nature that we will consider provide for payments of interest only and a payment of principal in full at the end of the loan term. We will not originate loans with negative amortization provisions.
We are not limited as to the amount of our assets that may be invested in construction loans, mezzanine loans, bridge loans, loans secured by leasehold interests and second, third and wraparound mortgage loans. However, we recognize that these types of loans are riskier than first deeds of trust or first priority mortgages on income-producing, fee-simple properties, and we expect to minimize the amount of these types of loans in our portfolio. Our advisor will evaluate the fact that these types of loans are riskier in determining the rate of interest on the loans. We do not have any policy that limits the amount that we may invest in any single loan or the amount we may invest in loans to any one borrower. We are not limited as to the amount of gross offering proceeds that we may use to invest in or originate loans, and we have not established a portfolio turnover policy with respect to such loans.
Our loan investments may be subject to regulation by federal, state and local authorities and subject to various laws and judicial and administrative decisions imposing various requirements and restrictions, including among other things, regulating credit granting activities, establishing maximum interest rates and finance charges, requiring disclosures to customers, governing secured transactions and setting collection, repossession and claims handling procedures and other trade practices. In addition, certain states have enacted legislation requiring the licensing of mortgage bankers or other lenders and these requirements may affect our ability to effectuate our proposed investments in loans. Commencement of operations in these or other jurisdictions may be dependent upon a finding of our financial responsibility, character and fitness. We may determine not to make loans in any jurisdiction in which the regulatory authority determines that we have not complied in all material respects with applicable requirements.
Investing in Securities 
We may invest in the following types of securities: (i) equity securities such as common stocks, preferred stocks and convertible preferred securities of public or private unaffiliated real estate companies (including other REITs, real estate operating companies and other real estate companies); (ii) debt securities such as commercial mortgage-backed securities and debt securities issued by other unaffiliated real estate companies; and (iii) certain other types of securities that may help us reach our diversification and other investment objectives. These other securities may include, but are not limited to, various types of collateralized debt obligations and certain non-U.S. dollar denominated securities.
10

Our advisor has substantial discretion with respect to the selection of specific securities investments. Our charter provides that we may not invest in equity securities unless a majority of our directors, including a majority of our independent directors, not otherwise interested in the transaction, approve such investment as being fair, competitive and commercially reasonable. Consistent with such requirements, in determining the types of securities investments to make, our advisor will adhere to a board-approved asset allocation framework consisting primarily of components such as: (i) target mix of securities across a range of risk/reward characteristics; (ii) exposure limits to individual securities; and (iii) exposure limits to securities subclasses (such as common equities, debt securities and foreign securities). Within this framework, our advisor will evaluate specific criteria for each prospective securities investment including:

• | positioning the overall portfolio to achieve an optimal mix of real estate and real estate-related investments;


• | diversification benefits relative to the rest of the securities assets within our portfolio;


• | fundamental securities analysis;


• | quality and sustainability of underlying property cash flows;


• | broad assessment of macroeconomic data and regional property level supply and demand dynamics;


• | potential for delivering high current income and attractive risk-adjusted total returns; and


• | additional factors considered important to meeting our investment objectives.

Commercial mortgage-backed securities are securities that evidence interests in, or are secured by, a single commercial mortgage loan or a pool of commercial mortgage loans. Commercial mortgage-backed securities generally are pass-through certificates that represent beneficial ownership interests in common law trusts whose assets consist of defined portfolios of one or more commercial mortgage loans. They typically are issued in multiple tranches whereby the more senior classes are entitled to priority distributions from the trust’s income. Losses and other shortfalls from expected amounts to be received in the mortgage pool are borne by the most subordinate classes, which receive payments only after the more senior classes have received all principal and/or interest to which they are entitled. Commercial mortgage-backed securities are subject to all of the risks of the underlying mortgage loans. We may invest in investment grade and non-investment grade commercial mortgage-backed securities. However, we will not invest more than 10.0% of the proceeds available for investment from our offering in commercial mortgage-backed securities.
We will not invest more than 10.0% of the proceeds available for investment from our offering in equity securities of public or private real estate companies. The specific number and mix of securities in which we invest will depend upon real estate market conditions, other circumstances existing at the time we are investing in our securities, the amount of any future indebtedness that we may incur and any possible future equity offerings. We will not invest in securities of other issuers for the purpose of exercising control and the first or second mortgages in which we intend to invest will likely not be insured by the Federal Housing Administration or guaranteed by the Department of Veterans Affairs or otherwise guaranteed or insured. Real estate-related equity securities are generally unsecured and also may be subordinated to other obligations of the issuer. Our investments in real estate-related equity securities will involve special risks relating to the particular issuer of the equity securities, including the financial condition and business outlook of the issuer.
Our Strategies and Policies With Respect to Borrowing
We have used and intend to continue to use secured and unsecured debt as a means of providing additional funds for the acquisition of properties and real estate-related investments. Our ability to enhance our investment returns and to increase our diversification by acquiring assets using additional funds provided through borrowing could be adversely impacted if banks and other lending institutions reduce the amount of funds available for the types of loans we seek. When interest rates are high or financing is otherwise unavailable on a timely basis, we may purchase certain assets for cash with the intention of obtaining debt financing at a later time. We have also utilized and may continue to utilize derivative financial instruments such as fixed interest rate swaps and caps to add stability to interest expense and to manage our exposure to interest rate movements.
We anticipate that our overall leverage will not exceed 50.0% of the combined market value of all of our real estate, real estate-related investments and joint venture interests, as determined at the end of each calendar year. For these purposes, the fair market value of each asset will be equal to the purchase price paid for the asset or, if the asset was appraised subsequent to the date of purchase, then the fair market value will be equal to the value reported in the most recent independent appraisal of the asset. Our borrowing policies do not limit the amount we may borrow with respect to any individual investment. As of December 31, 2018, our aggregate borrowings were 31.7% of the combined market value of all our real estate and joint venture interest.
11

Our board of directors reviews our aggregate borrowings at least quarterly to ensure that such borrowings are reasonable in relation to our net assets. Our borrowing policies preclude us from borrowing in excess of 300% of our net assets, unless any excess in such borrowing is approved by a majority of our independent directors and is disclosed in our next quarterly report along with justification for such excess. Net assets for purposes of this calculation are defined as our total assets, other than intangibles, valued at cost before deducting depreciation, amortization, bad debt and other similar non-cash reserves, less total liabilities. Generally, the preceding calculation is expected to approximate 75.0% of the aggregate cost of our real estate and real estate-related investments before depreciation, amortization, bad debt and other similar non-cash reserves. However, we may temporarily borrow in excess of these amounts if such excess is approved by a majority of our independent directors and disclosed to stockholders in our next quarterly report, along with justification for such excess. In such event, we will review our debt levels at that time and take action to reduce any such excess as soon as practicable. We are likely to exceed these leverage limitations during the period prior to the investment of all of the net proceeds from our offering and any subsequent offering of our common stock. We may also incur indebtedness to finance improvements to properties and, if necessary, for working capital needs or to meet the distribution requirements applicable to REITs under the federal income tax laws. In addition, if our cash flows from operations are not sufficient to pay the stockholder servicing fee paid with respect to our shares of Class T common stock sold, we will pay the stockholder servicing fee through borrowings in anticipation of future cash flows. As of March 18, 2019 and December 31, 2018, our leverage did not exceed 300% of the value of our net assets. 
By operating on a leveraged basis, we have more funds available for our investments. This generally enables us to make more investments than would otherwise be possible, potentially resulting in enhanced investment returns and a more diversified portfolio. 
Our advisor uses its best efforts to obtain financing on the most favorable terms available to us and refinances assets during the term of a loan only in limited circumstances, such as when a decline in interest rates makes it beneficial to prepay an existing loan, when an existing loan matures or if an attractive investment becomes available and the proceeds from the refinancing can be used to purchase such investment. The benefits of the refinancing may include increased cash flows resulting from reduced debt service requirements, an increase in distributions from proceeds of the refinancing, and an increase in diversification and assets owned if all or a portion of the refinancing proceeds are reinvested.
Our charter restricts us from borrowing money from one of our co-sponsors, our advisor, any of our directors or any of their respective affiliates unless such loan is approved by a majority of our directors, including a majority of our independent directors, not otherwise interested in the transaction as being fair, competitive and commercially reasonable and no less favorable to us than comparable loans between unaffiliated parties.
When incurring secured debt, we may incur recourse indebtedness, which means that the lenders’ rights upon our default generally will not be limited to foreclosure on the property that secured the obligation. If we incur mortgage indebtedness, we will endeavor to obtain level payment financing, meaning that the amount of debt service payable would be substantially the same each year, although some mortgages are likely to provide for one large payment and we may incur floating or adjustable rate financing when our board of directors determines it to be in our best interest.
Our board of directors controls our strategies with respect to borrowing and may change such strategies at any time without stockholder approval, subject to the maximum borrowing limit of 300% of our net assets described above.
Real Estate Acquisitions
Our advisor evaluates various potential investments on our behalf and engage in discussions and negotiations with real property sellers, developers, brokers, lenders, investment managers and others regarding such potential investments. We expect that this will normally occur upon the signing of a purchase agreement for the acquisition of a specific, significant property or real estate-related investment, but may occur before or after such signing or upon the satisfaction or expiration of major contingencies in any such purchase agreement, depending on the particular circumstances surrounding each potential investment. 
Sale or Disposition of Assets
Our advisor and our board of directors will determine whether a particular property should be sold or otherwise disposed of after consideration of the relevant factors, including performance or projected performance of the property and market conditions, with a view toward achieving our principal investment objectives.
12

We intend to hold each property or real estate-related investment we acquire for an extended period. However, circumstances might arise which could result in a shortened holding period for certain investments. In general, the holding period for real estate-related investments other than real property is expected to be shorter than the holding period for real property assets. A property or real estate-related investment may be sold before the end of the expected holding period if:

• | diversification benefits exist associated with disposing of the investment and rebalancing our investment portfolio;


• | an opportunity arises to pursue a more attractive investment;


• | in the judgment of our advisor, the value of the investment might decline;


• | with respect to properties, a major tenant involuntarily liquidates or is in default under its lease;


• | the investment was acquired as part of a portfolio acquisition and does not meet our general acquisition criteria;


• | an opportunity exists to enhance overall investment returns by raising capital through sale of the investment; or


• | in the judgment of our advisor, the sale of the investment is in the best interest of our stockholders.

The determination of whether a particular property or real estate-related investment should be sold or otherwise disposed of will be made after consideration of relevant factors, including prevailing economic conditions, with a view toward maximizing our investment objectives. The terms of payment will be affected by custom in the area in which the investment being sold is located and the then-prevailing economic conditions.
Construction and Development Activities
From time to time, we may construct and develop real estate assets or render services in connection with these activities. We may be able to reduce overall purchase costs by constructing and developing property versus purchasing a finished property. We retain and will continue to retain independent contractors to perform the actual construction work on tenant improvements, such as installing heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems.
Additionally, we may engage our advisor or its affiliates to provide development-related services for all or some of the properties that we acquire for development or refurbishment. In those cases, we pay our advisor or its affiliates a development fee that is usual and customary for comparable services rendered for similar projects in the geographic market where the services are provided. However, we do not pay a development fee to our advisor or its affiliates if our advisor or any of its affiliates elect to receive an acquisition fee based on the cost of such development. In the event that our advisor assists with planning and coordinating the construction of any tenant improvements or capital improvements, our advisor may be paid a construction management fee of up to 5.0% of the cost of such improvements.
Terms of Leases
The terms and conditions of any lease we enter into with our tenants may vary substantially from those we describe in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. However, we expect that a majority of our leases will require the tenant to pay or reimburse us for some or all of the operating expenses of the building based on the tenant’s proportionate share of rentable space within the building. Operating expenses typically include, but are not limited to, real estate taxes, sales and use taxes, special assessments, utilities, insurance and building repairs, and other building operation and management costs. We expect to be responsible for the replacement of specific structural components of a property such as the roof of the building or the parking lot. We expect that many of our leases will have terms of five or more years, some of which may have renewal options.
Board Review of Our Investment Policies and Report of Independent Directors
Our board of directors has established written policies on investments and borrowing. Our board of directors is responsible for monitoring the administrative procedures, investment operations and performance of our company and our advisor to ensure such policies are carried out. Our charter requires that our independent directors review our investment policies at least annually to determine that the policies we are following are in the best interest of our stockholders. Each determination and the basis therefore is required to be set forth in the minutes of the applicable meetings of our directors. Implementation of our investment policies also may vary as new investment techniques are developed. Our investment policies may not be altered by our board of directors without the approval of our stockholders.
As required by our charter, our independent directors have reviewed our policies outlined above and determined that they are in the best interests of our stockholders because: (i) they increase the likelihood that we will be able to acquire a diversified portfolio of income-producing properties, thereby reducing risk in our portfolio; (ii) there are sufficient property acquisition opportunities with the attributes that we seek; (iii) our executive officers, directors and affiliates of our advisor entities have expertise with the type of real estate investments we seek; and (iv) our borrowings will enable us to purchase 
13

assets and earn real estate revenue more quickly, thereby increasing our likelihood of generating income for our stockholders and preserving stockholder capital.
Tax Status
We qualified and elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Code beginning with our taxable year ended December 31, 2016. To maintain our qualification as a REIT, we must meet certain organizational and operational requirements, including our requirement to currently distribute at least 90.0% of our annual taxable income, excluding net capital gains, to our stockholders. As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on taxable income that we distribute to our stockholders. 
Distribution Policy 
In order to maintain our qualification as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, among other things, we are required to distribute at least 90.0% of our annual taxable income, excluding net capital gains, to our stockholders. We cannot predict if we will generate sufficient cash flows to continue to pay cash distributions to our stockholders on an ongoing basis or at all. The amount of any cash distributions is determined by our board of directors and depends on the amount of distributable funds, current and projected cash requirements, tax considerations, any limitations imposed by the terms of indebtedness we may incur and other factors. If our investments produce sufficient cash flows, we expect to continue to pay distributions to our stockholders on a monthly basis. Because our cash available for distribution in any year may be less than 90.0% of our annual taxable income, excluding net capital gains, for the year, we may be required to borrow money, use proceeds from the issuance of securities (in subsequent offerings, if any) or sell assets to pay out enough of our taxable income to satisfy the distribution requirement. These methods of obtaining funds could affect future distributions by increasing operating costs. We did not establish any limit on the amount of net proceeds from our offering, and we have not established any limit on the amount of net proceeds from any future offerings, that may be used to fund distributions, except that, in accordance with our organizational documents and Maryland law, we may not make distributions that would: (i) cause us to be unable to pay our debts as they become due in the usual course of business; or (ii) cause our total assets to be less than the sum of our total liabilities plus senior liquidation preferences.
To the extent that distributions to our stockholders are paid out of our current or accumulated earnings and profits, such distributions are taxable as ordinary income. To the extent that our distributions exceed our current and accumulated earnings and profits, such amounts constitute a return of capital to our stockholders for federal income tax purposes, to the extent of their basis in their stock and thereafter will constitute capital gain. Any portion of distributions to our stockholders paid from net offering proceeds constitutes a return of capital to our stockholders.
Monthly distributions are calculated with daily record dates so distribution benefits begin to accrue immediately upon becoming a stockholder. However, our board of directors could, at any time, elect to pay distributions quarterly to reduce administrative costs. Subject to applicable REIT rules, we generally intend to reinvest proceeds from the sale, financing, refinancing or other disposition of our properties through the purchase of additional properties, although we cannot assure our stockholders that we will be able to do so.
The amount of distributions we pay to our stockholders is determined by our board of directors and is dependent on a number of factors, including funds available for the payment of distributions, our financial condition, capital expenditure requirements, annual distribution requirements needed to maintain our status as a REIT under the Code and restrictions imposed by our organizational documents and Maryland Law.
See Part II, Item 5, Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities — Distributions, for a further discussion of distributions.
Competition
We compete with many other entities engaged in real estate investment activities for acquisitions of medical office buildings, hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, senior housing and other healthcare-related facilities, including international, national, regional and local operators, acquirers and developers of healthcare real estate properties. The competition for healthcare real estate properties may significantly increase the price we must pay for medical office buildings, hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, senior housing and other healthcare-related facilities or other assets we seek to acquire, and our competitors may succeed in acquiring those properties or assets themselves. In addition, our potential acquisition targets may find our competitors to be more attractive because they may have greater resources, may be willing to pay more for the properties or may have a more compatible operating philosophy. In particular, larger healthcare REITs may enjoy significant competitive advantages that result from, among other things, a lower cost of capital and enhanced operating efficiencies. Further, the number of entities and the amount of funds competing for suitable investment properties may increase. This competition will result in increased demand for these assets, and therefore, increased prices paid for them. If there is an increased interest in single-property acquisitions among tax-motivated individual purchasers, we may pay higher prices per property if we purchase 
14

single properties in comparison with portfolio acquisitions. If we pay higher prices per property for medical office buildings, hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, senior housing or other healthcare-related facilities, our business, financial condition, results of operations and our ability to pay distributions to our stockholders may be materially and adversely affected and our stockholders may experience a lower return on their investment.
In addition, income from our investments is dependent on the ability of our tenants and operators to compete with other healthcare operators. These operators compete on a local and regional basis for residents and patients and the operators’ ability to successfully attract and retain residents and patients depends on key factors such as the number of facilities in the local market, the types of services available, the quality of care, reputation, age and appearance of each facility and the cost of care in each locality. Private, federal and state payment programs and the effect of other laws and regulations may also have a significant impact on the ability of our tenants and operators to compete successfully for residents and patients at the properties. For additional information on the risks associated with our business, please see Item 1A, Risk Factors.
Government Regulations
Many laws and governmental regulations are applicable to our properties and changes in these laws and regulations, or their interpretation by agencies and the courts, occur frequently.
Costs of Compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act. Under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, as amended, or the ADA, all public accommodations must meet federal requirements for access and use by disabled persons. Although we believe that we are in substantial compliance with present requirements of the ADA, none of our properties have been audited, nor have investigations of our properties been conducted to determine compliance. Additional federal, state and local laws also may require modifications to our properties or restrict our ability to renovate our properties. We cannot predict the cost of compliance with the ADA or other legislation. We may incur substantial costs to comply with the ADA or any other legislation.
Costs of Government Environmental Regulation and Private Litigation. Environmental laws and regulations hold us liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances which may be on our properties. These laws could impose liability without regard to whether we are responsible for the presence or release of the hazardous materials. Government investigations and remediation actions may have substantial costs and the presence of hazardous substances on a property could result in personal injury or similar claims by private plaintiffs. Various laws also impose liability on a person who arranges for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances and such person often must incur the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous substances at the disposal or treatment facility. These laws often impose liability whether or not the person arranging for the disposal ever owned or operated the disposal facility. As the owner of our properties, we may be deemed to have arranged for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances.
Other Federal, State and Local Regulations. Our properties are subject to various federal, state and local regulatory requirements, such as state and local fire and life safety requirements. If we fail to comply with these various requirements, we may incur governmental fines or private damage awards. While we believe that our properties are and will be in substantial compliance with all of these regulatory requirements, we do not know whether existing requirements will change or whether future requirements will require us to make significant unanticipated expenditures that will adversely affect our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. We believe, based in part on engineering reports which are generally obtained at the time we acquire the properties, that all of our properties comply in all material respects with current regulations. However, if we were required to make significant expenditures under applicable regulations, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to pay distributions could be adversely affected.
Issuing Securities for Property
Subject to limitations contained in our organizational and governance documents, we may issue, or cause to be issued, shares of our stock or limited partnership units in our operating partnership in any manner (and on such terms and for such consideration) in exchange for real estate. Our existing stockholders have no preemptive rights to purchase such shares of our stock or limited partnership units in any such offering, and any such offering might cause a dilution of a stockholder’s initial investment.
In order to induce the contributors of such properties to accept units in our operating partnership, rather than cash, in exchange for their properties, it may be necessary for us to provide them additional incentives. For instance, our operating partnership’s partnership agreement provides that any holder of units may exchange limited partnership units on a one-for-one basis for shares of our common stock, or, at our option, cash equal to the value of an equivalent number of shares of our common stock. We may, however, enter into additional contractual arrangements with contributors of property under which we would agree to repurchase a contributor’s units for shares of our common stock or cash, at the option of the contributor, at set times. In order to allow a contributor of a property to defer taxable gain on the contribution of property to our operating partnership, we might agree not to sell a contributed property for a defined period of time or until the contributor exchanged the 
15

contributor’s units for cash or shares of our common stock. Such an agreement would prevent us from selling those properties, even if market conditions made such a sale favorable to us. Such transactions are subject to the risks described in Item 1A, Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Business — We may structure acquisitions of property in exchange for limited partnership units in our operating partnership on terms that could limit our liquidity or our flexibility. Although we may enter into such transactions with other existing or future American Healthcare Investors or Griffin Capital programs, we do not currently intend to do so. If we were to enter into such a transaction with an entity managed by one of our co-sponsors or its affiliates, we would be subject to the risks described in Item 1A, Risk Factors — Risks Related to Conflicts of Interest. We may acquire assets from, or dispose of assets to, affiliates of our advisor, which could result in us entering into transactions on less favorable terms than we would receive from a third party or that negatively affect the public’s perception of us. 
Significant Tenants
As of December 31, 2018, we had one tenant that accounted for 10.0% or more of our total property portfolio’s annualized base rent or annualized net operating income, or NOI, as follows:

Tenant | AnnualizedBase Rent(1) | | Percentage of Annualized Base Rent | Acquisition | Reportable Segment | GLA(Sq Ft) | Lease ExpirationDate
RC Tier Properties, LLC | $ | 7,629,000 | | 12.5% | Missouri SNF Portfolio | Skilled Nursing | 385,000 | 09/30/33

___________

(1) | Annualized base rent is based on contractual base rent from leases in effect as of December 31, 2018. The loss of this tenant or its inability to pay rent could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.

Geographic Concentration
Based on leases in effect as of December 31, 2018, three states in the United States accounted for 10.0% or more of our total property portfolio’s annualized base rent or annualized NOI. Properties located in Missouri, Michigan and Florida accounted for 14.0%, 10.6% and 10.3%, respectively, of our total property portfolio’s annualized base rent or annualized NOI. Accordingly, there is a geographic concentration of risk subject to fluctuations in each state’s economy. For a further discussion, see Item 2, Properties — Geographic Diversification/Concentration Table.
Employees
We have no employees and our executive officers are all employees of one of our co–sponsors. Our day-to-day management is performed by our advisor and its affiliates. We cannot determine at this time if or when we might hire any employees, although we do not anticipate hiring any employees during the next twelve months. We do not directly compensate our executive officers for services rendered to us. However, our executive officers, consultants and the executive officers and key employees of our advisor and its affiliates are eligible for awards pursuant to the 2015 Incentive Plan, or our incentive plan. As of December 31, 2018, no awards had been granted to our executive officers, consultants or the executive officers or key employees of our advisor or its affiliates under this plan.
Investment Company Act Considerations 
We conduct and intend to continue to conduct our operations, and the operations of our operating partnership and any other subsidiaries, so that no such entity meets the definition of an “investment company” under Section 3(a)(1) of the Investment Company Act. We primarily engage in the business of investing in real estate assets; however, our portfolio may include, to a much lesser extent, other real estate-related investments. We also have acquired and may continue to acquire real estate assets through investments in joint venture entities, including joint venture entities in which we may not own a controlling interest. We anticipate that our assets generally will be held in wholly and majority-owned subsidiaries of the company, each formed to hold a particular asset. We monitor our operations and our assets on an ongoing basis in order to ensure that neither we, nor any of our subsidiaries, meet the definition of “investment company” under Section 3(a)(1) of the Investment Company Act. Among other things, we monitor the proportion of our portfolio that is placed in investments in securities.
Financial Information About Industry Segments
Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, Topic 280, Segment Reporting, establishes standards for reporting financial and descriptive information about a public entity’s reportable segments. We segregate our operations into reporting segments in order to assess the performance of our business in the same way that management reviews our performance and makes operating decisions. Accordingly, when we acquired our first medical office building in June 2016; senior housing facility in December 2016; senior housing — RIDEA facility in November 2017; and 
16

skilled nursing facility in March 2018, we added a new reportable segment at each such time. As of December 31, 2018, we operated through four reportable business segments — medical office buildings, senior housing, senior housing — RIDEA and skilled nursing facilities.
Medical Office Buildings. As of December 31, 2018, we owned 29 medical office buildings, or MOBs. These properties typically contain physicians’ offices and examination rooms and may also include pharmacies, hospital ancillary service space and outpatient services such as diagnostic centers, rehabilitation clinics and day-surgery operating rooms. While these properties are similar to commercial office buildings, they require additional parking spaces as well as plumbing, electrical and mechanical systems to accommodate multiple exam rooms that may require sinks in every room and special equipment such as x-ray machines. In addition, MOBs are often built to accommodate higher structural loads for certain equipment and may contain “vaults” or other specialized construction. Our MOBs are typically multi-tenant properties leased to healthcare providers (hospitals and physician practices). Based on GLA, approximately 42.5% of our MOBs are located on hospital campuses and 19.8% are affiliated with hospital systems. Our medical office buildings segment accounted for approximately 40.7%, 67.0% and 96.0% of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. 
Senior Housing. As of December 31, 2018, we owned 18 senior housing facilities. Senior housing facilities cater to different segments of the elderly population based upon their personal needs. Services provided by our tenants in these facilities are primarily paid for by the residents directly or through private insurance and are less reliant on government reimbursement programs such as Medicaid and Medicare. Our senior housing facilities are leased to single tenants under triple-net lease structures. Our senior housing segment accounted for approximately 10.6%, 16.4% and 4.0% of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. 
Senior Housing — RIDEA. As of December 31, 2018, we owned and operated 12 senior housing facilities utilizing a RIDEA structure. Such facilities are of a similar property type as our senior housing segment discussed above; however, we have entered into agreements with healthcare operators to manage the facilities on our behalf utilizing a RIDEA structure. Substantially all of our leases with residents in the senior housing facilities are for a term of one year or less. Our senior housing — RIDEA segment accounted for approximately 43.6% and 16.6% of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. We did not own and operate any senior housing facilities utilizing a RIDEA structure for the year ended December 31, 2016.
Skilled Nursing Facilities. As of December 31, 2018, we owned 10 skilled nursing facilities, or SNFs. SNFs offer restorative, rehabilitative and custodial nursing care for people not requiring the more extensive and sophisticated treatment available at hospitals. Ancillary revenues and revenues from sub-acute care services are derived from providing services to residents beyond room and board and include occupational, physical, speech, respiratory and intravenous therapy, wound care, oncology treatment, brain injury care and orthopedic therapy as well as sales of pharmaceutical products and other services. Certain SNFs provide some of the foregoing services on an out-patient basis. Skilled nursing services provided by our tenants in these SNFs are primarily paid for either by private sources or through the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Our SNFs are leased to a single tenant under a triple-net lease structure. Our skilled nursing facilities segment accounted for approximately 5.1% of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018. We did not own any skilled nursing facilities for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.
For a further discussion of our segment reporting for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, see Note 17, Segment Reporting, to the Consolidated Financial Statements that are a part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
