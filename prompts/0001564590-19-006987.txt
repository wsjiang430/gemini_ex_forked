General
 Forrester Research, Inc. is a global independent research, data, and advisory services firm.  We work with business and technology leaders to help them develop customer-obsessed strategies that drive growth. Forrester’s unique insights are grounded in annual surveys of more than 675,000 consumers and business leaders worldwide, rigorous and objective research methodologies, and the shared wisdom of our clients.  Through proprietary research and data, custom consulting, exclusive executive peer groups and events, Forrester challenges the thinking of its clients and positions them to lead change in their organizations in an era of powerful customers.
 We were incorporated in Massachusetts on July 7, 1983 and reincorporated in Delaware on February 16, 1996.
 Our Internet address is www.forrester.com. We make available free of charge, on or through the investor information section of our website, annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, and current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the SEC.
 On January 3, 2019, we acquired SiriusDecisions, Inc., a privately held company based in Wilton, Connecticut with approximately 350 employees globally.  SiriusDecisions helps companies worldwide by delivering actionable intelligence, transformative frameworks and expert guidance that equip executives to modernize and elevate sales, marketing and product performance.  We believe that the combination of our expertise in strategy with SiriusDecisions’ focus on operational excellence will enable our clients to know what they should do, why they should do it, and how to do it. The acquisition creates several opportunities for us, including cross-selling services to our respective client bases, extending SiriusDecisions’ platform, methodologies, data, and best-practices tools into new roles, and accelerating international and industry growth.  See Note 15 - Subsequent Events, to the financial statements.  The following description of our business reflects our business as of December 31, 2018 and does not reflect the acquisition of SiriusDecisions, other than as explicitly indicated.
 Industry Background
 Enterprises struggle to keep up with digitally-savvy, empowered customers and maintain differentiation in a disruption-rich market.  Technology changes and innovations occur at an increasingly rapid pace. Developing comprehensive and coordinated business strategies is increasingly difficult as consumers and businesses adopt new methods of buying and selling, and markets grow increasingly dynamic. 
 Consequently, companies and the professionals in the roles we serve must rely on external sources of independent business advice spanning a variety of areas including but not limited to customer behavior, technology investments, and business strategy. We believe there is a need for objective research, data, advisory and related services that allow our clients to see, interpret, and act to respond to complex market dynamics and the extraordinary pace of technology change.
 Forrester’s® Strategy
 Empowered customers are ushering in a new “Age of the Customer” that we believe will reshape the way organizations succeed and grow. Our differentiated strategy, products, and services are designed to help those enterprises satisfy their increasingly dynamic customer bases. 
 3
 
Driven by our strategy, we: 1) help our clients stay current with and understand their dynamic customers, 2) advise marketing and strategy executives such as Chief Marketing Officers as they seek to win those customers, and 3) work with technology management executives such as Chief Information Officers as they build systems to satisfy customers. Technology is moving from being a tool for managing and lowering operating costs to a means of generating market opportunities and revenue.  Given this shift, today’s technology management professionals have two agendas – a traditional back-office agenda of running internal systems, and a business technology (BT) agenda that provides the technology, systems, and processes to win, serve and retain customers.  In today’s market, we believe few companies will succeed that are unable to capitalize on the full value of business technologies and harness data to deliver differentiated experiences. 
 Importantly, the three areas where we work with our clients (understanding their customers, winning their customers, and building technology to serve their customers) are highly interrelated in the large organizations that we serve.  This creates opportunities to sell add-on products and services to our existing clients.  In addition, we believe our go to market strategy is unique, increasing our competitive differentiation.  
 Our core capabilities combine to deliver a comprehensive set of products and solutions to help our clients compete and win in the Age of the Customer.  Our ability to customize our solutions to specific industries provides a powerful method to drive the success of our clients and creates significant opportunities to consistently enrich our relationships with our clients.

Forrester Research
 Forrester’s published research and decision tools enable clients to better anticipate and capitalize on the disruptive forces affecting their businesses and organizations.  We believe Forrester Research provides insights and frameworks to drive growth in a complex and dynamic market. Our primary syndicated research product, named Research, provides clients with access to our core syndicated research designed to inform their strategic decision-making. Research includes our Playbooks, a set of integrated reports, tools, and guidance for critical business initiatives, and our Reports, designed to deepen clients’ understanding of market, customer, and technology trends through data-driven reports, case studies, predictions, and strategic road maps.  Our syndicated research also includes The Forrester Wave,TM our primary mechanism for evaluating enterprise technologies. The Forrester Wave provides a detailed analysis of vendors’ technologies and services based on transparent, fully accessible criteria, and measurement of characteristics weighted by us. The Forrester Wave allows clients to compare products and develop a custom shortlist based on the client’s unique requirements.  Since 2017 we have also published Forrester Industry Waves, which evaluate the digital experiences of firms that serve end customers, and Forrester New Waves, which evaluate vendors in emerging markets.
 Our Age of the Customer Research offering, which combines our Business Technology (BT) and Marketing and Strategy (M&S) Research offerings, is closely aligned with our strategy of addressing our clients’ and prospects’ opportunities and challenges in the Age of the Customer. In addition to the Age of the Customer Research offering, our various Research offerings include standalone BT Research and M&S Research, as well as our TI (Technology Industry) Research offering designed specifically for technology vendors. Each of our Research offerings consists of a library of cross-linked documents that interconnect our playbooks, reports, data, product rankings, best practices, evaluation tools, and research archives. Research access is provided through role-based websites that facilitate client access to research and tools that are most relevant to their professional roles, including community tools that allow interaction between and among clients and our analysts. 
 We also offer clients the opportunity to license electronic “reprints” of designated Research for posting to a client’s website(s) for a designated period of time to support a client’s marketing or business objectives.  Electronic reprints are hosted on an on-line platform that enables interactive content and provides us with improved tracking of distribution of our intellectual property.
 Research Methodology
 We employ a structured methodology in our research that enables us to identify and analyze business technology trends, markets, and audiences and ensures consistent research quality and recommendations across all coverage areas. We ascertain the issues important to our clients and prospects through thousands of interactions and surveys with technology vendors and business, marketing, and technology professionals, and accordingly, the majority of our research is focused on helping our clients increase their customer focus and grow their business. We use the following primary research inputs:

• | Our own proprietary data from our CX Index™, Consumer Technographics®, Business Technographics, and ForecastView products.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Confidential interviews with early adopters and mainstream users of new technologies across technology, marketing, and strategy roles at end-user companies.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | In-depth interviews with business technology vendors and suppliers of related services.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Ongoing briefings with vendors to review current positions and future directions.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Continuous dialogue with our clients to identify business and technology opportunities in the marketplace.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Collaboration among research, product, data and consulting professionals is an integral part of our process, leading to higher-quality research and a unified perspective. Our global research and product organization supports our client base by facilitating research and product collaboration and quality, promoting a uniform client experience and improved customer satisfaction, and encouraging innovation.

The initial course, called Foundations, enables CX practitioners and other CX proponents within our clients’ organizations to learn the core skills needed to carry out a CX program aimed at driving business growth, and the certification provides professional recognition to help these individuals stand out as possessing unique skills in the growing field of CX.  Participants in the program engage in hands-on activities that result in deliverables that can be put into practice immediately in their own CX programs.

Forrester Events
 We host multiple events in various locations in North America, Europe and Asia throughout the year. Events bring together executives and other participants serving or interested in the particular subject matter or professional role(s) on which an event focuses. Event participants come together to network with their peers, meet with Forrester analysts, and hear business leaders discuss business and technology issues of interest or significance to the professionals in attendance. Forrester Events focus on business imperatives of significant interest to our clients, including succeeding in the Age of the Customer, customer experience, digital transformation, privacy and security, new technology and innovation, and marketing leadership, and provide immersive experiences to challenge clients’ thinking and help clients to lead change.  
 Sales and Marketing
 We sell our products and services through our direct sales force in various locations in North America, Europe, Asia, and Australia. Our sales organization is organized into five groups based on client size, geography and market potential. Our Premier group focuses on our largest vendor and end user clients across the globe and our Core group focuses on small to mid-sized vendor and end user clients. Our European and Asia Pacific groups focus on both end user and vendor clients in their respective geographies.  Our International Business Development group sells our products and services through independent sales representatives in select international locations.  We employed 528 sales personnel as of December 31, 2018 compared to 539 sales personnel employed as of December 31, 2017. We also sell select Research products directly online through our website.
 In 2018, we substantially completed the work commenced in 2016 to evolve our customer engagement model to better serve and engage our clients and prospects and drive profitable growth, extending the model to our European and Asia Pacific groups. Our sales process has moved to a model where we provide different sales engagement and support levels for clients and prospects in our Premier and Core groups.  We believe that our customer engagement model changes will improve client and dollar retention and enrichment and accelerate growth.
 Our marketing activities are designed to enhance the Forrester brand, differentiate and promote Forrester products and solutions, improve the client experience, and drive growth.  We achieve these outcomes by combining the value of analytics, content, social media, public relations, and creative and field marketing, delivering multi-channel campaigns, Forrester Events, and high-quality digital journeys.
 As of December 31, 2018, our products and services were delivered to more than 2,300 client companies. No single client company accounted for more than 3% of our 2018 revenues.
 Pricing and Contracts
 We report our revenue from client contracts in two categories of revenue: (1) research services and (2) advisory services and events. We classify revenue from subscriptions to our Research, Leadership Boards and Executive Programs, and Analytics products and services as research services revenue. We classify revenue from Forrester Consulting, custom Forrester Analytics projects, and Forrester Events as advisory services and events revenue.
 Contract pricing for annual memberships for research and/or other subscription-based products is principally a function of the number of licensed users at the client. Pricing of contracts for advisory services generally is a fixed fee for the consulting project or shorter-term advisory service. We periodically review and increase the list prices for our products and services.
 We track the agreement value of contracts to purchase our services as a significant business indicator. We calculate agreement value as the total revenues recognizable from all such contracts in force at a given time (excluding contracts that consist solely of advisory and consulting services and the value of Forrester Events sponsorships included in all contracts), without regard to how much revenue has already been recognized. Agreement value increased 10% to $266.3 million at December 31, 2018 from $242.9 million at December 31, 2017.

Competition
 We compete principally in the market for research, data, and advisory services, with an emphasis on customer behavior, customer experience, and the deployment of business technology to win, serve and retain customers.  We believe that the principal competitive factors in the markets we participate in include:

• | the ability to offer products and services that meet the changing needs of organizations and their executives for research, data, and advisory services;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | comprehensive global data and insights on customer behavior;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


• | independent analysis and opinions;
--+-----------------------------------


• | the ability to render our services in digital forms;
--+-----------------------------------------------------


• | the pricing and packaging of our products and services; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------


• | customer service, including the quality of professional interactions with our clients.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We believe we compete favorably on these factors due to:
  
• | our differentiated Age of the Customer strategy and portfolio of complementary Age of the Customer products and services;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | our research methodology;
--+--------------------------


• | our experience with and focus on emerging technologies;
--+--------------------------------------------------------


• | our history of providing research and executable advice on the impact of technology on business; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | our growing ability to deploy digital products.
--+------------------------------------------------

 Our principal direct competitors include other independent providers of research and advisory services, such as Gartner, as well as marketing agencies, general business consulting firms, survey-based general market research firms, providers of peer networking services, and digital media measurement services. In addition, our indirect competitors include the internal planning and marketing staffs of our current and prospective clients, as well as other information providers such as electronic and print publishing companies. We also face competition from free sources of information available on the Internet, such as Google. Our indirect competitors could choose to compete directly against us in the future. In addition, there are relatively few barriers to entry into certain segments of our market, and new competitors could readily seek to compete against us in one or more of these market segments. Increased competition could adversely affect our operating results through pricing pressure and loss of market share. There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to compete successfully against existing or new competitors.
 Employees
 As of December 31, 2018, we employed a total of 1,432 persons, including 559 Research, Connect, Analytics, Consulting and Events staff and 528 sales personnel.
 Our culture emphasizes certain key values — including client service, courage, collaboration, integrity and quality — that we believe are critical to our future growth. We promote these values through training and frequent recognition for achievement. We encourage teamwork and promote and recognize individuals who foster these values. New employees participate in a three-day training process that focuses on our Age of the Customer strategy, our products and services, corporate culture, values and goals.
