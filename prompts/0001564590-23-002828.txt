Item 1. Business. 
 Overview
 Our mission is to connect everyone in construction on a global platform.
 We are a leading provider of cloud-based construction management software, and are helping transform one of the oldest, largest, and least digitized industries in the world. We focus exclusively on connecting and empowering the construction industry’s key stakeholders, such as owners, general contractors, specialty contractors, architects, and engineers, to collaborate and access our capabilities from any location on any internet-connected device. Our platform is modernizing and digitizing construction management by enabling real-time access to critical project information, simplifying complex workflows, and facilitating seamless communication among key stakeholders, all of which we believe positions us to serve as the system of record for the construction industry. We are also developing other programs and services, such as our materials financing program, to address related challenges faced by the construction industry’s key stakeholders. Adoption of our products and services helps our customers increase productivity and efficiency, reduce rework and costly delays, improve safety and compliance, and enhance financial transparency and accountability.
 In short, we build the software for the people that build the world.
 We have established our leading market position by focusing on serving the unique needs of the construction industry. We work directly with stakeholders to develop the products and services they need and to provide high-quality support, available to all users at no additional charge. Our five integrated product categories—Preconstruction, Project Execution, Workforce Management, Financial Management, and Construction Intelligence—automate workflows, provide real-time visibility, offer advanced analytics, and support collaboration across key stages of the construction project lifecycle. Each of our products can be accessed from the office or the jobsite on computers, smartphones, and tablets, enabling users to work wherever the job requires. Our open application programming interfaces (“APIs”) and our application marketplace (“App Marketplace”) allow customers to integrate our products with their internal systems and over 400 integrations including accounting, document management, and scheduling software, providing our users with choice and flexibility, and demonstrably increasing the stickiness of our platform as we aim to become the construction industry’s system of record. Our customers range from small businesses managing a few million dollars of annual construction volume to global enterprises managing billions of dollars of annual construction volume. Our core customers are owners, general contractors, and specialty contractors operating across the commercial, residential, industrial, and infrastructure segments of the construction industry. We generate substantially all of our revenue from subscriptions to access our products. We primarily sell our products on a subscription basis for a fixed fee with pricing generally based on the number and mix of products a customer subscribes to and the fixed aggregate dollar volume of construction work contracted to run on our platform annually, which we refer to as annual construction volume. As our customers subscribe to additional products or increase the annual construction volume contracted to run on our platform we generate more revenue. We do not provide refunds for unused construction volume, or charge customers based on consumption or on a per project basis. Our customers rely on our platform to help run their businesses more efficiently.
 Our business model is designed to encourage rapid, widespread adoption of our products by allowing for unlimited users, meaning we do not charge a per-seat or per-user fee. Customers can invite all project participants to engage with our platform as part of a project team. Customers typically invite participants to join our platform, including their employees and collaborators, which are other project participants that engage with our platform but do not pay us for such use. Collaborators have access to relevant project information and product features for the duration of their involvement in a project and are incentivized to become customers, as collaborators do not control what information they get access to, may not be able to access project information after a job is complete, and cannot run their complete portfolio of projects on our platform. Once collaborators have used our platform, they may potentially become customers and evangelize Procore on future projects. 
 We believe that our business model creates a flywheel effect that has helped increase our customer count, from 10,166 as of December 31, 2020, to 12,193 as of December 31, 2021, to 14,488 as of December 31, 2022, reflecting a year-over-year growth rate of 20% and 19% in 2021 and 2022, respectively. The increase of 2,295 net new customers in 2022 includes 189 customers from LaborChart, Inc. (“LaborChart”) when it was fully integrated into the sales process in the third quarter of 2022. We have also seen an increase in the number of customers that contributed more than $100,000 of annual recurring revenue (“ARR”), which grew from 843 as of December 31, 2020, to 1,111 as of December 31, 2021, to 1,576 as of December 31, 2022, reflecting year-over-year growth rates of 32% in 2021 and 42% in 2022. All customer counts aforementioned exclude customers acquired from Levelset and Esticom, Inc. (“Esticom”), which have not yet been renewed onto standard Procore

annual contracts. Remaining Levelset and Esticom legacy customers will be included in our customer and ARR metrics once they are renewed onto standard Procore annual contracts or upon integration of Levelset and Esticom into Procore’s sales process.
 Our success in building our customer base, expanding usage for existing customers, and helping digitize the industry has allowed us to achieve significant growth. We generated revenue of $400.3 million in 2020, $514.8 million in 2021, and $720.2 million in 2022, representing year-over-year growth of 29% in 2021 and 40% in 2022. We had net losses of $96.2 million in 2020, $265.2 million in 2021, and $286.9 million in 2022.
 Our Industry
 The construction ecosystem is highly fragmented and specialized.
 The construction process relies on coordination among highly fragmented and specialized groups, including key stakeholders such as owners, general contractors, specialty contractors, architects, and engineers. These stakeholders engage in financing, budgeting, designing, building, and maintaining commercial, residential, industrial, and infrastructure projects while navigating varying responsibilities, risk profiles, and motives. Completing a project safely, on time, and within budget requires effective collaboration between stakeholders across workstreams, sharing information in a timely and effective manner, and navigating increasing contractual and regulatory complexity.
 Key stakeholders in the construction ecosystem are:
  
• | Owners. Owners initiate construction projects, secure financing, work with architects, engineers, and consultants on building design, hire general contractors to manage the construction process, and are the ultimate decision-makers throughout a project. Owners include corporations, universities, government entities, and commercial and residential real estate developers. Once a project is completed, owners are responsible for operating, leasing, or selling the structure, or outsourcing such processes to a third party.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | General contractors. General contractors coordinate the construction project and fulfill the demands of owners while simultaneously maintaining oversight and responsibility for specialty contractors and other vendors.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Specialty contractors. Specialty contractors, commonly referred to as subcontractors, are hired by general contractors for their specialized skills, such as mechanical, electrical, plumbing, roofing, or concrete trades, and perform the vast majority of construction work, including sourcing materials.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Architects and engineers. Architects and engineers work together to develop building plans and designs, collaborating directly with owners and general contractors. Typically, architects are responsible for designing the aesthetic look and feel of a structure, while engineers focus on safety and functionality, materials, and structural design.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The construction industry has four defining characteristics:
  
• | Construction is a custom business. Construction projects are typically custom and each project has a distinctive combination of dynamic variables, including unique project teams, design, materials, financing, terrain, regulations, and schedules.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The workforce is mobile and decentralized. Construction happens on the jobsite, not at the office, which increases the importance of mobile access to project data. Construction workers often operate with out-of-date or incomplete project information and struggle to collaborate effectively with other stakeholders, leading to mistakes that may translate to costly rework and extended project timelines. Given mistakes not only impact the progress of the project but also expose workers to safety risks, the need for mobile collaboration solutions and real-time access to instructions, designs, documentation, and reporting is becoming increasingly critical for managing and optimizing a dispersed workforce.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Stakeholder dynamics are complex. Construction projects require collaboration across a wide range of stakeholders who often have a different set of interests and lack familiarity and trust with one another, yet all are interdependent and ultimately share project risks. Similarly, all project participants are adversely impacted when a project is delayed, runs over budget, or does not meet quality or safety requirements. For example, a concrete contractor may not be able to pour concrete on a project until the mechanical, electrical, and plumbing (“MEP”) contractors complete their scope of work. If the MEP contractors fail to complete their tasks as scheduled and that delay is not properly communicated to all affected stakeholders, then not only could the project fall behind schedule but the concrete may still arrive at the jobsite as originally scheduled, become unusable, and need to be disposed of,

driving up costs and impacting profit margins. In order to avoid related financial losses, stakeholders are often quick to redirect responsibility to other participants on a project and seek to resolve disputes in court.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Change is constant. Construction project designs, schedules, and budgets are modified frequently. Construction teams typically run into unforeseen issues requiring a workaround, or the owner may decide to make a modification to the project. As a result, the design that teams set out to build rarely matches the finished product. An event as small as a delayed inspection that adjusts worker schedules, or as significant as discovering an unexpected boulder during excavation that requires special equipment to remove, can trigger costly changes to a project’s schedule and require timely communication to teams on the ground to minimize or avoid mistakes.

Our Approach
 We believe that we are well-positioned to extend our leading market position, not only through promoting the rapid adoption of our products, services, and platform, but also through our dedicated efforts to invest in and positively impact the future success of the construction community. We believe that our success is driven by the quality of our products, services, and platform and our strong relationships with our customers and the broader construction industry. Our approach is based on two key elements:

• | We live and breathe construction. Our products, services, and platform are focused on the construction industry, and we build them for the diverse requirements of industry stakeholders. We have deep domain expertise and an understanding of the construction industry’s complex workflows, incentive structures, and the risks each stakeholder faces on a project. We also partner with the industry beyond providing software. Several of our initiatives, including Jobsite, our industry-focused blog site, Procore Community, our online user community forum, and Groundbreak, our annual construction industry conference, are designed to grow community engagement across our platform. We also offer additional resources to the construction community, including certified continuing education courses, training programs, online content libraries, and free software to universities, schools, trade unions, and non-profits through our in-house social impact team, Procore.org.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We put our customers first. We make our products intuitive and easy-to-use, whether from a computer, smartphone, or tablet, in the field or in the back office, so that everyone can adopt and benefit from the power of our products. A core part of our strategy is our user-centric development culture. We engage with the construction community to understand its needs and work with our customers to develop, iterate, and improve our products and technology. Our customer support team provides live support to all users at no additional cost, as well as numerous online resources, because we believe that if all users are successful, then our customers will be successful.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Platform
 Our platform is built to be modern, intuitive, and open with a modular and extensible architecture that not only includes the breadth and depth of functionality of our own products, but also integrates with third-party applications and our customers’ own customized applications. While we offer a broad set of products that we primarily monetize through subscriptions, our platform includes a wide range of technical services that are shared across our products and open APIs that enable us to extend the capabilities of our platform to the broader ecosystem of software that our customers use.
 Our platform offers our customers and collaborators online and offline access to critical project information and capabilities that address a range of evolving needs throughout a project’s lifecycle, including bidding, scheduling, building information modeling (“BIM”), labor tracking, financial management, and more. Our platform streamlines communication and facilitates compliance with safety and other regulatory standards, which helps increase productivity and efficiency, reduces rework and costly delays, improves safety and compliance, and enhances collaboration and accountability among key stakeholders.
 Product Categories
  
• | Preconstruction. Selecting the right specialty contractors and vendors for a construction project is critical to the successful outcome of the project. The process is often manual, disorganized, time-consuming, and resource-intensive, requiring the collection of extensive documentation and multi-faceted bids that typically include sensitive information. Our Preconstruction products facilitate collaboration between internal and external stakeholders during the planning, budgeting, estimating, bidding, and partner selection phase of a construction project. Our products are designed to help reduce financial and operational risk across key stakeholders before construction begins.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Project Execution. Construction teams struggle with poor communication between the field and office, time-consuming processes, and getting updated and accurate information to all project stakeholders. Teams often lack the ability to effectively collaborate on workflows, such as structure design, or changes to plans that become necessary in the field. Tracking project progress and ensuring procedures are in line with quality and safety standards is often manual or done using disparate point solutions. These dynamics lead to risky work environments, rework, training gaps, and strained relationships, often resulting in millions of dollars in cost overruns and litigation. Our Project Execution products connect entire construction project teams by ensuring project information is aggregated in a cloud-based platform, available to all project participants, and accurate so that work on the jobsite is completed correctly. Our products and platform enable real-time collaboration, information storage, design, BIM model clash detection, and regulation compliance for teams on the jobsite and in the back office.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Workforce Management. Construction teams responsible for performing work on the jobsite are often unable to efficiently track labor productivity, which leads to schedule delays, inefficient use of time, margin loss, and rework. Our Workforce Management product helps customers address these problems by allowing contractors to better schedule, track and forecast labor productivity, improve time management, communicate more efficiently with their workforces, and better manage profitability on construction projects. By using our products, customers are also creating detailed productivity records that can be referenced during the bidding process.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Financial Management. Managing construction financials is often a slow, expensive, and manual data entry process. Construction teams need to be able to monitor budgets on individual projects and across entire portfolios of projects in order to maximize project profitability and plan for the long-term. Teams lack real-time access to accurate financial data that is critical to managing changes that impact budgets or allow for efficient invoicing. Our Financial Management products provide customers with visibility into the financial health of their individual construction projects and portfolios, and facilitate untethered access to financial data, linking the field and the office in real-time. Our products improve cost management, invoice collection and review, lien rights management, and budget forecasting and tracking. Our platform also supports integrations with a majority of the industry’s preferred accounting systems.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Construction Intelligence. Construction Intelligence is a set of holistic solutions that offers advanced analytics and business intelligence capabilities, allowing customers to capture, manage, and learn from data for streamlined and robust project and portfolio reporting, analytics, and artificial intelligence (“AI”)-guided workflows, as well as to monitor projects and drive more informed decision-making for their business needs. With Construction Intelligence, information and data collected during the course of construction using our products becomes a catalyst for creating a culture of data-driven analysis and decision making at each level of a customer’s organization. Our Construction Intelligence products provide access to 12 pre-built reports and over 145 pre-built report pages and the ability to build custom visualizations leveraging their enterprise data in Microsoft Power BI. Cross-tool reporting, configurable dashboards, and advanced data visualization all help turn project data into business insights.

Procore App Marketplace
 Our platform gives customers the freedom to connect with third-party integrations currently in our App Marketplace. Our App Marketplace extends the functionality of our existing products, connecting critical business workflows and processes, and enabling customers to maintain a single system of record while being able to leverage software solutions providing an array of functionality. This ecosystem provides customers with support in analytics, accounting and finance, scheduling, insurance, compliance, and customer relationship management, among many other categories. While our customers may pay fees to certain third-party developers in order to use their applications that integrate with our platform, we do not earn any fees or commissions from either our customers or these third-party developers for accessing or using our App Marketplace.
 Our App Marketplace represents a key competitive differentiator for us and has been widely adopted by our customers, providing significant value while demonstrably increasing the stickiness of our products and providing a future pipeline for potential acquisitions. Within the construction industry, integration of third-party applications with our platform and a presence in the App Marketplace are increasingly seen as requirements for adoption and usage by our customer base.
 Procore Shared Technology Services
 Our platform includes a number of shared services that underlie our products and enable us to launch new products and extend the capabilities of our existing products. The user directory, reporting, tasks, search, and other components of our platform are examples of the underlying shared services that our customers can use across our products. In order to create a centralized hub for construction project information, we have developed an open and extensible platform that connects our customers’ business applications, people, devices, and data. We have also developed highly configurable forms, data fields, and workflows, enabling our customers to centralize their data on our platform. Our platform services are designed around four 
 7
 

defining attributes that increase the breadth and depth of our offering, improve usability, and enable a unified experience. These include:
  
• | UI Customization. Our platform is designed to be flexible and adaptable, providing native mobile and desktop user interfaces (“UI”) to both our internal and third-party developers. This means developers can accelerate design and development efforts by accessing Procore’s core UI components and design guidelines, helping to ensure a consistent user experience. We also offer third-party developers the ability to create embedded applications, which we call Embedded Apps, a feature that allows developers to insert their apps directly into our UI. This creates an experience that reduces user friction and context switching between different applications, while providing our familiar UI to users when introducing new integrations.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Customizable Business Logic. Our products are designed to work the way our users work. Customers can create designated workflows to match the approval sequence and processes that are appropriate for their businesses. Our platform offers configurable fields and forms, improving the degree of precision with which customers can track data and secure documentation. Additionally, our platform offers comprehensive user permission functionality. These permissions define who has access to certain project and company-level information. By default, we provide customers with several role-based permission templates, and these permissions are configurable down to the tool access level by user.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | APIs. Our platform features developer-friendly open APIs and tools that are designed to empower our customers and third-party developers to build their own integrations or customized applications, thereby expanding the functionality of our products.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Data. As data is generated on our platform, it is securely stored in centralized databases. Our platform enables our customers to search across their data, empowering real-time analytics and customizable reporting. Users have access to insights that can be derived from data generated by their account usage across our platform. Additionally, our platform allows us to collect aggregated, anonymized data that we can use to develop new products, services, and features, as well as better support our customers as they navigate challenging industry and market conditions. We are also developing risk modeling to price risk in offerings such as our materials financing program and utilize predictive data to tailor those offerings to fit our customers’ needs. We also expect to leverage data to build AI and machine learning functionality into the Procore platform in order to provide customers with ways to automate repetitive tasks, uncover hidden information, and glean actionable insights to drive better outcomes on projects, in addition to other next-generation features.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our platform typically serves as a system of record for our customers’ projects, meaning that our customers are incentivized to continue to subscribe to our products even after the end of a construction project in order to leverage the benefits of Procore. As the number of projects and the construction volume managed on our platform grows, so does the amount of data that our platform captures. This enables our customers to analyze their data and derive insights to better operate their business, and enables us to develop products and services specifically tailored to the needs of the construction industry and its stakeholders.
 Our Core Customer Stakeholders and the Benefits Provided by Our Products
 We serve customers ranging from small businesses managing a few million dollars of annual construction volume to global enterprises managing billions of dollars of annual construction volume. Our core customers are owners, general contractors, and specialty contractors operating across the commercial, residential, industrial, and infrastructure segments of the construction industry. For additional information on these core customers, see “Our Industry” above.
 We believe that our ability to deliver products that address our customers’ specific needs, including by enabling streamlined communication and real-time access to data, is essential to driving increased productivity and efficiency, reducing rework and costly delays, improving safety and compliance, and enhancing financial transparency and accountability.
 Owners
 Owners are the beneficiaries of the end result of a construction project, but if the project is over budget, or not completed on schedule, the owner can be responsible for funding the overage or incurring lost revenue. Owners need the ability to plan capital expenditures, accurately estimate project costs, source high-quality general contractors to manage construction work, and track project progress with a high degree of visibility. By reducing friction that hinders collaboration, our products can help owners track cost updates, project status, and change orders. We help owners save significant time and money by providing financial and operational visibility into their projects. It is critical for owners’ bottom lines that they remain informed of what work has been completed, when it was completed, and what specifically was built or installed. Not only is this information crucial for 
 8
 

ongoing projects, but it is also necessary for long-term asset management, as the underlying data allows for more efficient, effective, and predictive maintenance.
 General contractors
 General contractors operate under immense pressure, with little room for error, as they often manage their businesses with small profit margins. Inadequate information flows, such as not providing specialty contractors with the latest set of plans, can result in costly project delays, overages, and unfulfilled expectations. General contractors are also compelled to perform duplicate data entry in disparate systems and are accustomed to dealing with invoicing errors, information silos, and disconnected point solutions. For example, general contractors must often collect and consolidate dozens of invoices from their specialty contractors each month before invoicing the owner. This process can require days or even weeks of effort, depending upon a project’s complexity and the number of specialty contractors. With our platform, that process can be greatly condensed. We have developed a cloud-based platform to allow general contractors to manage their projects from a smart device in their hand, with the goal of facilitating exceptional teamwork, reducing costly rework, mitigating risk, and improving profit margins.
 Specialty contractors
 For specialty contractors to be successful, it is imperative that they are able to effectively track and manage their crews, materials, and equipment. Specialty contractors have to get the right people to the right jobsite at the right time with the correct materials and equipment. However, specialty contractors often utilize disparate point software solutions or antiquated documentation systems, such as pen and paper and even physical whiteboards, which means they lack a consistent way to track labor production rates, monitor safety compliance and quality of work, ensure they are working off the latest set of plans and schedules, or document work completed as part of the invoicing process. Specialty contractors frequently experience delays and disruptions in work progress as a result of not having timely access to the most up-to-date information, such as when other stakeholders make changes to project plans or schedules and do not effectively communicate those changes to specialty contractors. For example, when a specialty contractor submits a change order, they typically cease work until the change order is approved by the owner and the decision is communicated back to the specialty contractor, which can take weeks. Our products feature intuitive, easy-to-use tools that allow specialty contractors to leverage accurate, real-time information, reduce unnecessary data entry, visualize productivity trends, document completed work, and get paid the correct amounts faster.
 We are also developing other programs and services to address related challenges faced by specialty contractors. For example, our materials financing program aims to help specialty contractors manage cash flow concerns by facilitating the purchase of construction materials from fulfillment partners on our customers’ behalf, allowing those customers to finance their materials purchases from us on deferred payment terms that better match construction payment timelines.
 Our Business Model
 We generate substantially all of our revenue from subscriptions to access our products and have an unlimited user model that is designed to facilitate adoption and maximize usage of our platform by all project stakeholders. We primarily sell our products on a subscription basis for a fixed fee with pricing generally based on the number and mix of products and the annual construction volume contracted to run on our platform. 
 As we grow, we believe that the value of our business will increase across three key dimensions:
  
• | Ecosystem. Our business model is designed to encourage rapid, widespread adoption by allowing for unlimited users, meaning we do not charge a per-seat or per-user fee. Customers can invite all project participants to engage with our platform as part of a project team. This includes customers’ employees and collaborators, who are other project participants who engage with our platform but do not pay us for such use. Thereafter, collaborators have an incentive to become customers, as collaborators do not control what information they get access to, may not be able to access project information after a project is complete, and cannot run their complete portfolio of projects on our platform.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Products. We believe our expertise in construction and close relationship with our customers and collaborators enable us to deliver easy-to-use and feature-rich products, specifically tailored to solve the problems of the industry’s key stakeholders and help them manage their businesses more effectively. Our products are offered à la carte and are integrated into our cloud-based platform.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Data. Our platform captures extensive data across stakeholders and each stage of a project, which enables us to create a system of record for all stakeholders and to analyze project and industry trends. Our platform captures data encompassing bidding, safety, cost, quality, scheduling, materials, supplier information, and other types of data. We believe our unique access to data through our platform will allow our team to assess construction risk faster and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

more accurately than traditional methods, and our goal is to use such data to scale and automate our product offerings, including our materials financing program.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Growth Strategy
 We intend to leverage our existing products and industry presence to establish our products, services, and platform as the industry standard in construction, both domestically and internationally. The key elements of our strategy to accomplish these objectives are as follows:

• | Maintain and advance our technology leadership. We believe that the investments we have made in research and development to build our technology have been core differentiators of our products and platform. We plan to continue to invest in technology innovation and product development, and we believe that our customers will benefit from new features and products on our centralized platform.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Acquire new customers. We believe the market for construction technology and collaboration tools is in its early phases of adoption. We plan to continue to expand our sales and marketing efforts to drive awareness of our products and services and grow our customer base, focusing on owners, general contractors, and specialty contractors. The portion of our current user base made up of collaborators invited to participate in our customers’ projects represents a significant opportunity to increase our revenue. These users are incentivized to become customers in order to gain visibility and control across their projects with actionable insights from a single system. In the future, we have the potential to monetize additional adjacent stakeholders, including a broad set of industry participants who are potential customers of our existing products and services and those whom we plan to address with targeted new products and services, such as our materials financing program, over time. Such new products and services may allow us to attract new customers as well as expand existing customer relationships.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Increase and diversify spend within our customer base. We plan to drive additional spend from existing customers by capturing more projects, selling them additional existing products and services, and offering new products and services that address additional customer needs.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Expand internationally. We believe there is a global need for construction management software and that the global market is currently underpenetrated, representing a significant opportunity. We plan to open offices and hire sales and customer experience teams and expand our presence in the countries where we already operate, as applicable.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Extend our industry connectivity and our position as a trusted brand. We believe there are powerful network effects to our business, and to capitalize on these effects we intend to focus on driving higher engagement with customers, collaborators, and the broader construction community. We will continue to invest in expanding our ecosystem, developing new partnerships, and supporting more integrations. In addition, we plan to continue to invest in growing our brand and expanding on our key community and user initiatives.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Pursue targeted acquisitions. We have made and may in the future make select acquisitions to add innovative features and functionality to our platform, accelerate our end-to-end cloud-based platform strategy, and bring talent to our team. Our App Marketplace provides us with visibility into our customers’ interactions with many third-party integrations. For example, in 2019, we acquired Honest Buildings, Inc. (“Honest Buildings”), an existing App Marketplace partner and a provider of financial and project management software for owners, allowing us to further extend our products and platform to this key stakeholder group. In 2020, we acquired Esticom, another App Marketplace partner and provider of a leading estimating solution. In 2021, we acquired Levelset, a lien rights management solution, and LaborChart, a labor management solution, both of which were also existing App Marketplace partners. Our existing integrations with App Marketplace partners like these streamline the integration of their solutions into our platform post-acquisition and allows us to quickly deliver a seamless customer experience across financial and project management workstreams.

• | Bid Management. Procore Bid Management organizes the complex bidding process, from bid package creation to bid award, allowing customers to track and assess the significant volume of bids that are typically submitted to work on a given construction project. Bid Management also provides vendors with a single location to access bid package details, files, and communications to simplify the bid submission process.

Project Execution
  
• | Project Management. Procore Project Management provides every team member on a construction project with real-time access to the information they need via a single, accurate, up-to-date source. Project Management centralizes and facilitates collaboration on schedules, specifications, submittals, drawings, requests for information (“RFIs”), and outstanding tasks. Users have the ability to log critical information, track project progress, and escalate issues for approvals from the correct team members. Project Management is designed to increase transparency and accountability across the entire project team, reducing litigation risk and the shifting of responsibilities.

Procore Field Productivity enables contractors to manage their labor with real-time time data for payroll, manage out-of-scope work, as well as communication, certification, forecasting, and productivity tracking. This data deeply integrates into Procore Project Financials, powering critical labor cost analysis and change management workflows that maximize job profitability. In using Field Productivity, customers create a detailed record of historical productivity rates that allows them to more accurately bid and estimate future projects.

Sales and Marketing
 We primarily sell subscriptions to access our products through our direct sales team, which is specialized by stakeholder region, size, and type, and is serviced regionally by offices in the U.S., Canada, Australia, England, Mexico, Singapore, the United Arab Emirates (“UAE”), France, and Ireland, and by our focused sales and marketing efforts in Germany, where we do not yet maintain an office location. As a result of our international efforts, we support multiple languages and currencies. We combine an inside sales model with a field sales team targeting large accounts. Our install base team focuses on renewals and account expansion. Our construction volume-based pricing model and number of product offerings create multiple opportunities for expansion.
 We focus our marketing efforts on product innovation and value, domain expertise, and community-building. We reach potential customers and generate leads for our sales team through a combination of content marketing, public relations, advertising, sponsorships, digital marketing, partner marketing, social media, community initiatives, and events. We deliver multi-touch marketing efforts across all stages of the customer journey, from awareness and consideration to purchase, retention, and advocacy. Marketing activities are connected to our sales pipeline, resulting in product demonstration requests and sales opportunities. As a key part of our brand-building efforts, we host industry events. Our engagement with these leading industry events affords us the ability to connect directly with our customers, collaborators, and the broader construction industry.
 Research and Development
 Our research and development organization is responsible for the development and delivery of new features and products for our platform, and the continued improvement, maintenance, and support of our existing products, platform, and cloud infrastructure. We leverage our broad customer base, our engaged user communities, and our focus on user-driven innovation to aggregate feedback on features and functionality and consistently improve our products and platform. Our teams partner with our customers and collaborators to understand their needs through focus groups at our innovation labs, trade shows, and conferences, and with customers and collaborators on the jobsite.
 Our research and development teams are largely based in our Carpinteria, California headquarters, and our Austin, Texas, New York, New York, Cairo, Egypt, and Toronto, Canada offices.
 Our Competition
 The market for construction management software is competitive and rapidly evolving. We believe the market is in its early phases of maturity and technology adoption as many companies in the construction industry still rely on a combination of rudimentary workflows, including manual paper-based methods, email, fax, and spreadsheet-based processes. Where technology has been adopted, it has generally had a limited impact because of a lack of modern, cloud-based tools, limited breadth and depth of functionality, or a lack of integrations between point solutions.
 12
 

We believe our competitors primarily exist across the following four categories:
  
• | aggregated construction management tools, including products offered by Oracle, Autodesk, and Trimble. Some of these companies’ products integrate with our platform and are available in our App Marketplace.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | accounting software vendors, including providers that offer accounting software and supplement their solutions with project management tools and other offerings, which are often bundled with their accounting solutions as lower-value add-ons.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | point solution vendors in various categories, including analytics, bidding, BIM, compliance, scheduling, and materials financing, among others. Many of the point solutions these vendors provide integrate with our platform and are available in our App Marketplace.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | in-house specialized tools or processes built by or for existing or prospective customers.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our People and Our Values
 Our people are our most vital asset in building and growing our business. We have worked hard to create and maintain a culture based on three core values:

• | Openness. We define openness as “a willingness to engage and express, as well as to consider, new information and ideas.” We ask our employees to be honest without ego, meaning that employees can share critical opinions without fear of retribution and admit when they don’t know something. We include different voices and points of view. We believe that diversity of thought makes us stronger and more innovative.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Ownership. We define ownership as “a sense of having a personal stake in a project’s or team’s success and the feeling of empowerment and responsibility that goes with it.” We ask our employees to take initiative and move forward, and in so doing, to vigorously advocate for our vision, volunteer for work that challenges and inspires them, and solicit feedback from leaders and colleagues. We also believe in providing equity incentives to our employees to foster an ownership mentality among them and align their interests with those of our stockholders.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Optimism. We define optimism as “the ability to envision and pursue favorable outcomes, even in the face of challenges, and to believe in the capabilities and goodwill of oneself and others.” We ask our employees to build toward the possible, which means that they assume positive intent in others, let themselves have a bad day, and pursue the rewards of hard work. We believe in embracing a growth mindset for continuous learning.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We believe that these three core values are foundational in building a high-performing, healthy company that scales. We also believe that having an open and inclusive work culture is integral to our ability to attract and retain exceptionally talented and motivated employees. 
 We continue to evolve our diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging (“DEIB”) initiatives to drive engagement with our employees, our customers, and other industry stakeholders. Our DEIB initiatives are centered around five pillars: talent acquisition, training and development, equity analysis, employee resource groups, and partnerships and outreach. 
 As of December 31, 2022, we had 3,568 full-time employees, with 3,080 based in the U.S. and 488 based in our international locations.
 Our Commitment to the Construction Industry
 We have taken steps to promote a more diverse and inclusive construction industry. Through our long-standing Women in Construction initiative, we advocate for improved gender equality. As part of this effort, we host webinars, curate a virtual community group, and attend events across the country to connect advocates for the increased presence of women in construction. 
 Through our in-house social impact team, Procore.org, we support the advancement of the construction industry by providing an array of resources, including certified continuing education courses, training programs, online content libraries, and in-kind donations of software and training to universities, K-12 school programs, training centers, trade associations, disadvantaged business enterprises, and non-profits.

Our Intellectual Property
 We rely on trademarks, patents, copyrights, trade secrets, license agreements, intellectual property assignment agreements, confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements, and employee invention assignment agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights. As of December 31, 2022, we had 34 issued patents in the U.S. and 53 pending patent applications in the U.S. Additionally, we had 16 pending patent applications in foreign countries, as well as nine pending international patent applications that preserve our right to file additional foreign patent applications in the future, as of such date. Our issued patents in the U.S. will expire between 2034 and 2041. We continually review our development efforts to assess the existence and patentability of new intellectual property.
 We have trademark rights in our name, our logo, and other brand indicia, and have trademark registrations for select marks in the U.S. and many other jurisdictions around the world. We also have registered domain names for websites that we use in our business.
 We intend to pursue additional intellectual property protection to the extent we believe it would be beneficial and cost-effective. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights, they may not be respected in the future or may be invalidated, circumvented, or challenged. For additional information, see the sections titled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property—Our failure to protect our intellectual property rights and proprietary information could diminish our brand and other intangible assets and otherwise materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.”
