Item 1.        Business
Customers Bancorp, Inc. (the “Bancorp” or “Customers Bancorp”) is a bank holding company engaged in banking activities through its wholly owned subsidiary, Customers Bank (“Customers Bank” or the “Bank”), collectively referred to as "Customers" herein.  Customers Bank is principally a commercial bank that has a branch-light strategy that serves its customers through a single-point-of-contact private banking strategy. In addition, Customers Bank has BankMobile, a division of Customers Bank, which offers state-of-the-art high-tech digital banking services to consumers, students and the "under banked" nationwide, along with "Banking as a Service" offerings with white label partners.
Business Summary
Customers Bancorp, through its wholly owned subsidiary Customers Bank, provides financial products and services to small and middle market businesses, not-for-profits, and consumers through its branches and offices in Southeastern Pennsylvania (Bucks, Berks, Chester, Philadelphia and Delaware Counties); Rye Brook, New York (Westchester County); Hamilton, New Jersey (Mercer County); Boston, Massachusetts; Providence, Rhode Island; Portsmouth, New Hampshire (Rockingham County); Manhattan and Melville, New York; Washington, D.C.; and Chicago, Illinois. Customers Bank also provides liquidity to the mortgage market nationwide through the operation of its loans to mortgage banking businesses. At December 31, 2018, Customers had total assets of $9.8 billion, including loans, net of the allowance for loan losses (including loans held for sale and loans receivable, mortgage warehouse, at fair value) of $8.5 billion, total deposits of $7.1 billion and shareholders’ equity of $1.0 billion.
Customers differentiates itself through its unique single-point-of-contact business strategy executed by very experienced management teams. Customers' strategic plan is to become a leading regional bank holding company through organic core loan and deposit growth and value-added acquisitions. Customers differentiates itself from its competitors through its focus on exceptional customer service supported by state-of-the-art technology. The primary customers of Customers Bank are privately held businesses, business customers, not-for-profit organizations and consumers. Customers Bank also focuses on certain low-cost specialty lending areas such as multi-family/commercial real estate lending and lending to commercial mortgage banking businesses. Customers Bank’s lending activities are funded in part by deposits from its branch-light business model, which seeks higher deposit levels per branch than a typical bank, combined with lower branch operating expenses, without sacrificing exceptional customer service and its digital bank deposit offerings. Customers also creates franchise value through its disciplined approach to acquisitions, both in terms of identifying targets and structuring transactions. Enterprise risk management is an important part of the strategies Customers employs.
Customers launched BankMobile as a key strategic initiative in January 2015, recognizing the product delivery flexibility demanded by the millennial generation and the low cost of the smart phone delivery channel. BankMobile refers to Customers' efforts to build a full-service bank that is accessible to our customers anywhere and anytime through the customer's smartphone or other web-enabled device. As part of the BankMobile strategic initiative, on June 15, 2016, Customers completed the acquisition of substantially all the assets and the assumption of certain liabilities of the OneAccount Student Checking and Refund Management Disbursement Services business from Higher One. Higher One was acquired by a subsidiary of Blackboard, Inc. in third quarter 2016, and we continue to refer to that combined business as “Higher One” throughout this document. BankMobile, including the Disbursement business, provides a nationwide deposit-aggregation platform. BankMobile focuses on the aggregation of low-cost deposits and currently offers no or low-fee banking, higher than average interest rates on savings and access to over 55,000 ATMs across the U.S. Customers believes that consolidating BankMobile with the Disbursement business uniquely positions it to become the graduating students' "bank for life" and service each graduate's financial needs throughout their life. BankMobile's revenues are largely derived from interchange and card revenue, deposit fees, university card and disbursement fees and university subscription revenue. It is BankMobile's strategy to disrupt traditional banks' retail branch customer service delivery model and become the bank of choice for life of college students and middle-income and under-banked Americans using its low-cost digital delivery platform and superior deposit products, serve as a white label deposit partner to large companies, and disrupt payday lenders and high-cost check lenders by making low-cost quality banking services available to key under-banked markets. BankMobile has focused on the development of its "Banking as a Service" model, including research and development, and technology and product development for its white label partner. BankMobile has obtained and is applying for patents and copyrights to protect key elements of its products and delivery methods. This intellectual property will allow BankMobile to continue to differentiate its business from potential competitors.

Executive Summary
Customers' Markets
Market Criteria
Customers looks to grow organically as well as through selective acquisitions in its current and prospective markets. Customers believes that there is significant opportunity to both enhance its presence in its current markets and enter new complementary markets that meet its objectives. Customers focuses on markets that it believes are characterized by some or all of the following:
•Population density;

• | Concentration of business activity;


• | Attractive deposit bases;


• | Significant market share held by large banks;


• | Advantageous competitive landscape that provides opportunity to achieve meaningful market presence;


• | Lack of consolidation in the banking sector and corresponding opportunities for add-on transactions;


• | Potential for economic growth over time; and


• | Management experience in the applicable markets.

BankMobile products are delivered to customers nationwide via its digital delivery channels, such as a smartphone or other web-enable device. The BankMobile business is currently focused on millennials, now the largest generation in the United States, developing white label relationships with large companies that wish to expand their relationships with their retail customers and employees and the under-banked who can utilize a low-cost banking services provider. As a general retail deposit product and related services provider, the BankMobile segment does not have a dependency on a particular customer, but is focused on providing deposit services to college students who receive federal government loans or grants and to customers of its white label partners. BankMobile currently provides deposit products and services to students on over 700 college and university campuses. Besides the student disbursements, BankMobile has focused on the development of its "Banking as a Service" model. In late November 2018, BankMobile's first white label banking partnership went live in beta test phase, offering BankMobile's best in class banking products to the partner's broad customer base.

Current Markets
Customers' target market is broadly defined as extending from the Greater Washington, D.C. area to Boston, Massachusetts roughly following Interstate 95. As of December 31, 2018, Customers had bank branches or LPOs serving residents and businesses in the following locations:

Market | Offices | Type
Berks County, PA | 4 | | Branch 
Boston, MA | 1 | | LPO 
Mercer County, NJ | 1 | | Branch/LPO
New York, NY | 1 | | LPO 
Philadelphia-Southeastern, PA | 9 | | Branch/LPO
Portsmouth, NH | 1 | | LPO 
Providence, RI | 1 | | LPO 
Suffolk County, NY | 1 | | LPO 
Westchester County, NY | 1 | | Branch/LPO
Chicago, IL | 1 | | LPO 
Washington, D.C. | 1 | | LPO 

Customers believes its target market has highly attractive demographic, economic and competitive dynamics that are consistent with its objectives and favorable to executing its organic core loan and deposit growth and acquisition strategies.
The BankMobile suite of deposit products and services is provided nationally through digital delivery channels, such as a smartphone or other web-enabled device. The BankMobile deposit products and services are available nationwide throughout the United States. Customers believes that digital delivery without geographic limitations is the future of retail banking.
Prospective Markets
The organic core loan and deposit growth strategy of Customers focuses on expanding market share in its existing and contiguous markets by generating deposits, loan and fee-based services through its Concierge Banking® high-touch single-point-of-contact personalized service supported by state-of-the-art technology for its commercial, consumer, not-for-profit and specialized lending markets. While Customers has not acquired any banks since 2011, its bank acquisition strategy is focused where such acquisitions further Customers' objectives and meet its critical success factors. Customers will also consider other acquisitions that will contribute to its banking business. As Customers evaluates potential acquisition and asset purchase opportunities, it believes that there are many banking institutions that continue to face credit challenges, capital constraints and liquidity issues and that lack the scale and management expertise to manage the regulatory burden. The BankMobile suite of deposit products and services is delivered through digital delivery channels, such as a smartphone or other web-enabled device across the United States. As such, the product does not have geographic limitations. Currently, BankMobile is focused on the market for deposits but is continuing the development of loan products and relationships with market place lenders that will facilitate competing in loan markets, either as a direct lender or referral to other lenders. 
Competitive Strengths

• | Experienced and respected management team. An integral element of Customers' business strategy is to capitalize on and leverage the prior experience of its executive management team. The management team is led by Chairman and CEO, Jay Sidhu, who is the former CEO and Chairman of Sovereign Bancorp. In addition to Mr. Sidhu, a number of the members of the current management team of Customers have experience working together at Sovereign with Mr. Sidhu, including Richard Ehst, President and Chief Operating Officer, as well as Jim Collins, Chief Administration Officer. During their tenure at Sovereign, these individuals established a track record of producing strong financial results, integrating acquisitions, managing risk, working with regulators and achieving organic growth and expense control. Team leaders Timothy Romig, Pennsylvania and New Jersey Banking Group Executive Vice President; Steve Issa, New England Marketing President and Chief Lending Officer and Lyle Cunningham, Executive Vice President, Managing Director & Market President - New York Metro, Chicago, and Washington D.C. and Specialty Finance; all with over 30 years of experience. Ken Keiser, Director of Multi-Family and Investment Commercial Real Estate Lending, leads the commercial real estate and multi-family lending group and brings more than 40 years of experience including oversight of the Mid-Atlantic commercial real estate group at Sovereign. In addition, the banking to mortgage companies group, which 

9

primarily includes commercial loans (warehouse facilities) to residential mortgage originators is led by Glenn Hedde, President of Warehouse Lending, who brings more than 28 years of experience in this sector. This team has significant experience in successfully building a banking organization as well as existing valuable community and business relationships in our core markets.

• | Unique Asset and Deposit Generation Strategies. Customers focuses on local market lending combined with relatively low-risk specialty lending segments. Local market asset generation provides various types of business lending products and consumer lending products, such as mortgage loans and home equity loans. Customers has also established a multi-family and commercial real estate product line that is focused on the Mid-Atlantic region, particularly New York City. The strategy is to focus on obtaining deposits and refinancing existing loans with other banks, using teams recruited from other banks, conservative underwriting standards and minimizing costs. Through the multi-family and commercial real estate product, Customers earns interest and fee income and generates commercial deposits. Customers also maintains a specialty lending business, commercial loans to mortgage originators, which is a national business where Customers Bank provides liquidity to non-depository mortgage companies to fund their mortgage pipelines and meet other business needs. Through the loans to mortgage banking businesses, Customers earns interest and fee income and generates core deposits. 


• | BankMobile Strategy. Customers launched BankMobile as a key strategic initiative in January 2015, recognizing the product delivery flexibility demanded by the millennial generation and the low cost of the smartphone delivery channel. BankMobile refers to Customers' efforts to build a full-service bank that is accessible to its customers anywhere and anytime through the customer's smartphone or other web-enabled device. BankMobile provides a nationwide deposit-aggregation platform. BankMobile principally has a "banking as a service" business model and focuses on the aggregation of low-cost deposits and currently offers no or low-fee banking, higher than average interest rates on savings and access to over 55,000 ATMs across the U.S. Customers believes that consolidating BankMobile with the acquired Disbursement business uniquely positions BankMobile to service 1 million students across America and to become the graduating students "bank for life" and service each graduate's financial needs throughout their life. Successful execution of the BankMobile strategy, including its consolidation with the Disbursement business through colleges and universities across America and similar white-label partnerships, greatly accelerates BankMobile's ability to achieve profitability. BankMobile's revenues are largely derived from interchange and card revenue, deposit fees, university card and disbursement fees and university subscription revenue. 


• | Attractive low-credit risk profile. Customers has sought to maintain high asset quality and moderate credit risk by using conservative underwriting standards and early identification of potential problem assets. Customers has also formed a SAG to manage classified and NPAs. As of December 31, 2018, only $27.5 million, or 0.32%, of Customers Bank's total loan portfolio was non performing. 


• | Superior Community Banking Model. Customers expects to drive organic core loan and deposit growth by employing its Concierge Banking® and single-point-of-contact strategies, which provide specific relationship managers or private bankers for all customers, delivering an appointment banking approach available 12 hours a day, seven days a week. This allows Customers to provide services in a personalized, convenient and expeditious manner. This approach, coupled with superior technology, including remote account opening, remote deposit capture, mobile banking and the first fee-free mobile digital bank, BankMobile, results in a competitive advantage over larger institutions, which management believes contributes to the profitability of its franchise and allows Customers Bank to generate core deposits. The “high-tech, high-touch,” model requires less staff and smaller branch locations to operate, thereby significantly reducing operating costs. 


• | Acquisition Expertise. The depth of Customers' management team and their experience working together and successfully completing acquisitions provides unique insight in identifying and analyzing potential markets and acquisition targets. The experience of Customers' team, which includes the acquisition and integration of over 35 institutions, as well as numerous asset and branch acquisitions, provides a substantial advantage in pursuing and consummating future acquisitions. Additionally, management believes Customers' strengths in structuring transactions to limit its risk, its experience in the financial reporting and regulatory process related to troubled bank acquisitions, and its ongoing risk management expertise, particularly in problem loan workouts, collectively enable it to capitalize on the potential of the franchises it acquires. With Customers' depth of operational experience in connection with completing merger and acquisition transactions, it expects to be able to integrate and reposition acquired franchises cost-efficiently with a minimum disruption to customer relationships. 

Customers believes its ability to operate efficiently is enhanced by its centralized risk-management structure, its access to attractive labor and real estate costs in its markets, and an infrastructure that is unencumbered by legacy systems. Furthermore, 
10

Customers anticipates additional expense synergies from the integration of its acquisitions, which it believes will enhance its financial performance.
Segments
Beginning in third quarter 2016, Customers revised its segment financial reporting to reflect the manner in which its chief operating decision makers had begun allocating resources and assessing performance subsequent to Customers' acquisition of the Disbursement business from Higher One and the combination of that business with the BankMobile technology platform late in second quarter 2016.
Management has determined that Customers' operations consist of two reportable segments - Customers Bank Business Banking and BankMobile. Each segment generates revenues, manages risk, and offers distinct products and services to targeted customers through different delivery channels. The strategy, marketing and analysis of these segments vary considerably. For more information on Customers' reportable operating segments, see NOTE 22 - BUSINESS SEGMENTS to the consolidated financial statements.
Products
Customers offers a broad range of traditional loan and deposit banking products and financial services, and non-traditional products and services through the successful launch of BankMobile in January 2015, to its commercial and consumer customers. Customers offers an array of lending products to cater to its customers’ needs, including commercial mortgage warehouse loans, multi-family and commercial real estate loans, business banking, small business loans, equipment financing, residential mortgage loans and other consumer loans. Customers also offers traditional deposit products, including commercial and consumer checking accounts, non-interest-bearing demand accounts, MMDA, savings accounts, time deposit accounts and cash management services. Prior to January 2015, deposit products were available to customers only through branches of Customers Bank. With the successful launch of BankMobile, the acquisition of the Disbursement business from Higher One and the combination of that business with the BankMobile platform and its white-label partnership, Customers is able to provide banking to millennials, students, middle class American families and underserved consumers throughout the United States. 
BankMobile is focused on providing quality low-cost deposit products and related services to its customers, such as no-or-low-fee checking, no opening balance requirements, instant virtual debit cards and similar customer friendly technology enabled services. Customers can also obtain cash free of any fees from over 55,000 ATMs in the United States. BankMobile has developed its capabilities to deliver retail loan products, such as personal loans and credit cards to its customers, either as a referral or direct lender, as its technological capabilities have developed. In late November 2018, BankMobile's first white label banking partnership went live in beta test phase, offering BankMobile's best in class banking products to the partner's broad customer base.
Lending Activities
Customers Bank focuses its lending efforts on the following lending areas:

• | Commercial Lending – Customers' focus is on Business Banking (i.e., commercial and industrial lending), including Small and Middle Market Business Banking (including SBA loans), Commercial Loans to Mortgage Companies, and to a lesser extent Multi-Family and Commercial Real Estate Lending, and


• | Consumer Lending – local-market mortgage and home equity lending.

Commercial Lending
Customers' commercial lending activities are divided into five groups: Business Banking, Small and Middle Market Business Banking, Multi-Family and Commercial Real Estate Lending, Mortgage Banking Lending and Equipment Finance. This grouping is designed to allow for greater resource deployment, higher standards of risk management, strong asset quality, lower interest-rate risk and higher productivity levels.
The commercial lending group focuses primarily on companies with annual revenues ranging from $1 million to $100 million, which typically have credit requirements between $0.5 million and $10 million.
The small and middle market business banking platform originates loans, including SBA loans, through the branch network sales force and a team of dedicated relationship managers. The support administration of this platform is centralized including risk management, product management, marketing, performance tracking and overall strategy. Credit and sales training has been established for Customers' sales force, ensuring that it has small business experts in place providing appropriate financial 
11

solutions to the small business owners in its communities. A division approach focuses on industries that offer high asset quality and are deposit rich to drive profitability.
The goal of Customers' multi-family lending group is to manage a portfolio of high-quality multi-family loans within Customers' covered markets while cross-selling other products and services. These lending activities primarily target the refinancing of loans with other banks using conservative underwriting standards and provide purchase money for new acquisitions by borrowers. The primary collateral for these loans is a first-lien mortgage on the multi-family property, plus an assignment of all leases related to such property. During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, Customers originated approximately $355 million and $1.2 billion, respectively, of multi-family loans. As part of its strategic initiatives, Customers is deemphasizing its lower-yielding multi-family lending activities and focusing on growing relationship-based commercial and industrial lending activities. 
The goal of commercial loans to mortgage companies is to provide liquidity to mortgage companies. The loans are predominately short-term facilities used by mortgage companies to fund their pipelines from closing of individual mortgage loans until their sale into the secondary market. Most of the individual mortgage loans that collateralize our commercial loans to mortgage companies are insured or guaranteed by the U.S. Government through one of its programs, such as FHA, VA, or they are conventional loans eligible for sale to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Customers is currently expanding its product offerings to mortgage companies to meet a wider array of business needs. During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, Customers Bank funded $27.2 billion and $30.1 billion of mortgage loans, respectively, to mortgage originators via warehouse facilities. The commercial loans to mortgage companies are reported as loans receivable, mortgage warehouse, at fair value.
The equipment finance group offers equipment financing and leasing products and services for a broad range of asset classes. It services vendors, dealers, independent finance companies, bank-owned leasing companies and strategic direct customers in the plastics, packaging, machine tool, construction, transportation and franchise markets. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, Customers had $172.9 million and $152.5 million, respectively, of equipment finance loans outstanding. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, Customers had $54.5 million and $26.6 million of equipment finance leases, respectively. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, Customers had $54.5 million and $21.7 million, respectively, of operating leases entered into under this program, net of accumulated depreciation of $4.8 million and $0.5 million, respectively.
As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, Customers Bank had $7.8 billion and $8.4 billion, respectively, in commercial loans outstanding, composing approximately 91.6% and 96.2%, respectively, of its total loan portfolio, which includes loans held for sale and loans receivable, mortgage warehouse, at fair value. During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Bank originated $600 million and $1.4 billion, respectively, of commercial loans, exclusive of multi-family loan originations and loans to mortgage originators via warehouse facilities.
Consumer Lending
Customers provides home equity and residential mortgage loans to customers. Underwriting standards for home equity lending are conservative, and lending is offered to solidify customer relationships and grow relationship revenues in the long term. This lending is important in Customers' efforts to grow total relationship revenues for its consumer households. These areas also support Customers' commitment to lower-and-moderate-income families in its market area. Customers plans to expand its product offerings in real estate secured consumer lending, as well as other consumer lending activities, and has announced its entry into the non-QM residential mortgage market.
Customers Bank has launched a community outreach program in Philadelphia to finance homeownership in urban communities. As part of this program, Customers is offering an “Affordable Mortgage Product." This community outreach program is penetrating the underserved population, especially in low-and moderate income neighborhoods. As part of this commitment, a loan production office was opened in Progress Plaza, 1501 North Broad Street, Philadelphia, PA. The program includes homebuyer seminars that prepare potential homebuyers for homeownership by teaching money management and budgeting skills, including the financial responsibilities that come with having a mortgage and owning a home. The “Affordable Mortgage Product” is offered throughout Customers' assessment areas.
As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, Customers had $721.8 million and $329.8 million, respectively, in consumer loans outstanding, comprising 8.4% and 3.8%, respectively, of Customers' total loan portfolio. During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, Customers purchased $398.5 million and $264.1 million of consumer loans, respectively.
Private Banking
Beginning in 2013, Customers introduced a Private Banking model for its commercial clients in the major markets within its geographic footprint.  This unique model provides unparalleled service to customers through an in-market team of experienced 
12

private bankers.  Acting as a single-point-of-contact for all the banking needs of Customers’ commercial clients, these private bankers deliver the whole bank – not only to its clients, but to their families, their management teams and their employees, as well.  With a world-class suite of sophisticated cash management products, these private bankers deliver on Customers' “high-tech, high-touch” strategy and provide real value to its mid-market commercial clients.
Customers opened its first private banking representative office in Manhattan in second quarter 2013, and eventually, all of its markets will be served by private bankers.
Deposit Products and Other Funding Sources
Customers offers a variety of deposit products to its customers, including checking accounts, savings accounts, MMDA and other deposit accounts, including fixed-rate, fixed-maturity retail time deposits ranging in terms from 30 days to five years, individual retirement accounts, and non-retail time deposits consisting of jumbo certificates greater than or equal to $100,000. Using its high touch supported by high tech model, Customers has experienced strong growth in core deposits. Customers also utilizes wholesale deposit products, money market and certificates of deposit obtained through listing services and borrowings from the FHLB as a sources of funding. These funding sources offer attractive funding costs in comparison to traditional sources of funding given the current interest-rate environment.
Financial Products and Services
In addition to traditional banking activities, Customers provides other financial services to its customers, including: mobile phone banking, internet banking, wire transfers, electronic bill payment, lock box services, remote deposit capture services, courier services, merchant processing services, cash vault, controlled disbursements, positive pay and cash management services (including account reconciliation, collections and sweep accounts). In January 2015, Customers successfully launched BankMobile, America's first mobile platform based full-service consumer bank. In June 2016, Customers acquired the Disbursement business of Higher One and subsequently combined that business with the BankMobile platform. The Disbursement business assists higher educational institutions in their distributions of Title IV monies to students. In combining the businesses, BankMobile serviced over 1.0 million active deposit accounts at December 31, 2018.
Competition
Customers competes with other financial institutions for deposit and loan business. Competitors include other commercial banks, savings banks, savings and loan associations, insurance companies, securities brokerage firms, credit unions, finance companies, mutual funds, money market funds and certain government agencies. Financial institutions compete principally on the quality of the services rendered, interest rates offered on deposit products, interest rates charged on loans, fees and service charges, the convenience of banking office locations and hours of operation and in the consideration of larger commercial borrowers, lending limits.
Many competitors are significantly larger than Customers and have significantly greater financial resources, personnel and locations from which to conduct business. In addition, Customers is subject to regulation, while certain of its competitors are not. Non-regulated companies face relatively few barriers to entry into the financial services industry. Customers' larger competitors enjoy greater name recognition and greater resources to finance wide ranging advertising campaigns. Customers competes for business principally on the basis of high-quality, personal service to customers, customer access to Customers' decision makers and competitive interest and fee structure. Customers also strives to provide maximum convenience of access to services by employing innovative delivery vehicles such as internet banking, and the convenience of Concierge Banking® and our single-point-of-contact business model.
Customers' current market is primarily served by large national and regional banks, with a few larger institutions capturing more than 50% of the deposit market share. Customers' large competitors primarily utilize expensive, branch-based models to sell products to consumers and small businesses, which requires Customers' larger competitors to price their products with wider margins and charge more fees to justify their higher expense base. While maintaining physical branch locations remains an important component of Customers' strategy, Customers utilizes an operating model with fewer and less expensive locations, thereby lowering overhead costs and allowing for greater pricing flexibility.
BankMobile competes for deposit customers with traditional bank branches that may have a physical presence near the university and college campuses it serves, large national banks, as well as smaller regional or local banks, with other student and disbursement businesses, both banks and prepaid card providers, and with local and national loan providers. Banks providing student disbursement services include PNC, Wells Fargo Bank, and U.S. Bank. BankMobile continues to develop strategies to white label deposit products to commercial entities, again competing with traditional bank deposit product branch 
13

delivery channels. In late November 2018, BankMobile's first white label banking partnership went live in beta test phase, offering BankMobile's best in class banking products to the partner's broad customer base.
Employees
As of December 31, 2018, Customers had 827 full-time equivalent team members, including approximately 247 team members dedicated to the BankMobile business segment.

SUPERVISION AND REGULATION
GENERAL
Customers Bancorp is subject to extensive regulation, examination and supervision by the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities and, as a member of the Federal Reserve System, by the Federal Reserve Board.  Federal and state banking laws and regulations govern, among other things, the scope of a bank’s business, the investments a bank may make, the reserves against deposits a bank must maintain, terms of deposit accounts, loans a bank makes, the interest rates it charges and collateral it takes, the activities of a bank with respect to mergers and consolidations and the establishment of branches.
PENNSYLVANIA BANKING LAWS
Pennsylvania banks that are Federal Reserve members may establish new branch offices only after approval by the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities and the Federal Reserve Board.  Approval by these regulators can be subject to a variety of factors, including the convenience and needs of the community, whether the institution is sufficiently capitalized and well managed, issues of safety and soundness, the institution’s record of meeting the credit needs of its community, whether there are significant supervisory concerns with respect to the institution or affiliated organizations, and whether any financial or other business arrangement, direct or indirect, involving bank “insiders” (directors, officers, employees and 10%-or-greater shareholders) which involves terms and conditions more favorable to the insiders than would be available in a comparable transaction with unrelated parties.
Under the Pennsylvania Banking Code, Customers Bank is permitted to branch throughout Pennsylvania.  Pennsylvania law also provides Pennsylvania state-chartered banks elective parity with the power of national banks, federal thrifts, and state-chartered institutions in other states as authorized by the FDIC, subject to a required notice to the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities.  The Pennsylvania Banking Code also imposes restrictions on payment of dividends, as well as minimum capital requirements.
In October 2012, Pennsylvania enacted three laws known as the “Banking Law Modernization Package,” all of which became effective on December 24, 2012. The intended goal of the law, which applies to Customers Bank, is to modernize Pennsylvania’s banking laws and to reduce regulatory burden at the state level where possible, given the increased regulatory demands at the federal level as described below.
The law also permits banks to disclose formal enforcement actions initiated by the Department, clarifies that the Department has examination and enforcement authority over subsidiaries as well as affiliates of regulated banks and bolsters the Department’s enforcement authority over its regulated institutions by clarifying its ability to remove directors, officers and employees from institutions for violations of laws or orders or for any unsafe or unsound practice or breach of fiduciary duty. Changes to existing law also allow the Department to assess civil money penalties of up to $25,000 per violation.
The law also sets a new standard of care for bank officers and directors, applying the same standard that exists for non-banking corporations in Pennsylvania. The standard is one of performing duties in good faith, in a manner reasonably believed to be in the best interests of the institutions and with such care, including reasonable inquiry, skill and diligence, as a person of ordinary prudence would use under similar circumstances. Directors may rely in good faith on information, opinions and reports 
14

provided by officers, employees, attorneys, accountants or committees of the board, and an officer may not be held liable simply because he or she served as an officer of the institution.
Interstate Branching. Federal law allows the Federal Reserve and FDIC, and the Pennsylvania Banking Code allows the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities, to approve an application by a state banking institution to acquire interstate branches.  For more information on federal law, see the discussion under “Federal Banking Laws – Interstate Branching” that follows.
Pennsylvania banking laws authorize banks in Pennsylvania to acquire existing branches or branch de novo in other states and also permit out-of-state banks to acquire existing branches or branch de novo in Pennsylvania.
In April 2008, Banking Regulators in the States of New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (the “Interstate MOU”) to clarify their respective roles, as home and host state regulators, regarding interstate branching activity on a regional basis pursuant to the Riegle-Neal Amendments Act of 1997. The Interstate MOU establishes the regulatory responsibilities of the respective state banking regulators regarding bank regulatory examinations and is intended to reduce the regulatory burden on state-chartered banks branching within the region by eliminating duplicative host state compliance exams.
Under the Interstate MOU, the activities of branches Customers established in New Jersey or New York would be governed by Pennsylvania state law to the same extent that federal law governs the activities of the branch of an out-of-state national bank in such host states. Issues regarding whether a particular host state law is preempted are to be determined in the first instance by the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities. In the event that the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities and the applicable host state regulator disagree regarding whether a particular host state law is pre-empted, the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities and the applicable host state regulator would use their reasonable best efforts to consider all points of view and to resolve the disagreement.
FEDERAL BANKING LAWS
Interstate Branching.  The Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 (called the “Interstate Act”), among other things, permits bank holding companies to acquire banks in any state. A bank may also merge with a bank in another state.  Interstate acquisitions and mergers are subject, in general, to certain concentration limits and state entry rules relating to the age of the bank.  Under the Interstate Act, the responsible federal regulatory agency is permitted to approve the acquisition of less than all of the branches of an insured bank by an out-of-state bank or bank holding company without the acquisition of an entire bank, only if the law of the state in which the branch is located permits.  Under the Interstate Act, branches of state-chartered banks that operate in other states are covered by the laws of the chartering state, rather than the host state.  The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (“Dodd-Frank Act”) created a more permissive interstate branching regime by permitting banks to establish de novo branches in any state if a bank chartered by such state would have been permitted to establish the branch. For more information on interstate branching under Pennsylvania law, see “Pennsylvania Banking Laws – Interstate Branching” above.
Prompt Corrective Action. Federal banking law mandates certain “prompt corrective actions,” which Federal banking agencies are required to take, and certain actions which they have discretion to take, based upon the capital category into which a Federally regulated depository institution falls.  Regulations have been adopted by the Federal bank regulatory agencies setting forth detailed procedures and criteria for implementing prompt corrective action in the case of any institution that is not adequately capitalized.  Under the rules, an institution will be deemed to be “adequately capitalized” or better if it exceeds the minimum Federal regulatory capital requirements.  However, it will be deemed “undercapitalized” if it fails to meet the minimum capital requirements, “significantly undercapitalized” if it has a common equity tier 1 risk-based capital ratio that is less than 3.0%, or has a total risk-based capital ratio that is less than 6.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio that is less than 4.0%, or a leverage ratio that is less than 3.0%, and “critically undercapitalized” if the institution has a ratio of tangible equity to total assets that is equal to or less than 2.0%.  The rules require an undercapitalized institution to file a written capital restoration plan, along with a performance guaranty by its holding company or a third party.  In addition, an undercapitalized institution becomes subject to certain restrictions including a prohibition on the payment of dividends, a limitation on asset growth and expansion, and in certain cases, a limitation on the payment of bonuses or raises to senior executive officers and a prohibition on the payment of certain “management fees” to any “controlling person.”  Institutions that are classified as undercapitalized are also subject to certain additional supervisory actions, including increased reporting burdens and regulatory monitoring, a limitation on the institution’s ability to make acquisitions, open new branch offices, or engage in new lines of business, obligations to raise additional capital, restrictions on transactions with affiliates and restrictions on interest rates paid by the institution on deposits.  In certain cases, bank regulatory agencies may require replacement of senior executive officers or directors or sale of the institution to a willing purchaser.  If an institution is deemed to be “critically undercapitalized” and 
15

continues in that category for four quarters, the statute requires, with certain narrowly limited exceptions, that the institution be placed in receivership.
Safety and Soundness; Regulation of Bank Management. The Federal Reserve Board possesses the power to prohibit a bank from engaging in any activity that would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice and in violation of the law.  Moreover, Federal law enactments have expanded the circumstances under which officers or directors of a bank may be removed by the institution’s Federal supervisory agency; restricted and further regulated lending by a bank to its executive officers, directors, principal shareholders or related interests thereof; restricted management personnel of a bank from serving as directors or in other management positions with certain depository institutions whose assets exceed a specified amount or which have an office within a specified geographic area; and restricted management personnel from borrowing from another institution that has a correspondent relationship with the bank for which they work.
Capital Rules.  Federal banking agencies have issued certain “risk-based capital” guidelines, which supplemented existing capital requirements. In addition, the Federal Reserve Board imposes certain “leverage” requirements on member banks.  Banking regulators have authority to require higher minimum capital ratios for an individual bank or bank holding company in view of its circumstances.
The risk-based capital guidelines require all banks and bank holding companies to maintain capital levels in compliance with “risk-based capital” ratios.  In these ratios, the on-balance-sheet assets and off-balance sheet exposures are assigned a risk-weight based upon the perceived and historical risk of incurring a loss of principal from that exposure. The risk-based capital rules are designed to make regulatory capital requirements more sensitive to differences in risk profiles among banks and bank holding companies and to minimize disincentives for holding liquid assets.
The risk-based capital rules also may consider interest-rate risk.  Institutions with interest-rate risk exposure above a normal level would be required to hold extra capital in proportion to that risk.  Customers currently monitors and manages its assets and liabilities for interest-rate risk, and management believes that the interest-rate risk rules which have been implemented and proposed will not materially adversely affect its operations.
The Federal Reserve Board’s “leverage” ratio rules require member banks which are rated the highest in the composite areas of capital, asset quality, management, earnings and liquidity to maintain a ratio of “Tier 1” capital to “adjusted total assets” of not less than 3.0%.  For banks which are not the most highly rated, the minimum “leverage” ratio will range from 4.0% to 5.0%, or higher at the discretion of the Federal Reserve Board, and is required to be at a level commensurate with the nature of the level of risk of the bank's condition and activities.
For purposes of the capital requirements, “Tier 1,” or “core,” capital is defined to include common shareholders’ equity and certain noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus. “Tier 2,” or “qualifying supplementary,” capital is defined to include a bank’s allowance for loan losses up to 1.25% of risk-weighted assets, plus certain types of preferred stock and related surplus, certain “hybrid capital instruments” and certain term subordinated debt instruments.
Capital Rules.  In July 2013, the Federal Reserve approved final rules that substantially amend the regulatory risk-based capital rules applicable to the Bancorp and Customers Bank. The FDIC and the OCC have subsequently approved these rules. The final rules were adopted following the issuance of proposed rules by the Federal Reserve in June 2012 and implement the “Basel III” regulatory capital reforms and changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act. “Basel III” refers to two consultative documents released by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in December 2009, the rules text released in December 2010 and loss absorbency rules issued in January 2011, which include significant changes to bank capital, leverage and liquidity requirements.
The rules include risk-based capital and leverage ratios, planned to be phased in from 2015 to 2019, and refine the definition of what constitutes “capital” for purposes of calculating those ratios. Effective January 1, 2015, the new minimum capital level requirements applicable to the Bancorp and Customers Bank under the final rules were:
(i) a common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 4.5%;
(ii) a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6%;
(iii) a total risk-based capital ratio of 8% and
(iv) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4% for all institutions.
The final rules also establish a “capital conservation buffer” above the new regulatory minimum capital requirements.
The capital conservation buffer will be phased-in over four years beginning on January 1, 2016, as follows: the maximum buffer will be 0.625% of risk-weighted assets for 2016, 1.25% for 2017, 1.875% for 2018, and 2.5% for 2019 and thereafter.
16

Effective January 1, 2018, the minimum capital level requirements (including the capital conservation buffer) applicable to the Bancorp and Customers Bank under the final rules are:
(i) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.375%;
(ii) a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 7.875%; and
(iii) a total risk-based capital ratio of 9.875%.
Considering the capital conservation buffer, to avoid limitations on certain actions or activities, banks will be required to maintain the following ratios beginning January 1, 2019:
(i) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 7.0%;
(ii) a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.5%; and
(iii) a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.5%.
Under the final rules, institutions are subject to limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases and paying discretionary bonuses if their capital levels fall below the minimum capital level plus capital conservation buffer amount. These limitations establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that could be utilized for such actions.
Basel III provided discretion for regulators to impose an additional buffer, the “countercyclical buffer,” of up to 2.5% of common equity Tier 1 capital to take into account the macro-financial environment and periods of excessive credit growth. However, the final rules permit the countercyclical buffer to be applied only to “advanced approach banks” (i.e., banks with $250 billion or more in total assets or $10 billion or more in total foreign exposures), which currently excludes the Bancorp and Customers Bank. The final rules also implement revisions and clarifications consistent with Basel III regarding the various components of Tier 1 capital, including common equity, unrealized gains and losses, as well as certain instruments that will no longer qualify as Tier 1 capital, some of which will be phased out over time. However, the final rules provide that small depository institution holding companies with less than $15 billion in total assets as of December 31, 2009, (which includes the Bancorp) will be able to permanently include non-qualifying instruments that were issued and included in Tier 1 or Tier 2 capital prior to May 19, 2010, as additional Tier 1 or Tier 2 capital until they redeem such instruments or until the instruments mature.
In addition, the final rules provide for smaller banking institutions (less than $250 billion in consolidated assets) an opportunity to make a one-time election to opt out of including most elements of AOCI in regulatory capital. Importantly, the opt-out excludes from regulatory capital not only unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities, but also accumulated net gains and losses on cash-flow hedges and amounts attributable to defined benefit postretirement plans. Customers Bank selected the opt-out election in its March 31, 2015 Call Report.
The final rules also contain revisions to the prompt corrective action framework, which is designed to place restrictions on insured depository institutions, including Customers Bank, if their capital levels begin to show signs of weakness. These revisions took effect on January 1, 2015. Under the prompt corrective action requirements, which are designed to complement the capital conservation buffer, insured depository institutions will be required to meet the following increased capital level requirements in order to qualify as “well capitalized:”
(i) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.5%;
(ii) a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8%;
(iii) a total risk-based capital ratio of 10%; and
(iv) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 5%.
The final rules set forth certain changes for the calculation of risk-weighted assets, which were required to be utilized as of January 1, 2015. The standardized approach final rule utilizes an increased number of credit-risk exposure categories and risk weights and also addresses:
(i) an alternative standard of creditworthiness consistent with Section 939A of the Dodd-Frank Act;
(ii) revisions to recognition of credit-risk mitigation;
(iii) rules for risk weighting of equity exposures and past-due loans;
(iv) revised capital treatment for derivatives and repo-style transactions and
(v) disclosure requirements for top-tier banking organizations with $50 billion or more in total assets that are not subject to the “advance approach rules” that apply to banks with greater than $250 billion in consolidated assets.

In addition, in December 2018, the U.S. federal banking agencies finalized rules that would permit bank holding companies and banks to phase-in, for regulatory capital purposes, the day-one impact of the new current expected credit loss accounting rule on retained earnings over a period of three years. 
As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, Customers Bank and the Bancorp met all capital adequacy requirements to which they were subject. For additional information on Customers' regulatory capital ratios, refer to “NOTE 17 – REGULATORY MATTERS” to the consolidated financial statements.
Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.  The Dodd-Frank bill was enacted by Congress on July 15, 2010, and was signed into law by President Obama on July 21, 2010. Among many other provisions, the legislation:

• | established the Financial Stability Oversight Council, a federal agency acting as the financial system’s systemic risk regulator with the authority to review the activities of significant bank holding companies and non-bank financial firms, to make recommendations and impose standards regarding capital, leverage, conflicts and other requirements for financial firms and to impose regulatory standards on certain financial firms deemed to pose a systemic threat to the financial health of the U.S. economy;


• | created a new CFPB within the U.S. Federal Reserve, which has substantive rule-making authority over a wide variety of consumer financial services and products, including the power to regulate unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices;


• | permitted state attorney generals and other state enforcement authorities broader power to enforce consumer protection laws against banks;


• | authorized federal regulatory agencies to ban compensation arrangements at financial institutions that give employees incentives to engage in conduct that could pose risks to the nation’s financial system;


• | granted the U.S. Government resolution authority to liquidate or take emergency measures with regard to troubled financial institutions, such as bank holding companies, that fall outside the existing resolution authority of the FDIC;


• | required that the amount of any interchange fee charged by a debit card issuer with respect to a debit card transaction must be reasonable and proportional to the cost incurred by the issuer. On June 29, 2011, for banks with assets of $10 billion or greater, the Federal Reserve Board set the interchange rate cap at $0.21 per transaction and 5 basis points multiplied by the value of the transaction; 


• | gave the FDIC substantial new authority and flexibility in assessing deposit insurance premiums, which may result in increased deposit insurance premiums for Customers in the future;


• | increased the deposit insurance coverage limit for insurable deposits to $250,000 generally, and removes the limit entirely for transaction accounts;


• | permitted banks to pay interest on business demand deposit accounts;


• | extended the national bank lending (or loans-to-one-borrower) limits to other institutions;


• | prohibited banks subject to enforcement action such as a memorandum of understanding from changing their charter without the approval of both their existing charter regulator and their proposed new charter regulator; and


• | imposed new limits on asset purchase and sale transactions between banks and their insiders.

The EGRRCPA was signed into law by President Trump on May 24, 2018 and directs the Federal Reserve Board to monitor emerging risks to financial stability and enact supervision and prudential standards applicable to bank holding companies with total assets of $250 billion or more and non-bank covered companies designated as systematically important by the Financial Stability Oversight Council. In general, the EGRRCPA increases the statutory asset threshold, defined in the Dodd-Frank Act, above which the Federal Reserve is required to apply these enhanced prudential standards from $50 billion to $250 billion and immediately raised the asset threshold for stress testing from $10 billion to $100 billion for bank holding companies. Bank holding companies with $250 billion or more in total consolidated assets remain fully subject to the Dodd-Frank Act's enhanced prudential standards requirements. As a result, Customers is no longer subject to stress testing regulations or any requirement to publish the results of our stress testing. Customers will continue to perform certain stress tests internally and incorporate the economic models and information developed through our stress testing program into our risk management and business planning activities.
In July 2018, the Federal Reserve stated that it would no longer require bank holding companies with less than $100 billion in total consolidated assets to comply with the modified version of the liquidity coverage ratio. In addition, in October 2018, the federal bank regulators proposed to revise their liquidity requirements so that banking organizations that are not global 
18

systemically important banks and have less than $250 billion in total consolidated assets and less than $75 billion in each of off-balance-sheet exposure, nonbank assets, cross-jurisdictional activity and short-term wholesale funding would not be subject to any liquid coverage ratio or net stable funding ratio requirements.
In February 2014, the Federal Reserve adopted rules to implement certain of these enhanced prudential standards. Beginning in 2015, the rules require publicly traded bank holding companies with $10 billion or more in total consolidated assets to establish risk committees and require bank holding companies with $50 billion or more in total consolidated assets to comply with enhanced liquidity and overall risk management standards. Customers has established a risk committee and is in compliance with this requirement. In October 2018, the Federal Reserve and the other federal bank regulators proposed rules that would tailor the application of the enhanced prudential standards to bank holding companies and depository institutions pursuant to the EGRRCPA amendments, including by raising the asset threshold for application of many of these standards. For example, all publicly traded bank holding companies with $50 billion or more in total consolidated assets would be required to maintain a risk committee.
Many of these provisions are subject to further rule making and to the discretion of regulatory bodies, including Customers Bank’s primary federal banking regulator, the Federal Reserve.  It is not possible to predict at this time the extent to which regulations authorized or mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act and EGRRCPA will impose requirements or restrictions on Customers Bank in addition to or different from the provisions summarized above.
Regulatory Reform and Legislation. From time to time, various legislative and regulatory initiatives are introduced in Congress and state legislatures, as well as by regulatory agencies. Such initiatives may include proposals to expand or contract the powers of bank holding companies and depository institutions or proposals to substantially change the financial institution regulatory system. Such legislation could change banking statutes and the operating environment of Customers in substantial and unpredictable ways. If enacted, such legislation could increase or decrease the cost of doing business, limit or expand permissible activities or affect the competitive balance among banks, savings associations, credit unions and other financial institutions. Customers cannot predict whether any such legislation will be enacted, and, if enacted, the effect that it, or any implementing regulations, would have on its financial condition or results of operations. A change in statutes, regulations or regulatory policies applicable to Customers or our subsidiaries could have a material effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Deposit Insurance Assessments. Customers Bank’s deposits are insured by the FDIC up to the limits set forth under applicable law and are subject to deposit insurance premium assessments. The FDIC imposes a risk-based deposit premium assessment system, which was amended pursuant to the Federal Deposit Insurance Reform Act of 2005 (the “Act”). Under this system, the amount of FDIC assessments paid by an individual insured depository institution, like Customers Bank, is based on the level of perceived risk incurred in its activities. The FDIC places a depository institution in one of four risk categories determined by reference to its capital levels and supervisory ratings. In addition, in the case of those institutions in the lowest risk category, the FDIC further determines its assessment rates based on certain specified financial ratios.
In February 2011, the FDIC adopted a final rule modifying the risk-based assessment system and setting initial base assessment rates beginning in April 2011, ranging from 2.5 to 45 basis points of Tier I capital.
In addition to deposit insurance assessments, banks are subject to assessments to pay the interest on Financing Corporation bonds. The Financing Corporation was created by Congress to issue bonds to finance the resolution of failed thrift institutions. The FDIC sets the Financing Corporation assessment rate every quarter.
Community Reinvestment Act.  Under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977, the record of a bank holding company and its subsidiary banks must be considered by the appropriate Federal banking agencies, including the Federal Reserve Board, in reviewing and approving or disapproving a variety of regulatory applications including approval of a branch or other deposit facility, office relocation, a merger and certain acquisitions.  Federal banking agencies have demonstrated an increased readiness to deny applications based on unsatisfactory CRA performance.  The Federal Reserve Board is required to assess Customers' record to determine if it is meeting the credit needs of the community, including the low-and-moderate- income neighborhoods that it serves.  The Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 amended the CRA to require, among other things, that the Federal Reserve Board make publicly available an evaluation of the bank's record of meeting the credit needs of its entire community, including low-and-moderate-income neighborhoods.  This evaluation includes a descriptive rating (outstanding, satisfactory, needs to improve or substantial noncompliance) and a statement describing the basis for the rating.
Incentive Compensation. In June 2010, the Federal Reserve Board, OCC and FDIC issued comprehensive final guidance on incentive compensation policies intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness of such organizations by encouraging excessive risk-taking. The guidance, which covers all employees that have the ability to materially affect the risk profile of an organization, either individually or as part of a 
19

group, is based upon the key principles that a banking organization’s incentive compensation arrangements should (i) provide incentives that do not encourage risk-taking beyond the organization’s ability to effectively identify and manage risks, (ii) be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management and (iii) be supported by strong corporate governance, including active and effective oversight by the organization’s board of directors.
The Federal Reserve Board will review, as part of the regular, risk-focused examination process, the incentive compensation arrangements of banking organizations, such as Customers, that are not “large, complex banking organizations.” These reviews will be tailored to each organization based on the scope and complexity of the organization’s activities and the prevalence of incentive compensation arrangements. The findings of the supervisory initiatives will be included in reports of examination. Deficiencies will be incorporated into the organization’s supervisory ratings, which can affect the organization’s ability to make acquisitions and take other actions. Enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements, or related risk-management control or governance processes, pose a risk to the organization’s safety and soundness, and the organization is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies.
In addition, Section 956 of the Dodd-Frank Act required certain regulators (including the FDIC, SEC and Federal Reserve Board) to adopt requirements or guidelines prohibiting excessive compensation. In April and May 2016, the Federal Reserve, jointly with five other federal regulators, published a proposed rule in response to Section 956 of the Dodd-Frank Act, which requires implementation of regulations or guidelines to: (i) prohibit incentive-based payment arrangements that encourage inappropriate risks by certain financial institutions by providing excessive compensation or that could lead to material financial loss and (ii) require those financial institutions to disclose information concerning incentive-based compensation arrangements to the appropriate federal regulator.
The proposed rule identifies three categories of institutions that would be covered by these regulations based on average total consolidated assets, applying less prescriptive incentive-based compensation program requirements to the smallest covered institutions (Level 3) and progressively more rigorous requirements to the larger covered institutions (Level 1). Under the proposed rule, Customers would fall into the smallest category (Level 3), which applies to financial institutions with average total consolidated assets greater than $1 billion and less than $50 billion. The proposed rules would establish general qualitative requirements applicable to all covered entities, which would include (i) prohibiting incentive arrangements that encourage inappropriate risks by providing excessive compensation; (ii) prohibiting incentive arrangements that encourage inappropriate risks that could lead to a material financial loss; (iii) establishing requirements for performance measures to appropriately balance risk and reward; (iv) requiring board of director oversight of incentive arrangements and (v) mandating appropriate record keeping. Under the proposed rule, larger financial institutions with total consolidated assets of at least $50 billion would also be subject to additional requirements applicable to such institutions’ “senior executive officers” and “significant risk-takers.” These additional requirements would not be applicable to Customers because it currently has less than $50 billion in total consolidated assets. Comments on the proposed rule were due by July 22, 2016. As of the date of this document, the final rule has not yet been published by these regulators.
Consumer Protection Laws. Customers Bank is subject to a variety of consumer protection laws, including the Truth in Lending Act, the Truth in Savings Act adopted as part of the FDICIA, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Electronic Funds Transfer Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act and the regulations adopted thereunder. In the aggregate, compliance with these consumer protection laws and regulations involves substantial expense and administrative time on the part of Customers.
UDAP and UDAAP. Banking regulatory agencies have increasingly used a general consumer protection statute to address “unethical” or otherwise “bad” business practices that may not necessarily fall directly under the purview of a specific banking or consumer finance law. The law of choice for enforcement against such business practices has been Section 5 of the FTC Act, which is the primary federal law that prohibits unfair or deceptive acts or practices, referred to as "UDAP," and unfair methods of competition in or affecting commerce. “Unjustified consumer injury” is the principal focus of the FTC Act. Prior to the Dodd-Frank Act, there was little formal guidance to provide insight to the parameters for compliance with UDAP laws and regulations. However, UDAP laws and regulations have been expanded under the Dodd-Frank Act to apply to “unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices,” referred to as "UDAAP," which have been delegated to the CFPB for supervision. The CFPB has published its first Supervision and Examination Manual that addresses compliance with and the examination of UDAAP.
Bank Holding Company Regulation
As a bank holding company, Customers Bancorp is also subject to additional regulation.
The Bank Holding Company Act requires the Bancorp to secure the prior approval of the Federal Reserve Board before it owns or controls, directly or indirectly, more than five percent (5%) of the voting shares or substantially all of the assets of any bank.  
20

It also prohibits acquisition by the Bancorp of more than five percent (5%) of the voting shares of, or interest in, or all or substantially all of the assets of, any bank located outside of the state in which a current bank subsidiary is located unless such acquisition is specifically authorized by laws of the state in which such bank is located.  A bank holding company is prohibited from engaging in or acquiring direct or indirect control of more than five percent (5%) of the voting shares of any company engaged in non-banking activities unless the Federal Reserve Board, by order or regulation, has found such activities to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto.  In making this determination, the Federal Reserve Board considers whether the performance of these activities by a bank holding company would offer benefits to the public that outweigh the possible adverse effects.  Applications under the Bank Holding Company Act and the Change in Control Act are subject to review, based upon the record of compliance of the applicant with the CRA.
The Bancorp is required to file an annual report with the Federal Reserve Board and any additional information that the Federal Reserve Board may require pursuant to the Bank Holding Company Act.  Further, under Section 106 of the 1970 amendments to the Bank Holding Company Act and the Federal Reserve Board’s regulations, a bank holding company and its subsidiaries are prohibited from engaging in certain tie-in arrangements in connection with any extension of credit or provision of credit or provision of any property or services.  The so-called “anti-tie-in” provisions state generally that a bank may not extend credit, lease, sell property or furnish any service to a customer on the condition that the customer obtains additional credit or service from the bank, or on the condition that the customer not obtain other credit or service from a competitor.
The Federal Reserve Board permits bank holding companies to engage in non-banking activities so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto.  A number of activities are authorized by Federal Reserve Board regulation, while other activities require prior Federal Reserve Board approval.  The types of permissible activities are subject to change by the Federal Reserve Board.
