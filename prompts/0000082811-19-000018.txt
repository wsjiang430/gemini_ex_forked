Divestitures
In fiscal 2016, we completed two divestitures.

• | On June 1, 2016, we sold the Mastergear Worldwide ("Mastergear") business to Rotork PLC for a purchase price of $25.7 million. Mastergear was included in our Power Transmission Solutions segment. Gains related to the sale of $0.1 million and $11.6 million were recorded as a reduction to Operating Expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income during fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, respectively.


• | On July 7, 2016, we sold the assets of our Venezuelan subsidiary, which had been included in our Commercial and Industrial Systems segment, to a private company for $3.0 million. Of this amount, $1.0 million was received on the transaction closing date and $2.0 million was paid in 24 monthly installments. We recorded the gains as the cash was received. We wrote down our investment and ceased operations of this subsidiary in fiscal 2015.

Sales, Marketing and Distribution
We sell our products directly to OEMs, distributors and end-users. We have multiple business units that promote our brands across their respective sales organizations. These sales organizations consist of varying combinations of our own internal direct sales people as well as exclusive and non-exclusive manufacturers' representative organizations.

We operate large distribution facilities in Plainfield, Indiana; McAllen, Texas; LaVergne, Tennessee; Florence, Kentucky; and Monterrey, Mexico which serve as hubs for our North American distribution and logistics operations. Products are shipped from these facilities to our customers utilizing common carriers. We also operate numerous warehouse and distribution facilities in our global markets to service the needs of our customers. In addition, we have many manufacturer representatives' warehouses located in specific geographic areas to serve local customers.
We derive a significant portion of revenue from our OEM customers. In our HVAC business, a large portion of our sales are to key OEM customers which makes our relationship with each of these customers important to our business. We have long standing relationships with these customers and we expect these customer relationships will continue for the foreseeable future. Despite this relative concentration, we had no customer that accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated net sales in fiscal 2018, fiscal 2017 or fiscal 2016.
Many of our motors are incorporated into residential applications that OEMs sell to end users. The number of installations of new and replacement HVAC systems, pool pumps and related components is higher during the spring and summer seasons due to the increased use of air conditioning and swimming pools during warmer months. As a result, our revenues tend to be higher in the second and third quarters.
