ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 
Effective April 2, 2012, we changed our name to Black Ridge Oil & Gas, Inc. (“BROG”). Our common stock is traded on the OTCQB under the trading symbol “ANFC”.
 
The Company is focused on acquiring, investing in, and managing the oil and gas assets for our partners. We continue to pursue asset acquisitions in all major onshore unconventional shale formations that may be acquired with capital from our existing joint venture partners or other capital providers. Additionally, as the sponsor and manager of Black Ridge Acquisition Corp. (“BRAC”), we are focused on assisting BRAC in its efforts to identify a prospective target business for a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition or other similar business combination.
 
Rights Offering and BRAC IPO
 
The Company filed a Registration Statement on Form S-1 (the “Registration Statement”) with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) to register the issuance of 431,819,910 shares of common stock in a Rights Offering that was declared effective by the SEC on August 3, 2017 (the “Rights Offering”). Pursuant to the Rights Offering, the Company distributed, on a pro rata basis, one right for each share of common stock owned by shareholders on August 2, 2017 (the “Record Date”). Each right permitted a shareholder to purchase up to nine shares of common stock at a subscription price of $0.012 per share. The Rights Offering expired on September 8, 2017 (the “Expiration Date”).
 
Associated with the Rights Offering the Company also entered into a Standby Purchase Agreement (the “Backstop Agreement”) with a consortium of investors, including members of the Company’s board of directors and our Chief Executive Officer (collectively, the “Backstop Purchasers”), who agreed to purchase up to $2.9 million of the unsubscribed shares following the completion of the rights offering.
 
On September 26, 2017, the Company finalized the Rights Offering and Backstop Agreement, and issued 431,819,910 shares raising gross proceeds of $5,181,839. Under the Rights Offering the Company’s current shareholders exercised rights to purchase 199,811,421 shares of stock for a total of $2,397,737. Under the Backstop Agreement, the Backstop Purchasers purchased 232,008,489 shares of stock for a total of $2,784,102. Additionally, as part of Backstop Agreement, the Company issued 435,000 warrants to purchase its common stock at $0.01 to participants in the Backstop Agreement. We incurred $130,164 in costs associated with raising the capital in Rights Offering and Backstop Agreement which were charged directly to stockholder’s equity. In October 2017, the Company used $4,450,000 of the net proceeds of the Rights Offering and Backstop Agreement to fulfill its obligation as sponsor of a special purpose acquisition company, BRAC, simultaneous with BRAC’s initial public offering (IPO) described below. BRAC was formed on May 9, 2017 with the purpose of becoming the special acquisition company as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. The remaining proceeds from the Rights Offering are used for general corporate purposes which may include other investments and acquisitions.
 
On October 10, 2017, BRAC completed its IPO raising $138,000,000 of gross proceeds (including proceeds from the exercise of an over-allotment option by the underwriters on October 18, 2017). BRAC is a blank check company formed for the purpose of entering into a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or other similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities. BRAC’s efforts to identify a prospective target business are not limited to a particular industry or geographic region. Following the IPO and exercise of the over-allotment, the Company owns 22% of the outstanding common stock of BRAC and manages BRAC’s operations via a management services agreement.
 
The Company has determined that BRAC, following its IPO, is a variable interest entity (“VIE”) and that the Company is the primary beneficiary of the VIE. The Company determined that, due to the redemption feature associated with the IPO shares, that the IPO shareholders are indirectly protected from the operating expenses of BRAC and it has the power to direct the activities of BRAC through the date at which BRAC affords the stockholders the opportunity to vote to approve a proposed business combination. Therefore, the consolidated financial statements contain the operations of the BRAC from its inception on May 9, 2017. BRAC’s IPO shareholders are reflected in our financial statements as a non-controlling interest. The non-controlling interest was recorded at fair value on October 10, 2017, with an addition on October 18, 2017 as a result of the underwriters’ exercise of their over-allotment option. Hereafter the term “the Company” refers to the consolidated entity including BRAC.

Proposed Business Combination
 
On December 19, 2018, BRAC entered into an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization (the “Merger Agreement”) with Black Ridge Merger Sub, Corp., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of BRAC (“Merger Sub”), Allied Esports Entertainment, Inc. (“Allied Esports”), Ourgame International Holdings Ltd. (“Ourgame”), Noble Link Global Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ourgame (“Noble”), and Primo Vital Ltd., also a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ourgame (“Primo”).
 
Subject to the Agreement, (i) Noble will merge with and into Allied Esports (the “Redomestication Merger”) with Allied Esports being the surviving entity in such merger and (ii) immediately after the Redomestication Merger, Merger Sub will merge with and into Allied Esports with Allied Esports being the surviving entity of such merger (the “Transaction Merger” and together with the Redomestication Merger, the “Mergers” or the “Proposed Business Combination”) and becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of BRAC.
 
The Mergers will result in BRAC acquiring two of Ourgame’s global esports and entertainment assets, Allied Esports and WPT Enterprises, Inc. (“WPT”). Allied Esports is a premier esports entertainment company with a global network of dedicated esports properties and content production facilities. WPT is the creator of the World Poker Tour® (WPT®) – the premier name in internationally televised gaming and entertainment with brand presence in land-based tournaments, television, online and mobile. The proposed transaction will seek to strategically combine the globally recognized Allied Esports brand with the three-pronged business model of the iconic World Poker Tour, featuring in-person experiences, multiplatform content and interactive services, to leverage the high-growth opportunities in the global esports industry.
 
Upon consummation of the Mergers (the “Closing”), BRAC will issue to the former owners of Allied Esports and WPT (i) an aggregate of 11,602,754 shares of BRAC’s common stock and (ii) an aggregate of 3,800,003 warrants to purchase shares of BRAC’s common stock.
 
In addition to the consideration described above, the former owners of Allied Esports and WPT will be entitled to receive their pro rata portion of an aggregate of an additional 3,846,153 shares of BRAC’s common stock if the last sales price of BRAC’s common stock equals or exceeds $13.00 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations and recapitalizations) for thirty (30) consecutive days at any time during the five (5) year period commencing on the date of the Closing (the “Closing Date”).
 
Consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement is subject to customary conditions and covenants of the respective parties, including approval of BRAC’s stockholders and BRAC having cash on hand of at least $80 million. Further information regarding the Proposed Business Combination, the proposed business of the combined company following consummation of the Proposed Business Combination and the risks related to the proposed business of the combined company following consummation of the Proposed Business Combination can be found in BRAC’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on December 20, 2018, the preliminary proxy statement filed by BRAC with the SEC and the definitive proxy statement to be filed by BRAC with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Unless otherwise indicated, the information in this Report assumes BRAC will not consummate the Proposed Business Combination and will be forced to seek an alternative target with which to consummate an initial business combination.

On April 3, 2017, we were notified by Black Ridge Holding Company, LLC (“BRHC”), of its termination of our Management Services Agreement and that they had finalized the sale of BRHC’s oil and gas assets to a third party. BRHC was formed by the Company in 2016 to contribute and assign to BRHC, all of the Company’s oil and gas assets and related debt as part of a debt restructuring and was managed by the Company under a management services agreement. On April 3, 2017, BRHC signed a Contribution Agreement that provided for the transfer of ownership and title of all oil and gas assets held by BRHC in exchange for preferred membership interest in the acquiring LLC (the “BRHC Sale”). Consistent with the terms of the Management Services Agreement, we were paid for our management services through June 30, 2017.

Business
 
We believe we create value through identifying and targeting acreage positions or other assets with attractive returns on the capital employed by evaluating, amongst other factors, reserve potential, operator performance, anticipated well costs and anticipated operating expenses. Our management team has significant access to both publicly available and proprietary business combination opportunities and has collectively bid on over $2.4 billion of opportunities with private equity sponsors since June 2015.
 
With the experience and connections of our personnel across a variety of onshore unconventional oil and gas plays or other assets, we believe that we are able to create value for our partners through opportunistic acquisitions development and subsequent divestitures. We believe our experience and relationships enhance our ability to identify and acquire high value prospects and manage them effectively.
 
As the sponsor and manager of BRAC, we will be focused on BRAC’s efforts to identify a prospective target business.
 
Principal Agreements Affecting Our Ordinary Business
 
Our principal agreements for our continuing operations take the form of management service agreements, whereby our partners pay a fee to us for managing the business operations and day-to-day transactions of the business, and joint venture agreements, whereby joint ventures are funded by our partners and we are paid a fee to identify prospective oil and gas related investments for purchase and manage the day-to-day operations of those assets once purchased. Under the joint venture agreements, after certain investor hurdles are met, the Company will generally receive a share of profits in the joint venture. 
 
Employees
 
We currently have 7 full time employees. We may hire additional technical or administrative personnel as appropriate. However, we do not expect a significant change in the number of full time employees over the next 12 months based upon our currently-projected business plan. We are using and will continue to use the services of independent consultants and contractors to perform various professional services for us or on behalf of our partners. We believe that this use of third-party service providers enhances our ability to contain general and administrative expenses.
Office Locations
 
Our executive offices are located at 110 North Fifth Street, Suite 410, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55403. Our office space consists of approximately 2,786 square feet leased pursuant to an annual lease agreement that commenced on July 1, 2016 and continued on a month-to-month basis beginning July 1, 2017.
Financial Information about Segments and Geographic Areas
 
We have not segregated our operations into segments or geographic areas.
