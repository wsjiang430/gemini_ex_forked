ITEM 1: | BUSINESS
--------+---------

Company Overview
 
Ritchie Bros. Auctioneers Incorporated (“Ritchie Bros.”, the “Company”, “we”, or “us”) (NYSE & TSX: RBA) was founded in 1958 in Kelowna, British Columbia, Canada and is a world leader in asset management and disposition of used industrial equipment and other durable assets, selling $4.96 billion of used equipment and other assets during 2018. Our expertise, unprecedented global reach, market insight, and trusted portfolio of brands provide us with a unique position in the used equipment market. We sell used equipment for our customers through live, unreserved auctions at 40 auction sites worldwide, which are also simulcast online to reach a global bidding audience and through our online marketplaces.

Through our unreserved auctions, online marketplaces, and private brokerage services, we sell a broad range of used and unused equipment, including earthmoving equipment, truck trailers, government surplus, oil and gas equipment and other industrial assets. Construction and heavy machinery comprise the majority of the equipment sold. Customers selling equipment through our sales channels include end users (such as construction companies), equipment dealers, original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) and other equipment owners (such as rental companies). Our customers participate in a variety of sectors, including heavy construction, transportation, agriculture, energy, and mining.

We operate globally with locations in more than 13 countries, including the U.S., Canada, Australia, the United Arab Emirates, and the Netherlands, and employ more than 2,200 full time employees worldwide.

Recent Developments
 
On May 31, 2017, we completed the acquisition of IronPlanet® (the “Acquisition”), a leading online marketplace for heavy equipment and other durable assets. We acquired IronPlanet for approximately $776.5 million and was financed through a combination of senior notes offering and a secured term loan facility.
 
The acquisition of IronPlanet accelerates Ritchie Bros.' strategy of becoming a one-stop, multichannel company where customers can buy, sell or list equipment, when, how and where they choose – both onsite and online. As part of the acquisition, Ritchie Bros. also gains expanded growth capabilities in the oil and gas and government sectors.
 
The company combined the Ritchie Bros. and IronPlanet sales forces in the U.S., Canada and Europe, in line with its strategy to provide customers a one-stop, multichannel experience. As a part of this acquisition, Ritchie Bros. also entered into an initial five-year strategic alliance with Caterpillar which is expected to strengthen its relationship with Caterpillar's independent dealers around the world by providing them enhanced and continued access to a global auction marketplace to sell their used equipment.
 
Company Objectives & Strategies
 
Key objectives and strategies
 We operate in a large and fragmented used equipment marketplace and believe that significant growth opportunities can be captured by building on Ritchie Bros.' established sales and operation infrastructure combined with IronPlanet's online formats. Our wide range of sales channels and sales formats offer our customers unprecedented choice from our well-known live and online simulcast options to featured online auctions and marketplaces to private contract negotiations. We are building on our position as trusted advisors and are evolving from transactional selling to solution selling.
 
At the beginning of 2015, we formalized a new strategy that centered around becoming a more diversified, multi-channel company that offered a full range of asset management and disposition solutions, all on a greater scale, that would provide even more choice to customers. Our strategy focuses on two overarching strategic objectives: (i) grow share of the auction segment and (ii) penetrate the upstream market. The executable pillars of the strategy are Grow, Drive and Optimize.
 

a. | GROW Revenues and Earnings. We are committed to pursuing growth initiatives that will further enhance our sector reach, drive geographic depth, meet a broader set of customer needs, and add scale to our operations. We will leverage multi-channel solutions to drive market share growth. With the acquisition of IronPlanet, Ritchie Bros. now possesses leading mainstream auction solutions and services to be able to serve customers end-to-end in a channel-agnostic manner. We are focused on penetrating the upstream market and are focused on providing alternative solutions such as Marketplace E to customers who currently use brokers or sell privately, and develop partnerships and deeper penetration with retail customers through Ritchie Bros. Asset Solutions (“RBAS”).

· | Exceptional Customer Service is a key enabler for growth. We will look to leverage our full suite of solutions, competitive technology enablers, CRM, operational excellence and our renowned experienced sales force to provide customers with unparalleled service. We are positioning our Company to offer a truly compelling and superior experience for our customers as we provide them with more choice, more sales channels, and a larger digital offering which will enable equipment sellers to transact and list when they want, where they want and how they want.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


b. | DRIVE Efficiencies and Effectiveness. We plan to take advantage of opportunities to improve overall effectiveness of our organization.
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


c. | OPTIMIZE our Balance Sheet. Our business model provides us with the ability to generate strong cash flows. Cash flow represents our ability to convert revenue to cash, and provides a meaningful indication of the strength of our business. We will focus not only on profit growth but also further enhancing cash flow, reviewing contract structures and auction site returns to improve the cash flow and asset returns.

Intellectual Property
 
We believe our intellectual property has significant value and is an important factor in marketing our organization, services, and website, as well as differentiating us from our competitors. We own or hold the rights to use valuable intellectual property such as trademarks, service marks, domain names and tradenames. We protect our intellectual property in Canada, the U.S., and internationally through federal, provincial, state, and common law rights, including registration of certain trade mark and service marks for many of our brands, including our core brands. We also have secured patents for inventions and have registered our domain names.

We rely on contractual restrictions and rights to protect certain of our proprietary rights in products and services. Effective protection of our intellectual property can be expensive to maintain and may require litigation. We must protect our intellectual property rights and other proprietary rights in many jurisdictions throughout the world. In addition, we may, from time to time, be subject to intellectual property claims, including allegations of infringement, which can be costly to defend. For a discussion of the risks involved with intellectual property litigation and enforcement of our intellectual property rights, see the related information in “Part I, Item 1A: Risk Factors” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 
Competition
 
Competition Overview
 The global used equipment market is highly fragmented with total annual global used equipment volumes estimated at more than $300 billion. We estimate the used equipment auction segment is $25 billion. Ritchie Bros. is the largest live auction company and claims approximately 20% market share of the live auction space with its $4.96 billion in GTV volume in 2018. In addition to the auction segment, two other major segments include private sales and brokers as well as the retail segment which includes OEM’s, OEM dealers, rental companies and large strategic accounts. We compete based on breadth, brand reputation, security, technology, and global reach of our services, as well as in the variety of contracts and methods and channels of selling equipment. We also compete with private sales – often securing new business from equipment owners who had previously tried selling their equipment privately. Given the fragmentation in the auction market as well as upstream opportunities in private sales and retail, there is significant opportunity for growth.
 
Competitive advantages
 Our key strengths provide distinct competitive advantages, and have enabled us to achieve significant and profitable growth over the long term.
 
Global platform
 We pride ourselves on our unparalleled ability to connect buyers and sellers through our global network of 40 operational auction sites in more than 13 countries, including the U.S., Canada, Australia, the United Arab Emirates, and the Netherlands and via multiple online sales channels. Our online bidding technology and Ritchie Bros. website are available in 10 and 22 languages, respectively. Our global presence ensures we generate global market pricing for our equipment sellers, as we reach international buyers and equipment demand, helping to deliver strong price realization through our sales channels. This global reach provides us and our selling customers with the ability to transcend local market conditions.
 
Customer Relationships
 Relationships are the core of Ritchie Bros. – delighting customers and treating them like friends while meeting their business needs. By offering an unprecedented choice of solutions that best suit our customers’ needs, making their lives easier in the process, we develop relationships that last across generations. We take a long-term approach with our customers and as such we position our sales force to act as Trusted Advisors to our customers.
 
Breadth of solutions 
 Post the acquisition of IronPlanet, we now possess the ability to meet all the buyers and seller’s unique needs in a one-stop-shop manner. The event-driven live on site auction, which has been Ritchie’s core business for nearly 60 years, is now just one—albeit powerful solution—to meet our customers’ varied needs. By delivering choice, the Company can work with customers as a trusted advisor to provide them each with a tailored suite of equipment disposition solutions and asset management capabilities to best meet their needs.
 
While Ritchie Bros. has a full suite of solutions, most of its volumes are generated through three core solutions.
 

1. | The unreserved on site auction which provides Ritchie customers with care, custody, and control at its live auction sites.
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | IronPlanet weekly online auctions for sellers looking to manage the disposition of their assets on a more frequent basis and being able to sell from their yard or location without having to move equipment. Auctions are held every Thursday in North America; monthly in our international regions.
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | The reserved online marketplace that affords sellers with control over price and timing, and with solutions such as Make Offer, Buy Now, and Reserve Price selling formats for buyers. The Company recently launched a combined reserved online marketplace, known as Marketplace-E, bringing together Ritchie Bros.’ Equipment One with IronPlanet’s Daily Marketplace.

Data & Analytics
 
The Company’s deep auction history and strategic investments in technology has enabled us to develop a rich database of information which we intend to leverage to provide our customers with value-added insights, equipment pricing trends, and differentiated service offerings.
 
We are also deriving enterprise value from data by using it to improve operational efficiencies and augment our transactional products services. We have invested in analytics talent, data infrastructure and integration, and machine learning to provide near real-time strategic and operational insights and services to enable us to deliver on our multi-channel business objectives.
 
We have also invested in predictive machine learning to deliver highly scalable asset valuation predictions to enable enhanced and scalable asset valuation capabilities. Ritchie Bros. possesses one of the most complete collections of transparent transaction data in the industries we serve. As a paid service, we have recently launched a Data and Insights Module within Ritchie Bros. Asset Solutions. This allow customers to gain self-service insights into market trends, asset pricing and their sales activity on Ritchie Bros. platforms.
 
Our People
 
Our continued success is largely dependent on the strength and capabilities of our employees, and we believe that the development of a safe, engaged and inclusive workforce is critical to the achievement of our strategic goals. Along with a strong reputation among customers and the general public, Ritchie Bros. is acknowledged as a great place to work and was recently awarded one of British Columbia’s Top Employers in 2018.
Ethics
 Ritchie Bros. recognizes that our employees are our greatest assets. Employee development is not just important to the Company but also for the professional and personal growth of our employees.  We foster our employees’ development through a wide range of development programs, instructional services and learning products. Ritchie Bros. is creating a learning culture where managers are responsible for providing an environment that supports the growth and development needs of their employees, and where employees are motivated to establish development plans and look for opportunities to apply their learning on the job.
 
The Company's employees and officers conduct the Company's business on a day-to-day basis in a manner that promotes and protects our reputation and the trust that our customers and investors have in the Ritchie Bros. brand. To further promote and instil strong operating practices and foster appropriate behaviours and decision making, the Company promotes and mandates the following:

-----------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Whistle-blower Hotline | Provides a confidential and anonymous communication channel for anyone, both external and internal to submit concerns without fear of repercussions.

Health & Safety
 Our Company’s 2,200+ employees have an unreserved commitment to safety and is committed to send everyone home, every day, the way they came to work.  We support this commitment through the use of a Safety Steering Team made up of a cross section of functions within the organization, the use of Continuous Improvement Teams made up of Operations, Sales and Administration personnel, an active Risk Identification process at the field level and open communications around safety both on and off the job.
 
The Safety Steering Team identifies continuous improvement activities using a quarterly review of all incidents across the organization to identify common issues that require attention. In the past three years, we have improved not only our TRIR (Total Recordable Incident Rate) and severity rating but we have seen an overall reduction in total incidents throughout the organization supporting our unreserved commitment to safety and to send everyone home, every day, the way they came to work.
 
Diversity & Inclusion
 The Company also supports an inclusive workplace culture and is committed to the education, recruitment, development and advancement of diverse team members worldwide.

LINK is an Employee Resource Group (ERG) to serve as a resource for the women at Ritchie Bros. and the organization itself. Although the ERG’s primary goal is to support RB women, the broader mandate is to make the resources and services available to all employees.

The Role of Technology
 
The role of technology in our business continues to evolve and become more meaningful as more buyers adopt mobile and online channels to transact their business with us. We have been on a pathway to leverage digital and technology capabilities to improve the consumer auction and leverage technology as a competitive differentiator. 
 
The acquisition of IronPlanet was an inflection point in our business and was a step change in this direction as it positioned us as a technology-enabled asset disposition company. The combination of IronPlanet’s technology and our existing assets results in tools and capabilities that provide our customers, both buyers and sellers, with more efficient and richer experiences and value-added differentiators creating deeper brand loyalty.
 
We remain focused on technology enablement to transform the way we compete, the way we work and leveraging technology for future growth. Our technology capabilities are delivering choice for our customers in the form of multiple channels for buyers and sellers, meeting customer’s asset management needs through information-rich software solutions and leveraging our rich data repository to drive strong sales and improved pricing decisions. We are also providing our customers with leading tools and capabilities to deliver on a unique leading customer experience.
 
As the role of technology and data in our business expands, so too does the importance of cybersecurity. The Company takes protecting our customers, employees, brand, systems and data very seriously. The Company actively monitors and manages security risks and looks to mitigate them through enterprise-wide programs, employee training and vulnerability assessments. We have made – and continue to make – investments in dedicated information security resources, leadership and technology. We continue to strengthen and enhance our program and controls around people, process and technology and apply risk-based strategies to enhance detection, protection and response efforts. 
 
Our commitment to data security and privacy is demonstrated in the Company’s overall approach to governance. We are incorporating security and privacy by design and increasing awareness around the company with support from management and our board, include the following:
 

· | We have formed a Data Privacy Committee. The oversight of the committee is to develop and approve our general strategy and policies on data privacy and data protection, assess the data privacy risks associated with the Company’s business activities, and provide direction to, and support the initiatives of, our Data Protection Office.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Our information security and policy committee meets on a monthly basis and advises Information Security on issues of security and risk reduction. This committee is responsible for reviewing and setting security policies, assessing risk and impacts of security incidents, and providing guidance and direction for security programs and strategy. The committee will be advised regarding information security assessment activities and will provide advice regarding education and communication that may be needed to support the information security policies and other compliance policy. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | All eligible employees complete mandatory privacy and information-security training courses, which are refreshed annually. Through continual awareness-building, such as our Cybersecurity Awareness Month every October, we work to promote a culture that understands the critical importance of data security and privacy, areas of vulnerability and how to remain vigilant when handling data.

Seasonality
 
Our GTV and associated A&M segment revenues are affected by the seasonal nature of our business. GTV and A&M segment revenues tend to increase during the second and fourth calendar quarters, during which time we generally conduct more business than in the first and third calendar quarters. Given the operating leverage inherent in our business model, the second and fourth quarter also tend to produce higher operating margins, given the higher volume and revenue generated in those quarters.
Revenue Mix Fluctuations
 
Our revenue is comprised of service revenues and revenue from inventory sold. Service revenues from A&M segment activities include commissions earned at our live auctions, online marketplaces, and private brokerage services, and various auction-related fees, including listing and buyer transaction fees. We also recognize revenues from our Other Services activities as service revenues. Revenue from inventory sales is recognized as part of our A&M activities, and relates to revenues earned through our inventory contracts.
 
Revenue from inventory sales can fluctuate significantly, as it changes based on whether our customers sell using a straight commission contract or an inventory contract at time of selling. Straight commission contracts will result in the commission being recognized as service revenues, while inventory contracts will result in the gross transaction value of the equipment sold being recorded as revenue from inventory sales with the related cost recognized in cost of inventory sold. As a result, a change in the revenue mix between service revenues and revenue from inventory sales can have a significant impact on revenue growth percentages.
 
Governmental Regulations and Environmental Laws
 
Our operations are subject to a variety of federal, provincial, state and local laws, rules, and regulations throughout the world. We believe that we are compliant in all material respects with those laws, rules, and regulations that affect our business, and that such compliance does not impose a material impediment on our ability to conduct our business.
 
We believe that, among other things, laws, rules, and regulations related to the following list of items affect our business:
 

· | Imports and exports of equipment. Particularly, there are restrictions in the U.S. and Europe that may affect the ability of equipment owners to transport certain equipment between specified jurisdictions. Also, engine emission standards in some jurisdictions limit the operation of certain trucks and equipment in those regions.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Development or expansion of auction sites. Such activities depend upon the receipt of required licenses, permits, and other governmental authorizations. We are also subject to various local zoning requirements pertaining to the location of our auction sites, which vary among jurisdictions.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The use, storage, discharge, and disposal of environmentally sensitive materials. Under such laws, an owner or lessee of, or other person involved in, real estate may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances located on or in, or emanating from, such property, as well as related costs of investigation and property damage. These laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or lessee or other person knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Worker health and safety, privacy of customer information, and the use, storage, discharge, and disposal of environmentally sensitive materials.
