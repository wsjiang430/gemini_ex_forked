our products to end users. Certain of our acquired businesses historically sold their products directly to end-user customers and continue to have direct relationships with customers.
Outside of the U.S., our subsidiaries located in Australia, Belgium, Japan, Italy, Korea, the P.R.C., the United Kingdom and Brazil distribute our Company’s products. Operations in Maasmechelen, Belgium; St. Gallen, Switzerland; Shanghai, P.R.C.; and Montevideo, Uruguay reinforce our commitment to their regions.
During 2018, manufacturing capacity met business demand. Production requirements in the immediate future are expected to be met through existing facilities, planned facility expansions, the installation of new automatic and semi-automatic machine tools, efficiency and productivity improvements, the use of leased space and available subcontract services. In 2018, we completed projects to expand manufacturing and office facilities in our Process segment, and construction is in progress to more than double the size of our Contractor segment facility in Rogers, MN and significantly expand our manufacturing facility in Sioux Falls, SD. We are in the planning and design phases of additional projects to expand capacity in other manufacturing and distribution locations in 2019 and beyond. For more details on our facilities, see Item 2, Properties.

Our Contractor products are distributed primarily though distributor outlets whose main products are paint and other coatings. Certain sprayers and accessories are distributed globally through the home center channel. Contractor products are also sold through general equipment distributors outside of North America.
Raw Materials
The primary materials and components in our products are steel of various alloys, sizes and hardness; specialty stainless steel and aluminum bar stock, tubing and castings; tungsten carbide; electric and gas motors; injection molded plastics; sheet metal; forgings; powdered metal; hoses; electronic components and high performance plastics, such as polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE). The materials and components that we use are generally adequately available through multiple sources of supply. To manage cost, we source significant amounts of materials and components from outside the U.S., primarily in the Asia Pacific region.
In 2018, our raw material and purchased component availability was strong. Pressures from tariffs, mostly on metals and electronics, and increased material prices, particularly in aluminum, stainless steel, carbon steel bar stock, electronic controls, plastics and copper, increased production cost in 2018. We expect these pressures will continue into 2019. 
We endeavor to address fluctuations in the price and availability of various materials and components through adjustable surcharges and credits, close management of current suppliers, price negotiations and an intensive search for new suppliers. We have performed risk assessments of our key suppliers, and we factor the risks identified into our commodity plans.
Intellectual Property
We own a number of patents across our segments and have patent applications pending in the U.S. and other countries. We also license our patents to others and are a licensee of patents owned by others. In our opinion, our business is not materially dependent upon any one or more of these patents or licenses. Our Company also owns a number of trademarks in the U.S. and foreign countries, including registered trademarks for “GRACO,” “Gema,” several forms of a capital “G,” and various product trademarks that are material to our business, inasmuch as they identify Graco and our products to our customers.
Sales to Major Customers 
Worldwide sales in the Contractor and Industrial segments to The Sherwin-Williams Company represented over 10 percent of the Company’s consolidated sales in 2018, 2017 and 2016.

Competition
We encounter a wide variety of competitors that vary by product, industry and geographic area. Each of our segments generally has several competitors. Our competitors are both U.S. and foreign companies and range in size. We believe that our ability to compete depends upon product quality, product reliability, innovation, design, customer support and service, specialized engineering and competitive pricing. Although no competitor duplicates all of our products, some competitors are larger than our Company, both in terms of sales of directly competing products and in terms of total sales and financial resources. We also face competitors with different cost structures and expectations of profitability and these companies may offer competitive products at lower prices. We refresh our product line and continue development of our distribution channel to stay competitive. We also face competitors who illegally sell counterfeits of our products or otherwise infringe on our intellectual property rights. We may have to increase our intellectual property and unfair competition enforcement activities.
Environmental Protection
Our compliance with federal, state and local laws and regulations did not have a material effect upon our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position during the fiscal year ended December 28, 2018.
Employees
As of December 28, 2018, we employed approximately 3,700 persons. Of this total, approximately 1,500 were employees based outside of the U.S., and 1,000 were hourly factory workers in the U.S. None of our Company’s U.S. employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. Various national industry-wide labor agreements apply to certain employees in various countries outside of the U.S. Compliance with such agreements has no material effect on our Company or our operations.
