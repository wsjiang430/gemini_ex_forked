Challenges associated with increasing complexity of healthcare data
 Across the healthcare landscape, a significant amount of data is being created every day, driven by patient care, payment systems, regulatory compliance, and recordkeeping. This includes information within patient health records, clinical trials, pharmacy benefit programs, imaging systems, sensors, and monitoring platforms, laboratory results, patient-reported information, hospital, and physician performance programs, and billing and payment processing.
 The U.S. Healthcare system has invested billions of dollars to collect vast amounts of detailed information in digital format. Examples of major areas of investment include electronic transactional systems that digitize clinical information (e.g., EHR systems, pharmacy, laboratory, imaging, patient satisfaction, and healthcare information exchanges), financial information (e.g., general ledger, costing, and billing), and operational information (e.g., supply chain, human resources, time and attendance, IT support, and patient engagement). Wearables and sensors drive personalized health data for continuous monitoring of patients through daily activity logs, biometric sensors, fall sensors, social activity sensors, etc. These wearables and sensors result in a proliferation of healthcare data that also includes socioeconomic, genomic, and remote patient monitoring information. Collecting, storing, and using healthcare data is complicated by the breadth and depth of disparate sources, the multitude of formats, and increasing regulatory requirements.
 The data is vital for Life Sciences and pharmaceutical industries; however, traditional and current data platforms are not equipped to meet this surge or the analytic demands. Today, the data platform is expected to stay relevant for at least 15 years, be able to democratize the data, and still be secure and compliant. Data and analytics in healthcare is transforming the way illnesses are identified and treated, improving quality of life and avoiding preventable deaths.
 We believe our DataEz platform addresses these challenges. DataEz is a cloud-based data pipeline platform that helps to enable personal healthcare data management, analytics, and data science capabilities for large Life Sciences, pharmaceutical, and healthcare organizations. It integrates with a larger variety of data sources to ingest, process, store, analyze, and gain insights from the data. By leveraging the real-world evidence data and the ability to diagnose through advanced predictive modelling, AI/ML makes the process simpler and less expensive. Life Sciences industries will require a secure, privacy-compliant, and future-proof data platform as a foundation for large-scale genomics collaborations and for efforts to analyze archived data, including privacy-protected data. This means most organizations will turn into data organizations and will aggressively leverage data as a core asset to drive innovation in their businesses.
 Challenges due to lack of coordination and interoperability
 The healthcare industry is fragmented and inefficient, with different legacy health insurers, hospital systems, provider groups, and pharmacy networks each possessing distinct incentive structures—some or all of which may diverge from consumers’ interests. Even as consumer demand for greater coordination grows, inflexible and disparate legacy technological systems present a significant barrier to meeting consumers’ wants and needs.

After decades of investing in EHR technology, the state of interoperability is insufficient and inhibits care coordination, health data exchange, clinical efficiency, and the quality of care provided to patients. Given that the EHR is the principal electronic interface used today at the point of care, the path to improved data-driven decision support will require integration between EHR systems and other data and analytics providers. Incidentally, the U.S. Healthcare system is in the midst of an “open data wave,” with an increasing focus on, and demand for, patient data interoperability. Additionally, recent laws and regulations, such as the 21st Century Cures Act, promote and prioritize interoperability and the free exchange of health information. The COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 has helped to pave the way for advancements in EHR interoperability and standardization. The federal government’s new regulations aim to help patients gain better control of their health data via smartphone apps, interoperability is expected to increase between providers, payers, and healthcare technology companies.
 We believe our Healthcare Interoperability solutions and proprietary platforms drive resilient interoperable health infrastructure as a catalyst for delivering better care and reducing costs. We participate in Google Cloud’s Healthcare Interoperability Readiness Program, which aims to help free up patient data and make it more accessible across the continuum of care, as well as set up organizations for long-term success with more modern, interoperable API-first architectures. We help healthcare providers understand their current interoperability maturity levels and map out a stepwise journey to enable interoperability. For example, our Readabl.AI is a Google Cloud-based AI/ML platform to ingest documents, which provides OCR (optical character recognition) capabilities with Natural Language Processing where the patient information is extracted and matched/validated with healthcare providers’ EHR system via FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) API.
 Impact of, and response to, COVID-19 pandemic
 Because of COVID-19, healthcare and Life Sciences organizations are accelerating research, rethinking patient care, and maintaining clinical and operational continuity during this unprecedented time for the global health system. COVID-19 has necessitated the adoption of digital communication channels and remote working technology within the Healthcare and Life Sciences industry at a rapid pace.
 We believe our proprietary platforms and solutions address these challenges. Our business is focused on providing digital platform solutions to healthcare organizations and it is our mission to adequately address COVID-19 challenges for the benefit of our customers and society in general. As a result, consumers have better personal care, convenience, and value. We believe that COVID-19 is expected to drive increased utilization of technology during and after the pandemic, and such shift to a virtual approach creates a unique opportunity for our business to shape the new virtual-oriented experiences of businesses through our cloud technology and services.
 Our Technology and Services
 We offer two proprietary software platforms, CloudEz and DataEz, for cloud transformation, automation, data management, security and data governance, and clinical and non-clinical operations management. The platforms are composed of individual, proprietary technology toolsets and deep data assets that can be rapidly configured to empower the operationalization of large-scale, data-driven healthcare initiatives. The platforms enable healthcare organizations to implement highly sophisticated value-based initiatives on a very large scale. At the core of value-based initiatives is the need to aggregate and analyse data, garner meaningful insight from the results, and use these insights to drive material change to outcomes and economics. The platforms address these needs through their major competencies: (i) large-scale data connectivity, integration, and validation capabilities, (ii) advanced predictive analytics and high-speed computing, (iii) toolsets to translate resulting insights into real-world impact, and (iv) purpose-built data visualization and reporting.
