Item 1. Business
 
Enzon Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, the “Company,” “Enzon,” “we” or “us”), manages its sources of royalty revenues from existing licensing arrangements with other companies primarily related to sales of certain drug products that utilize our proprietary technology. In 2018, the primary source of our royalties and milestones revenues was a milestone payment of $7 million due from Servier IP UK Limited (“Servier”). On December 20, 2018, we were notified that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) approved Servier’s Biologics License Application (“BLA”) for calaspargase pegol – mknl (brand name ASPARLAS™), also known as SC Oncaspar. Pursuant to an agreement originally entered into with Sigma-Tau Finanziaria S.p.A. (“Sigma-Tau”) in November 2009, and ultimately assigned to Servier, we earned a milestone payment of $7.0 million. Accordingly, we recorded revenue and a milestone receivable of $7.0 million at December 31, 2018. In 2017, the primary source of our royalties and milestones revenues was the revenues received from Nektar Therapeutics, Inc. (“Nektar”) pursuant to the Second Amendment (“Nektar Second Amendment”) to our Cross-License and Option Agreement (the “Nektar License Agreement”), which generated non-recurring milestones revenues of $7.0 million (see below). The receipt of this $7.0 million satisfied all future obligations of royalty payments to us pursuant to the Nektar License Agreement.
 
Prior to 2017, the primary source of our royalty revenues was derived from sales of PegIntron, which is marketed by Merck & Co., Inc. (“Merck”). The Company currently has no clinical operations and limited corporate operations. We have no intention of resuming any clinical development activities or acquiring new sources of royalty revenues. Royalty revenues from sales of PegIntron accounted for (2)% and 7% of our total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, net of the effects of adjustments for Merck’s recoupment of previously overpaid royalties. The effects of such recoupments were recorded as a decrease of royalty revenues aggregating approximately $280,000 and $877,000 for the years ending December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, as discussed in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
In March 2018, Merck notified us that a downward adjustment of approximately $313,000 in royalties was necessary, resulting primarily from product returns relating to periods prior to December 31, 2017. Accordingly, at December 31, 2017, we accrued a liability to Merck of approximately $313,000 and partially offset that amount by the $88,000 that was due to us from Merck. Thus, we recorded a net payable to Merck of approximately $225,000 at December 31, 2017. In January 2018, Merck paid the $88,000 to us, which increased the liability to $313,000. During the second quarter, Enzon earned approximately $60,000 of royalties, which reduced the royalty payable to Merck to $253,000. During the third quarter of 2018, Merck notified us of an additional recoupment of approximately $280,000, resulting primarily from product rebates and returns. In the fourth quarter, Enzon earned approximately $94,000 of royalties. Accordingly, the liability to Merck was $439,000 at December 31, 2018, as discussed in Note 4 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.
 
In April 2013, we announced that we intended to distribute excess cash, expected to arise from royalty revenues, in the form of periodic dividends to stockholders. On February 4, 2016, our Board adopted a Plan of Liquidation and Dissolution (the “Plan of Liquidation and Dissolution”), the implementation of which has been postponed. (See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.)

  On January 30, 2019, we entered into a letter agreement with Servier, a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of Les Laboratoires Servier, in connection with the asset purchase agreement, dated as of November 9, 2009 (the “Asset Purchase Agreement”), by and between Klee Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Defiante Farmacêutica, S.A. (“Defiante”) and Sigma-Tau, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand. Under the letter agreement, Servier, as successor-in-interest to Defiante, has confirmed its obligation to pay us a $7.0 million milestone payment related to SC Oncaspar as a result of the FDA’s December 20, 2018 approval of calaspargase pegol – mknl (brand name ASPARLAS™) as a component of a multi-agent chemotherapeutic regimen for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia in pediatric and young adult patients age 1 month to 21 years. In addition, under the letter agreement, we agreed to waive Servier’s obligations to pursue the development of SC Oncaspar in Europe and the approval of SC Oncaspar by the European Medicines Agency (“EMEA”) under the Asset Purchase Agreement, provided that the Company is not waiving Servier’s obligation to make any applicable milestone payment to the Company upon EMEA approval, if any, of SC Oncaspar. Servier is required to pay the $7.0 million milestone payment to us within three business days following the parties’ completion of procedures for claiming benefits under the double tax treaty between the United States and the United Kingdom. We expect to receive the $7.0 million milestone payment from Servier by the third quarter of 2019. However, no assurance can be given as to the timing of our receipt of the payment.
 
On June 26, 2017, we entered into the Nektar Second Amendment, wherein Nektar agreed to buy-out all remaining payment obligations to us under the Nektar License Agreement. In consideration for fully paid-up licenses under the Nektar License Agreement and for the dismissal with prejudice of all claims and counterclaims asserted in the litigation with Nektar, Nektar agreed to pay us the sum of $7.0 million, which satisfied all future obligations of royalty payments pursuant to the Nektar License Agreement. The entire amount due was received during 2017. Accordingly, we recorded revenue of $7.0 million in 2017.
 
We have a marketing agreement with Micromet AG (“Micromet”), now part of Amgen, Inc. (the “Micromet Marketing Agreement”), that was entered into in 2004, under which Micromet is the exclusive marketer of the parties’ combined intellectual property portfolio in the field of single-chain antibody technology.  Under the Micromet Marketing Agreement, the parties agreed to share, on an equal basis, in any licensing fees, milestone payments and royalties revenue received by Micromet in connection with any licenses of the patents within the portfolio by Micromet to any third party during the term of the collaboration. To our knowledge, Micromet has a license agreement with Viventia Biotech (Barbados) Inc. (“Viventia”), now part of Sesen Bio, Inc. (“Sesen”) that was entered into in 2005, under which Micromet granted Viventia nonexclusive rights, with certain sublicense rights, for know-how and patents allowing exploitation of certain single chain antibody products, which patents cover some key aspects of Vicinium, one of Sesen’s drug candidates that is in Phase 3 clinical trials being evaluated for the treatment of patients with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer. To our knowledge, Micromet is entitled to receive (i) certain milestone payments with respect to the filing of a new drug application (“NDA”) for Vicinium with the FDA or the filing of a marketing approval application for Vicinium with the EMEA; (ii) certain milestone payments with respect to the first commercial sale of Vicinium in the U.S. or Europe and (iii) certain royalties on net sales for ten years from the first commercial sale of Vicinium. Pursuant to the Micromet Marketing Agreement, we would be entitled to a 50% share of these milestone payments and royalties received by Micromet. Due to the challenges associated with developing and obtaining approval for drug products, there is substantial uncertainty whether any of these milestones will be achieved. We also have no control over the time, resources and effort that Sesen may devote to its programs and limited access to information regarding or resulting from such programs. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that we will receive any of the milestone or royalty payments under the Micromet Marketing Agreement. We will not recognize revenue until all revenue recognition requirements are met.
 
Commencing on March 1, 2016, we changed the location of our principal executive offices to 20 Commerce Drive, Suite 135, Cranford, New Jersey, 07016. We entered into an office service agreement with Regus Management Group, LLC (“Regus”) for use of office space at this location effective March 1, 2016. Under the agreement, in exchange for our right to use the office space at this location, we were required to pay Regus an initial service retainer of $2,418 and thereafter pay Regus a monthly fee of $1,209 until February 28, 2017. This agreement was renewed for two one-year extensions, until February 28, 2019, for a monthly fee of $1,259. In June 2018, Regus and we agreed to end the lease on August 31, 2018, and replace it with an updated office service agreement. We entered into an office service agreement with Regus for mailbox plus, telephone answering, and virtual office services effective September 1, 2018. Under the agreement, in exchange for the services provided by Regus, we were required to pay Regus an initial service retainer of $259 and thereafter pay Regus a monthly fee of $259 until August 31, 2019.
 
Effective July 1, 2018, we entered into an office rental agreement with Equinox Junior, LLC (“Equinox”) for use of office space at 3556 Main Street, Manchester, VT, 05225. Under this agreement, in exchange for our right to use the office space at this location, we are required to pay Equinox a monthly fee of $708 until June 30, 2019.

Plan of Dissolution
 
On February 4, 2016, our Board of Directors adopted the Plan of Liquidation and Dissolution pursuant to which the Company would, subject to obtaining requisite stockholder approval, be liquidated and dissolved in accordance with Sections 280 and 281(a) of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. In approving the Plan of Liquidation and Dissolution, our Board of Directors had considered, among other factors, the ability of the Company to obtain no-action relief from the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) to suspend certain of our reporting obligations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the anticipated cost savings if such relief is granted by the SEC. Upon further review, our Board of Directors determined that it would be fair, advisable and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders to postpone seeking stockholder approval of the Plan of Liquidation and Dissolution until a later time to be determined by our Board of Directors.
 
 From time to time, our Board of Directors reviews the Company’s status and prospects in deciding on the timing of dissolution and liquidation of the Company pursuant to the Plan of Liquidation and Dissolution. If our Board of Directors determines to seek stockholder approval of such plan and such plan is approved by our stockholders and implemented by the Company, it is expected that our corporate existence will continue for the purpose of winding up our business and affairs for at least three years. We have forecasted minimal or no royalty or milestone revenues for the foreseeable future. In light of the uncertainty as to whether any of the milestones under the Micromet Marketing Agreement would be achieved, this forecast assumes that we would not receive any milestone or royalty payments under the Micromet Marketing Agreement.
 
ROYALTIES
 
We currently receive royalty revenues from existing licensing arrangements with Merck primarily related to sales of two marketed drug products, namely, PegIntron ® and Sylatron ®. Until 2017, in recent years, royalty revenues from Merck were our primary source of revenues. In 2018, we earned a $7 million milestone payment from Servier in connection with its receiving FDA approval for ASPARLAS, also known as SC Oncaspar. In 2017, we earned $7 million in royalties from Nektar in connection with our entering into the Nektar Second Amendment. Royalty revenues from sales of PegIntron accounted for approximately (2)% and 7% of our total revenues in each of the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, net of the effects of adjustments for Merck’s recoupment of previously overpaid royalties. Our right to receive royalties on U.S. and European sales of PegIntron expired in 2016 and 2018, respectively.
 
Sales of PegIntron have been in decline since 2008. Products that compete with PegIntron have been and potentially will be introduced by other drug manufacturers. In addition, there are multiple oral drug therapies, both available and in development, that have been effective for treatment of hepatitis C that do not require interferon. As a result, we expect sales of PegIntron-related products to continue their declining trend.
 
We have out-licensed our proprietary PEGylation and single-chain antibody, or SCA, technologies on our own and through agreements with Nektar and Micromet AG (“Micromet”). Micromet was acquired by Amgen in 2012. Under our Cross-License and Option Agreement with Nektar, Nektar had the lead role in granting sublicenses for certain of our PEGylation patents and we receive royalties on sales of any approved product for which a sublicense has been granted. Pursuant to the Nektar Second Amendment, we are no longer entitled to any royalties or immunity fees from Nektar under the Nektar License Agreement.

PATENTS AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS 
 
We have a portfolio of issued U.S. patents, many of which have foreign counterparts. Of the patents owned or exclusively licensed by us, one relates to PegIntron. The patent related to PegIntron (peginterferon alfa-2b) expired in the U.S. in 2016 and expired outside of the U.S. in 2018 (including any patent term extensions), except for Japan, where the patent was extended until 2021 and Malaysia and Chile, where the patent expires in 2020 and 2024, respectively. Although we believe that our patents provide certain protection from competition, we cannot assure you that such patents will be of substantial protection or commercial benefit to us, will afford us adequate protection from competing products, or will not be challenged or declared invalid. In addition, we cannot assure you that additional U.S. patents or foreign patent equivalents will be issued to us.
 
Patents for individual products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained. Many of our patents have expired or are nearing the end of their patent protection period. The actual protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from country to country, depends upon the type of patent, the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in the country.
 
GOVERNMENT REGULATION 
 
Although we are no longer engaged in clinical activities, our patent assignees are subject to various government regulatory processes. The FDA and comparable regulatory agencies in state and local jurisdictions and in foreign countries impose substantial requirements on the clinical development, manufacture, and marketing of pharmaceutical products. These agencies and other federal, state, local and foreign entities regulate research and development activities and the inspection, testing, manufacture, quality assurance, safety, effectiveness, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, record-keeping, approval, and promotion of products. Drug products require regulatory approval before commercialization. In particular, therapeutic products for human use are subject to rigorous preclinical and clinical testing and other requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and the Public Health Service Act, implemented by the FDA, as well as similar statutory and regulatory requirements of foreign countries. Obtaining these marketing approvals and subsequently complying with ongoing statutory and regulatory requirements is costly and time consuming. Any failure by our collaborators, licensors or licensees to obtain, or any delay in obtaining, regulatory approval or in complying with post-approval requirements, could adversely affect our ability to receive product or royalty revenues.
 
The approval process can take a number of years, if approval is obtained at all, and often requires substantial financial resources, including license application fees. The results of preclinical studies and initial clinical trials are not necessarily predictive of the results from large-scale clinical trials, and clinical trials may be subject to additional costs, delays or modifications due to a number of factors, including the difficulty in obtaining enough patients, clinical investigators, drug supply, or financial support.
 
 Any products manufactured or distributed by our licensees pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to extensive continuing regulation by the FDA, including record-keeping requirements and a requirement to report adverse experiences with the product. In addition to continued compliance with standard regulatory requirements, the FDA also may require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the safety and efficacy of the marketed drug product. Product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory requirements is not maintained or if problems concerning safety or efficacy of the product are discovered following approval.
 
Even after FDA approval has been obtained, and often as a condition to expedited approval, further studies, including post-marketing studies, are typically required by the FDA. Results of post-marketing studies may limit or expand the further marketing of the products. If the developer of a product proposes any modifications to the product, including changes in indication, manufacturing or testing processes, manufacturing facility or labeling, an NDA or BLA supplement may be required to be submitted to and approved by the FDA.

We cannot predict the extent of government regulation that might result from current or future legislation or administrative action. Any proposed or actual changes could cause our collaborators to limit or eliminate spending on development projects and may otherwise impact us. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of adverse governmental regulation that might result from current or future legislative or administrative action, either in the U.S. or abroad. Additionally, in both domestic and foreign markets, sales of our proposed products will depend, in part, upon the availability of reimbursement from third-party payors, such as government health administration authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. Significant uncertainty often exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved health care products. In addition, third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services.
 
With respect to patented products, delays imposed by the government approval process may materially reduce the period during which we will have the exclusive right to exploit them.
