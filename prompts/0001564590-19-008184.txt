Item 1. Business.
OVERVIEW
 We are a biotechnology company focused on novel oncology (cancer) and hematology (blood disease) therapeutics to meaningfully improve patients’ lives. Our core technology is the ADAPTIR™ (modular protein technology) platform. We currently have one revenue-generating product in the area of hematology, as well as various investigational stage product candidates in immuno-oncology and autoimmune and inflammatory diseases.
 In August 2015, Emergent BioSolutions Inc., or Emergent, announced a plan to separate into two independent publicly traded companies, one a biotechnology company and the other a global specialty life sciences company. To accomplish this separation, Emergent created a new company, Aptevo Therapeutics Inc., or Aptevo, to be the parent company for the development-based biotechnology business focused on novel oncology, hematology, and autoimmune and inflammatory therapeutics. We were incorporated in Delaware in February 2016 as a wholly owned subsidiary of Emergent. To effect the separation, Emergent made a pro rata distribution of Aptevo’s common stock to Emergent’s stockholders on August 1, 2016.
 
We have numerous investigational stage product candidates based on our ADAPTIR platform. The ADAPTIR platform technology can produce monospecific and multispecific immunotherapeutic proteins that specifically bind to one or more targets, for example, bispecific therapeutic molecules, which may have structural and functional advantages over monoclonal antibodies. The structural differences of ADAPTIR molecules over monoclonal antibodies allow for the development of ADAPTIR immunotherapeutics that engage immune effector cells and disease targets in a novel manner designed to produce unique signaling responses that may kill tumors or modulate the immune system to kill tumors. ADAPTIR redirected T-cell cytotoxicity (RTCC) molecules have shown more potent tumor killing in in vitro studies compared to heterodimer formats targeting the same tumor antigen. In addition, in in vitro studies, ADAPTIR bispecific candidates have generated lower levels of cytokines when tumor antigen presented compared to other formats targeting the same tumor antigen, and have induced comparable T-cell cytotoxicity.
 
We have one marketed product, IXINITY coagulation factor IX (recombinant), indicated in adults and children 12 years of age and older with Hemophilia B for control and prevention of bleeding episodes, and management of bleeding during operations.

STRATEGY
 We seek to grow our business by, among other things: 
 Advancing our ADAPTIR platform, initially focusing on immunotherapy and the development of novel bispecific and multi-specific proteins for the treatment of cancer and autoimmune disease. We focus on product development using our ADAPTIR platform. We plan to generate additional bispecific protein immunotherapies for early development, potentially with other collaborative partners, to further validate the potential of the ADAPTIR platform. We intend to favor the development of bispecific candidates that have the potential to demonstrate proof of concept early in development and are differentiated in key oncology indications. We expect to continue to expand the ADAPTIR product pipeline to address areas of unmet medical need. Bispecifics and multispecific ADAPTIR proteins will be generated to target tumors using the immune system or direct cytokine delivery to selective cell populations or modulate immune cells to treat diseases. We believe these product candidates may have utility in oncology, autoimmune disease and other therapeutic areas. 
 Continuing to develop new products. We are committed to new product development. We have expertise in molecular biology, antibody engineering and the development of protein therapeutics, including cell line development, protein purification, process development and analytical characterization. We believe that these core areas of expertise enable the development of therapeutics based on the ADAPTIR platform technology from design, pre-clinical testing, and clinical development to preparation of a biologics license application, or BLA. 
 Establishing collaborative partnerships to broaden our pipeline and provide funding for research and development. We intend to continue to develop and grow our product portfolio through internal research and development as well as through collaborations with other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, academia and non-governmental organizations. 
 
Supporting the future growth of our pipeline by maximizing the financial contribution of IXINITY. We intend to continue to maximize the financial contribution of IXINITY for the purpose of funding our research and development efforts. This may require further investments. 
 PLATFORM TECHNOLOGY AND PRODUCT CANDIDATES 
 Platform Technology 
 ADAPTIR Platform. The platform can be used to produce monospecific, bispecific and multispecific immunotherapeutic proteins that specifically bind to one or more targets and receptors found on immune cells to mediate tumor killing and improve disease response by modulating the immune cells directly or immune environment. We believe we are well positioned for the development of bispecific therapeutics, which are antibody-based molecules that are able to bind two targets of therapeutic interest, utilizing our innovative ADAPTIR (modular protein technology) platform. This allows us to take a novel approach to cancer immunotherapy. 
 Structurally, ADAPTIR molecules are similar to antibodies; they can exhibit the same biological functions of an antibody, but can be easily modified to either eliminate or incorporate new activities, all the while maintaining a similar size, stability and manufacturing advantages of a monoclonal antibody. The ADAPTIR molecules are single-chain polypeptides comprising customized elements including a protein domain that binds to one or more target binding domains to a hinged domain and a set of antibody constant domains known as the fragment crystallizable region, or Fc region of a human antibody. The antibody Fc region can elicit an immune response by binding to the corresponding Fc receptors found on various immune cells such as natural killer, or NK, cells, and other cells, including cancer cells to mediate antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity resulting in killing of the cancer cell. With the ADAPTIR platform, the Fc region can be modified to enhance or eliminate these functions. Incorporation of the Fc region into the ADAPTIR platform also provides for an extended serum half-life by engaging recycling via the neonatal Fc receptor or FcRn. A long serum half-life could potentially reduce dosing frequency and dose quantity.

Multispecific ADAPTIR molecules are similar in structure to monospecific ADAPTIR molecules with the exception that they have two or more customized target binding domains on the ends of the Fc region. Multiple targeting domains allow ADAPTIR molecules to bind to two or more targets. We have created several bispecific molecules that are able to redirect T-cell cytotoxicity (RTCC). T-cells are white blood cells that fight infections and tumor cells. RTCC ADAPTIR molecules are designed to cause T-cells to specifically kill a tumor by binding to a common component (CD3) found on the T-cell and then binding to a specific tumor antigen on a specific tumor, thereby activating the T-cell to kill the tumor.
 

We believe the ADAPTIR platform is a promising platform technology within the rapidly growing field of immuno-oncology therapeutics. The structural differences between ADAPTIR molecules and monoclonal antibodies, allow for the development of new immunotherapeutics that engage disease targets in a novel manner and produce a unique signaling response. By customizing the binding domains of our ADAPTIR molecules, we are able to select for desired potency, half-life, toxicity and stability/manufacturability. We have the potential to develop products with mechanisms of action including but not limited to RTCC and targeted cytokine delivery. We are able to expand our ADAPTIR platform to generate bispecifics that target tumor antigens in combination with costimulatory molecules including TNF-Receptor family members. We believe the ADAPTIR platform may prove to have advantages over other immunotherapeutics and other bispecific T-cell engaging technologies. In pre-clinical studies, we have gathered data indicating that APVO436, a RTCC ADAPTIR bispecific that binds CD123, may have high potency and activity at low doses, a long half-life, and reduced cytokine release. This molecule is able to be produced using standard manufacturing practices. Further clinical and pre-clinical studies may not confirm or establish the anticipated benefits of this platform.
 Our ADAPTIR platform intellectual property (IP) portfolio consists of IP that we solely own and control with the exception of non-exclusive licenses to Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines and related expression systems.  See section entitled “Intellectual Property” for additional information about the ownership rights to ADAPTIR platform intellectual property. We have a non-exclusive research license with Lonza Sales AG, or Lonza, for certain CHO cell lines, which are cells derived from the ovary of a Chinese hamster. The Lonza CHO cell line is often used in the production of therapeutic proteins, in protein expression and the GS (glutamine synthetase) Gene Expression SystemTM, or GS System (GS Gene Expression System is a registered trademark of Lonza).

Product Portfolio 
 
Product Candidates 
 Our pipeline includes investigational stage product candidates in immuno-oncology, autoimmune, and inflammatory diseases.
 
APVO436. We have developed APVO436, an ADAPTIR bispecific immunotherapeutic protein targeting CD123, a cell surface receptor highly expressed on several hematological malignancies and CD3, a component of the T-cell receptor. APVO436 utilizes RTCC to initiate killing of CD123 expressing tumor cells. Pre-clinical data on this anti-CD123 ADAPTIR bispecific was presented at the 2017 annual meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research and 2017 American Society of Hematology (ASH). These data demonstrate in vitro RTCC activity and in vivo tumor cell killing in animal models of disease and demonstrate that APVO436 can kill acute myeloid leukemia (AML) blasts using patient derived peripheral blood cells in the presence of APVO436. Potential indications for APV0436 include AML, myelodysplastic syndrome, or MDS, acute lymphocytic leukemia, or ALL, and hairy cell leukemia, for each of which we believe there is a strong unmet need for safe and effective therapies. APVO436 is expressed from a single gene construct from CHO production cell line and manufactured using traditional antibody-like processes.  APVO436 has a half-life of up to 12.5 days in rodents and 3.5 days in non-human primates. In a cytokine release assay in vitro, administration of APVO436 resulted in lower levels of cytokine release as compared to an anti-CD123 x anti-CD3 in the dual-affinity retargeting, or D.A.R.T. format.  In an in vitro assay using AML patient samples, APVO436 induced rapid activation and proliferation of endogenous T cells and showed a progressive reduction of CD123+ cells over the 96-hour culture period.  In a murine therapeutic delivery model, treatment with APVO436 resulted in a rapid reduction in skeletal tumor burden in mice which were previously established with MOLM-13 tumors.    
 
We commenced a Phase 1/1b clinical trial in the United States in December 2018 in patients with AML and MDS.  The objective of the trial is to evaluate safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of APVO436 in patients.  Phase 1 will consist of up to 60 patients and is designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose and recommended dose for Phase 1b.  The primary endpoint for Phase 1 will be the incidence of dose-limiting toxicities occurring during Cycle 1 of each dose cohort.  Phase 1b will consist of up to 48 patients and is designed to assess clinical activity at the recommended dose.  The primary endpoint for Phase 1b is to assess clinical activity, including overall response rate.  In both Phase 1 and Phase 1b, patients will receive APVO436 by intravenous dosing once weekly for six 28-day cycles.  We anticipate that we will have anti-drug antibody (ADA) data in the third quarter of 2019, and preliminary Phase 1 safety data in the fourth quarter of 2019.  
 
APVO210. APVO210 is an anti-inflammatory molecule engineered using our ADAPTIR platform technology currently in pre-clinical development. It is under development for the treatment of psoriasis and inflammatory bowel disease, including ulcerative colitis and other autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. APVO210 is a targeted cytokine therapeutic, specifically, it is designed to deliver a modified form of the anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10, to antigen presenting cells, or APCs, via targeting CD86. APCs are a therapeutic target of interest for an anti-inflammatory therapeutic such as APVO210 because, as described further below, APCs play a critical role in the immune response. APVO210 is unique in that it can deliver a modified form of IL-10 to APC without stimulation of resting and activated lymphocytes.  Additionally, APVO210 has the potential to modulate long-term antigen specific immune responses through generation of antigen-specific tolerogenic dendritic cells.
 Structurally, APVO210 contains monomeric IL-10, a modified form of IL-10, coupled to a humanized binding domain specific for CD86, linked by an antibody Fc region. Humanized refers to chemically altering animal proteins to resemble natural human amino acid sequences (or the order in which they bond). By targeting monomeric IL-10 to desired cell populations, APVO210 is designed to increase the exposure of target cells (APCs) to the drug and to reduce toxicity and increase efficacy (i.e., therapeutic window) as compared to IL-10 therapies.  The mechanism of action results in suppression of T-cell responses through inhibition of antigen presentation. Antigen presenting cells play a central role in the generation and regulation of immune response and inflammation; therefore, inhibiting their function represents a therapeutic opportunity to suppress immunopathological processes in autoimmune and inflammatory disease. APVO210 pre-clinical data demonstrate potent in vitro and in vivo antagonism of T-cell proliferation in human mixed lymphocyte reactions and in a humanized graft-versus-host disease model. The APVO210 ADAPTIR molecule has potential to suppress immune responses and serve in anti-inflammation 
 4


applications that occurs, for instance, in inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, graft versus host disease (GVHD) and in the treatment of transplant rejection. As a molecule designed using our ADAPTIR platform technology, the half-life of APVO210 is extended as compared to wildtype IL-10 as demonstrated in pre-clinical rodent studies and non-human primate studies. In non-human primate studies, APVO210 exhibited a half-life of 30 to 40 hours which is significantly longer than that of IL-10 which is in single-digit hours.  Also, manufacturing benefits are realized because the platform enables use of a manufacturing process that is typically used for making antibodies.   
 
We have received authorization to initiate dosing in Australia and intend to initiate a Phase 1 clinical trial in March 2019. The Phase 1 clinical trial will evaluate safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of APVO210 in healthy volunteers. The trial will consist of two stages.  Stage 1 will consist of up to 64 healthy volunteers receiving a single ascending dose. Stage 2 will consist of up to 40 healthy volunteers receiving multiple ascending doses. For both stages of the Phase 1 clinical trial, healthy volunteers will receive APVO210 or placebo administered by intravenous infusion. We anticipate that initial results of APVO210 single dose cohorts will be available in the third quarter of 2019, and that preliminary Phase 1 data will be available in the fourth quarter of 2019 for cohorts enrolled by the beginning of fourth quarter of 2019.
 
ALG.APV-527. ALG.APV-527 is a bispecific antibody candidate, partnered with Alligator Bioscience AB, or Alligator, featuring a novel mechanism of action designed to simultaneously target 4-1BB (CD137) and 5T4, a tumor antigen widely overexpressed in a number of different types of cancer. 4-1BB, a costimulatory receptor on T cells, is known to enhance the immune response to cancer through activation of tumor-specific T cells and is believed to be a promising target for new immunotherapeutic approaches. ALG.APV-527 is designed to target T cells previously activated by tumor antigen, exert tumor-localized T cell activation upon 5T4 binding, and to not stimulate resting or naïve T cells.  ALG.APV-527 has the potential advantage of improved efficacy and safety as the result of being a targeted therapy.  In in vivo studies, ALG-APV-527 localized specifically to 5T4 positive tumors but not 5T4 negative tumors.  Additionally, in in vitro studies, ALG-APVO-527 bound to human and cynomologous 5T4 and 4-1BB expressing cells and activated T cells. In vitro studies induced 4-1BB activation in a reporter-based activity assay only when 5T4 targets were present. In in vitro assays, ALG.APV-527 induced CD8+ T cell proliferation and IFN-γ production in the presence of 5T4 antigen, and induced NK cell activation only in the presence of 5T4 targets.  In in vivo studies, ALG-APV-527 localized to 5T4-expressing tumors and reduced colon carcinoma tumor growth in an HCT116 tumor model. ALG.APV-527 could potentially have utility in the treatment of a broad spectrum of cancers over-expressing the tumor antigen, including breast, cervical, non-small-cell-lung, prostate, pancreatic, renal, gastric, colorectal, ovarian, and bladder cancers.  ALG.APV-527 has the potential advantage of having utility in multiple solid tumor cancers that express the 5T4 antigen.  Aptevo and Alligator intend to file a clinical trial authorization, or CTA, in the fourth quarter of 2019.  
 
ROR1 Bispecific. ROR1 Bispecific is a proof-of-concept bispecific candidate in pre-clinical development featuring an immunotherapeutic protein targeting ROR1, an antigen found on several solid tumors and hematologic, or blood-related malignancies and CD3, a component of the T-cell receptor complex expressed on all T-cells.  Initial pre-clinical data demonstrate redirected T cell killing of tumors expressing ROR1 in vitro and in vivo in animal models.
 ADAPTIR Therapeutic Candidates. We have multiple additional candidates that are focused on immuno-oncology and based on the ADAPTIR platform technology that are in different stages of pre-clinical development.
 In 2018, we elected to discontinue the APVO414 development program, a first generation bispecific ADAPTIR candidate, including the Phase 1 clinical program, targeting prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA), an antigen that is expressed on the surface of prostate cancer cells, and CD3. APVO414 redirected T cells to specifically kill PSMA-expressing tumors and was being developed for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), which is advanced prostate cancer that has spread to other organs and no longer responds to hormone blocking therapies. To date, no dose limiting toxicities have been reported with continuous infusion in the Phase 1 mCRPC clinical trial. In that study, continuous infusion delayed the development of anti-drug antibodies (ADA) compared to weekly IV infusions, but with longer dosing, ADA developed that cleared the drug from the blood in some patients. While we are no longer enrolling patients into the Phase 1 APVO414 clinical trial, we will continue to monitor the patients remaining on the therapy. 
 5


In 2018, we also elected to discontinue the otlertuzumab development program, a first generation monospecific ADAPTIR candidate including the Phase 2 clinical program for the treatment of peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL).  A previous Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating otlertuzumab for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) showed that otlertuzumab in combination with bendamustine, compared to bendamustine alone, demonstrated a significant increase in median progression free survival for the combination, from approximately 10 to 16 months. One patient showed a complete response and there was some evidence of tumor regression (43% primary tumor) in a second patient in the PTCL pilot Phase 2 clinical trial. There has been no evidence of an early response in the remaining patients. Preliminary immunohistochemistry analysis has revealed that the number of patients with tumors expressing CD37, and the degree of CD37 expression within the tumors, is much lower than that found on panels of PTCL patient samples that were tested prior to the initiation of the pilot study. Due to these reasons, we elected to close the study to further enrollment. However, we will continue to monitor the patients remaining on therapy. 
 Potential adverse events related to our product candidates 
 Experimental drugs may have a variety of adverse events related to their target, mechanism of action or off target toxicities. Clinical trials are conducted to define the efficacy and safety of a new molecule and this data is reviewed by the FDA prior to FDA approval. The majority of the drugs that we are developing are intended for the treatment of cancer. Because cancer is a serious and life threatening disease, these patients experience a number of serious adverse events as part of their disease. The risk-benefit ratio for new treatments of cancer is different from other less serious diseases. For example, for the treatment of hypertension, it is not acceptable for a drug to lower the number of white blood cells that fight infections. However, chemotherapy for the treatment of cancer frequently lowers the number of white blood cells and infections do occur, which physicians manage in the course of a patient’s cancer treatment. In order to distinguish whether a new drug causes adverse events, a controlled trial is frequently conducted comparing a new drug to another therapy. 
 Competition 
 Our product candidates face significant competition. Any product candidate that we successfully develop and commercialize is likely to compete with currently marketed products, as well as other novel product candidates that are in development for the same indications. Specifically, the competition with respect to our clinical product candidates includes the following: 

• | APVO436. If approved for AML, we anticipate that APVO436 would compete with other agents targeting CD123 that are in development if they are also approved. Bispecifics in development targeting CD123 include: MGD006 (Macrogenics), JNJ-63709178 (Janssen) and XmAb14045 (Xencor), and Sanofi. There are at least two CAR-T therapies in development: CART123 (University of Penn.) and CARTCD123 (NCI/City of Hope). Other competitive products targeting CD123 are: SL-401 (antibody immunotoxin, Stemline), KHK2833 (monoclonal antibody, Kyowa Hakko Kirin Pharma), and CSL362 (monoclonal antibody, CSL/Janssen).
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | APVO210. If approved, we anticipate that APVO210 would compete with products indicated for inflammatory bowel diseases such as ulcerative colitis, including: HUMIRA® (AbbVie Inc.), Remicade® (Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. of Johnson and Johnson) and Entyvio® (Takeda Pharmaceuticals U.S.A., Inc., a subsidiary of Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited). Depending on what APVO210 is approved for, we anticipate that it could also compete with products indicated for moderate to severe Crohn’s Disease, including: Stelara (Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. of Johnson and Johnson) and Xeljanz (Pfizer Inc.). If approved, APVO210 would compete against a number of other drugs for additional autoimmune diseases. For example, in psoriasis alone there are four anti-TNF inhibitors and four anti-interleukins approved by the FDA.

COLLABORATIONS AND LICENSES 
 Collaboration with Alligator Bioscience AB
 On July 20, 2017, our wholly owned subsidiary Aptevo Research and Development LLC or Aptevo R&D, entered into a collaboration and option agreement or the Collaboration Agreement with Alligator Bioscience AB, (Alligator), pursuant to which Aptevo R&D and Alligator are collaborating to develop ALG.APV-527, a lead bispecific antibody candidate simultaneously targeting 4-1BB (CD137), a member of the TNFR superfamily of a co-stimulatory receptor found on activated T-cells, and 5T4 a tumor antigen widely overexpressed in a number of different types of cancer. This product candidate is built on our novel ADAPTIR platform. Under this Collaboration Agreement, Alligator also granted to Aptevo R&D a time-limited option to enter into a second agreement with Alligator for the joint development of a separate bispecific antibody.
 In accordance with the terms of this Collaboration Agreement, the parties intend to develop the lead bispecific antibody candidate targeting 4-1BB (CD137) through the completion of Phase 2 clinical trials in accordance with an agreed upon development plan and budget. Subject to certain exceptions for Aptevo R&D’s manufacturing and platform technologies, the parties will jointly own intellectual property generated in the performance of the development activities under the Collaboration Agreement.
 Following the completion of the anticipated development activities under the Collaboration Agreement, the parties intend to seek a third-party commercialization partner for this product candidate, or, in certain circumstances, may elect to enter into a second agreement granting rights to either Aptevo R&D or Alligator to allow such party to continue the development and commercialization of this product. Under the terms of the Collaboration Agreement, the parties intend to share revenue received from a third-party commercialization partner equally, or, if the development costs are not equally shared under the Collaboration Agreement, in proportion to the development costs borne by each party. 
 The Collaboration Agreement also contains several points in development at which either party may elect to “opt-out” (i.e., terminate without cause) and, following a termination notice period, cease paying development costs for this product candidate, which would be borne fully by the continuing party. Following an opt-out by a party, the continuing party will be granted exclusive rights to continue the development and commercialization of this product candidate, subject to a requirement to pay a percentage of revenue received from any future commercialization partner for this product, or, if the continuing party elects to self-commercialize, tiered royalties on the net sales of this product by the continuing party ranging from the low to mid-single digits, based on the point in development at which the opt-out occurs. The parties have also agreed on certain technical criteria or “stage gates” related to the development of this product that, if not met, will cause an automatic termination and wind-down of the Collaboration Agreement and the activities thereunder, provided that the parties do not agree to continue.
 The Collaboration Agreement contains industry standard termination rights, including for material breach following a specified cure period, and in the case of a party’s insolvency.
 Collaboration with MorphoSys AG
 In August 2014, we entered into a collaboration agreement with MorphoSys AG (MorphoSys Agreement) for the joint development of MOR209/ES414, a targeted immunotherapeutics protein, which activates host T-cell immunity specifically against cancer cells expressing prostate specific membrane antigen, an antigen commonly overexpressed on prostate cancer cells. Effective August 31, 2017, MorphoSys terminated the MorphoSys Agreement. As a result of the termination, we have no ongoing obligation related to this agreement and therefore recognized the total remaining deferred revenue balance of $3.7 million as collaborations revenue in the third quarter of 2017.

MARKETED PRODUCT 
 
IXINITY (coagulation factor IX (recombinant)). IXINITY is a third-generation recombinant human coagulation factor IX approved by the FDA in April 2015 in the United States for the control and prevention of bleeding episodes and for perioperative management in adults and children 12 years of age or older with hemophilia B. Hemophilia B, also known as Christmas disease, is a rare, inherited bleeding disorder. The blood of hemophilia B patients has an impaired clotting ability, which results from substantially reduced or missing factor IX activity. Patients with hemophilia B commonly experience joint bleeding with pain and swelling, which can result in irreversible joint damage. They may also experience more serious or life-threatening hemorrhages. People with hemophilia B require factor IX injections to restore normal blood coagulation temporarily. Many patients use regular, prophylactic treatment to try to prevent bleeding episodes, while others use on-demand treatment to control bleeding episodes after they occur. Treatment selection and approach is individualized based on factors including the patient’s condition and age, factor level severity, bleeding pattern, activity level and individual pharmacokinetic parameters.
 
In 2019, we intend to introduce a new 3,000 IU assay size.  We anticipate that this new assay will be available mid-2019.  The 3,000 IU assay size will provide enhanced convenience for patients who use IXINITY.  The 3,000 IU assay size is designed to allow some patients to use fewer vials when infusing.  We believe that the 3,000 IU assay size will also be a more attractive option for some patients on IXINITY when traveling.
 
We anticipate commencing a Phase 4 post-marketing study in the third quarter of 2019 that has the potential to support a pediatric label expansion.  We performed a pilot study in patients under 12 years of age that showed that IXINITY was well tolerated.  The pilot study also showed comparable results to that of the overall patient population studied in the Phase 3 pivotal clinical trial of IXINITY.  
 
We are exploring distribution and partnership opportunities for IXINITY outside of the U.S.  We believe that we may be able to leverage existing relationships from the hyperimmune business sold in September 2017 to grow the IXINITY market outside of the United States.
 
Manufacturing
 We rely primarily on AGC Biologics, formally known as CMC Biologics, Inc. (AGC) for drug substance manufacture of IXINITY, on Patheon UK Limited, or Patheon, for fill-finish services of IXINITY and on Rovi Contract Manufacturing, S.L. or Rovi for supply of the syringe pre-filled with water for injection packaged with IXINITY. 
Sources and Availability of Raw Materials 
 Agreement with AGC Biologics. We rely on AGC, for the manufacture of the substance that becomes the active ingredient (the bulk drug substance) in the production of our IXINITY product. On June 17, 2017, we entered into a non-exclusive Commercial Supply (Manufacturing Services) Agreement with AGC, pursuant to which, subject to specified exceptions, we are obligated to purchase at least four batches and AGC is obligated to maintain a maximum capacity for ten batches of IXINITY bulk drug substance per full year. The agreement has a five-year term renewable with twenty-four months’ prior notice before the expiry of the term for successive two-year terms. AGC is obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to perform services in accordance with our forecast and projected delivery dates. In the event there is a supply failure as defined under the agreement, the agreement becomes non-exclusive with respect to 50% of our forecasted demand (or up to the unsupplied quantities until supply reinstatement). 
 8


The agreement provides for fees for services. Each party may terminate the agreement if the other party fails to pay any amount properly due and payable with ten business days of notice demanding payment after the expiration of the original payment term or if the other party materially breaches the agreement and fails to remedy any such breach capable of remedy during a twenty business day notice period. Each party may terminate the agreement if the other party experiences certain bankruptcy events. This agreement may be terminated by either party in the event of a material breach by the other party; however, termination shall not affect the accrued rights of either party. We may also terminate our obligations under the agreement with a specified amount of prior notice, if AGC has any material permit or regulatory license permanently revoked preventing the performance of services by AGC, if AGC is subject to certain competitor change of control events, or where there is a supply failure prior to a supply reinstatement where AGC does not reinstate supply within twelve months of the supply failure. 
 Agreement with Patheon. Patheon, through an affiliate, is currently the sole source third-party manufacturer that performs the services of filling the bulk drug substance into vials for our IXINITY product. We have a non-exclusive Manufacturing Services Agreement with Patheon pursuant to which we are obligated to order, and Patheon agrees to perform, a specified amount of such services on an annual basis. Under the agreement, Patheon also agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to perform services in excess of such minimum purchase commitments subject to its available capacity. The agreement had an initial three-year term that expired on May 26, 2018, and pursuant to its terms, automatically renewed for an additional two-year term that expires on May 26, 2020. The agreement will continue to automatically renew for successive terms of two years each, unless either party gives the other party at least eighteen months’ notice. We may terminate the agreement on a specified amount of notice if a regulatory authority prevents us from importing, exporting, purchasing or selling the product or if we no longer order services for a product due to the product’s discontinuance in the market; however, we must still perform any surviving obligations as specified in the agreement. Patheon may terminate the agreement upon six months’ notice if we assign our rights under the agreement to an assignee that, in Patheon’s opinion acting reasonably, is not a credit-worthy substitute, a Patheon competitor, or an entity with whom Patheon has had prior unsatisfactory business relations. Each party may terminate the agreement if the other party breaches the agreement and the breach is not cured within a specified period of time, if the other party experiences certain bankruptcy events, or upon a period of notice if the parties do not agree upon certain pricing adjustments. Except in respect of liability for certain third party claims, breach of confidentiality obligations, or replacement of defective product, Patheon’s liability is limited under the agreement to 10% of the revenues for such year to Patheon under the agreement. Patheon’s liability in respect of replacement of defective product is limited to the amount paid by us to Patheon for such product. Except in respect of a breach of confidentiality obligations, neither party is liable to the other under the agreement for any loss of profits or other damages of an indirect or consequential nature. 
 Agreement with Rovi. Rovi is currently the sole source third-party manufacturer that supplies the syringe pre-filled with water for injection, that is packaged with and required for reconstitution of our IXINITY product. We have a non-exclusive supply agreement with Rovi pursuant to which Rovi is obligated to use its best efforts to supply the quantity of syringes ordered by us. The agreement has a five-year term expiring on April 28, 2019, and will automatically renew for successive five-year terms, unless Rovi provides us with written notice of its intent not to renew at least twenty-four months prior to the expiration of the term or any renewal term. We may terminate the agreement for any reason on at least twelve months’ prior notice. Each party may terminate the agreement if the other party breaches the agreement and the breach is not cured within a specified period of time. 
 License with the University of North Carolina to IXINITY intellectual property rights 
 In connection with our separation from Emergent, we assumed an exclusive license from the University of North Carolina, or UNC, to make, have made, use, offer for sale, sell and import factor IX and factor VII(a) therapeutics, including IXINITY, under certain UNC’s patents. We are required to pay a low single digit royalty obligation to UNC under the license. The license agreement expires when the last of the licensed patents expire, on a country-by-country basis. Most of the licensed patents expire in or around September 2024. A licensed United States patent received patent term extension and will now expire in or around November 2028. UNC may terminate the license if a material breach is not cured forty-five days after notice, we become bankrupt or insolvent, or we do not pay a yearly minimum earned royalty (in the mid-five digits). We can terminate the license with sixty days’ notice to UNC.

Trademark License Agreement with Emergent
We entered into a trademark license agreement with Emergent pursuant to which Emergent granted us a non-exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide, non-sublicensable license under certain trademarks of Emergent to distribute the physical inventory of packaging and marketing materials assigned to us as part of the distribution, solely to sell, offer to sell and otherwise commercialize the commercial products until such inventory of packaging and marketing materials is depleted or, if earlier, the third anniversary of the distribution. We may terminate our rights under the agreement at any time by providing written notice to Emergent. Emergent may terminate the agreement if we breach the agreement and the breach is not cured within a specified period of time or is uncurable. 
Distribution 
 Our IXINITY product is sold in the United States by our commercial sales force and distributed to end-users through major U.S. distributors and wholesalers, and other specialty distributors. All third-party logistics (including, for instance, warehousing, inventory management, and shipping) of final drug product are provided by a third-party logistics company.
Marketing & Sales 
 We have biotechnology commercial operations and medical affairs teams with experience in sales, marketing, distribution, reimbursement and medical support. 
 The commercial operations team includes a U.S.-based field sales force. This hemophilia sales team focuses its selling efforts primarily on hemophilia treatment centers and hematology clinics. Orders are filled upon receipt, and we generally have no orders on backlog. Reimbursement support, patient assistance/compassionate use and non-medical customer inquiries are handled by customer service personnel within our commercial operations team. 
 Our medical affairs team includes field-based medical science liaisons, who respond to customer requests for information, establish and maintain company relationships with researchers and clinicians, train our product specialists and sales personnel and interface with clinical trial investigators. Our medical affairs team also supports customers by providing medical information, drug safety and pharmacovigilance services. 
 Competition

Currently, IXINITY competes with five recombinant factor IX products that are marketed in North America.  Two are standard half-life products:  BeneFIX® (Pfizer Inc.) and RIXUBIS® (Shire US Inc.), and three are enhanced half-life products:  IDELVION® (CSL Behring LLC), ALPROLIX® (Bioverativ Therapeutics Inc.), and Rebinyn® (Novo Nordisk Inc.). 
 Sale of Hyperimmune Business
 On August 31, 2017, we entered into an LLC purchase agreement with Saol International Limited, or Saol, whereby we agreed to sell our Hyperimmune Business, which consisted of the following products: WinRho® SDF for autoimmune platelet disorder and hemolytic disease of the newborn; HepaGam B® for the prevention of Hepatitis B following liver transplantation and for treatment following hepatitis B exposure; and VARIZIG® for treatment following exposure to varicella zoster virus for individuals with compromised immune systems. 
 On September 28, 2017, we announced that we completed the sale of our Hyperimmune Business to Saol for total consideration of up to $74.5 million. At the closing of the acquisition, Saol paid us an upfront payment totaling $65.0 million, including $3.3 million that was deposited in an escrow account for the purposes of satisfying any indemnification claims brought by Saol pursuant to the LLC purchase agreement. This $3.3 million escrow amount was collected in full in December 2018. In addition, we may receive (1) an additional potential milestone payment totaling up to $7.5 million related to the achievement of certain gross profit milestones and (2) up to $2.0 million related to collection of certain accounts receivable after the closing. The up to $7.5 million potential milestone payment, if earned, will be collectable in the fourth quarter of 2020.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY 
 We actively seek intellectual property protection for our products and product candidates. We own or exclusively license the patents and patent applications in our patent portfolio that support IXINITY, the ADAPTIR platform and pipeline products, including APVO210 and APVO436, with the exception of certain cell line rights which we license on a non-exclusive basis. We practice patent life cycle management by filing patent applications to protect new inventions relating to meaningful improvements to our products and related methods. We primarily seek patent protection for inventions that support our products and product candidates, but from time to time, we seek patent protection for inventions that could, for instance, support a potential business opportunity or block a competitor from designing around our existing patents.
 In general, and where possible, we pursue patent protection in countries where we believe there will be a significant market for the corresponding product or product candidate. We generally do not seek patent protection in countries where we have reason to believe we would not be able to enforce patents. For instance, we tend to not file in countries that are frequently listed on the Priority Watch List of the Special 301 Report prepared by the Office of the United States Trade Representative, with the exception that we typically file patent applications in China, Russia and India. We may also decide to take a narrower filing approach for secondary and improvement type inventions as compared to inventions that are more foundational to our products. We do not seek patent protection in countries that are on the United Nations, or U.N., list of Least Developed Countries. 
 The term of protection for various patents associated with and expected to be associated with our marketed product and product candidates is typically twenty years from the filing date but may vary depending on a variety of factors including the date of filing of the patent application or the date of patent issuance and the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained. The protection afforded by a patent varies on a product-by-product basis and country-to-country basis and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory-related extensions, the necessity for terminal disclaimers, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country, and the validity and enforceability of the patents. 
 In some cases, we may decide that the best way to protect our intellectual property is to retain proprietary information as trade secrets and confidential information rather than to apply for patents, which would involve disclosure of proprietary information to the public. When determining whether to protect intellectual property as a trade secret, we consider many factors including, for instance, our ability to maintain the trade secret, the likelihood that a competitor will independently develop the information, our ability to patent protect the intellectual property and the likelihood we would be able to enforce a resulting patent. 
 We are a party to a number of license agreements under which we license patents, patent applications and other intellectual property. These agreements impose various commercial diligence and financial payment obligations on us. We expect to continue to enter into these types of license agreements in the future. 
 ADAPTIR Platform. We protect the ADAPTIR platform technology through a combination of patents and trade secrets. We own all ADAPTIR platform intellectual property, with the exception that we have non-exclusive commercial licenses and a research license with Lonza to certain intellectual property related to Lonza’s CHO cell lines and vectors. Under our Lonza research license, we have an option to take a license to use the GS System to develop and manufacture therapeutic proteins for our commercial purposes. 
 The intellectual property we own that supports our ADAPTIR platform was generated internally at Emergent or at Trubion Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Trubion, prior to its acquisition by Emergent in 2010, or at Aptevo following the separation. One patent family which supports use of unique linkers in the homodimer (a molecule consisting of two identical halves) version of the platform was invented jointly by Trubion and Wyeth Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Wyeth, as part of a collaboration between the two companies. Upon termination of a product license agreement between Wyeth and Trubion, Wyeth assigned the rights it had in that platform patent family to Trubion. These rights have since transferred to us. 
 11


In order to differentiate our platform inventions from antibodies and other antibody-like constructs that have been publicly disclosed, many of our patents and patent applications are directed to unique aspects or components of our platform such as linkers or binding domains. Our ADAPTIR platform can be homodimeric or heterodimeric. Although most of our patent families protect both homodimeric and heterodimeric forms of the platform, we also have a patent family that is focused on the heterodimeric form of the platform. 
 We have filed patent applications for the ADAPTIR platform in the United States and in countries and territories, including Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Egypt, Europe, India, Indonesia, Israel, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Singapore, South Africa, South Korea, United Arab Emirates and Vietnam. We plan to continue to improve our ADAPTIR platform and to file patent applications on those improvements. Our decision as to where to file any new ADAPTIR improvement inventions will be based in part on the significance of the improvement. If patents issue on the pending ADAPTIR patent applications, the patent term for those patents are estimated to expire between June 2027 and September 2036. 
 IXINITY (coagulation factor IX (recombinant)). We license patents and patent applications from UNC, which support the manufacture of factor IX and other Vitamin K Dependent Proteins. In addition to the patent assets licensed from UNC, we own a patent portfolio with claims generally directed to factor IX pharmaceutical compositions, methods of making recombinant factor IX protein, and cell lines producing recombinant factor IX protein. This patent portfolio includes issued patents in Australia, Europe and Japan and pending patent applications in other territories including the United States. If patents issue on our pending patent applications, the patent term for those patents is estimated to expire between December 2026 and October 2030. The estimated patent expirations are subject to change based on patent term adjustments, extensions or terminal disclaimers. 
 APVO436.  We have a pending patent cooperation treaty, or PCT, patent application which supports our APVO436 product candidate.  We plan to file national stage applications when due in March and April 2019.  In addition to the PCT application, we have a pending United States continuation-in-part or CIP, patent application.  
 APVO210. We have patents and pending patent applications supporting our APVO210 product candidate. We have foundational patents and patent applications in countries and territories, including the United States, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Eurasia, Europe, Hong Kong, India, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Singapore, South Africa and South Korea. The foundational patents granted in this patent family are estimated to expire in October 2029 outside of the United States and October 2030 inside the United States. The estimated patent expirations are subject to change based on patent term adjustments, extensions or terminal disclaimers. 
 Trademarks owned by Aptevo Therapeutics Inc. and its subsidiaries. Where possible, we pursue registered trademarks for our marketed products in significant markets. We own trademark registrations and pending applications for the marks: APTEVO THERAPEUTICS, APTEVO BIOTHERAPEUTICS, APTEVO RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, the Aptevo logo, IXINITY, IXINITY with logo, IXPERIENCE, and ADAPTIR in relevant jurisdictions. We own registrations or pending trademark applications for the mark APTEVO per se in Iraq, Nicaragua, Pakistan, and Ukraine. 
 REGULATION
 Regulations in the United States and other countries have a significant impact on our product development, manufacturing and marketing activities.
 Product Development for Therapeutics
 Pre-clinical Testing. Before beginning testing of any compounds with potential therapeutic value in human subjects in the United States, stringent government requirements for pre-clinical data must be satisfied. Pre-clinical testing includes both in vitro, or in an artificial environment outside of a living organism, and in vivo, or within a living organism, laboratory evaluation and characterization of the safety and efficacy of a drug and its formulation. We perform pre-clinical testing on all of our product candidates before we initiate any human trials.
 12


Investigational New Drug Application. Before clinical testing may begin, the results of pre-clinical testing, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and any other available clinical data or literature, must be submitted to the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, as part of an Investigational New Drug Application, or IND. The sponsor must also include an initial protocol detailing the first phase of the proposed clinical investigation, together with information regarding the qualifications of the clinical investigators. The pre-clinical data must provide an adequate basis for evaluating both the safety and the scientific rationale for the initial clinical studies in human volunteers. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA imposes a clinical hold within that 30-day time period.
 Clinical Trials. Clinical trials involve the administration of the drug to healthy human volunteers or to patients with the target disease or disorder under the supervision of a qualified physician (also called an investigator) pursuant to an FDA-reviewed protocol. Human clinical trials typically are conducted in three sequential phases, although the phases may overlap with one another. Clinical trials must be conducted under protocols that detail the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used to monitor safety and the efficacy criteria, if any, to be evaluated. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND.

• | Phase 1 clinical trials test for safety, dose tolerance, absorption, bio-distribution, metabolism, excretion and clinical pharmacology and, if possible, for early evidence regarding efficacy.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2 clinical trials involve a small sample of individuals with the target disease or disorder and seek to assess the efficacy of the drug for specific targeted indications to determine dose response and the optimal dose range and dose regimen and to gather additional information relating to safety and potential adverse effects.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3 clinical trials consist of expanded, large-scale studies of patients with the target disease or disorder to obtain definitive statistical evidence of the efficacy and safety of the proposed product and dosing regimen. The safety and efficacy data generated from Phase 3 clinical trials typically form the basis for FDA approval of the product candidate.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 4 clinical trials, if conducted, are conducted after a product has been approved. These trials can be conducted for a number of purposes, including to collect long-term safety information or to collect additional data about a specific population. As part of a product approval, the FDA may require that certain Phase 4 studies, which are called post-marketing commitment studies, be conducted post-approval.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Good Clinical Practice. All of the phases of clinical studies must be conducted in conformance with the FDA’s bioresearch monitoring regulations and Good Clinical Practices, or GCP, which are ethical and scientific quality standards for conducting, recording and reporting clinical trials to assure that the data and reported results are credible and accurate and that the rights, safety and well-being of trial participants are protected. Additionally, an Institutional Review Board at each site participating in a trial must obtain ongoing approval for conduct of the trial at that site.
 Marketing Approval—Biologics
 Biologics License Application. All data obtained from a comprehensive development program, including research and product development, manufacturing, pre-clinical and clinical trials, labeling and related information are submitted in a biologics license application, or BLA, to the FDA and in similar regulatory filings with the corresponding agencies in other countries for review and approval. The submission of an application is not a guarantee that the FDA will find the application complete and accept it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file the application and request additional information rather than accept the application for filing, in which case the application must be resubmitted with the supplemental information. The FDA has two months to review an application for its acceptability for filing. Once an application is accepted for filing, the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, establishes a two-tiered review system: Standard Review and Priority Review. When conducting Priority Review, the FDA has a goal to review and act on BLA submissions within six months from the date of the FDA’s acceptance for filing of the application, rather than the ten-month goal under a Standard Review. The FDA gives Priority Review status to product candidates that provide safe and effective therapies where no satisfactory alternative exists or to a product candidate that constitutes a significant improvement compared to marketed products in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease.
 13


In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, or PREA, BLAs and certain supplements must contain data to assess the safety and efficacy of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any drug or biologic for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted.
 In reviewing a BLA, the FDA may grant approval or deny the application through a complete response letter if it determines the application does not provide an adequate basis for approval requesting additional information. Even if such additional information and data are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. The receipt of regulatory approval often takes many years, involving the expenditure of substantial financial resources. The speed with which approval is granted often depends on a number of factors, including the severity of the disease in question, the availability of alternative treatments and the risks and benefits demonstrated in clinical trials. The FDA may also impose conditions upon approval. For example, it may require a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, for a product. This can include various required elements, such as publication of a medication guide, patient package insert, a communication plan to educate health care providers of the drug’s risks and/or restrictions on distribution and use, such as limitations on who may prescribe or dispense the drug. The FDA may also significantly limit the indications approved for a given product and/or require, as a condition of approval, enhanced labeling, special packaging or labeling, post-approval clinical trials, expedited reporting of certain adverse events, pre-approval of promotional materials or restrictions on direct-to-consumer advertising, any of which could negatively impact the commercial success of a drug.
 Fast Track Designation. The FDA may designate a product as a fast track drug if it is intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for this disease or condition. Sponsors granted a fast track designation for a drug are granted more opportunities to interact with the FDA during the approval process and are eligible for FDA review of the application on a rolling basis, before the application has been completed.
 Breakthrough Therapy. Under the provisions of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, the FDA may designate a product as a breakthrough therapy if the product is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other products, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Products designated as breakthrough therapies are also eligible for accelerated approval. The FDA must take certain actions, such as holding timely meetings and providing advice, intended to expedite the development and review of an application for approval of a breakthrough therapy.
 Orphan Drugs. Under the Orphan Drug Act, an applicant can request the FDA to designate a product as an “orphan drug” in the United States if the drug is intended to treat an orphan, or rare, disease or condition. A disease or condition is considered orphan if it affects fewer than 200,000 people in the United States. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. Products designated as orphan drugs are eligible for special grant funding for research and development, FDA assistance with the review of clinical trial protocols, potential tax credits for research, waived filing fees for marketing applications and a seven-year period of market exclusivity after marketing approval. Orphan drug exclusivity (afforded to the first applicant to receive approval for an orphan designated drug) prevents FDA approval of applications by others for the same drug for the designated orphan disease or condition. The FDA may approve a subsequent application from another applicant if the FDA determines that the application is for a different drug or different use, or if the FDA determines that the subsequent product is clinically superior, or that the holder of the initial orphan drug approval cannot assure the availability of sufficient quantities of the drug to meet the public’s need. A grant of an orphan designation is not a guarantee that a product will be approved. Our product candidate otlertuzumab was granted orphan drug designation for the treatment of CLL by the FDA in November 2011 and received orphan medicinal product designation from the European Commission in December 2012 for the treatment of CLL. Orphan designation in Europe qualifies a drug for certain development and commercial incentives, including protocol assistance, access to centralized authorization procedures, reduced fees for regulatory activities, and ten years of market exclusivity after approval.
 14


Post-Approval Requirements. Any biologic for which we receive FDA approval will be subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, record keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP, and restrictions on advertising and promotion. Adverse events that are reported after marketing approval can result in additional limitations being placed on the product’s distribution or use and, potentially, withdrawal or suspension of the product from the market. In addition, the FDA authority to require post-approval clinical trials and/or safety labeling changes if warranted. In certain circumstances, the FDA may impose a REMS after a product has been approved. Facilities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA for compliance with cGMP and other laws. The FDA also closely monitors advertising and promotional materials we may disseminate for our products for compliance with restrictions on off-label promotion and other laws. We may not promote our products for conditions of use that are not included in the approved package inserts for our products. Certain additional restrictions on advertising and promotion exist for products that have boxed warnings in their approved package inserts.
 Pricing, Coverage and Reimbursement
 In the United States and internationally, sales of our products and our ability to generate revenues on such sales are dependent, in significant part, on the availability and level of reimbursement from third-party payors, including state and federal governments and private insurance plans. Insurers have implemented cost-cutting measures and other initiatives to enforce more stringent reimbursement standards and likely will continue to do so in the future. These measures include the establishment of more restrictive formularies and increases in the out-of-pocket obligations of patients for such products. In addition, we are required to provide discounts and pay rebates to state and federal governments and agencies in connection with purchases of our products that are reimbursed by such entities. Various provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act), collectively referred to as the Affordable Care Act, increased the levels of rebates and discounts that we have to provide in connection with sales of such products that are paid for, or reimbursed by, certain state and federal government agencies and programs. It is possible that future legislation in the United States and other jurisdictions could be enacted, which could potentially impact the reimbursement rates for our products and also could further impact the levels of discounts and rebates we are required to pay to state and federal government entities. The most significant governmental reimbursement programs in the United States relevant to our products are described below:
 Medicare Part B. Medicare Part B covers certain drug products provided in a physician’s office or hospital outpatient setting under a payment methodology using “average sales price,” or ASP, information. We are required to provide ASP information to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, on a quarterly basis. Medicare payment rates using an ASP methodology are currently set at ASP plus six percent, although this rate could change in future years. If we fail to timely or accurately submit ASP, we could be subject to civil monetary penalties and other sanctions. 
 Medicaid Rebate Program. For products to be covered by Medicaid, drug manufacturers must enter into a rebate agreement with the Secretary of HHS on behalf of the states and must regularly submit certain pricing information to CMS. The pricing information submitted, including information about the “average manufacturer price,” or AMP, and “best price” for each of our covered drugs, determines the amount of the rebate we must pay. The total rebate also includes an “additional” rebate, which functions as an “inflation penalty.” The Affordable Care Act increased the amount of the basic rebate and, for some “line extensions,” increased the additional rebate. It also requires manufacturers to pay rebates on utilization by enrollees in managed care organizations. If we fail to timely or accurately submit required pricing information, we could be subject to civil, monetary and other penalties. In addition, the Affordable Care Act changed the definition of AMP to address which manufacturer sales are to be considered, which affected the rebate liability for our products. 
 15


340B/PHS Drug Pricing Program. The availability of federal funds to pay for IXINITY under the Medicaid and Medicare Part B programs requires that we extend discounts under the 340B/Public Health Service, or PHS, drug pricing program. The 340B/PHS drug pricing program requires participating manufacturers to charge no more than a statutorily-defined “ceiling” price to a variety of community health clinics and other covered entities that receive health services grants from the PHS, as well as the outpatient departments of hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of Medicaid and Medicare beneficiaries. A product’s ceiling price for a quarter reflects its Medicaid AMP from two quarters earlier less its Medicaid rebate amount from two quarters earlier. Therefore, the above-mentioned revisions to the Medicaid rebate formula and AMP definition enacted by the Affordable Care Act could cause the discount produced by the ceiling price to increase. Under the Affordable Care Act, several additional classes of entities were made eligible for these discounts, increasing the volume of sales for which we must now offer the 340B/PHS discounts.
 Federal Supply Schedule. We make IXINITY available for purchase by authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule, or FSS, administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs, or DVA, pursuant to our FSS contract with the DVA. Under the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992, we are required to offer deeply discounted FSS contract pricing to four federal agencies—the DVA, the Department of Defense, or DoD, the Coast Guard and the PHS (including the Indian Health Service)—for federal funding to be made available for reimbursement of any of our products under the Medicaid program, Medicare Part B and for our products to be eligible to be purchased by those four federal agencies and certain federal grantees. FSS pricing to those four federal agencies must be equal to or less than the “Federal Ceiling Price,” which is, at a minimum, 24% less than the Non-Federal Average Manufacturer Price for the prior fiscal year.
Foreign Regulation
 Currently, we maintain a commercial presence in the United States. In the future, we may further expand our commercial presence to additional foreign countries and territories. In the European Union, or EU, medicinal products are authorized following a process similarly demanding as the process required in the United States. Medicinal products must be authorized in one of two ways, either through the decentralized procedure, which provides for the mutual recognition procedure of national approval decisions by the competent authorities of the EU Member States or through the centralized procedure by the European Commission, which provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all EU member states. The authorization process is essentially the same irrespective of which route is used. We are also subject to many of the same continuing post-approval requirements in the EU as we are in the United States (e.g., good manufacturing practices). We will be subject to varying preapproval, approval and post-approval regulatory requirements similar to those imposed by the FDA in each foreign country in which we conduct regulated activities. 
 Healthcare Fraud and Abuse and Anti-Corruption Laws
 We are subject to various federal and state laws pertaining to health care “fraud and abuse,” including state and federal anti-kickback laws false claims laws, and patent privacy and security laws. Anti-kickback laws make it illegal for a drug manufacturer to knowingly and willfully solicit, offer, receive or pay any remuneration in exchange for, to induce, or in return for, the referral of business that may be reimbursed by a third party payor (including Medicare and Medicaid), including the purchase, prescribing or recommendation of a particular drug. Due to the breadth of the statutory provisions, it is possible that our practices might be challenged under anti-kickback or similar laws. Civil and criminal false claims laws, false statement laws and civil monetary penalty laws prohibit, among other things, anyone from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented for payment, to third-party payors (including Medicare and Medicaid) claims for reimbursed drugs or services that are false or fraudulent, claims for items or services not provided as claimed or claims for medically unnecessary items or services. Our activities relating to the sale and marketing of our products may be subject to scrutiny under these laws. Privacy and security laws, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, create federal criminal and civil liability for executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Additionally, HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health, or HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, impose certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. 
 16


If we violate the healthcare fraud and abuse laws, we could be subject to sanctions, including civil and administrative penalties, criminal, fines, damages, exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, individual imprisonment, integrity obligations, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could materially adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. Similar restrictions are imposed on the promotion and marketing of medicinal products in other countries. Laws (including those governing promotion, marketing and anti-kickback provisions), industry regulations and professional codes of conduct are often strictly enforced. 
 In addition, as part of the Affordable Care Act, the federal government enacted the Physician Payment Sunshine Act. Manufacturers of drugs biologics and devices that are reimbursed by Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program are required to annually report to CMS payments and transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals, and ownership or investment interest held by physicians and their family members. This information is posted on a public website. Failure to timely and accurately submit required information could subject us to civil penalties. Some local, state and foreign governments have similar compliance, marketing, licensure and/or transparency laws. Many of these transparency requirements are new and uncertain and the extent to which the laws will be enforced is not always clear.
 Our operations are also subject to compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, which prohibits corporations and individuals from directly or indirectly paying, offering to pay, or authorizing the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official or employee, or any foreign political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business or to otherwise influence such official, employee, party or candidate in his or her or its official capacity. We also may be implicated under the FCPA by activities taken on our behalf by our partners, collaborative partners, consultants, distributors, contract research organizations, vendors or other agents and representatives. As a public company, the FCPA also requires us to make and keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all of our transactions and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls. Our operations are also subject to compliance with the U.K. Bribery Act of 2010, which applies to activities both in the public and private sector, Canada’s Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act and similar laws in other countries where we do business.
 Healthcare Reform
 A primary trend in the United States healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. There have been a number of federal and state proposals during the last few years regarding the pricing of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical products, limiting coverage and reimbursement for drugs and other medical products, government control and other changes to the healthcare system in the United States. 
 By way of example, the United States and state governments continue to propose and pass legislation designed to reduce the cost of healthcare. In March 2010, the Affordable Care Act, or the ACA, was enacted which, among other things, includes changes to the coverage and payment for products under government health care programs. However, some provisions of the ACA have yet to be fully implemented and certain provisions have been subject to judicial and Congressional challenges, as well as efforts by the Trump Administration to repeal or replace certain aspects of the ACA. For example, since January 2017, President Trump has signed two executive orders and other directives designed to delay, circumvent, or loosen certain requirements mandated by the ACA. Concurrently, Congress has considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the ACA. Additionally, President Trump signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 on December 22, 2017, which includes a provision repealing the individual mandate under the ACA, effective January 1, 2019. 
 17


Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. For example, in August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2012 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and will remain in effect through 2025 unless additional Congressional action is taken. In January 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. Furthermore, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny recently over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products. For example, there have been several recent Congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. 
 Additionally, on December 13, 2016, the 21st Century Cures Act, or Cures Act, was signed into law, which is designed to modernize and personalize healthcare, spur innovation and research, and streamline the discovery and development of new therapies through increased federal funding of particular programs. Among other provisions, the Cures Act reauthorizes the existing priority review voucher program for certain drugs intended to treat rare pediatric diseases until 2020; creates a new priority review voucher program for drug applications determined to be material national security threat medical countermeasure applications; revises the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to streamline review of combination product applications; requires FDA to evaluate the potential use of “real world evidence” to help support approval of new indications for approved drugs; provides a new “limited population” approval pathway for antibiotic and antifungal drugs intended to treat serious or life-threatening infections; and authorizes FDA to designate a drug as a “regenerative advanced therapy,” thereby making it eligible for certain expedited review and approval designations.
