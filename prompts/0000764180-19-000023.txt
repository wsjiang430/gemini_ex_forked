Item 1. Business.
General Development of Business 
▪General: Altria Group, Inc. (“Altria”) is a holding company incorporated in the Commonwealth of Virginia in 1985. At December 31, 2018, Altria’s wholly-owned subsidiaries included Philip Morris USA Inc. (“PM USA”), which is engaged in the manufacture and sale of cigarettes in the United States; John Middleton Co. (“Middleton”), which is engaged in the manufacture and sale of machine-made large cigars and pipe tobacco and is a wholly-owned subsidiary of PM USA; Sherman Group Holdings, LLC and its subsidiaries (“Nat Sherman”), which are engaged in the manufacture and sale of super premium cigarettes and the sale of premium cigars; and UST LLC (“UST”), which through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, including U.S. Smokeless Tobacco Company LLC (“USSTC”) and Ste. Michelle Wine Estates Ltd. (“Ste. Michelle”), is engaged in the manufacture and sale of smokeless tobacco products and wine. Altria’s other operating companies included Philip Morris Capital Corporation (“PMCC”), which maintains a portfolio of finance assets, substantially all of which are leveraged leases, and Nu Mark LLC (“Nu Mark”), both of which are wholly-owned subsidiaries. In December 2018, Altria announced the decision to refocus its innovative product efforts, which included Nu Mark’s discontinuation of production and distribution of all e-vapor products. Prior to that time, Nu Mark was engaged in the manufacture and sale of innovative tobacco products. Other Altria wholly-owned subsidiaries included Altria Group Distribution Company, which provides sales and distribution services to certain Altria operating subsidiaries, and Altria Client Services LLC (“ALCS”), which provides various support services in areas such as legal, regulatory, consumer engagement, finance, human resources and external affairs to Altria and its subsidiaries. 
Altria’s reportable segments are smokeable products, smokeless products and wine. The financial services and the innovative tobacco products businesses are included in an all other category due to the continued reduction of the lease portfolio of PMCC and the relative financial contribution of Altria’s innovative tobacco products businesses to Altria’s consolidated results. For further information, see Note 16. Segment Reporting to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K (“Item 8”).
At September 30, 2016, Altria had an approximate 27% ownership of SABMiller plc (“SABMiller”), which Altria accounted for under the equity method of accounting. In October 2016, Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (“Legacy AB InBev”) completed its business combination with SABMiller, and Altria received cash and shares representing a 9.6% ownership in the combined company (the “AB InBev Transaction”). The newly formed Belgian company, which retained the name Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (“AB InBev”), became the holding company for the combined businesses. Subsequently, Altria purchased approximately 12 million ordinary shares of AB InBev, increasing Altria’s ownership to approximately 10.2% at 


December 31, 2016. At December 31, 2018, Altria had an approximate 10.1% ownership of AB InBev, which Altria accounts for under the equity method of accounting using a one-quarter lag. As a result of the one-quarter lag and the timing of the completion of the AB InBev Transaction, no earnings from Altria’s equity investment in AB InBev were recorded for the year ended December 31, 2016. For further discussion, see Note 7. Investment in AB InBev/SABMiller to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 (“Note 7”).
In January 2017, Altria acquired Nat Sherman, which joined PM USA and Middleton as part of Altria’s smokeable products segment.
On December 20, 2018, Altria purchased, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, shares of non-voting convertible common stock of JUUL Labs, Inc. (“JUUL”), representing a 35% economic interest for $12.8 billion. JUUL is engaged in the manufacture and sale of e-vapor products globally. If and when antitrust clearance is obtained, Altria’s non-voting shares will automatically convert to voting shares (“Share Conversion”). At December 31, 2018, Altria accounted for its investment in JUUL as an investment in an equity security. Upon Share Conversion, Altria expects to account for its investment in JUUL under the equity method of accounting. For further discussion, see Note 8. Investment in JUUL to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 (“Note 8”).
On December 7, 2018, Altria announced that it entered into an agreement to purchase, through a subsidiary, approximately 146.2 million newly issued common shares of Cronos Group Inc. (“Cronos”), a global cannabinoid company headquartered in Toronto, Canada. Cronos shareholders approved the transaction on February 21, 2019. The closing of this transaction remains subject to certain customary closing conditions, including receipt of required regulatory approval. Altria expects the transaction to close in the first half of 2019. Upon completion of this transaction, Altria will own an approximate 45% equity interest in Cronos. Additionally, the agreement includes a warrant to purchase up to an additional approximately 72.2 million common shares of Cronos at a per share exercise price of Canadian dollar (“CAD”) $19.00. The purchase price for the approximate 45% equity interest and warrant is approximately CAD $2.4 billion (approximately U.S. dollar (“USD”) $1.8 billion, based on the CAD to USD exchange rate on February 22, 2019), to be paid on the date of the closing of the transaction. Upon full exercise of the warrant, which expires four years after issuance, Altria would own approximately 55% of the outstanding common shares of Cronos. The exercise price for the warrant is approximately CAD $1.4 billion (approximately USD $1.0 billion, based on the CAD to USD exchange rate on February 22, 2019). As part of the agreement, upon completion of this transaction, Altria will have the right to nominate four directors, including one independent director, to serve on Cronos’ Board of Directors, which will be expanded from five to seven directors. Altria expects to account for its investment in Cronos under the equity method of accounting. 
In January and February 2019, Altria entered into derivative financial instruments in the form of forward contracts, which mature on April 15, 2019, to hedge Altria’s exposure to foreign 


1

currency exchange rate movements in the CAD to USD, in relation to the CAD $2.4 billion purchase price for the Cronos transaction. The aggregate notional amounts of the forward contracts were approximately USD $1.8 billion (CAD $2.4 billion). The forward contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting; therefore, changes in the fair values of the forward contracts will be recorded as gains or losses in Altria’s consolidated statements of earnings in the periods in which the changes occur.
▪Source of Funds: Because Altria is a holding company, its access to the operating cash flows of its wholly-owned subsidiaries consists of cash received from the payment of dividends and distributions, and the payment of interest on intercompany loans by its subsidiaries. In addition, Altria receives cash dividends on its interest in AB InBev and will continue to do so as long as AB InBev pays dividends. Altria expects to receive cash dividends from JUUL, if and when JUUL pays such dividends. 
Narrative Description of Business
Portions of the information called for by this Item are included in Operating Results by Business Segment in Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Annual Report on Form 10-K (“Item 7”).
Tobacco Space
Altria’s tobacco operating companies include PM USA, USSTC and other subsidiaries of UST, Middleton and Nat Sherman. Altria Group Distribution Company provides sales and distribution services to Altria’s tobacco operating companies. 
The products of Altria’s tobacco subsidiaries include smokeable tobacco products, consisting of combustible cigarettes manufactured and sold by PM USA and Nat Sherman, machine-made large cigars and pipe tobacco manufactured and sold by Middleton and premium cigars sold by Nat Sherman; smokeless tobacco products, consisting of moist smokeless tobacco (“MST”) and snus products manufactured and sold by USSTC; and innovative tobacco products, including e-vapor products previously manufactured and sold by Nu Mark.
▪Cigarettes:  PM USA is the largest cigarette company in the United States. Marlboro, the principal cigarette brand of PM USA, has been the largest-selling cigarette brand in the United States for over 40 years. Nat Sherman sells substantially all of its super premium cigarettes in the United States. Total smokeable products segment’s cigarettes shipment volume in the United States was 109.8 billion units in 2018, a decrease of 5.8% from 2017. 
▪Cigars: Middleton is engaged in the manufacture and sale of machine-made large cigars and pipe tobacco. Middleton contracts with a third-party importer to supply a majority of its cigars and sells substantially all of its cigars to customers in the United States. Black & Mild is the principal cigar brand of Middleton. Nat Sherman sources all of its cigars from third-party suppliers and sells substantially all of its cigars to customers in the United States. Total smokeable products segment’s cigars shipment volume was approximately 1.6 billion units in 2018, an increase of 3.8% from 2017. 


▪Smokeless tobacco products:  USSTC is the leading producer and marketer of MST products. The smokeless products segment includes the premium brands, Copenhagen and Skoal, and value brands, Red Seal and Husky. Substantially all of the smokeless tobacco products are manufactured and sold to customers in the United States. Total smokeless products segment’s shipment volume was 832.6 million units in 2018, a decrease of 1.0% from 2017.
▪Innovative tobacco products: In December 2018, Altria announced the decision to refocus its innovative product efforts, which includes Nu Mark’s discontinuation of production and distribution of all e-vapor products. Prior to that time, Nu Mark participated in the e-vapor category and developed and commercialized other innovative tobacco products. In 2013, Nu Mark introduced MarkTen e-vapor products. In April 2014, Nu Mark acquired the e-vapor business of Green Smoke, Inc. and its affiliates, which began selling e-vapor products in 2009. In 2018 and 2017, Altria’s subsidiaries purchased certain intellectual property related to innovative tobacco products. 
In December 2013, Altria’s subsidiaries entered into a series of agreements with Philip Morris International Inc. (“PMI”), including an agreement that grants Altria an exclusive right to commercialize certain of PMI’s heated tobacco products in the United States, subject to the United States Food and Drug Administration’s (“FDA”) authorization. PMI submitted a pre-market tobacco product application and a modified risk tobacco product application for its electronically heated tobacco product, IQOS, with the FDA’s Center for Tobacco Products in the first quarter of 2017 and the fourth quarter of 2016, respectively. Upon regulatory authorization by the FDA and subject to certain performance obligations, Altria’s subsidiaries will have an exclusive license to commercialize IQOS in the United States. 
▪Distribution, Competition and Raw Materials:  Altria’s tobacco subsidiaries sell their tobacco products principally to wholesalers (including distributors), large retail organizations, including chain stores, and the armed services.
The market for tobacco products is highly competitive, characterized by brand recognition and loyalty, with product quality, taste, price, product innovation, marketing, packaging and distribution constituting the significant methods of competition. Promotional activities include, in certain instances and where permitted by law, allowances, the distribution of incentive items, price promotions, product promotions, coupons and other discounts. 
In June 2009, the President of the United States of America signed into law the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act (“FSPTCA”), which provides the FDA with broad authority to regulate the design, manufacture, packaging, advertising, promotion, sale and distribution of tobacco products; the authority to require disclosures of related information; and the authority to enforce the FSPTCA and related regulations. The FSPTCA went into effect in 2009 for cigarettes, cigarette tobacco and smokeless tobacco products and in August 2016 for all other tobacco products, including cigars, e-vapor products, pipe tobacco and oral tobacco-derived nicotine products (“Other Tobacco Products”). The FSPTCA imposes restrictions on the advertising, 


2

promotion, sale and distribution of tobacco products, including at retail. PM USA, Middleton, Nat Sherman and USSTC are subject to quarterly user fees as a result of the FSPTCA. Their respective FDA user fee amounts are determined by an allocation formula administered by the FDA that is based on the respective market shares of manufacturers and importers of each kind of tobacco product. PM USA, Nat Sherman, USSTC and other U.S. tobacco manufacturers have agreed to other marketing restrictions in the United States as part of the settlements of state health care cost recovery actions.
In the United States, under a contract growing program, PM USA purchases the majority of its burley and flue-cured leaf tobaccos directly from tobacco growers. Under the terms of this program, PM USA agrees to purchase the amount of tobacco specified in the grower contracts. PM USA also purchases a portion of its tobacco requirements through leaf merchants. 
Nat Sherman purchases its tobacco requirements through leaf merchants.
USSTC purchases dark fire-cured, dark air-cured and burley leaf tobaccos from domestic tobacco growers under a contract growing program as well as from leaf merchants. 
Middleton purchases burley, dark air-cured and flue-cured leaf tobaccos through leaf merchants. Middleton does not have a contract growing program.
Altria’s tobacco subsidiaries believe there is an adequate supply of tobacco in the world markets to satisfy their current and anticipated production requirements. See Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K (“Item 1A”) and Tobacco Space - Business Environment - Price, Availability and Quality of Tobacco, Other Raw Materials and Component Parts in Item 7 for a discussion of risks associated with tobacco supply. 
Wine
Ste. Michelle is a producer and supplier of premium varietal and blended table wines and of sparkling wines. Ste. Michelle is a leading producer of Washington state wines, primarily Chateau Ste. Michelle, Columbia Crest and 14 Hands, and owns wineries in or distributes wines from several other domestic and foreign wine regions. Ste. Michelle’s total 2018 wine shipment volume of approximately 8.2 million cases decreased 3.3% from 2017. 
Ste. Michelle holds an 85% ownership interest in Michelle-Antinori, LLC, which owns Stag’s Leap Wine Cellars in Napa Valley. Ste. Michelle also owns Conn Creek in Napa Valley, Patz & Hall in Sonoma and Erath in Oregon. In addition, Ste. Michelle imports and markets Antinori, Torres and Villa Maria Estate wines and Champagne Nicolas Feuillatte in the United States. 
▪Distribution, Competition and Raw Materials:  Key elements of Ste. Michelle’s strategy are expanded domestic distribution of its wines, especially in certain account categories such as restaurants, wholesale clubs, supermarkets, wine shops and mass merchandisers, and a focus on improving product mix to higher-priced, premium products. 
Ste. Michelle’s business is subject to significant competition, including competition from many larger, well-established domestic and international companies, as well as from many smaller wine producers. Wine segment competition is primarily 


based on quality, price, consumer and trade wine tastings, competitive wine judging, third-party acclaim and advertising. Substantially all of Ste. Michelle’s sales occur in the United States through state-licensed distributors. Ste. Michelle also sells to domestic consumers through retail and e-commerce channels and exports wines to international distributors.
Federal, state and local governmental agencies regulate the beverage alcohol industry through various means, including licensing requirements, pricing rules, labeling and advertising restrictions, and distribution and production policies. Further regulatory restrictions or additional excise or other taxes on the manufacture and sale of alcoholic beverages may have an adverse effect on Ste. Michelle’s wine business.
Ste. Michelle uses grapes harvested from its own vineyards or purchased from independent growers, as well as bulk wine purchased from other sources. Grape production can be adversely affected by weather and other forces that may limit production. At the present time, Ste. Michelle believes that there is a sufficient supply of grapes and bulk wine available in the market to satisfy its current and expected production requirements. See Item 1A for a discussion of risks associated with competition, unfavorable changes in grape supply and governmental regulations. 
Financial Services Business
In 2003, PMCC ceased making new investments and began focusing exclusively on managing its portfolio of finance assets in order to maximize its operating results and cash flows from its existing lease portfolio activities and asset sales. 
Other Matters
▪Customers:  The largest customer of PM USA, USSTC, Middleton and Nat Sherman, McLane Company, Inc., accounted for approximately 27%, 26% and 25% of Altria’s consolidated net revenues for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. In addition, Core-Mark Holding Company, Inc. accounted for approximately 14% of Altria’s consolidated net revenues for each of the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. Substantially all of these net revenues were reported in the smokeable products and smokeless products segments. 
Sales to two distributors accounted for approximately 64% of net revenues for the wine segment for the year ended December 31, 2018. Sales to three distributors accounted for approximately 67% and 69% of net revenues for the wine segment for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. 
▪Employees: At December 31, 2018, Altria and its subsidiaries employed approximately 8,300 people. As a result of the cost reduction program announced in December 2018, there will be a reduction of approximately 900 employees, substantially all of which are expected to depart by February 28, 2019.
▪Executive Officers of Altria: The disclosure regarding executive officers is included in Item 10. Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance - Executive Officers as of February 12, 2019 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
▪Intellectual Property: Trademarks are of material importance to Altria and its operating companies, and are protected by registration or otherwise. In addition, as of 


3

December 31, 2018, the portfolio of approximately 950 United States patents owned by Altria’s businesses, as a whole, was material to Altria and its tobacco businesses. However, no one patent or group of related patents was material to Altria’s business or its tobacco businesses as of December 31, 2018. Altria’s businesses also have proprietary trade secrets, technology, know-how, processes and other intellectual property rights that are protected by appropriate confidentiality measures. Certain trade secrets are material to Altria and its tobacco and wine businesses.
▪Environmental Regulation:  Altria and its subsidiaries (and former subsidiaries) are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations concerning the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise related to environmental protection, including, in the United States: The Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (commonly known as “Superfund”), which can impose joint and several liability on each responsible party. Subsidiaries (and former subsidiaries) of Altria are involved in several matters subjecting them to potential costs of remediation and natural resource damages under Superfund or other laws and regulations. Altria’s subsidiaries expect to continue to make capital and other expenditures in connection with environmental laws and regulations. As discussed in Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 (“Note 2”), Altria provides for expenses associated with environmental remediation obligations on an undiscounted basis when such amounts are probable and can be reasonably estimated. Such accruals are adjusted as new information develops or circumstances change. Other than those amounts, it is not possible to reasonably estimate the cost of any environmental remediation and compliance efforts that subsidiaries of Altria may undertake in the future. In the opinion of management, however, compliance with environmental laws and regulations, including the payment of any remediation costs or damages and the making of related expenditures, has not had, and is not expected to have, a material adverse effect on Altria’s consolidated results of operations, capital expenditures, financial position or cash flows.
