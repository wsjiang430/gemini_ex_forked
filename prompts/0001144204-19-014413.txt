ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

Overview
 
We develop and operate seawater desalination plants (that utilize reverse osmosis technology) and water distribution systems in areas where naturally occurring supplies of potable water are scarce. Through our subsidiaries and affiliate, we provide the following services to our customers in the Cayman Islands, The Bahamas, Belize, the British Virgin Islands, the United States and Indonesia:

· | Retail Water Operations. We produce and supply water to end-users, including residential, commercial and government customers in the Cayman Islands under an exclusive retail license issued by the Cayman Islands government to provide water in two of the three most populated and rapidly developing areas on Grand Cayman Island. We also have a desalination plant in Bali, Indonesia that sells water to resort and residential properties. In 2018, our retail water operations generated approximately 39% of our consolidated revenues. Substantially all of our retail revenues were generated by our Grand Cayman operations.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Bulk Water Operations. We produce and supply water to government-owned distributors in the Cayman Islands and The Bahamas. In 2018, our bulk water operations generated approximately 47% of our consolidated revenues. As of and through December 31, 2018, we also supplied water in Belize, however, in February 2019, we completed the sale (which was effective as of January 1, 2019) of this subsidiary to our government-controlled customer in Belize. Accordingly, our results of continuing operations no longer include the results of this Belize subsidiary. CW-Belize’s results of operations for 2018 and 2017 are reflected in our consolidated results of operations as net income from discontinued operations.

----+--------------------------------

Strategy
 
Our primary strategy is to provide water services in areas where (i) the supply of potable water is scarce and (ii) the production of potable water by reverse osmosis desalination is, or will be, economically viable for customers in those areas. We also seek to complement this primary strategy with other products and services relevant to desalination, water production and water treatment. We focus primarily on markets with the following characteristics:

· | inadequate sources of potable water.
--+-------------------------------------


· | favorable regulatory and tax environments.
--+-------------------------------------------


· | a large proportion of tourist properties (which historically have generated higher volume sales than residential properties).
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | growing populations and economies.
--+-----------------------------------

We believe that our potential market includes any location with a demand for, but a limited supply of, potable water and that has access to seawater. The desalination of seawater is the most widely used process for producing potable water in areas with an insufficient natural supply. In addition, in many locations, desalination is the only commercially viable means to expand the existing water supply. We believe that our experience in the development and operation of reverse osmosis desalination plants provides us with the capabilities to successfully expand our operations beyond our existing markets and we expect to do so in the coming years.
 
Key elements of our strategy include:
 
Maximizing our existing operations in the Cayman Islands and The Bahamas. We plan to continue to seek new water supply agreements and renewals of our existing supply agreements, and to pursue increases in our production levels in our two largest existing markets.
 
Penetrating new markets. We plan to continue to seek opportunities to profitably expand our existing operations into new markets that have significant unfulfilled demands for potable water and/or our other products. These markets include the rest of the Caribbean, Mexico, the United States and any other areas where we believe we can be successful. We may pursue these opportunities either on our own or through joint ventures, strategic alliances and/or acquisitions.
 
Broadening our existing revenue sources with complementary products, services and businesses. We plan to pursue opportunities to leverage our water-related expertise to enter complementary industries that can serve as viable complements to our existing businesses. We may pursue these opportunities either on our own or through joint ventures, strategic alliances and/or acquisitions.

We own an overall 43.53% equity interest in OC-BVI’s profits and certain profit-sharing rights that raise our effective interest in OC-BVI’s profits to approximately 45%. OC-BVI also pays our subsidiary, DesalCo Limited, fees for certain engineering and administrative services. We account for our investment in OC-BVI under the equity method of accounting.
Discontinued Operations 
 
As of and through December 31, 2018, we sold bulk water in Belize through our wholly-owned subsidiary CW-Belize, which is the exclusive provider of water in Ambergris Caye to Belize Water Services Ltd. (“BWSL”), a government-controlled entity which distributes the water through its own pipeline system to residential, commercial and tourist properties. BWSL distributes water primarily to residential properties, small hotels, and businesses that serve the tourist market. CW-Belize was included in our bulk segment.
 
In February 2019, we completed the sale (which was effective as of January 1, 2019) of CW-Belize to BWSL. See further discussion of this sale at Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements at ITEM 8.
 
Our Operations
 
For fiscal year 2018, our retail water, bulk water, services and manufacturing segments generated approximately 39%, 47%, 3% and 11%, respectively, of our consolidated revenues. For additional information about our business segments and geographical information about our operating revenues and long-lived assets, see Note 17 to our consolidated financial statements at ITEM 8 of this Annual Report.
Retail Water Operations
 
For fiscal years 2018 and 2017, our retail water operations accounted for approximately 39%, and 39%, respectively, of our consolidated revenues. This business produces and supplies water to end-users, including residential, commercial and government customers in the Cayman Islands and Bali, Indonesia.
Retail Operations in the Cayman Islands
 
We sell water through our retail operations to a variety of residential and commercial customers through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Cayman Water, which operated under an exclusive license issued to us by the Cayman Islands government that expired in January 2018. Pursuant to the license, we had the exclusive right to produce potable water and distribute it by pipeline to our licensed service area which consists of two of the three most populated areas of Grand Cayman Island: Seven Mile Beach and West Bay.
 
The license was originally scheduled to expire in July 2010 but was extended several times by the Cayman Islands government in order to provide the parties with additional time to negotiate the terms of a new license agreement. The most recent extension of the license expired on January 31, 2018. We continue to provide water subsequent to January 31, 2018 on a month-to-month “good faith” basis under the terms of the expired license in order to allowed for the continuation of negotiations for a new license without interruption to an essential service.

In 2016, the Government of the Cayman Islands passed legislation which created a new utilities regulation and competition office (“OfReg”). OfReg is an independent and accountable regulatory body with a view of protecting the rights of consumers, encouraging affordable utility services, and promoting competition. OfReg, which began operations in January 2017, has the ability to supervise, monitor and regulate multiple utility undertakings and markets. Supplemental legislation was passed by the Government of the Cayman Islands in April 2017, which transferred responsibility for economic regulation of the water utility sector and the retail license negotiations from the WAC to OfReg in May 2017. We began license negotiations with OfReg in July 2017 and such negotiations are continuing.
 
Under the terms of its previous license (and subsequent to the expiration of the license in January 2018), Cayman Water pays a royalty to the government of 7.5% of its gross retail water sales revenues (excluding energy cost adjustments). The selling prices of water sold to its customers are determined by the license and vary depending upon the type and location of the customer and the monthly volume of water purchased. The license provides for an automatic adjustment for inflation or deflation on an annual basis, subject to temporary limited exceptions, and an automatic adjustment for the cost of electricity on a monthly basis. The WAC, on behalf of the government, previously reviewed and confirmed the calculations of the price adjustments for inflation and electricity costs. Effective May 22, 2017, regulatory responsibility for the water utility sector was transferred from the WAC to OfReg and all reviews and confirmations of calculations of the price adjustments for inflation and electricity costs are now performed by OfReg.
 
See also ITEM 1.A. RISK FACTORS and ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - Material Commitments, Expenditures and Contingencies – Cayman Water Retail License.
 
Our retail operations in the Cayman Islands produce potable water at three seawater reverse osmosis desalination plants in Grand Cayman located at our Abel Castillo Water Works (“ACWW”), Britannia and West Bay sites. We own the land for our ACWW and West Bay plants and have entered into a lease for the land for our Britannia plant that expires January 1, 2027. The current production capacity of the plant located at ACWW is 2.0 million gallons of water per day. The production capacity of the Britannia plant is 715,000 gallons of water per day. The production capacity of the West Bay plant is 885,000 gallons of water per day.
 
Electricity to our plants is supplied by Caribbean Utilities Co. Ltd., a publicly traded utility company. We maintain diesel engine-driven standby generators at all three retail plant sites with sufficient capacity to operate our distribution pumps and other essential equipment during any temporary interruptions in electricity supply. Standby generation capacity is available at our ACWW plants and West Bay plant to operate a portion of the water production capacity as well.
 
In the event of an emergency, our distribution system is connected to the distribution system of the WAC. In prior years, we have purchased water from the WAC for brief periods of time and have also sold potable water to the WAC from our retail plants.
 
Our pipeline system on Grand Cayman covers the Seven Mile Beach and West Bay areas and consists of approximately 90 miles of potable water pipeline. We extend our distribution system periodically as demand warrants. We have a main pipe loop covering the Seven Mile Beach and West Bay areas. We place extensions of smaller diameter pipe off our main pipe to service new developments in our service area. This system of building branches from the main pipe keeps construction costs low and allows us to provide service to new areas in a timely manner. Developers are responsible for laying the pipeline within their developments at their own cost, but in accordance with our specifications. When a development is completed, the developer then transfers operation and maintenance of the pipeline to us.
 
We bill our customers on a monthly basis based on metered consumption and bills are typically collected within 30 to 35 days after the billing date. Receivables not collected within 45 days subject the customer to disconnection from water service. In 2018 and 2017, bad debts represented less than 1% of our total annual retail sales. In addition to their past due invoice balance, customers that have had their service disconnected must pay re-connection charges.
 
Historically, demand on our pipeline distribution has varied throughout the year. Demand depends upon various factors including the number of tourists visiting and the amount of rainfall during any particular time of the year and other cyclical climate conditions. In general, the majority of tourists come from the United States during the winter which is also the dry season in the Cayman Islands.
 
Retail Operations in Bali, Indonesia
 
Our subsidiary, CW-Bali, completed the construction of, and in 2013 began operating, a seawater reverse osmosis desalination plant with an initial capacity of 790,000 gallons per day in Nusa Dua, one of the primary tourist areas of Bali, Indonesia. Nusa Dua has a target customer profile consisting of tourist resorts and luxury/vacation residences comparable to our retail service area on Grand Cayman. We believed the water demands of these properties in Nusa Dua already exceeded the supply capacity of the local public water utility and would soon exceed other local sources (such as wells), and that other areas of Bali would also eventually experience fresh water shortages. Since desalination had not been employed to any meaningful extent in Bali, we concluded that to obtain customers in Bali we were required to first demonstrate the viability of desalination as well as our capabilities and expertise. Consequently, we elected to construct this plant before obtaining water supply agreements for its production.

Since its inception, we have recorded operating losses for CW-Bali as the sales volumes for its plant have not been sufficient to cover its operating costs. In May 2017, after considering CW-Bali’s historical and projected operating losses, its on-going funding requirements, the current business and economic environment in Bali and our inability to obtain a strategic partner for CW-Bali, our Board of Directors formally resolved to discontinue CW-Bali’s operations. Shortly thereafter, we reduced the capacity of CW-Bali’s plant to 264,000 gallons per day by transferring two of its reverse osmosis desalination units to other operations. We planned to cease the production of water in Bali, sell our stock in CW-Bali or CW-Bali’s net assets, and exit the Bali market at the earliest practical date, which we initially believed would be no later than March 31, 2018. However, in October 2017, CW-Bali’s sole remaining customer filed a lawsuit in Bali, Indonesia against CW-Bali seeking compensatory and punitive damages. This lawsuit was ultimately resolved in our favor and we are presently seeking to dispose of our investment in CW-Bali. As a result of impairment losses recorded in prior years, the carrying value of our remaining investment in CW-Bali is immaterial to our consolidated financial condition. CW-Bali’s operations were also immaterial to our consolidated results of operations for 2018.
 
See further discussion of CW-Bali at ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS and ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.
 
Bulk Water Operations
 
For fiscal years 2018 and 2017, our bulk water operations accounted for approximately 47% and 48%, respectively, of our consolidated revenues. These operations produce potable water from seawater and sell this water to governments in the Cayman Islands and The Bahamas.
Bulk Water Operations in the Cayman Islands
 
Through our wholly-owned subsidiary OC-Cayman we provide bulk water to the WAC, a government-owned utility and regulatory agency, under various agreements. The WAC in turn distributes that water to properties in Grand Cayman outside of our retail license area.
 
The water we sell to the WAC is produced at three seawater reverse osmosis desalination plants in Grand Cayman owned by the WAC but designed, built and operated by OC-Cayman: the North Sound, Red Gate and North Side Water Works (“NSWW”) plants, which have production capacities of approximately 1.6 million, 1.3 million and 2.4 million gallons of water per day, respectively. The plants we operate for the WAC are located on land owned by the WAC.
 
The previous operating agreements for the North Sound and Red Gate plants expired in February 2019. In response to a public bidding process for a new operations and maintenance agreement encompassing both the North Sound and Red Gate plants, OC-Cayman submitted a bid for the new agreement.
 
In August 2018, the WAC accepted OC-Cayman’s bid for the new agreement, and the WAC and OC-Cayman entered into a new five-year contract commencing on February 1, 2019 for the operation of the North Sound and Red Gate plants. The terms of the new agreement are substantially consistent with those of the prior North Sound and Red Gate water supply agreements, except that (i) we have decreased the price we charge for the water supplied; and (ii) under the new agreement the WAC pays the energy costs for the operation of these plants directly to the utility company rather than paying OC-Cayman pass -through energy charges for these costs. The per gallon price we charged for the water supplied under the new agreement in February 2019, excluding the effect of the pass-through energy component, was approximately 25% less than the per gallon rate we charged in February 2018 under the prior agreements. As a result of this price reduction (and assuming comparable sales volumes), the revenues and operating income we generate from the North Sound and Red Gate plants commencing February 1, 2019 will be less than the revenues and operating income we have historically generated from these plants under the previous agreements.
 
The operations and maintenance agreement for the NSWW plant expires in June 2019. Pursuant to a public bidding process, in February 2019, we submitted our bid to operate and maintain this plant for a period of seven years after the current contract expires and are awaiting the results of the bidding process and the decision of the WAC.
 
Bulk Water Operations in The Bahamas
 
We sell bulk water in The Bahamas through our majority-owned subsidiary, CW-Bahamas, to the WSC, which distributes the water through its own pipeline system to residential, commercial and tourist properties on the Island of New Providence. We also sell water to a private resort on Bimini.
 
We supply bulk water in The Bahamas from our Windsor, Blue Hills and Bimini plants.
 
Our water supply agreement with the WSC for our Windsor plant, which has a capacity of 2.8 million gallons per day, expires in August 2033 and requires us to deliver a minimum of 16.8 million gallons per week. Pursuant to this agreement, CW-Bahamas was required to complete capital improvements to the Windsor plant to ensure that the plant can meet its performance guarantees during the agreement period. These improvements were completed during the fourth quarter of 2018.

We supply water from the Blue Hills plant, our Company’s largest seawater reverse osmosis desalination facility with a capacity of 12.0 million gallons per day, under the terms of a water supply agreement with the WSC that expires in March 2032 that requires us to deliver and requires the WSC to purchase a minimum of 63.0 million gallons of water each week.
 
The Bimini plant has a capacity of 115,000 gallons per day and supplies water to a private resort under a water supply agreement that expires in December 2020.
 
The high-pressure pumps at our Windsor and Blue Hills plants in The Bahamas are diesel engine-driven. Electricity for the remainder of our plant operations is supplied by Bahamas Power and Light, formally known as Bahamas Electricity Corporation. We maintain a standby generator with sufficient capacity to operate essential equipment at our Windsor and Blue Hills plants and are able to produce 100% of the production capacity with these plants during temporary interruptions in the electricity supply.
 
Services Operations
 
For fiscal years 2018 and 2017, our services operations accounted for approximately 3% and 1%, respectively, of our consolidated revenues. Presently, our services operations are providing management and purchasing services to our affiliate OC-BVI in the British Virgin Islands. In the past, we have also provided services to the WAC and to the WSC.
 
We provide design, engineering and construction services for desalination projects through DesalCo, which is recognized by suppliers as an original equipment manufacturer of seawater reverse osmosis desalination plants. DesalCo also provides management and procurement services for desalination plants and engineering services relating to municipal water production, distribution and treatment. DesalCo also conducts research and development. DesalCo sometimes tests new components and technology offered by suppliers in our business and, at times, we collaborate with suppliers in the development of their products.
 
Manufacturing Operations
 
For fiscal years 2018 and 2017, our manufacturing operations accounted for approximately 11% and 12%, respectively, of our consolidated revenues. Our manufacturing operations consists of Aerex, an original equipment manufacturer and service provider of a wide range of products and services applicable to desalination, municipal water treatment and industrial water and wastewater treatment. Its products include reverse osmosis desalination equipment, membrane separation equipment, filtration equipment, piping systems, vessels and custom fabricated components. Aerex also offers engineering, design, consulting, inspection, training and equipment maintenance services to its customers. Aerex’s manufacturing facility and headquarters are located in Fort Pierce, Florida and substantially all of its customers are U.S. companies. We acquired our 51% ownership interest in Aerex in 2016.
Affiliate Operations
 
Our affiliate, OC-BVI, sells water to the Government of the British Virgin Islands Water and Sewerage Department (“BVIW&S”). We own 50% of the voting shares of OC-BVI and have an overall 43.53% equity interest in the profits of OC-BVI. We also own separate profit-sharing rights in OC-BVI that raise our effective interest in OC-BVI’s profits from 43.53% to approximately 45%. Sage Water Holdings (BVI) Limited (“Sage”) owns the remaining 50% of the voting shares of OC-BVI and the remaining 55% interest in its profits. Under the Articles of Association of OC-BVI, we have the right to appoint three of the six directors of OC-BVI. Sage is entitled to appoint the remaining three directors. In the event of a tied vote of the directors, the President of the Caribbean Water and Wastewater Association, a regional trade association comprised primarily of government representatives, is entitled to appoint a junior director to cast a deciding vote.
 
Through our DesalCo subsidiary, we provide certain engineering and administrative services to OC-BVI for a monthly fee and a bonus arrangement which provides for payment of 4% of the net operating income of OC-BVI.
 
We account for our investment in OC-BVI using the equity method of accounting.
 
OC-BVI sells bulk water to BVIW&S, which distributes the water through its own pipeline system to residential, commercial and tourist properties on the islands of Tortola and Jost Van Dyke in the British Virgin Islands. OC-BVI provides operating, engineering and procurement services for another plant under a short-term agreement with Sage.
 
OC-BVI owns and operates a desalination plant located at Bar Bay, Tortola with a capacity of 720,000 gallons per day. Pursuant to a water supply agreement with the BVI government, OC-BVI is required to supply up to 600,000 gallons per day to the BVI government. This water supply agreement was scheduled to expire in March 2017 but was extended in February 2017 to March 2031.
 
OC-BVI purchases electrical power to operate this plant from BVI Electric Co. and operates diesel engine driven emergency power generators which can produce 100% of the plant’s production capacity when BVI Electric Co. is unable to provide power to the plant.
 
OC-BVI’s plant on the island of Jost Van Dyke has a capacity of 60,000 gallons per day. This plant operates under a 10-year contract with the BVI government that expired July 8, 2013. Pursuant to the contract, OC-BVI is operating the plant on a year-to-year basis until the BVI government informs OC-BVI of its intention to extend the existing contract or enter into a new agreement. We purchase electrical power to operate this plant from BVI Electric Co.

Reverse Osmosis Technology
 
The conversion of seawater to potable water is called desalination. The two primary forms of desalination are distillation and reverse osmosis. Both methods are used throughout the world and technologies are improving to lower the costs of production. Reverse osmosis is a fluid separation process in which the saline water (i.e. seawater) is pressurized and the fresh water is separated from the saline water by passing through a semi-permeable membrane which rejects the salts. The saline water is first passed through a pretreatment system, which generally consists of fine filtration and treatment chemicals, if required. Pre-treatment removes suspended solids and organics which could cause fouling of the membrane surface. Next, a high-pressure pump pressurizes the saline water thus enabling approximately 40% conversion of the saline water to fresh water as it passes through the membrane, while more than 99% of the dissolved salts are rejected and remain in the now concentrated saline water. This concentrate is discharged without passing through the membrane, and the remaining hydraulic energy in the concentrate is transferred to the initial saline feed water with an energy recovery device thus reducing the total energy requirement for the reverse osmosis system. The final step is post-treatment, which consists of stabilizing the produced fresh water (thereby removing undesirable dissolved gases), adjusting the pH and (if necessary) the mineral content, and providing chlorination to prepare it for distribution.
 
We use reverse osmosis technology to convert seawater to potable water at all of the plants we construct and operate. We believe that this technology is the most effective and efficient conversion process for our markets. However, we are always seeking ways to maximize efficiencies in our current processes and investigating new, more efficient processes to convert seawater to potable water. The equipment at our plants is among the most energy efficient available and we monitor and maintain the equipment in an efficient manner. As a result of our decades of experience in seawater desalination, we believe our expertise and experience with respect to the development and operation of desalination plants and similar facilities is easily transferable to locations outside of our current operating areas.
 
Raw Materials and Sources of Supply
 
All materials, parts and supplies essential to our business operations are obtained from multiple sources and we use the latest industry technology. Prior to our acquisition of Aerex, we did not manufacture any parts or components for equipment essential to our business. Aerex has manufactured some of the key components for some of our plants in the past and we expect Aerex to continue to do so. Our access to seawater for processing into potable water is granted through our licenses and contracts with governments of the various jurisdictions in which we have our operations.
Seasonal Variations in Our Business
 
Demand for our water in the Cayman Islands, Belize, and The Bahamas is affected by variations in the level of tourism and local weather, primarily rainfall. Tourism in our service areas is affected by the economies of the tourists’ home countries, primarily the United States and Europe, terrorist activity and perceived threats thereof, and increased costs of fuel and airfares. We normally sell more water during the first and second quarters, when the number of tourists is greater and local rainfall is less in our markets, than in the third and fourth quarters.
Government Regulations, Custom Duties and Taxes
 
Our operations and activities are subject to the governmental regulations and taxes of the countries in which we operate. The following summary of regulatory developments and legislation does not purport to describe all present and proposed regulation and legislation that may affect our businesses. Legislative or regulatory requirements currently applicable to our businesses may change in the future. Any such changes could impose new obligations on us that may adversely affect our businesses and operating results. The following paragraphs set forth some of the key governmental regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate outside of the United States.
The Cayman Islands
 
The Cayman Islands are a British Overseas Territory and have had a stable political climate since 1670, when the Treaty of Madrid ceded the Cayman Islands to England. The Queen of England appoints the Governor of the Cayman Islands to make laws with the advice and consent of the legislative assembly. The legislative assembly consists of 19 elected members and two members appointed by the Governor from the Civil Service. The Cabinet is responsible for day-to-day government operations. The Cabinet consists of the Premier and six other ministers who are chosen by the Premier from its 19 popularly elected members, and the two Civil Service members. The elected members choose from among themselves a leader, who is designated the Premier, and is in effect the leader of the elected government. The Governor has reserved powers and the United Kingdom retains full control over foreign affairs and defense. The Cayman Islands are a common law jurisdiction and have adopted a legal system similar to that of the United Kingdom.
 
The Cayman Islands have no taxes on profits, income, distributions, capital gains or appreciation. We have exemptions from, or receive concessionary rates of customs duties on, certain capital expenditures for plant and major consumable spare parts and supplies imported into the Cayman Islands under our retail water license. We do not pay import duty or taxes on reverse osmosis membranes, electric pumps and motors, and chemicals, but we do pay duty at the rate of 10% of the cost, including insurance and transportation to the Cayman Islands, of other plant and associated materials and equipment to manufacture or supply water in the Seven Mile Beach or West Bay areas. We have been advised by the Government of the Cayman Islands that we will not receive any duty concessions in our new retail water license.

The Bahamas
 
The Commonwealth of The Bahamas is an independent nation and a constitutional parliamentary democracy with the Queen of England as the constitutional head of state. The basis of the Bahamian law and legal system is the English common law tradition with a Supreme Court, Court of Appeals, and a Magistrates court.
 
Under the current laws of the Commonwealth of The Bahamas, no income, corporation, capital gains or similar taxes are payable by us. We are required to pay an annual business license fee (the calculation of which is based on our preceding year’s financial statements) which to date has not been material to the results of our Bahamas operations. We are also required to pay a value added tax on materials and services we purchase.
 
The British Virgin Islands
 
The British Virgin Islands (the “BVI”) is a British Overseas Territory, with the Queen of England as the Head of State and Her Majesty’s representative, the Governor, responsible for external affairs, defense and internal security, the Civil Service and administration of the courts. Since 1967, the BVI has held responsibility for its own internal affairs.
 
The BVI Constitution provides for the people of the BVI to be represented by a ministerial system of government, led by an elected Premier, a Cabinet of Ministers and the House of Assembly. The House of Assembly consists of 13 elected representatives, the Attorney General, and the Speaker.
 
The judicial system, based on English law, is under the direction of the Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court, which includes the High Court of Justice and the Court of Appeal. The ultimate appellate court is the Privy Council in London.
 
Market and Service Area
 
Although we currently operate in the Cayman Islands, The Bahamas, the British Virgin Islands, the United States and Indonesia, we believe that our potential market consists of any location where a need exists for potable water and with access to seawater or brackish water. The desalination of seawater, either through distillation or reverse osmosis, is the most widely used process for producing potable water in areas with an insufficient natural supply. We believe our experience in the development and operation of reverse osmosis desalination plants will provide us with significant opportunities to successfully expand our operations beyond the markets in which we currently operate.
Cayman Islands. The Cayman Islands government, through the WAC, supplies water to the areas of Grand Cayman that are not within our licensed area, as well as to Cayman Brac. We operate all but one of the reverse osmosis desalination plants owned by the WAC on Grand Cayman and supply water under licenses and supply agreements held by OC-Cayman with the WAC.
 
According to the most recent information published by the Economics and Statistics Office of the Cayman Islands Government, the population of the Cayman Islands was estimated in December 2017 to be 63,415. According to the figures published by the Department of Tourism Statistics Information Center, in 2018 as compared to 2017, tourist air arrivals increased by 11% to approximately 463,000 and tourist cruise ship arrivals increased by 11% to approximately 1,921,000.
 
We believe that our water sales in the Cayman Islands are more positively impacted by stay-over tourists that arrive by air than by those arriving by cruise ship, since cruise ship tourists generally only visit the island for one day or less and do not remain on the island overnight.
 
Our retail water sales are significantly impacted by the amount of rainfall on Grand Cayman Island.
 
The Bahamas. The Bahamas government, through the WSC, supplies all of the piped water on the island of New Providence, Bahamas, which includes Nassau, the largest city, political capital and commercial hub of The Bahamas. We supply water to the WSC through the water supply agreements for our Blue Hills and Windsor plants, which are located in Nassau. New Providence is the most populous island in The Bahamas, with more than 70% of the country’s population. A 2010 census placed the population of New Providence at approximately 246,000. According to statistics published by the Bahamas Ministry of Tourism, the number of cruise ship arrival and air arrival tourists to New Providence exceeded 2.5 million and 1.1 million, respectively, in 2018.
British Virgin Islands. The British Virgin Islands are a British Overseas Territory and are situated east of Puerto Rico. They consist of 16 inhabited and more than 20 uninhabited islands, of which Tortola is the largest and most populated. The British Virgin Islands serve as a hub for many large yacht-chartering businesses.

Competition
 
Cayman Islands. Pursuant to our license granted by the Cayman Islands government, we had the exclusive right to provide potable, piped water within our licensed service area on Grand Cayman. This license expired on January 31, 2018. However, we continue to provide water subsequent to January 31, 2018 on a month-to-month “good faith” basis under the terms of the expired license in order to allow for the continuation of negotiations for a new license without interruption to an essential service. We are the only non-government-owned public water utility on Grand Cayman. The Cayman Islands government, through the WAC, supplies water to parts of Grand Cayman located outside of our licensed service area. Although we have no competition within our exclusive retail license service area for potable water, our ability to expand our service area is at the discretion of the Cayman Island government. Private residences and commercial multi-unit dwellings up to four units may install potable water making equipment for their own use. Water plants on premises within our license area and serving only their premises in existence prior to 1991 can be maintained but not replaced or expanded. We are aware of only one such plant currently in operation. We have competed with such companies as SUEZ (formerly GE Water), Veolia, and IDE Technologies for bulk water supply contracts with the WAC.
The Bahamas. On South Bimini Island in The Bahamas, we supply water to a private developer and do not have competitors. A competitor operates a seawater reverse osmosis desalination plant on North Bimini Island and other small islands. We competed with companies such as SUEZ (formerly GE Water), Veolia, IDE Technologies, GS Inima and Biwater for the contract with the Bahamian government to build and operate a seawater reverse osmosis desalination plant at Blue Hills, New Providence, Bahamas. We expect to compete with these companies and others for any future water supply contracts in The Bahamas.
British Virgin Islands. In the British Virgin Islands, SUEZ (formerly GE Water) operates seawater reverse osmosis desalination plants in West End, Tortola, and on Virgin Gorda and generally bids against OC-BVI for projects. In 2010, Biwater PLC negotiated a 16-year contract on a sole sourced basis, pursuant to which it has constructed and is operating a 2.75 million gallon per day desalination plant in Parakeeta Bay, Tortola for the British Virgin Islands government. In August 2015, this plant was acquired from Biwater by Seven Seas Water, a division of AquaVenture Holdings. We expect that OC-BVI will be required to compete against SUEZ (formerly GE Water), Aquaventure Holdings and other parties for any future business opportunities that may arise in the British Virgin Islands.
United States. Aerex competes in the highly fragmented industry for manufactured water production and treatment equipment, systems and services against a large number of manufacturers, fabricators and service providers, many of which have greater resources than Aerex.
Bali, Indonesia. In Bali, we compete against local water treatment equipment suppliers who provide equipment and services to individual resort properties.
 
To implement our growth strategy for our desalination businesses outside our existing operating areas, we will have to compete with some of the same companies we competed with in the past such as Seven Seas Water, SUEZ (formerly GE Water), Veolia, IDE Technologies, GS Inima, and Biwater as well as other companies. Some of these companies currently operate in areas in which we would like to expand our operations, already maintain worldwide operations, and have greater financial, managerial and other resources than our company. We believe that our low overhead costs, knowledge of local markets and conditions and our efficient manner of operating desalinated water production and distribution equipment provide us with the capabilities to effectively compete for new projects in the Caribbean basin and other select markets.
Environmental and Health Regulatory Matters
 
Cayman Islands. With respect to our Cayman Islands operations, we operate our water plants in accordance with guidelines of the Cayman Islands Department of Environmental Health. We are licensed by the WAC to discharge concentrated seawater, which is a byproduct of our desalination process, into deep disposal wells.
 
Our Cayman Islands license requires that our potable water quality meet the World Health Organization’s Guidelines for Drinking Water Quality and contain less than 200 mg/l of total dissolved solids.
 
The Bahamas and British Virgin Islands. With respect to our Bahamian operations and OC-BVI’s British Virgin Islands operations, we and OC-BVI are required by our water supply contracts to take all reasonable measures to prevent pollution of the environment. We are licensed by the Bahamian government to discharge concentrated seawater, which is a by-product of our desalination process, into deep disposal wells. OC-BVI is licensed by the British Virgin Islands government to discharge concentrated seawater into the sea. At several of our locations, hydrogen sulfide gas is present in the seawater and we operate our plants in a manner designed to minimize the emission of airborne gas into the environment.
United States. Consistent with other U.S. manufacturers, Aerex must comply with laws and regulations administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
 
We are not aware of any existing or pending environmental legislation which may affect our operations. To date, we have not received any complaints from any regulatory authorities.
