ITEM 1. BUSINESS
The Company
 
We are a leading metals service center that operates in three reportable segments; carbon flat products, specialty metals flat products, and tubular and pipe products.  We provide metals processing and distribution services for a wide range of customers.  Our carbon flat products segment’s focus is on the direct sale and distribution of large volumes of processed carbon and coated flat-rolled sheet, coil and plate products and fabricated parts.  Our specialty metals flat products segment’s focus is on the direct sale and distribution of processed aluminum and stainless flat-rolled sheet and coil products, flat bar products and fabricated parts.  Through the acquisition of Berlin Metals, LLC (Berlin Metals) on April 2, 2018, our specialty metals flat products segment expanded its product offerings to include differing types of stainless flat-rolled sheet and coil and prime tin mill products.  In addition, we distribute metal tubing, pipe, bar, valves and fittings and fabricate pressure parts supplied to various industrial markets through our tubular and pipe products segment.  Products that require more value-added processing generally have a higher gross profit.  Accordingly, our overall gross profit is affected by, among other things, product mix, the amount of processing performed, the demand for and availability of metals, and volatility in selling prices and material purchase costs.  We also perform toll processing of customer-owned metals. We sell certain products internationally, primarily in Canada and Mexico.  International sales are immaterial to our consolidated financial results and to the individual segments’ results.
 
We are incorporated under the laws of the State of Ohio. Our executive offices are located at 22901 Millcreek Boulevard, Suite 650, Highland Hills, Ohio 44122. Our telephone number is (216) 292-3800, and our website address is www.olysteel.com. We are not including the information on our website as a part of, or incorporating it by reference into, this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 

Industry Overview 
 
The metals industry is comprised of three types of entities: metals producers, intermediate metals processors and metals service centers. Metals producers have historically emphasized the sale of metals to volume purchasers and have generally viewed intermediate metals processors and metals service centers as part of their customer base. However, all three types of entities can compete for certain customers who purchase large quantities of metals. Intermediate metals processors tend to serve as processors in large quantities for metals producers and major industrial consumers of processed metals, including automobile and appliance manufacturers.
 
Services provided by metals service centers can range from storage and distribution of unprocessed metal products to complex, precision value-added metals processing. Metals service centers respond directly to customer needs and emphasize value-added processing of metals pursuant to specific customer demands, such as cutting-to-length, slitting, shearing, roll forming, shape correction and surface improvement, blanking, tempering, plate burning and stamping. These processes produce metals to specified lengths, widths, shapes and surface characteristics through the use of specialized equipment. Metals service centers typically have lower cost structures than, and provide services and value-added processing not otherwise available from, metals producers.
 
End product manufacturers and other metals users seek to purchase metals on shorter lead times and with more frequent and reliable deliveries than can normally be provided by metals producers. Metals service centers generally have lower labor costs than metals producers and consequently process metals on a more cost-effective basis. In addition, due to this lower cost structure, metals service centers are able to handle orders in quantities smaller than would be economical for metals producers. The benefits to customers purchasing products from metals service centers include lower inventory levels, lower overall cost of raw materials, more timely response and decreased manufacturing time and expense. Customers also benefit from a lower investment in production labor, buildings and equipment, which allows them to focus on the engineering, assembly and marketing of their products. We believe that customers’ demands for just-in-time delivery have made the value-added inventory, processing and delivery functions performed by metals service centers increasingly important.

Corporate History
 
Our company was founded in 1954 by the Siegal family as a general steel service center. In the late 1980s, our business strategy changed from a focus on warehousing and distributing steel from a single facility with no major processing equipment to a focus on geographic and product growth, customer diversity and value-added processing. An integral part of our growth has been the acquisition and start-up of processing and sales operations, and the investment in processing equipment. In 1994, we completed an initial public offering and, in 1996, we completed a follow-on offering of our common stock.
 
In July 2011, we acquired Chicago Tube and Iron, or CTI, a private leading distributor of tubing, pipe, bar, valves, and fittings, which represents our tubular and pipe products segment, and in April 2018, we acquired the net assets of Berlin Metals.
 
Michael Siegal, the son of one of our founders, began his career with us in the early 1970s and served as our Chief Executive Officer from 1984 until the end of 2018. Effective January 1, 2019, Mr. Siegal began serving as our Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors and Richard T. Marabito began serving as our Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Marabito joined us in 1994 as Corporate Controller and had served as our Chief Financial Officer since 2000. On January 1, 2019, Rich Manson began serving as our Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Manson has served in various capacities at our company since 1996. David Wolfort, our President, joined us as General Manager in 1984. Andrew Greiff, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer joined us in 2009 and managed our rapidly expanding specialty metals business.
 

Business Strategy and Objectives
 
We believe that the metals service center and processing industry is driven by the following primary trends: (i) shift by customers to fewer suppliers that are larger and financially strong; (ii) increased customer demand for more frequent deliveries, higher quality products and services; and (iii) globalization of metals industry participants.
 
In recognition of these industry trends, our focus has been on achieving profitable geographic and product growth through the start-up and acquisition of service centers, processors, fabricators and related businesses, and investments in people, information systems, higher value-added processing equipment and services, while continuing our commitment to expanding and improving our operating efficiencies, sales and servicing efforts.
 
We are focused on specific operating objectives including: (i) managing inventory turnover; (ii) managing operating expenses; (iii) maintaining targeted cash turnover rates; (iv) investing in value-added processing and material handling equipment to help us grow our margins and returns; (v) growing our market share; (vi) investing in technology and business information systems; (vii) improving safety performance; and (viii) improving on-time delivery and quality performance for our customers.
 
These operating objectives are supported by:
 

● | A set of core values, which are communicated, practiced and measured throughout the Company. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Our “flawless execution” program (Fe), which is an internal recognition program that rewards employees who achieve profitable growth by delivering superior customer service and exceeding customer expectations.
● | Operational initiatives designed to improve efficiencies and reduce costs by improving three key sub-systems: 


● | Operating system: Focused on continuously improving processes through waste and variation elimination using Lean Six Sigma tools and employee certifications.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Cultural system: Focused on creating the environment to facilitate change and improve the way we work and create value. 


● | Management system: Focused on creating the measurements and governance structure to support continuous improvement.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Information systems and key metric reporting to focus managers on achieving specific operating objectives. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Alignment of compensation with the financial objectives and performance of the Company and the achievement of specific financial and operating objectives.

 
We believe our depth of management, facilities, locations, processing capabilities, inventory, focus on safety, quality and customer service, extensive and experienced sales force, and the strength of our customer and supplier relationships provide a strong foundation for implementation of our strategy and achievement of our objectives. Certain elements of our strategy are set forth in more detail below.
 
Investments and Acquisitions. Historically, we have accelerated our growth through acquisitions and capital investments in facilities and processing equipment. During 2017, we created a new position, Vice President of Strategic Development, whose focus is on profitable growth opportunities, including acquisitions. When the results of sales and marketing efforts and our financial justifications indicate that there is sufficient customer demand for a particular product, process or service, we may purchase equipment to satisfy that demand. We also evaluate our existing equipment to ensure that it remains productive, and we upgrade, replace, redeploy or dispose of equipment when necessary. We invest in processing equipment to support customer demand and to respond to the growing trend among original equipment manufacturers (our customers) to outsource non-core production processes, such as plate processing, machining, welding and fabrication, in order to concentrate on engineering, design and assembly.

On April 2, 2018, we acquired substantially all of the net assets of Berlin Metals, based in Hammond, Indiana. Berlin Metals was founded in 1967 and is one of the largest North American service centers processing and distributing prime tin mill products and stainless steel strip in slit coil form. Berlin Metals is also a supplier of galvanized, light gauge cold rolled sheet and strip and other coated metals in coil forms, to customers in the building products, automotive and specialized industrial markets.
 
In addition to the acquisition of Berlin Metals, our capital investments during the past three years have primarily consisted of a building and equipment expansion in Chicago, building improvements across existing facilities, a slitter for our specialty metals flat products segment, a stretcher leveling line as well as other processing equipment for our expanded value-added customer base in Winder, Georgia, added tube and pipe distribution capabilities from our Locust, North Carolina facility, and additional processing equipment for all three of our segments. 
 
On January 2, 2019, we acquired substantially all of the net assets of McCullough Industries (McCullough), based in Kenton, Ohio. McCullough is a manufacturer of self-dumping hoppers used in a variety of industrial applications. The downstream vertical integration of McCullough represents our first acquisition of a manufacturer of metal-intensive branded products, which allows us to deploy our purchasing, logistics and processing expertise to achieve synergies, expand margins and increase returns.
 
Sales and Marketing. We believe that our commitments to quality, service, just-in-time delivery and field sales personnel have enabled us to build and maintain strong customer relationships. We continuously analyze our customer base to ensure that strategic customers are properly targeted and serviced, while focusing our efforts to supply and successfully service multi-location customers from multi-location Olympic facilities. We service certain customers with carbon and specialty metals flat products and tubular and pipe products through cross-stocking of products in certain facilities.
 
We offer business solutions to our customers through value-added and value-engineered services. We also provide inventory stocking programs and in-plant Olympic Steel employees located at certain customer locations to help reduce customers’ costs. Our owned truck fleet further enhances our just-in-time deliveries based on our customers’ requirements.
 
Our flawless execution (Fe) program is a commitment to provide superior customer service while striving to exceed customer expectations. This program includes tracking on-time delivery and quality performance against objectives, and recognition of employee initiatives to improve efficiencies, streamline processes or reduce operating expenses at each operation.
 
We believe our large and experienced sales force provides strategic advantages. Our sales force makes direct daily sales calls to customers throughout the continental United States, Canada and Mexico. The continuous interaction between our sales force and active and prospective customers provides us with valuable market information and sales opportunities, including opportunities for outsourcing, improving customer service and increasing sales.
 
Our sales efforts are further supported by metallurgists, engineers, technical and quality service personnel and product specialists who have specific expertise in carbon and stainless steel, aluminum, alloy plate and steel fabrication as well as tubular and pipe products. Our services for certain customers also include integration into our internal business systems to provide cost efficiencies for both us and our customers.
 
Management. We believe one of our strengths is the depth, knowledge and experience of our management team. In addition to our executive officers, members of our senior management team have a diversity of backgrounds within the metals industry, including management positions at metals producers and other metals service centers. They average 28 years of experience in the metals industry and 18 years with our company. Effective January 1, 2019, we executed a succession plan which allowed us to further enhance our management team by the promotions of several employees to executive management positions within the organization.

Products, Processing Services and Quality Standards
 
We maintain inventory of carbon, stainless and aluminum coil, plate and sheet products, and tubular and pipe products. Coil is in the form of a continuous sheet, typically 36 to 96 inches wide, between 0.015 and 0.625 inches thick, and rolled into 10 to 30 ton coils. Because of the size and weight of these coils and the equipment required to move and process them into smaller sizes, such coils do not meet the requirements, without further processing, of most customers. Plate is typically thicker than coil and is processed by laser, plasma or oxygen burning. Through our acquisition of Berlin Metals, the specialty metals flat products segment expanded its product offerings to include differing types of stainless flat-rolled sheet and coil and prime tin mill products.
 
Through our CTI subsidiary, we maintain inventory of round, square, and rectangular mechanical and structural tubing; hydraulic and stainless tubing; boiler tubing; carbon, stainless, and aluminum pipe; and valves and fittings. CTI provides a variety of value added services to its tube and pipe product line, including saw cutting, laser cutting, beveling, threading and grooving. CTI also fabricates pressure components supplied to various industrial markets.   
 
Customer orders are entered or electronically transmitted into computerized order entry systems, and appropriate inventory is selected and scheduled for processing in accordance with the customer’s specified delivery date. We attempt to maximize yield and equipment efficiency through the use of computer software and by combining customer orders for processing each coil, plate, tube or pipe to the fullest extent practicable.
 
Our services include both traditional service center processes of cutting-to-length, slitting, flattening, sawing and shearing and higher value-added processes of blanking, tempering, plate burning, laser cutting, precision machining, welding, fabricating, bending, beveling, polishing, kitting and painting to process metals to specified lengths, widths and shapes pursuant to specific customer orders. Cutting-to-length involves cutting metal along the width of the coil. Slitting involves cutting metal to specified widths along the length of the coil. Shearing is the process of cutting sheet metal. Blanking cuts the metal into specific shapes with close tolerances. Tempering improves the uniformity of the thickness and flatness of the metals through a cold rolling process. Plate and laser processing is the process of cutting metal into specific shapes and sizes. Our forming activities include bending metal. Our machining activities include drilling, milling, tapping, boring and sawing. Tube processing includes tube bending and end finishing. Finishing activities include shot blasting, grinding, edging and polishing. Our fabrication activities include machining, welding, assembly and painting of component parts.
 
The flat products segment is separated into two reportable segments; carbon flat products and specialty metals flat products. The flat products segments’ assets and resources are shared by the carbon and specialty metals segments and both segments’ products are, in some instances, stored in the shared facilities and processed on the shared equipment.
 
The following table sets forth, as of December 31, 2018, the major pieces of processing equipment in operation by segment:
 

Processing Equipment | Consolidated Flat Products | | Tubular and Pipe Products | | Total
---------------------+----------------------------+-----+---------------------------+-----+------
Tempering | | 3 | | - | | 3 
Stretcher-leveling | | 2 | | - | | 2 
Cutting-to-length | | 14 | | 13 | | 27 
Slitting | | 15 | | - | | 15 
Shearing | | 7 | | - | | 7 
Blanking | | 4 | | - | | 4 
Plate processing | | 23 | | - | | 23

Tube processing | | 2 | | 39 | | 41 
Finishing | | 28 | | 3 | | 31 
Total | | 179 | | 150 | | 329

 
Our quality assurance system, led by certified specialists and engineers, establishes controls and procedures covering all aspects of our products from the time the material is ordered through receipt, processing and shipment to the customer. These controls and procedures encompass periodic supplier and customer audits, workshops with customers, inspection equipment and criteria, preventative actions, traceability and certification. We have quality testing labs at several of our facilities, including at our temper mill facilities in Cleveland, Ohio and Bettendorf, Iowa.

In addition, 26 of our facilities have earned International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 9001:2015 certifications.  CTI has earned The American Society of Mechanical Engineers S Certification and The National Board of Boiler & Pressure Vessel Inspectors R Certification.  Our office building in Winder, Georgia has received Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification. 
Customers and Distribution
 
We have a diverse customer and geographic base, which helps to reduce the inherent risk and cyclicality of our business.  Net sales to our top three customers, in the aggregate, approximated 8%, 8% and 9% of our consolidated net sales in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.  We serve customers in metals consuming industries, including manufacturers and fabricators of transportation and material handling lift equipment, construction, mining and farm equipment, storage tanks, environmental and energy generation equipment, automobiles, food service and electrical equipment, military vehicles and equipment, as well as general and plate fabricators and metals service centers.  The table below shows the percentage of our consolidated net sales to the largest industries for the past three years.

Industry | 2018 | | | 2017 | | 2016
-----------------------------------------------------------------------+------+----+---+------+----+-----
Industrial machinery and equipment manufacturers and their fabricators | | 48 | % | | 51 | % | 51 | %
Residential and commercial construction | | 13 | % | | 9 | % | 8 | %
Metals service centers | | 10 | % | | 11 | % | 10 | %
Automobile manufacturers and their suppliers | | 10 | % | | 9 | % | 10 | %
Transportation equipment manufacturers | | 8 | % | | 6 | % | 6 | %
All others <5% | | 11 | % | | 14 | % | 15 | %

 
While we ship products throughout the United States, most of our customers are located in the midwestern, eastern and southern regions of the United States. Most customers are located within a 250-mile radius of one of our processing facilities, thus enabling an efficient delivery system capable of handling a high frequency of short lead time orders. We transport our products directly to customers via our in-house truck fleet, which further supports the just-in-time delivery requirements of our customers, and third-party trucking firms. Products sold to foreign customers, which have been immaterial to our consolidated results, are shipped either directly from metals producers to the customer or to an intermediate processor, and then to the customer by rail, truck or ocean carrier. Through our facility in Monterrey, Mexico, we are able to stock material and service our customers in that country with shorter lead times.
 
We process our metals to specific customer orders as well as for stocking programs. Many of our larger customers commit to purchase on a regular basis at agreed upon or indexed prices for periods ranging from three to twelve months. To help mitigate price volatility risks, these price commitments are generally matched with corresponding supply arrangements, or to a lesser degree by commodities hedging. Customers notify us of specific release dates as processed products are required. Customers typically notify us of release dates anywhere from a just-in-time basis to one month before the release date. Therefore, we are required to carry sufficient inventory to meet the short lead time and just-in-time delivery requirements of our customers. CTI produces pressure parts and other fabricated components primarily for industrial boiler applications. These products typically take several months to produce due to their size and complexity. Due to the time required for production, we may require progress payments throughout the construction period.
 
The current global economic environment has resulted in increased supply chain scrutiny by our customers and potential customers. We believe our size, geographic footprint, financial position, dedication to a field sales force, and our focus on quality and customer service are advantageous in maintaining our customer base and in securing new customers.
 

Raw Materials
 
Our principal raw materials are carbon, coated, and stainless steel and aluminum, in the forms of pipe, tube, flat rolled sheet, coil and plate that we typically purchase from multiple primary metals producers. The metals industry as a whole is cyclical and at times pricing and availability of material can be volatile due to numerous factors beyond our control, including general domestic and global economic conditions, domestic and global supply and demand imbalance, competition, quickly changing lead times and late deliveries from metals producers, fluctuations in the costs of raw materials necessary to produce metals, import duties and tariffs and currency exchange rates. This volatility can significantly affect the availability and cost of raw materials to us.
Page 8



Inventory management is a key profitability driver in the metals service center industry. Similar to many other metals service centers, we maintain substantial inventories of metals to accommodate the short lead times and just-in-time delivery requirements of our customers. Accordingly, we purchase metals in an effort to maintain our inventory at levels that we believe to be appropriate to satisfy the anticipated needs of our customers based upon historic buying practices, purchase commitments with customers and market conditions.
 
Our commitments to purchase metals are generally at prevailing market prices in effect at the time we place our orders. During the past three years, we have entered into pass through nickel and carbon swaps at the request of our customers in order to mitigate our customers’ risk of volatility in the price of metals. The swaps are settled with the brokers at maturity and the economic benefit or loss arising from the changes in fair value of the swaps is contractually passed through to the customer.
 
We have no long-term, fixed-price metals purchase contracts, except for commodity hedges. When metals prices decline, customer demands for lower prices and our competitors’ responses to those demands could result in lower sale prices and, consequently, lower gross profits and earnings as we use existing metals inventory. When metals prices increase, competitive conditions will influence how much of the price increase we can pass on to our customers.
 

Suppliers
 
We concentrate on developing supply relationships with high-quality domestic and international metals producers, using a coordinated effort to be the customer of choice for business critical suppliers. We employ sourcing strategies that maximize the quality, production lead times and transportation economies of a global supply base. We are an important customer of flat-rolled coil and plate, pipe and tube for many of our principal suppliers, but we are not dependent on any one supplier. We purchase in bulk from metals producers in quantities that are efficient for such producers. This enables us to maintain a continued source of supply at what we believe to be competitive prices. We believe the access to our facilities and equipment, and our high quality customer services and solutions, combined with our long-standing and continuous prompt pay practices, will continue to be an important factor in maintaining strong relationships with metals suppliers.
 
The metals producing supply base has experienced significant consolidation, with a few suppliers accounting for a majority of the domestic carbon steel market. We purchased approximately 52% and 53% of our total metals requirements from our three largest suppliers in 2018 and 2017, respectively. Although we have no long-term supply commitments, we believe we have good relationships with our metals suppliers. If, in the future, we are unable to obtain sufficient amounts of metals on a timely basis, we may not be able to obtain metals from alternate sources at competitive prices. In addition, interruptions or reductions in our supply of metals could make it difficult to satisfy our customers’ just-in-time delivery requirements, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
 

Competition
 
Our principal markets are highly competitive. We compete with other regional and national metals service centers, single location service centers and, to a certain degree, metals producers and intermediate metals processors on a regional basis. We have different competitors for each of our products and within each region. We compete on the basis of price, product selection and availability, customer service, value-added capabilities, quality, financial strength and geographic proximity. Certain of our competitors have greater financial and operating resources than we have.
 
With the exception of certain Canadian or Mexican operations, foreign-located metals service centers are generally not a material competitive factor in our principal domestic markets.
 

Management Information Systems 
 
Information systems are an important component of our strategy. We have invested in technologies and human resources as a foundation for growth.  We depend on our Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems for financial reporting, management decision-making, inventory management, order tracking and fulfillment and production optimization.  We continue to upgrade and consolidate our systems for optimal use of resources and to assure we are taking advantage of technology offerings.
Page 9



Our information systems focus on the following core application areas:
 
Inventory Management.  Our information systems track the status, quantity and cost of inventories by product, location and process on a daily basis.  This information is essential to optimize management of inventory.
Differentiated Services To Customers.  Our information systems support value-added services to customers, including quality control and on-time delivery monitoring and reporting, just-in-time inventory management and shipping services.
 
E-Commerce and Advanced Customer Interaction.  We are actively participating in electronic commerce initiatives to reduce processing cost and time.  In addition to full electronic data interchange (EDI) capabilities with our customers and vendors, we also have implemented extranet sites for specific customers which are integrated with our internal business systems. 
System and Process Enhancements. We have completed development of business system solutions to replace our legacy information systems and have successfully implemented new ERP systems at most of our locations. We continue to implement these systems to provide standardized business processes, enhanced inventory management, production cost, and sales administrative controls, and reduced technical support requirements. Our business analysts work with our quality team to identify opportunities for efficiency and improved customer service. We collaborate across the metal supply chain, working with metals producers, service providers, customers, and industry-sponsored organizations to develop industry processing standards to drive cost out of the supply chain.
 
Information security and continuous availability of information processing are of highest priority. Our information professionals employ proven security and monitoring practices and tools to mitigate cyber-security risks and threats. In case of physical emergency or threat, our ERP systems, accounting systems, internet and communications systems are duplicated at a secure off-site computing facility or through secure, multi-site cloud providers, with migration of our other systems which are in progress.
 

Employees
 
At December 31, 2018, we employed approximately 1,820 people. Approximately 315 of the hourly plant personnel are represented by nine separate collective bargaining units. The table below shows the expiration dates of the collective bargaining agreements.

Facility | Expiration date 
-----------------------------+-------------------
Hammond, Indiana | November 30, 2019 
Locust, North Carolina | March 4, 2020 
Romeoville, Illinois | May 31, 2020 
Minneapolis coil, Minnesota | September 30, 2020
Indianapolis, Indiana | January 29, 2021 
St. Paul, Minnesota | May 25, 2021 
Milan, Illinois | August 12, 2021 
Minneapolis plate, Minnesota | March 31, 2022 
Detroit, Michigan | August 31, 2022 

 
We have never experienced a work stoppage and we believe that our relationship with employees is good. However, any prolonged work stoppages by our personnel represented by collective bargaining units could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

Service Marks, Trade Names and Patents
 
We conduct our business under the name “Olympic Steel.” A provision of federal law grants exclusive rights to the word “Olympic” to the U.S. Olympic Committee. The U.S. Supreme Court has recognized, however, that certain users may continue to use the word based on long-term and continuous use. We have used the name Olympic Steel since 1954, but are prevented from registering the name “Olympic” and from being qualified to do business as a foreign corporation under that name in certain states. In such states, we have registered under different names, including “Oly Steel” and “Olympia Steel.” Our wholly-owned subsidiary, Olympic Steel Lafayette, Inc., does business in certain states under the names “Olympic Steel Detroit,” “Lafayette Steel and Processing” and “Lafayette Steel.” Our wholly-owned subsidiary, Olympic Steel Iowa, Inc. does business in certain states under the name “Oly Steel Iowa, Inc.”. Our North Carolina operation conducted business under the name “Olympic Steel North Carolina.” Our Integrity Stainless operation conducts business under the name “Integrity Stainless”. Our CTI operation conducts business under the name “CTI Power.” Our operation in Monterrey, Mexico operates under the name “Metales de Olympic S. de.R.L. de C.V.” We operate under the name “Berlin Metals” through our B Metals, Inc. subsidiary.
 
We also hold a trademark for our stainless steel sheet and plate product “OLY-FLATBRITE,” which has a unique combination of surface finish and flatness.
 

Government Regulation
 
Our operations are governed by many laws and regulations, including those relating to workplace safety and worker health, principally the Occupational Safety and Health Act and regulations thereunder. We believe that we are in material compliance with these laws and regulations and do not believe that future compliance with such laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
Environmental
 
Our facilities are subject to certain federal, state and local requirements relating to the protection of the environment. We believe that we are in material compliance with all environmental laws, do not anticipate any material expenditures to meet environmental requirements and do not believe that compliance with such laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
Seasonality
 
Seasonal factors may cause demand fluctuations within the year which could impact our results of operations. Typically, demand in the first half of the year is stronger than the second half of the year, as it contains more ship days and is not impacted by the seasonal shut-downs in July, November and December due to holidays.
Effects of Inflation
 
Inflation generally affects us by increasing the cost of employee wages and benefits, transportation services, processing equipment, purchased metals, energy and borrowings under our credit facility. General inflation, excluding increases in the price of metals and increased labor and distribution expense, has not had a material effect on our financial results during the past three years.
Backlog
 
Because we conduct our operations generally on the basis of short-term orders, we do not believe that backlog is a material or meaningful indicator of future performance.
