Overview 
We are a medical device company that has pioneered a proprietary minimally invasive surgical implant system, which we call iFuse, to fuse the sacroiliac joint to treat sacroiliac joint dysfunction that often causes severe lower back pain. Since we introduced iFuse in 2009, more than 37,000 procedures have been performed by over 1,800 surgeons, in the United States and 33 other countries. Published clinical studies have shown that 15% to 30% of all chronic lower back pain is associated with the sacroiliac joint. We believe iFuse is currently used in the majority of minimally invasive surgical fusions of the sacroiliac joint in the United States. 
The two sacroiliac joints are the largest joints in the body and connect the sacrum, near the base of the spine, to the iliac bones, the two major bones of the pelvis. The iFuse system includes a series of patented triangular implants, the instruments we have developed to enable the procedure, as well as the diagnostic and surgical techniques we have developed to enable physicians to perform the procedure. We introduced our second generation implant, the iFuse-3D, in 2017. We market our products with a direct sales force and a number of distributors in the United States, and with a combination of a direct sales force and distributors in other countries. 
Our growth rate has recently increased, which we attribute in part to more widespread insurance coverage for sacroiliac fusion procedures, with many recent positive payor coverage policies exclusive to our iFuse system, as well as our efforts to educate the market regarding sacroiliac dysfunction. Since January 1, 2018, because of the strength of published clinical evidence on iFuse, 31 U.S. payors have published reimbursement policies exclusively covering the patented triangular design of our iFuse implants and excluding coverage of other products that are intended to fuse the sacroiliac joint. We believe that the full impact of each exclusive coverage decision grows over time as we continue to educate surgeons about the coverage and the medical criteria they need to follow, and train them on the diagnosis and how to perform the iFuse procedure. 
In 2018 and 2017, we generated revenue of $55.4 million and $48.0 million, respectively, a growth rate of 15%, and incurred net losses of $17.5 million and $23.0 million, respectively. Our gross margins were 91% and 89% for 2018 and 2017, respectively. The number of iFuse procedures performed in 2018 and 2017 was 6,659 and 5,739 respectively. 
Our implants have a triangular cross section, which resists twisting of the implant within the bone in which it is implanted, helping stabilize the joint even before fixation of the bone onto the implant, or bony ingrowth, which results in fusion. Products from our competitors use screws to treat the sacroiliac joint, which do not resist twisting within the bone as well as our patented triangular implants. A study we performed showed that our iFuse implants have more than six times the rotation resistance of a screw designed for sacroiliac joint fusion. We hold issued patents on implants with cross-sections of many non-round shapes, including the triangular shape we use for iFuse. We also hold issued patents for the method of placing those implants across the sacroiliac joint, as well as other parts of the spine and pelvis. Each titanium iFuse implant is at least three times the strength of a typical eight-millimeter surgical screw and the larger porous surface area of our implants allows for bony ingrowth. Three of our implants are typically used in each procedure. 
The safety, clinical effectiveness, durability of pain relief and reduction in disability, cost effectiveness, and reduction in opioid users that result from iFuse are supported by a large number of studies that have resulted in more than 60 published papers. Several of these papers publish results from three prospective multicenter studies (INSITE, SIFI, and iMIA), two of which were randomized controlled clinical trials. Additionally, there have been several studies showing longer-term follow-up of up to six years.

• | INSITE is a randomized controlled study conducted in the United States. Positive 24-month follow-up results were published in August 2016 in the International Journal of Spine Surgery showing statistically significant and clinically important reduction in pain and disability after sacroiliac joint fusion but very little response to maximal non-surgical treatment. In April 2015, INSITE was awarded the “Best Overall Paper” out of approximately 450 submitted clinical study papers at the International Society for Advancement of Spine Surgery, or ISASS, conference
• | iMIA is a randomized controlled study conducted in Europe. Positive 24-month results were published in March 2019 in The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery. Like INSITE, results from iMIA show statistically significant and clinically profound reduction in pain and disability after SI joint fusion but little improvement after non-surgical treatment. 
• | SIFI is a single-arm study conducted in the United States. Positive 24-month follow-up results were published in the International Journal of Spine Surgery in April 2016, showing substantial and sustained reduction in pain and disability. 
• | LOIS is a prospective follow-on study, enrolling subjects at a subset of INSITE and SIFI sites treated with iFuse. Study outcomes at four years were published in July 2018 in Medical Devices: Evidence and Research. Among 103 enrolled subjects, mean sacroiliac joint pain at three years decreased from 82 preoperatively to 28 (a 54-point improvement from baseline, p<.0001). 
• | A study in Neurosurgery published in April 2017 showed similar improvements in pain and disability in patients followed for up to six years. The study also showed a substantial reduction in the number of subjects using opioids in patients treated with iFuse at their last follow-up visit. At the last follow-up visit, 84% of patients who received non-surgical management were using opioids, while only 7% of patients treated with iFuse were using opioids. 

The INSITE clinical trial included 148 subjects treated at 19 centers in the United States, with subjects randomized in a two-to-one ratio to either immediate sacroiliac joint fusion with iFuse or non-surgical management. The study design allowed subjects in the non-surgical management group to cross over and have surgery after six months. By 24 months after the start of the clinical trial, 89% of the non-surgical management group subjects still participating in the trial had elected to cross over to have the iFuse procedure, primarily because they derived little clinical benefit from non-surgical treatments. The study’s results can be summarized as follows: 

• | Reduction in Pain. There was a statistically significant and clinically important pain reduction in subjects treated with iFuse as compared to very small responses in those treated with non-surgical management. Subjects surgically treated with iFuse had mean 52- 54- and 55-point reductions in sacroiliac joint pain at 6, 12 and 24 months, respectively, as measured by the VAS. By contrast, subjects in the non-surgical management group had only a mean 12-point reduction (p<0.0001) at six months. 12 points is below the commonly accepted 20-point threshold for clinically important improvement. In addition, the non-surgical management group subjects who elected after six months to cross over to have the iFuse procedure had pain reduction similar to that seen in subjects originally assigned to sacroiliac joint fusion with iFuse. At 24 months, the proportion of subjects with a reduction in VAS sacroiliac joint pain of 20 or more points due to the assigned treatment only was 83% in the iFuse group and 10% in the non-surgical management group. 
• | Reduction in Disability. There was a statistically significant and clinically important reduction in disability in subjects treated with iFuse as compared to very little response in those treated with non-surgical management. Subjects surgically treated with iFuse had a mean 27-point reduction in disability at six months, on the 0–100 Oswestry Disability Index, or ODI, while subjects in the non-surgical management group had only a mean five-point reduction (p<0.0001). Five points is less than the commonly accepted 15-point threshold to denote a clinically important response. At 24 months, the iFuse group had a mean 28-point reduction in ODI. At six months, the proportion of subjects with ODI improvements of at least 15 points was 72.5% with iFuse treatment and only 13.0% in those undergoing non-surgical management (p<0.0001 for difference in response rate). In addition, the subjects who elected after six months to cross over to have the iFuse procedure had similar reduction in disability as the subjects originally assigned to sacroiliac joint fusion with iFuse. At 24 months, the proportion of subjects with an ODI improvement of at least 15 points with the assigned treatment only was 68.2% and 7.5% in the iFuse and non-surgical management groups, respectively (p<0.0001 for difference in response rate). These are very large differences.

Patients from certain sites participating in the INSITE study will be followed for up to five years as part of LOIS, a separate long-term study.

Surgical revision rate is an important measurement of a treatment’s effectiveness for patients. Studies on lumbar, or lower back, fusion, a different type of spine procedure from iFuse, have shown revision rates as approximately 12%. A study published in Medical Devices: Evidence and Research in November 2015 showed that the cumulative four-year revision rate with iFuse was 3.5%. A single surgeon retrospective study published in the International Journal of Spine Surgery in January 2017 showed that the cumulative four-year revision rate for screw-based treatment of the sacroiliac joint was five times higher than the cumulative four-year revision rate for iFuse. 
Market Opportunity 
We estimate that over 30 million American adults have chronic lower back pain. For patients whose chronic lower back pain stems from the sacroiliac joint, our experience in both clinical trials and commercial settings indicates that iFuse could be beneficial for at least 30% of patients who are properly diagnosed and screened for surgery by trained healthcare providers. Approximately 282,000 patients in the United States were estimated to have received multiple non-surgical steroid injections for sacroiliac joint pain in 2018. Based on our market experience and internal estimates, and the assumption that the average person suffering from sacroiliac joint dysfunction has been in pain for five years, we estimate that the potential market for iFuse in the United States could be 279,000 patients annually, for a potential annual market in the United States of approximately $2.7 billion. While we have made significant inroads at penetrating this market, U.S. patients received only 5,094 iFuse procedures in 2018. 
Patients with sacroiliac joint dysfunction may experience debilitating pain. We believe that the sacroiliac joint is the last major joint to be addressed by the orthopedic implant industry. Studies have shown that the disability that results from disease of the sacroiliac joint is comparable to the disability associated with a number of other serious orthopedic conditions, such as knee and hip arthritis and degenerative disc disease, each of which has surgical solutions where an implant is used and a multi-billion dollar market exists. 
Frequently, sacroiliac joint patients are aging and/or may have experienced one or more of the following events that have contributed to disruption or degeneration of the sacroiliac joint: falls, previous lumbar surgery, automobile accidents, and/or pregnancies. We believe that Americans spend approximately $85.9 billion per year on spine problems and that approximately 65% of people who suffer from sacroiliac pain are women. In the United States, iFuse is intended for sacroiliac joint fusion for conditions including sacroiliac joint dysfunction that is a direct result of sacroiliac joint disruption and degenerative sacroiliitis. This includes conditions whose symptoms began during pregnancy or in the peripartum period and have persisted postpartum for more than six months. In all other countries where iFuse is available commercially, the system is indicated for sacroiliac joint fusion. 
Diagnosis 
It is often difficult to identify the source of lower back pain. As a result, some surgical procedures performed on the spine have a sub-optimal success rate. For example, published studies of lumbar fusion have shown success rates of only approximately 60%. Unsuccessful spine surgery may result in failed back surgery syndrome, which has been shown to result in high healthcare costs with poor overall relief of pain. Published studies have shown that the sacroiliac joint is a cause of the pain in 32% to 43% of patients who have previously had lumbar fusion surgery and are experiencing recurrent low back pain. We believe low success rates of lumbar fusion are likely related, in many cases, to failure to diagnose the sacroiliac joint as the correct cause of pain. 
Since we launched iFuse, we have made considerable investments in teaching healthcare professionals to accurately diagnose sacroiliac joint disorders. We provide instruction and training on how to perform the provocative maneuvers in a physician’s office that can help establish the sacroiliac joint as the source of pain. If provocative tests are positive, surgeons confirm the diagnosis by injecting a small amount of local anesthetic into the joint under fluoroscopic guidance. The sacroiliac joint is confirmed as a pain source if the local anesthetic produces immediate and significant pain reduction. In addition to the differentiated characteristics of our iFuse procedure and triangular iFuse implants, we believe that more accurate diagnosis is part of the reason for the high success and patient satisfaction rates of the iFuse procedure. 
Surgical Treatment of Sacroiliac Joint Disease 
Patients with sacroiliac joint dysfunction or sacroiliac joint arthritis frequently experience significant pain simply from sitting, standing, or rolling over in bed. These activities result in small movements of the sacroiliac joints and pressure transferred across the joints. The pain can be exacerbated with activity—when a patient walks or runs, for example, the shock from each step is transmitted up the leg, through the iliac bones of the pelvis to the sacroiliac joint. The initial goal in fusion of the sacroiliac joint is to immediately stabilize the joint which very quickly decreases the pain. Following initial stabilization of the sacroiliac joint, the goal is to permanently fuse the joint. We believe our proprietary triangular implants stabilize the joint better and more quickly than competing technologies such as screws.

Surgical fusion of the sacroiliac joint with an open surgical technique was first reported in 1908, with further reports in the 1920s. The open procedure uses plates and screws, requires a 6- to 12-inch incision and is extremely invasive. The iFuse procedure involves a 1- to 2-inch incision and is much less invasive. For these reasons, we believe that open surgery for elective sacroiliac joint fusion has become less common in the United States since we introduced iFuse. 
Due to its invasiveness, pain, long recovery time, and infrequent use, the open sacroiliac joint fusion procedure was rarely taught in medical school or residency programs. Prior to our launch of iFuse, most spine surgeons were unfamiliar with the sacroiliac joint and had never performed a sacroiliac joint fusion. As a result, when patients presented with lower back pain, spine surgeons often did not include evaluation of the sacroiliac joint in their diagnostic work-up. Surgeons who did recognize the condition typically told their patients they had nothing to offer surgically. 
Non-Surgical Treatment of Sacroiliac Joint Disease 
Although a number of non-surgical treatments exist for sacroiliac joint pain, they did not provide the level of pain or disability relief seen with the iFuse procedure for the patients participating in the INSITE study. Non-surgical treatments include: 

• | Medical therapy, including opiates and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications. 
• | Physical therapy, which can involve exercises as well as massage. 
• | Intra-articular injections of steroid medications, which are typically performed by physicians who specialize in pain treatment or anesthesia.
• | Radiofrequency ablation, or the cauterizing, of the lateral branches of the sacral nerve roots. 

Our Solution—The iFuse Implant System 
Our iFuse system, which includes our implants and instruments, is designed to address the shortcomings of alternative treatments, including open surgery, non-surgical management, and screw-based fusion procedures. As shown in the graphic below, our iFuse implants are triangular, and three implants are typically used in each procedure. Our implants are made of titanium and have a porous surface. Each iFuse implant is at least three times the strength of a typical eight-millimeter surgical screw and the large porous surface area allows fixation of the bone to the implants. We introduced the original iFuse implants in 2009, and our second generation iFuse-3D implants in 2017. 
The iFuse procedure is typically performed under general anesthesia. The surgeon uses a custom instrument set we provide to prepare a triangular channel for each implant through the ilium, across the sacroiliac joint, and into the sacrum. An iFuse implant is then pressed into the triangular channel, which is slightly smaller than the implant, creating what is known as an interference fit. The triangular cross section of our iFuse implants, as shown below, prevents them from rotating. Our triangular iFuse implants cross the sacroiliac joint and provide immediate joint stability, which is why we believe pain diminishes soon after the iFuse procedure. Over time, bone grows onto the implants and across the joint, permanently stabilizing or fusing the joint. 
By contrast, open fusion of the sacroiliac joint, as well as the minimally invasive solutions offered by other companies, typically use screws and/or plates for fixation. When placed across the sacroiliac joint, standard orthopedic screws, which lack features to encourage biologic fixation, have an exhibited propensity to rotate and loosen over time. Because of the triangular shape, porous surface, strength, and other differentiating factors of our iFuse implants, we believe that our published clinical data do not apply to other minimally invasive solutions. Little published evidence of safety, clinical effectiveness, durability, or economic utility currently exists for sacroiliac fusion devices other than iFuse. We are unaware of any data to show that our competitors’ sacroiliac joint screws, with features allowing biologic fixation, have a lower rate of loosening than standard orthopedic screws. In addition, placement of plates for open fusion procedures typically requires larger incisions and more invasive dissection, which results in longer recovery times and increased morbidity. We believe that the differences between iFuse and other products, as well as the substantial published 
6

clinical evidence showing the safety and effectiveness of iFuse, are the reason why a growing number of payors have recommended that iFuse be reimbursed for sacroiliac surgery to the exclusion of other technologies that are designed for the procedure. 
Our implants cross the sacroiliac joint and provide immediate stability, which is why we believe pain diminishes soon after the iFuse procedure. Typically, surgeons recommend protected weight-bearing for three weeks. However, post-operative instructions are patient-specific and some patients are allowed to perform weight-bearing activities sooner. Follow-up studies have shown that bony bridging across the sacroiliac joint is present in the majority of cases five years after the iFuse procedure. 
Three implants are used in most iFuse procedures. Each implant bridges across the joint from the iliac bone to the sacrum. Placing each implant requires four basic steps: 

• | Pin. The surgeon inserts a guide pin through the iliac bone, across the sacroiliac joint and into the sacrum. 
• | Drill. Surgeons drill over the guide pin, through the iliac bone, across the sacroiliac joint and just into the sacrum. This step is optional if using the sharp-tip broach. 
• | Broach. The surgeon impacts a triangular broach over the pin which prepares a triangular channel that is slightly smaller than the iFuse implant. 
• | Implant. The surgeon impacts the implant into the triangular channel thereby spanning the sacroiliac joint and docking the implant in the sacrum. The channel is slightly smaller than the implant, which produces an interference fit.

iFuse is a cannulated system, which means that the drill, broach and implants have hollow channels which fit over the pin for guidance purposes. As is typical across the orthopedic implant industry, a member of our team is normally present in the operating suite during surgery to provide technical assistance for the use of iFuse. 
We currently offer three custom instrument sets for surgical placement of iFuse implants in the body. The standard set comprises largely stainless steel materials; the XL (Extra Long) set is the same as the standard set but most instruments are elongated by three inches for treatment of larger patients; and the radiolucent set comprises instruments made with more radiolucent materials, such as PEEK and aluminum to improve visualization under fluoroscopy during an iFuse procedure. We also have instrument sets which have been cleared for use with Medtronic’s surgical navigation system and with the Mazor surgical robot. 
Our Published Studies 
iFuse is the only minimally invasive product for sacroiliac joint fusion commercially available in the United States that, to our knowledge, is supported by substantial high-quality published evidence of safety, clinical effectiveness, durability, and economic utility. 
These benefits are supported by more than 65 published papers (48 of which we financially supported), including two prospective, randomized controlled multi-center clinical trials referred to as “INSITE” and “iMIA” respectively, and a prospective multi-center clinical study referred to as “SIFI.” INSITE 24-month follow-up results were published in August 2016 in International Journal of Spine Surgery. Six-month and one-year summaries were also published in reputable journals. Twenty-four month results from iMIA were published in the March 2019 issue of The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery, a general orthopedics journal. A prospective, follow-on study called “LOIS” tracks certain study participants from INSITE and SIFI for up to five years after their initial surgery. A four-year summary from LOIS was published in Medical Devices Evidence & Research in July 2018. Published results from each of these studies demonstrate clinically important and statistically significant improvement in sacroiliac joint pain, disability due to lower back pain, quality of life, and patient satisfaction. Moreover, the level of published evidence supporting the safety and effectiveness of sacroiliac joint fusion using iFuse is high. 
In the United States, the iFuse Implant System is FDA-cleared with the following indication statement: The iFuse Implant System® is intended for sacroiliac fusion for conditions including sacroiliac joint dysfunction that is a direct result of sacroiliac joint disruption and degenerative sacroiliitis. This includes conditions whose symptoms began during pregnancy or in the peripartum period and have persisted postpartum for more than six months. Clinical studies have demonstrated that treatment with the iFuse Implant System improved pain, patient function, and quality of life. 
iFuse-3D, which was FDA-cleared in 2017, has a very similar indication statement but does not have the statement regarding improvement in pain, function, and quality of life. In the United States, our marketing strategies must adhere to the above statements. In all other countries, the indication statement for the iFuse Implant System (including iFuse-3D) more broadly indicates that the device is indicated for sacroiliac joint fusion.

INSITE Study Design 
INSITE is a prospective multicenter randomized controlled trial conducted in the US. This section describes INSITE in more detail. 
INSITE enrollment took place between January 2013 and May 2014 at 19 sites in the United States. Adults between 21 and 70 years old were eligible to participate if they had a confirmed diagnosis of sacroiliac dysfunction due to degenerative sacroiliitis and/or sacroiliac joint disruption. Diagnosis was based on the subject’s history, provocative tests performed in the surgeon’s office, and at least a 50% decrease in sacroiliac joint pain 30 to 60 minutes after local anesthetic was injected into the joint under image guidance. Eligibility required a sacroiliac VAS pain score of at least 50, where zero represents no pain and 100 represents the worst pain imaginable, as well as a baseline ODI score of at least 30, which has a scale of 0-100, where zero represents no disability and scores greater than 60 represent very severe disability. 
Exclusion criteria included inability to diagnose pain related to the sacroiliac joint, sacroiliac joint pain due to inflammatory conditions, severe back pain deemed to be due primarily to other causes, history of recent major trauma to the pelvis, metabolic bone disease, or any condition that made treatment with the study devices infeasible or interfered with the ability to participate in physical therapy. Subjects involved in litigation, on disability leave, or receiving workers’ compensation related to their back or sacroiliac joint pain were also excluded.
Subjects were randomly assigned to sacroiliac joint fusion or non-surgical management in a two to one ratio. After six months of follow-up, subjects could elect to receive sacroiliac joint fusion surgery using iFuse. All of the subjects who were randomized to non-surgical management completed at least six months of follow-up before electing to cross over to surgery. There was no early crossover. Baseline assessments included medical history and physical examination. Subjects were scheduled for follow-up at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months after enrollment. At each follow-up, the subjects evaluated their pain and disability by completing questionnaires to assess pain and disability. 
Subjects assigned to non-surgical management began immediately with treatment consisting of one or more of the following: 1) management of pain with medication, including narcotics; 2) physical therapy; 3) steroid injections in the sacroiliac joint; and 4) radiofrequency ablation of local nerves. Physical therapy followed American Physical Therapy Association, or APTA, guidelines. Not all non-surgical management interventions were provided to all non-surgical management subjects. Non-surgical management interventions were provided serially, typically in order of increasing invasiveness, according to individual needs. 
A high-resolution pelvic CT scan was performed at the 24-month follow-up for those subjects randomized to and treated with iFuse. The primary purpose of the CT scan is to judge the adherence of bone onto the implants on both the sacral and iliac sides of the sacroiliac joint and to determine whether there is bone bridging across the joint. Other radiographic endpoints were assessed as well. 
The study required that subjects receive only the assigned treatment to month six. After six months, the study allowed subjects assigned to non-surgical treatment to cross over to surgery. Crossover was allowed because the anticipated success rate for non- surgical management was low, and many subjects would not have participated without the ability to cross over to surgical care within the study. One-hundred percent of subjects who crossed over to surgical treatment in the study did so shortly after their six-month visit was complete in compliance with the design of the study. Nearly 90% of non-surgical management subjects still participating at month six crossed over to surgical care. All subjects who crossed over had sacroiliac joint fusion using iFuse and were subsequently evaluated with follow-up visits. No early crossover occurred. 
In the study, 442 subjects at 19 centers were screened for participation, of which 148 were enrolled and treated. Mean subject age was 51 years and 18 (12%) were 65 years of age or older. Most subjects (94.6%) were Caucasian and approximately two-thirds were female. Follow-up was excellent with 96% of non-surgical subjects having 6-month follow-up and 87% of sacroiliac joint fusion patients having 24-month follow-up. 
The primary endpoint was a composite success or failure endpoint. Success was defined as reduction from baseline VAS sacroiliac joint pain by at least 20 points, absence of device-related serious adverse events, absence of neurological worsening related to the sacral spine, and absence of surgical re-intervention (removal, revision, reoperation, or supplemental fixation) for sacroiliac joint pain. Secondary endpoints included improvement from baseline in VAS, ODI, as well as treatment satisfaction and other criteria. Other important measures included quality of life assessments. 
Enrolled subjects were highly debilitated by sacroiliac joint pain as indicated by high baseline VAS scores (mean 82.3) and ODI scores (mean 56.8). Nineteen percent were not working due to chronic pain. The duration of pain prior to enrollment averaged 6.4 years (range 0.5 to 40.7 years), and 87.2% had had pain for more than one year and 73.6% had pain for more than two years.

Trial subjects had previously undergone sacroiliac-specific physical therapy (72.3% of subjects), sacroiliac steroid injections (85.8%) and radiofrequency ablation of the sacroiliac joint (16.2%). Approximately two-thirds were taking opioid pain medications at baseline and all reported that multiple activities commonly caused or worsened their sacroiliac joint pain.
All subjects assigned to sacroiliac joint fusion underwent the procedure. Of the subjects assigned to surgery, 76 had the iFuse procedure on one sacroiliac joint, while 26 underwent the procedure on both sacroiliac joints. Mean procedure time was 45 minutes (range 14 to 140 minutes). Mean estimated blood loss was 33 ml (range 0.5 to 250 ml). Three implants were used in 91.2% of cases and most implants were seven millimeters in diameter. The hospital length of stay ranged from zero to seven days, and 97.1% were discharged in two days or less. 
Of the 46 subjects assigned to non-surgical management: 

• | All but one received physical therapy during the six months after treatment assignment; 
• | 73.9% underwent at least one steroid injection; 
• | 45.7% underwent radiofrequency ablation of the sacroiliac joint; and 
• | 87.0% underwent at least two types of non-surgical management treatments in addition to pain medications.

The above data suggests that the intensity of non-surgical management interventions was high and representative of that provided in standard clinical practice.
INSITE clinical outcomes can be summarized as follows. 

• | Reduction in Pain. There was a statistically significant and clinically important reduction in pain among subjects treated with iFuse as compared to non-surgical management. As shown in the graph below, subjects surgically treated with iFuse had a mean 52-point VAS reduction in sacroiliac joint pain at six months. The reduction in pain was sustained with a mean 54- and 55-point reduction in sacroiliac joint pain observed at 12 and 24 months, respectively. By contrast, subjects in the non-surgical management group had only a mean 12-point reduction (p<0.0001) at six months. In addition, the non-surgical management group subjects who elected after six months to cross over to have the iFuse procedure had pain reduction similar to that seen in subjects originally assigned to sacroiliac joint fusion with iFuse. At 24 months, the proportion of subjects with a reduction in VAS sacroiliac joint pain of 20 or more points was 83% in the iFuse group and 10% in the non-surgical management group.

Subjects who elected not to cross over to surgery had reduced pain at six months, but their pain worsened somewhat over time. In contrast, the non-surgical management group subjects who elected to cross over to have the iFuse procedure had pain reduction similar to that seen in subjects originally assigned to sacroiliac joint fusion with iFuse. These clinically important differences show the effectiveness of sacroiliac joint fusion with iFuse. 

• | Reduction in Disability. There was a statistically significant reduction in disability with iFuse as compared to non-surgical management. As shown in the graph below, subjects surgically treated with iFuse had a mean 27-point ODI reduction in disability at six months, while subjects in the non-surgical management group had only a mean 4.6-point decrease (p<0.0001). At 12 and 24 months, the iFuse group had a mean 29- and 28-point reduction in disability, respectively. At six months, the proportion of subjects with ODI improvements of at least 15 points was 72.5% and 13.0% in the iFuse and non-surgical management groups, respectively. At 24 months, the proportion of subjects with an improvement of at least 15 points due to the assigned treatment was 68.2% and 7.5% in the iFuse and non-surgical management groups, respectively (p<0.0001).

As shown in the figure below, the subjects who elected after six months to cross over to have the iFuse procedure had similar reduction in disability as the subjects originally assigned to sacroiliac joint fusion with iFuse. These clinically important differences show the effectiveness of sacroiliac joint fusion with iFuse. 
10

Patient Satisfaction 
Patient satisfaction was assessed by asking subjects whether they were very satisfied, somewhat satisfied, somewhat dissatisfied or very dissatisfied with the treatment received. At six months, 79.0% of subjects who had received the iFuse procedure were very satisfied, compared with 27.3% of subjects in the non-surgical management group. At six months, 81.0% of surgery subjects said they would definitely have the procedure again. At 24 months, satisfaction rates were high, with 73.3% reporting being very satisfied with surgical treatment of the sacroiliac joint, and 71.1% indicated they would have the procedure again. These results are consistent with the satisfaction results from other iFuse studies, covering approximately 500 subjects. 
Adverse Events 
During the first six months, the mean number of adverse events per subject was slightly but not statistically significantly higher in the surgery group (1.3 events) as compared to the non-surgical management group (1.1 events, p=0.3063). The most common adverse event related to our implant was leg pain resulting from misplacement of the implant, resulting in impingement of the implant on a lumbar spine nerve root. The most common adverse event for our implant procedure has been minor wound infections. None of these adverse events required surgical treatment. The following table shows the number and percentages of subjects who had adverse events related to the iFuse device and the iFuse procedure.

In summary, we believe the INSITE study, a prospective, randomized controlled multi-center clinical trial, provides substantial evidence of clinically important and statistically significant efficacy supporting the superiority of sacroiliac joint fusion using iFuse as compared to non-surgical management. Further, the fact that subjects who crossed over responded, as well as those who were originally assigned to the iFuse group, adds significantly to the trial’s validity and importance. 
iMIA European Clinical Trial 
iMIA is a second prospective, randomized clinical trial of sacroiliac joint fusion using iFuse compared to non-surgical management with a design very similar to that of INSITE. iMIA enrolled and included treatment of 103 subjects at nine sites in four European countries. The trial’s six-month results were published in European Spine Journal in May 2016 and 12-month results were published in August 2017 in Pain Physician. Twenty-four month results were published in March 2019 in The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery. 
In iMIA, 103 adults with chronic sacroiliac joint pain at nine sites in four European countries were randomly assigned in a one-to-one ratio to either immediate sacroiliac joint fusion with iFuse or conservative management. Conservative management was performed according to the European guidelines for the diagnosis and management of pelvic girdle pain and consisted of optimization of medical therapy, individualized physical therapy and adequate information and reassurance as part of a multifactorial treatment. 
At 24 months, low back pain in the surgically treated group improved by 45 points and ODI improved by 26 points (p<.0001 from baseline). Adverse events occurred at a low rate and the frequency of adverse events did not differ meaningfully between groups. One case of postoperative nerve impingement occurred in the surgical group, which was resolved by repositioning the implant. 
The figure below shows low back pain scores at baseline and throughout follow-up, as well as several other endpoints. The results show clinically profound, rapid and sustained reduction in pain following treatment with iFuse, in contrast with conservative management. The results also show parallel improvements in disability and quality of life.

SIFI Clinical Trial 
Sacroiliac Joint Fusion with iFuse Implant System, or SIFI, is a prospective, multicenter single-arm clinical trial. Eligibility criteria and endpoints were identical to INSITE. A manuscript summarizing 24-month results was published in International Journal of Spine Surgery in April 2016. Each of the 172 enrolled subjects received the iFuse procedure at one of 26 participating sites between August 2012 and December 2013. Mean subject age was 51 years and 96.5% of subjects were Caucasian and approximately 70% were female. Follow-up rates at month 6, 12, and 24 were 97%, 91%, and 87%, respectively. 
Baseline sacroiliac pain and disability scores were high. The mean baseline VAS score was 79.8, while the mean baseline ODI score was 55.2. The mean duration of pain prior to enrollment was five years (range 0.4 to 41 years), and 84.3% had had pain for more than one year and 64.5% had had pain for more than two years. 
Seventy-six percent were taking opioid pain medications at baseline and all reported that multiple activities commonly caused their sacroiliac joint pain. Many subjects (44.2%) had a history of prior lumbar fusion, and concomitant spine disease was common. Sacroiliac joint pain persisted despite prior treatments with physical therapy (64.5% of subjects), sacroiliac joint steroid injections (94.2%), and prior radiofrequency ablation of the joint (15.7%). 
Hospital length of stay ranged from zero to seven days, and 95.3% were discharged in two days or less. Prolonged hospital stays were related to subject comorbidities, not procedure-related adverse events.
The figure on the left below shows mean VAS pain scores at baseline and throughout follow-up. The figure on the right shows mean ODI scores at baseline and throughout follow-up. The results for both VAS pain and ODI scores each show clinically important and sustained reduction in disability across the subject population and follow-up period, consistent with the results observed in the surgical group in INSITE. 
14

Satisfaction rates were high, with 78.1% reporting being very satisfied with sacroiliac joint treatment by month 24 and 93.8% being very or somewhat satisfied. 74.7% indicated they would definitely have the procedure again; 88.4% indicated they would probably or definitely have the procedure again. 
The most common adverse events were wound infection, irritation or drainage, sacroiliac joint pain related to implant malposition, and recurrent sacroiliac joint pain related to inadequate device placement. One subject had a deep wound infection that required surgical debridement. Four adverse events (2.4% of all subjects) were rated by the investigator to be definitely device-related and three (1.8%) were probably device-related. Pain related to implant impingement on sacral nerve roots occurred in three cases (including one non-study-related side), all of which resolved with immediate repositioning of implants. In four cases, sacroiliac joint or hip pain was attributed to the presence of an implant or bone growth around the implant. Twenty-six events were rated as probably or definitely related to the placement procedure. 
LOIS Clinical Trial 
LOIS is a prospective follow-on study, enrolling subjects at a subset of INSITE and SIFI sites who underwent sacroiliac joint fusion. Enrolled subjects will be followed out to five years following surgery. Study outcomes at four years were published in Medical Devices: Evidence and Research in August 2018. Among 103 enrolled subjects, mean sacroiliac joint pain at four years decreased from 82 preoperatively to 27 (a 54-point improvement from baseline, p<.0001), as shown in the graph below. 
15

Subjects in the LOIS study experienced similar improvements in disability and quality of life. As shown in the graph above on the right, average disability prior to treatment as measured on the ODI scale was 56 and fell to an average of 30 by 48 months following treatment, a 26 point improvement compared to the commonly accepted 15-point threshold for meaningful change in this measure. Quality of life scores also improved markedly in this study. Average quality of life as measured by the EuroQol-5D prior to treatment was 0.45 and had improved to 0.75 by 48 months following treatment with iFuse.
Additional Published Clinical Studies 
We have demonstrated the long-term durability of pain relief resulting from treatment with iFuse in several other published studies. A study published in the Open Orthopedics Journal in 2014, which we financially supported, showed that significant clinical pain relief observed at 12 months was maintained for five years. Similar results with four and one-half year follow-up were published in the Journal of Spine in 2014. A retrospective multicenter analysis of three-year outcomes after sacroiliac joint fusion with iFuse showed similar responses. 
Among eleven clinical studies including more than 500 patients in which satisfaction with the iFuse procedure was measured, an average of 92% of participants were satisfied or very satisfied with the results of the surgery. We financially supported nine of these 11 studies. 
To date, several studies, some of which we did not sponsor, have been published on the safety and effectiveness of sacroiliac joint fusion using iFuse. These are prospective or retrospective, single site or multi-site, and U.S.- or Europe-based. These clinical studies demonstrate the iFuse procedure to be safe and effective. These studies demonstrate pain reduction and/or ODI improvement that is statistically significant and clinically important. The type and rate of reported adverse events were similar to those reported in INSITE, iMIA, and SIFI. These additional studies are consistent with the results of INSITE, iMIA, and SIFI. 
A study published in April 2017 in Neurosurgery shows the impact of non-coverage of sacroiliac joint fusion by the healthcare system. In this study, a Spanish neurosurgeon reports the clinical experience of 423 patients seen in his clinic for sacroiliac joint pain. While many patients’ pain resolved without intervention, 152 of the patients (36%) had continued sacroiliac joint pain. Of these patients, 74 did not have access to the procedure due to their insurers’ denial of coverage and instead were only able to pursue continued non-surgical treatment. Of the remaining 78 patients, 51 underwent radiofrequency ablation of lateral branches of sacral nerve roots and 27 underwent sacroiliac joint fusion with iFuse. 
16

The group treated non-surgically had poor outcomes, including increased pain, disability, and opioid use, as well as worsened work status. By contrast, patients who were able to undergo the iFuse procedure had very large improvements in pain and disability, improved work status, and a decreased incidence of opioid use. The differences in all outcomes (pain, disability, work status, and opioid use) were both statistically significant and clinically profound. The graph below shows the pain scores of the three treatment cohorts followed in this study. 
The graph below shows the changes in the percentage of subjects using opioids among the iFuse and conservative care groups in the study. Forty-nine percent of subjects who were not able to access treatment with iFuse were using opioids at the beginning of the study, whereas 80% of them were using opioids at the time of their final follow-up. In contrast, 63% of the subjects who were able to obtain treatment with iFuse were using opioids prior to treatment, whereas only 7% were using opioids at their final follow-up visit. 
17

There are several important aspects to this study: 

• | It can be considered a “pseudorandomized trial” in that insurance denials (which dictated which treatment the patient could receive) was not clearly related to any important predictor of clinical outcomes. This enhances the comparability of groups.
• | It is the longest reported cohort of non-surgical treatment of sacroiliac joint pain published to date. 
• | Non-surgical treatment was clearly associated with poor outcomes, consistent with our experience in the US, in which patients receive repeated, and sometimes expensive, non-surgical treatments but do not derive significant benefit. 

We recently finished enrollment in SALLY, a prospective single-arm multicenter trial of iFuse-3D for the treatment of sacroiliac joint dysfunction. The enrolled patient population was very similar to that of INSITE, SIFI and iMIA. Early results from SALLY show preoperative and six-month pain scores that are nearly identical to those of the three earlier prospective trials of iFuse. In addition, SALLY showed improvements in physical function tests and a larger reduction in opioid usage. A manuscript describing early SALLY results was submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal in February 2019.
In addition to clinical evidence, a number of economic publications we financially supported, including those in ClinicoEconomics and Outcomes Research, demonstrate that the iFuse procedure provides a cost savings to the healthcare system when compared to non-surgical management over time. One of these studies used data from INSITE to calculate the incremental cost-effectiveness of the iFuse procedure and found it to be similar to that of hip and knee arthroplasty, commonly known as total joint replacement. The two latter procedures are generally accepted as being safe, effective, and highly cost-effective. The incremental cost effectiveness ratio, or ICER, of a procedure or therapy is a common way of quantifying its cost-effectiveness and represents the incremental cost to the healthcare system of providing one additional quality adjusted life-year, obtained by dividing the average cost of the therapy by the average increase in quality-adjusted life years that it achieves. Therapies with ICERs below $50,000 are considered cost-effective and generally gain acceptance. For example, studies have shown that the ICER of total joint replacement surgery for knees is approximately $12,000 and that for hip replacements is approximately $10,000. One study showed the ICER of the iFuse procedure to be $13,000, nearly as cost-effective as knee and hip surgeries, which are both common and well-accepted procedures. The ICER of iFuse derived from data from the INSITE trial is significantly better than the published ICERs of other common spine surgeries derived from one of the few other randomized controlled clinical trials of spine surgeries. Published analyses of the data from this trial showed the ICER of discectomy to be approximately $21,000, the ICER of standard decompressive laminectomy to be approximately $64,000, and the ICER of posterior decompressive laminectomy to be approximately $59,000. Each of these is a commonly performed spine surgery. 
A second study detailed a health economics model examining the cost impact of failing to consider the sacroiliac joint in the diagnosis of patients with low back pain in patients seeking surgery. Taking into account both the prevalence of sacroiliac joint dysfunction and the costs of diagnostic workup and surgical treatment, if a surgeon evaluating a patient with chronic low back pain fails to consider the sacroiliac joint, on average $3,100 more healthcare expenditures will ensue. The study concluded that taking the sacroiliac joint into account can save healthcare systems substantial amounts due primarily to reduction in misdiagnosis and its attendant costs. 
A third study used data from our two prospective trials conducted in the United States to examine the impact of sacroiliac joint fusion on worker productivity. Results suggest that sacroiliac joint fusion can increase the productivity of affected workers by an average of $6,900 compared to continued non-surgical care. 
A fourth health economic study conducted by Optum, a division of UnitedHealth Group, and published in October 2018 examined healthcare costs for low back pain before and after sacroiliac joint fusion in patients in a commercial insurance database. Analysis showed reductions in median low back pain-related healthcare costs after sacroiliac joint fusion compared to before. A break-even analysis for health plan reimbursements for patients undergoing minimally invasive sacroiliac joint fusion on an outpatient basis showed similar cumulative claims for patients not undergoing the procedure within approximately 2.5 years. Following the procedure, per patient costs related to sacroiliac joint pain decrease to approximately $250 per quarter among the group who underwent sacroiliac joint fusion.

Our Second-Generation Implant 
Our second-generation iFuse implant, iFuse-3D, shown on the left below, was cleared for marketing by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in March 2017 and the European Union in May 2017. This patented titanium implant combines the triangular cross-section of the iFuse implant with a proprietary 3D-printed porous surface and fenestrated design. This design also allows the surgeon to fill the implant with ground-up bone before implanting it, which some surgeons believe accelerates bone through-growth. iFuse-3D implants have shown positive bony ingrowth in cell culture and animal studies, whether or not ground-up bone is used, as shown in two peer reviewed studies published in June 2017 in the International Journal of Spine Surgery. The image on the right below shows the cross section cut from an iFuse-3D implant removed from an animal as part of the study and reveals robust growth of bone into and through the implant. We have completed enrollment of SALLY, described above, a clinical trial to evaluate the performance of iFuse-3D.

Coverage and Reimbursement 
Coverage and reimbursement for iFuse products and related procedures vary by setting of care, payor type, and region. In the United States, healthcare providers that purchase iFuse products look to various third-party payors, such as Medicare, Medicaid, private commercial insurance companies, health maintenance organizations, accountable care organization, or ACOs, and other healthcare-related organizations, to cover and pay for all or part of the costs of these procedures. These providers bill patients for any applicable deductibles or co-payments. Sales volumes and prices of company products will continue to depend in large part on the availability of coverage and reimbursement from such third-party payors. 
The Medicare program is commonly used as a model for how private payors and other governmental payors develop their coverage and reimbursement policies for healthcare items and services, including iFuse procedures. Unless a national coverage policy exists for a particular technology, each of the Medicare Administrative Contractors is permitted to make its own determination of whether that item or service is covered by Medicare. 
Medicare’s reimbursement rates for the iFuse procedure vary due to geographic location, the nature of facility in which the procedure is performed (i.e., hospital inpatient department, hospital outpatient department, or ambulatory surgical center) and other factors. Medicare reviews and updates its payment rates and methodologies for these settings of care annually, and rates can change from year to year. In addition, Congress can alter reimbursement rates at any time by mandating changes to Medicare’s payment methodologies. 
Similarly, private payor coverage policies and reimbursement rates tend to vary across payors and settings of care. Payors continually review the clinical evidence for new technologies and can change their coverage policies without notice or deny payment if the product was not used in accordance with the payor’s coverage policy. Payors also review and challenge the prices charged for products and procedures. 
In the United States, the American Medical Association, or AMA, generally creates specific billing codes for surgical procedures under a coding system known as Current Procedure Terminology, or CPT, which surgeons must use to bill and receive reimbursement for our iFuse procedure. Once the CPT code is established, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, establishes payment levels and coverage rules under Medicare while private payors establish rates and coverage rules independently. 
Prior to our launch of iFuse, Medicare and most private insurance companies reimbursed surgeons for sacroiliac joint fusions using either an established Category I CPT code or an unlisted code. A Category I CPT code is typically assigned to procedures that are consistent with contemporary medical practice and are widely performed. Procedures with a longstanding Category I CPT code are usually reimbursed. 
However, effective July 1, 2013, the AMA’s CPT Editorial Panel created a new Category III CPT code for fusion of the sacroiliac joint using a minimally invasive or percutaneous approach. Category III CPT codes are used for new and emerging technologies and are reimbursed sporadically. This new code functionally redefined coding for sacroiliac joint fusions because it meant that minimally invasive or percutaneous fusion procedures should not be billed using the general Category I CPT code for sacroiliac fusion surgery. This coding change was accompanied by the establishment of a Medicare hospital outpatient prospective payment rate for the new code. 
Following the creation of the new Category III CPT code, a number of papers demonstrating the clinical success of the iFuse procedure were published. As a result of these studies, along with the support of several professional medical specialty societies and leading academic surgeons, the AMA CPT Editorial Panel established a new Category I CPT code specifically for sacroiliac joint fusion surgery using a minimally invasive or percutaneous approach. This new Category I CPT code became effective on January 1, 2015. However, the new code did not immediately lead to positive coverage decisions by payors. In many cases, the payors wanted additional published evidence before deciding to cover the procedure. As a result, positive reimbursement decisions covering the procedure have occurred over the last few years, and some payors are still in the process of making decisions based on the most recent evidence. 
In March 2015, our INSITE prospective, randomized controlled multi-center clinical trial was published. In June 2015, the largest spine society in the world, the North American Spine Society, or NASS, published a positive coverage recommendation, based on the clinical evidence, advocating to insurance companies and Medicare Administrative Contractors that sacroiliac joint fusion using a minimally invasive surgical approach should be routinely reimbursed. In March 2015, the International Society for Advancement of Spine Surgery, or ISASS, also published a similar, updated positive advocacy document intended to encourage insurance companies in the United States to reimburse for the procedure. 
20

Coverage decisions for this code are made independently by each private insurance company and each of the Medicare Administrative Contractors that help manage Medicare. The process of obtaining coverage is laborious. As of June 30, 2016, because of the iFuse clinical evidence, all Medicare Administrative Contractors were covering the procedure. At the time, very few private payors were covering. As of December 31, 2017, U.S. payors covering 162 million lives regularly reimbursed for the iFuse procedure. However, by December 31, 2018, U.S. payors covering 256.5 million lives regularly reimbursed for the iFuse procedures, a 58% increase over December 31, 2017. Of the 65 largest private payors that we track, 45 had positive coverage policies for the procedure, were consistently covering the procedure, or had announced coming future coverage. 
Third-party payors, whether governmental or commercial, are also developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling healthcare costs. In addition, in the United States, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for medical device products and services exists among third-party payors. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for medical device products and services can differ significantly from payor to payor. In addition, payors continually review new technologies for possible coverage and can, without notice, deny coverage for these new products and procedures. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that requires us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained, or maintained if obtained. 
In addition to uncertainties surrounding coverage policies, there are periodic changes to reimbursement. Third-party payors regularly update reimbursement amounts and also from time to time revise the methodologies used to determine reimbursement amounts. This includes annual updates to payments to physicians, hospitals, and ambulatory surgical centers for procedures during which our products are used. An example of payment updates is the Medicare program’s updates to hospital and physician payments, which are done on an annual basis using a prescribed statutory formula. 
Specialty benefit managers and companies which perform healthcare technology assessments have significant influence on coverage decisions. In May 2016, the ECRI Institute Health Technology Assessment Information Service published a positive review of the iFuse Implant System, citing our clinical evidence. In January 2018, the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, the licensor to all 36 Blue Cross and Blue Shield insurers across the United States, wrote a favorable review of the clinical evidence conferring a positive coverage recommendation for minimally invasive sacroiliac fusion, but only when performed with iFuse. In February 2018, Milliman Care Guidelines, a Hearst Company publication, also recommended coverage and in May 2018, AIM Specialty Health, owned by Anthem, established coverage for only iFuse and none of our competitors. In October 2018, eviCore recommended our iFuse system exclusively for sacroiliac joint fusion or stabilization. 
Private Payors. Private payors also decide whether to cover and how much to pay on an individual basis. We target and track 65 of the largest private payors that cover 256.5 million lives in the United States as of December 31, 2018. Of the targeted and tracked payors, 45 were covering regularly, or had announced coverage for, the iFuse procedure, while the remaining private payors were reevaluating their coverage policies. Of the private payors who are covering regularly, 26 have issued positive coverage policies exclusive to iFuse for sacroiliac joint fusion because of the clinical evidence. Twenty of these exclusive coverage policies have published since January 1, 2018. The private payors covering iFuse exclusively are:

As of December 31, 2018, U.S. payors covering 256.5 million lives reimburse for iFuse, 121.7 million of which are covered by private payors. The chart below shows the overall coverage as of December 31, 2018: 
Note that because many individuals are covered by more than one health insurance plan or may switch plans during the year, the total number of covered lives reported by the payors represented above may be larger than the number of individuals who have access to the iFuse procedure through their health insurance provider at any given time. 
There are a number of large and small private payors, including Aetna, Cigna, Humana, and Anthem, that are not yet reimbursing for the procedure. Some of these non-covering payors are reevaluating coverage given the latest data, but there can be no assurance they will reach positive coverage decisions. In most cases, the payors who are not covering are reevaluating coverage. Many payors will only review their coverage policies for a procedure on a scheduled basis, which can be every few months or as infrequently as once per year. 
23

Prior to payor coverage, surgeons have been reluctant to get trained on a procedure for which they could not reliably be reimbursed. While we believe the increased coverage described above will have a positive effect on the number of iFuse procedures and our associated revenue in the future, the effect likely will happen with a lag time: after a positive coverage decision is made, a number of months may pass before it impacts the number of procedures and associated revenue, since the surgeons have to be made aware of the coverage decision, schedule re-examinations of patients who were candidates for surgery and subsequently schedule surgeries for the patients who are still candidates. We believe it takes between 6 and 24 months for surgeons to fully incorporate iFuse into their practices after payors initiate coverage. Further, the administrative burden on surgical practices can be substantial for patients where reimbursement coverage is new, and some surgeons do not believe that the current average surgeon reimbursement is yet adequate to compensate them. However, as reimbursement coverage has improved, surgeon interest in learning to diagnose the sacroiliac joint and perform iFuse procedures has been increasing. 
Coverage Outside the United States 
Outside the United States, reimbursement levels vary significantly by country, and by region within some countries. Reimbursement is obtained from a variety of sources, including government-sponsored and private health insurance plans, and combinations of both. Some countries will require us to gather additional clinical data before recognizing and granting broader coverage and reimbursement for our products. 
In April 2017, the UK’s National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, or NICE, published guidance on minimally invasive sacroiliac joint fusion, recommending that the procedure be available to properly diagnosed patients in the UK National Health System. NICE develops guidance and quality standards in health and social care and is a worldwide leader in technology evaluations. The recommendation states that the safety and efficacy of minimally invasive sacroiliac joint fusion surgery is adequate provided that standard arrangements are in place. Use with standard arrangements is the most positive recommendation that NICE can make for an interventional procedure such as MIS SI joint fusion. In October 2018, NICE published medical technology guidance specific to the iFuse Implant System, recommending that it be used in the National Health System because of the evidence demonstrating that treatment with iFuse improves pain, quality of life, and disability in properly selected patients. Additionally, in August 2018, the public hospital system in France announced it would initiate coverage for iFuse exclusively beginning September 6, 2018. Some countries will require us to gather additional clinical data before recognizing and granting broader coverage and reimbursement for our products. It is our intent to complete the requisite clinical studies and obtain coverage and reimbursement approval beyond what we have today in countries where it makes economic sense to do so. 
Medical Affairs and Education 
We have created a medical affairs team that focuses both internally and externally. Internally, specialized medical knowledge, and practical experience with iFuse are used to help train our sales, marketing, quality, reimbursement, clinical, regulatory, engineering, and product development teams. This same specialized medical knowledge and practical experience allow us to create and execute a wide variety of programs to train the relevant external medical community, to assist them in identifying and diagnosing patients with sacroiliac joint dysfunction and in performing the iFuse procedure. The medical affairs team is led by a board-certified fellowship trained orthopedic spine surgeon. As of December 31, 2018, our U.S. faculty consisted of 82 surgeons, 22 pain management physicians, 15 nurse practitioners/physician’s assistants, and 90 physical therapists. These third-party consultants educate surgeons, physician’s assistants, nurses, physical therapists, and other healthcare professionals regarding sacroiliac joint diagnosis and the iFuse procedure.
Our surgeon training programs are for orthopedic spine surgeons, neurosurgeons, general orthopedic surgeons, and orthopedic trauma surgeons. Since its introduction, over 1,800 surgeons have treated patients with iFuse. We also have a large number of educational programs for the broader medical community including primary care physicians and other healthcare practitioners that may manage a sacroiliac joint patient non-surgically, such as physical therapists, pain management physicians, and chiropractors. As of December 31, 2018, our medical affairs team and physical therapist consultants have educated over 4,600 physical therapists on sacroiliac joint dysfunction, its diagnosis and iFuse as a potential treatment. We also work to educate case managers, facilities where the iFuse procedure is performed such as hospitals, as well as payors and health plans. For example, as of December 31, 2018, we have trained over 1,200 case managers across the United States. Case managers help patients navigate the healthcare system so that they receive the appropriate treatment. In addition to the continuing education program for case managers, we have created continuing education programs for physical therapists and chiropractors. As of December 31, 2018, our physical therapy continuing education programs were approved in 47 states. These programs include instruction on the diagnosis and non-surgical treatment of sacroiliac joint dysfunction due to degenerative sacroiliitis and sacroiliac joint disruptions. Our medical affairs programs focus on working with leading spine surgeons to educate other surgeons on the differential diagnosis of sacroiliac joint disorders and the use of iFuse. We also work closely with medical societies to raise the awareness of and the appropriate diagnosis of sacroiliac joint dysfunction and the associated treatment options.

Sales and Marketing 
We market and sell iFuse primarily through a direct sales force and a small number of third-party distributors. Our target customer base includes approximately 7,500 surgeons who perform spine and/or pelvic surgery, including orthopedic spine surgeons, neurosurgeons, general orthopedic surgeons, and orthopedic trauma surgeons. 
Our direct sales organization in the United States was comprised of seven sales regions as of December 31, 2018. Each region is comprised of a number of territory sales managers who act as the primary customer contact. Our territory sales managers have extensive training and experience selling medical devices for spine problems and pain management, generally focusing on emerging technologies and markets. For large and/or high volume territories, we also employ territory associate representatives who cover cases. As of December 31, 2018, our territory sales managers were led by seven regional sales managers who reported to our Vice President of U.S. Sales. The Vice President of U.S. Sales reports to our Chief Commercial Officer. As of December 31, 2018, our U.S. sales force consisted of 45 sales representatives directly employed by us, and 30 third-party distributors. 
In addition to general sales and marketing training, we provide our sales organization with comprehensive, hands-on cadaveric and dry-lab training sessions focusing on the clinical benefits of our products and how to use them. We believe our robust training and professional development programs have been an important component of our success to date and will help support our anticipated future growth. We expect to continue to increase the size of our sales organization in order to increase sales and market penetration and to provide the significant, ongoing level of customer support required by our sales and marketing strategy. 
As of December 31, 2018, we had 27 employees working in our European operations, and have established operations in Italy (2010), Germany (2014), and the United Kingdom (2015). As of December 31, 2018, our international sales force consisted of 14 sales representatives directly employed by us and 23 exclusive third-party distributors, which together had sales in 33 countries through December 31, 2018. We anticipate continuing to build our operations in the major European countries while establishing distributor arrangements in smaller ones. We intend to follow a similar model in Europe to the one established in the United States, working with internationally recognized healthcare professional experts as we expand our training and reimbursement activities. As of December 31, 2018, beyond Europe and the United States, surgeons had performed the first iFuse procedures in Australia, Cayman Islands, Hong Kong, Israel, Japan, Kuwait, New Zealand, Saudia Arabia, Taiwan and Turkey. 
Research and Development 
Since our initial launch of the iFuse system, we have introduced a number of new instrument enhancements, product enhancements and procedure enhancements. An example is the iFuse-3D implant, which we developed over several years and launched in 2017. The most notable instrument enhancement was the release of the revamped instruments set which included a number of radiolucent instruments. 
In 2017, we introduced an instrument set which is cleared for use with Medtronic’s surgical navigation system, allowing the surgeon to visualize the positioning of certain instruments intra-operatively. In March 2018, we introduced surgical pins cleared for use with the Mazor surgical robot, allowing the surgeon to robotically place the guide pin according to a computer-generated surgical plan. We expect to continue developing enhancements to iFuse to meet our customers’ changing needs and improve the surgery’s effectiveness. For example, we know that some surgeons use iFuse to treat SI joint dysfunction in patients in whom the surgeon is also implanting other devices to treat other spine conditions. We are developing products and techniques to help surgeons improve the treatment of these patients, and we will seek any additional regulatory clearances which may be required. We also design and manufacture, Class I instruments for our surgeon customers based on special request under our “Non-Standard Product” program. 
Competition 
We believe we were the first company to develop, manufacture, and market a minimally invasive implant cleared by the FDA expressly for sacroiliac joint fusion other than a modified screw. Over the past several years, other companies have subsequently recognized the opportunity and have entered the minimally invasive sacroiliac joint fusion market. However, all of these products are either screw-based or allograft products. We expect more competitors to enter into the market and an increased number of new product introductions by existing competitors. Many of our competitors are large, publicly traded companies that can dedicate far greater resources to the minimally invasive sacroiliac joint market than we can. These companies often have wide product offerings for spine and orthopedic surgery, which allow them to bundle products in order to win large hospital group contracts and can increase the barrier to entry for us. For example, some of our competitors offer sacroiliac joint fusion products which integrate with their surgical navigation and robotics platforms, enabling navigation of their procedures or performance of aspects of these procedures by surgical robots. Many of these companies also have much larger sales forces than ours, which allow them to reach more surgeons. We also expect there to be a continued push for non-surgical alternatives. 
25

In the United States, we believe that our primary competitors currently are Globus Medical, Inc., Medtronic plc, XTant Medical Holdings, Inc., and RTI Surgical, Inc. Our primary competitors in Europe are Globus Medical, SIGNUS Medizintechnik GmbH, and XTant Medical Holdings. However, they sell screw-based products, which we believe to be weaker and less able to resist rotation than our triangular iFuse implants. We also compete against non-hardware products, such as allograft bone implants. These allograft products comprise human cells or tissues and are regulated by the FDA differently from implantable medical devices made of metallic or other non-tissue based materials, unless they include specific claims about their intended use which exceed a homologous use, or use consistent with the original function of the donor tissue. 
Based on our commercial experience and market research, we believe iFuse is currently used in the majority of minimally invasive surgical fusions of the sacroiliac joint in the United States. iFuse is the only minimally invasive product for sacroiliac joint fusion commercially available in the United States that, to our knowledge, is supported by published clinical evidence including randomized controlled studies that demonstrate the safety, clinical effectiveness, durability, and economic utility. These benefits are supported by more than 65 published papers. 
The following are the primary competitive factors on which companies compete in our industry: 

• | product and clinical procedure effectiveness; 
• | ease of surgical technique and use of associated instruments; 
• | safety; 
• | published clinical outcomes and evidence; 
• | sales force knowledge; 
• | product support and service, and customer service; 
• | comprehensive training, including disease, anatomy, diagnosis and treatment;
• | product innovation and the speed of innovation; 
• | intellectual property; 
• | accountability and responsiveness to customers’ demands; 
• | pricing and reimbursement; 
• | scientific (biomechanics) data; and 
• | attracting and retaining key personnel. 

Intellectual Property 
We protect our intellectual property through our pending patent applications and issued patents. As of December 31, 2018, we had been issued 35 patents in the United States, five patents in Japan, three in Europe and one in China. Also, as of December 31, 2018, we have 14 pending patent applications in the United States and five pending patent applications outside of United States. We have focused the majority of our foreign patent efforts in China, Europe, and Japan. Generally, our current U.S. patents are expected to expire between August 2024 and September 2035, and our Japanese patents are expected to expire between August 2025 and October 2031. 
We have 12 registered trademarks in the United States and have filed for two more. In other countries, we have focused on registering three primary trademarks: “iFuse Implant System,” “SI-BONE,” and the SI-BONE logo. As of December 31, 2018, we have sought protection for at least two of these trademarks in 60 countries including the 28 European member countries of the Madrid Protocol. 
We also rely upon trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological innovation, and may rely upon licensing opportunities in the future, to develop and maintain our competitive position. We may seek to protect our proprietary rights through a variety of methods, including confidentiality agreements and proprietary information agreements with suppliers, employees, consultants and others who may have access to proprietary information, under which they are bound to assign to us inventions made during the term of their employment. 
26

The term of individual patents depends on the legal term for patents in the countries in which they are granted. In most countries, including the United States, the patent term is generally 20 years from the earliest claimed filing date of a non-provisional patent application in the applicable country. There can be no assurance that patents will be issued from any of our pending applications or that, if patents are issued, they will be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection for our technology. Notwithstanding the scope of the patent protection available to us, a competitor could develop treatment methods or devices that are not covered by our patents but that compete with our proprietary technology and products. Furthermore, numerous U.S. and foreign issued patents and patent applications owned by third parties exist in the fields in which we are developing products. Because patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be applications unknown to us, which applications may later result in issued patents that our existing or future products or proprietary technologies may be alleged and/or found to infringe. 
There has been substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the medical device industry. In the future, we may need to engage in litigation to enforce patents issued or licensed to us, to protect our trade secrets or know-how and brands, to defend against claims of infringement of the rights of others or to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others. Litigation could be costly and could divert our attention from other functions and responsibilities. Adverse determinations in litigation could reduce the barriers to entry that we have established for iFuse, or subject us to significant liabilities to third parties, require us to seek licenses from third parties or prevent us from manufacturing, selling or using iFuse, any of which could severely harm our business. 
27

Regulation 
Domestic Regulation of Our Products and Business 
Our research, development and clinical programs, as well as our manufacturing and marketing operations, are subject to extensive regulation in the United States and other countries. Most notably, all of our products sold in the United States are subject to the FDCA as implemented and enforced by the FDA. The FDA governs the following activities that we perform or that are performed on our behalf, to ensure that medical products distributed domestically or exported internationally are safe and effective for their intended uses: 

• | product design, development, and manufacture; 
• | product safety, testing, labeling, and storage; 
• | record keeping procedures; 
• | product marketing, sales, distribution and export; and 
• | post-marketing surveillance, complaint handling, medical device reporting, reporting of deaths, serious injuries or device malfunctions, and repair or recall of products.

There are numerous FDA regulatory requirements governing the clearance or approval and marketing of our products. These include: 

• | product listing and establishment registration, which helps facilitate FDA inspections and other regulatory action; 
• | investigational device exemptions to conduct premarket clinical trials, which include extensive monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements; 
• | QSR, which requires manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the manufacturing process; 
• | labeling regulations and FDA prohibitions against the promotion of products for uncleared, unapproved or off-label use or indication; 
• | clearance of product modifications that could significantly affect safety or effectiveness or that would constitute a major change in intended use of one of our cleared devices; 
• | approval of product modifications that affect the safety or effectiveness of one of our approved devices; 
• | medical device reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers comply with FDA requirements to report if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or has malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction of the device or a similar device were to recur;
• | post-approval restrictions or conditions, including post-approval study commitments; 
• | post-market surveillance regulations, which apply when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device; 
• | the FDA’s recall authority, whereby it can ask, or under certain conditions order, device manufacturers to recall from the market a product that is in violation of governing laws and regulations; 
• | regulations pertaining to voluntary recalls; and 
• | notices of corrections or removals. 

We have registered our facility with the FDA as a medical device manufacturer. The FDA has broad post-market and regulatory enforcement powers. We and our third-party manufacturers are subject to announced and unannounced inspections by the FDA to determine our compliance with the QSR and other regulations and these inspections may include the manufacturing facilities of our suppliers. 
28

FDA Premarket Clearance and Approval Requirements 
Unless an exemption applies, each medical device we wish to commercially distribute in the United States will require either premarket notification, or 510(k), clearance or approval of a PMA from the FDA. The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes. Devices deemed to pose lower risks are placed in either Class I or II, which typically requires the manufacturer to submit to the FDA a premarket notification requesting permission to commercially distribute the device. This process is generally known as 510(k) clearance. Some low risk devices are exempted from this requirement. Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risks, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices, or devices deemed not substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510(k) device, are placed in Class III, requiring a PMA. If the FDA agrees that the device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device currently on the market, it will grant 510(k) clearance to commercially market the device. If the FDA determines that the device is “not substantially equivalent” to a previously cleared device, the device is automatically designated as a Class III device. The device sponsor must then fulfill more rigorous PMA requirements, or can request a risk-based classification determination for the device in accordance with the “de novo” process, which is a route to market for novel medical devices that are low to moderate risk and are not substantially equivalent to a predicate device. All of our currently marketed products are Class II devices, subject to 510(k) clearance. 
After a device receives 510(k) marketing clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change or modification in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) marketing clearance or, depending on the modification, PMA approval. The determination as to whether or not a modification could significantly affect the device’s safety or effectiveness is initially left to the manufacturer using available FDA guidance. Many minor modifications today are accomplished by a “letter to file” in which the manufacture documents the rationale for the change and why a new 510(k) is not required. However, the FDA may review such letters to file to evaluate the regulatory status of the modified product at any time and may require the manufacturer to cease marketing and recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or PMA approval is obtained. The manufacturer may also be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties. 
Clinical Trials 
Clinical trials are generally required to support a PMA application and are sometimes required for 510(k) clearance. Such trials for implanted devices such as iFuse generally require an investigational device exemption application, or IDE, approved in advance by the FDA for a specified number of subjects and study sites, unless the product is deemed a nonsignificant risk device eligible for more abbreviated IDE requirements. Clinical trials are subject to extensive monitoring, recordkeeping and reporting requirements. Clinical trials must be conducted under the oversight of an institutional review board, or IRB, for the relevant clinical trial sites and must comply with FDA regulations, including but not limited to those relating to good clinical practices. To conduct a clinical trial, we also are required to obtain the subjects’ informed consent in form and substance that complies with both FDA requirements and state and federal privacy and human subject protection regulations. We, the FDA, or the institutional review board, or IRB, could suspend a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the risks to study subjects outweigh the anticipated benefits. Even if a trial is completed, the results of clinical testing may not adequately demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the device or may otherwise not be sufficient to obtain FDA clearance or approval to market the product in the United States. Similarly, in Europe the clinical study must be approved by a local ethics committee and in some cases, including studies with high- risk devices, by the ministry of health in the applicable country. 
29

Pervasive and Continuing Regulation 
After a device is placed on the market, numerous regulatory requirements continue to apply. These include: 

• | Product listing and establishment registration, which helps facilitate FDA inspections and other regulatory action; 
• | QSR, which requires manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation, and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the manufacturing process; 
• | labeling regulations and FDA prohibitions against the promotion of products for uncleared, unapproved or off-label use or indication; 
• | clearance of product modifications that could significantly affect safety or effectiveness or that would constitute a major change in intended use of one of our cleared devices; 
• | approval of product modifications that affect the safety or effectiveness of one of our approved devices; 
• | medical device reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers comply with FDA requirements to report if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or has malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction of the device or a similar device were to recur;
• | post-approval restrictions or conditions, including post-approval study commitments; 
• | post-market surveillance regulations, which apply when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device; 
• | the FDA’s recall authority, whereby it can ask, or under certain conditions order, device manufacturers to recall from the market a product that is in violation of governing laws and regulations; 
• | regulations pertaining to voluntary recalls; and 
• | notices of corrections or removals. 

The FDA has broad post-market and regulatory enforcement powers. We are subject to unannounced inspections by the FDA to determine our compliance with the QSR and other regulations, and these inspections may include the manufacturing facilities of some of our subcontractors. Failure by us or by our suppliers to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA or other regulatory authorities, which may result in sanctions including, but not limited to: 

• | untitled letters, warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees, and civil penalties; 
• | unanticipated expenditures to address or defend such actions 
• | customer notifications for repair, replacement, refunds; 
• | recall, detention or seizure of our products; 
• | operating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production; 
• | refusing or delaying our requests for 510(k) clearance or PMA approval of new products or modified products;
• | operating restrictions; 
• | withdrawing 510(k) clearances or PMA approvals that have already been granted; 
• | refusal to grant export approval for our products; or 
• | criminal prosecution. 

The FDA inspected our facilities in May 2014. As a result, we received a Form 483 with three observations that have been since been corrected following a corrective and preventative action plan. We responded to the Agency in writing and the matter was closed as of October 2014. To date, the FDA has not taken any further actions with respect to the May 2014 inspection or its findings. The FDA inspected our facilities again in December 2016. As a result, no findings were noted. 
Promotional Materials—“Off-Label” Promotion 
Advertising and promotion of medical devices, in addition to being regulated by the FDA, are also regulated by the Federal Trade Commission and by state regulatory and enforcement authorities. If the FDA determines that our promotional materials or training constitutes promotion of an unapproved use, it could request that we modify our training or promotional materials or subject us to regulatory or enforcement actions, including the issuance of an untitled letter, a warning letter, injunction, seizure, civil fine, or criminal penalties. It is also possible that other federal, state, or foreign enforcement authorities might take action if they consider our promotional or training materials to constitute promotion of an unapproved use, which could result in significant fines or penalties under other statutory authorities, such as laws prohibiting false claims for reimbursement. In that event, our reputation could be damaged and adoption of the products would be impaired. 
30

In addition, under the federal Lanham Act and similar state laws, competitors, and others can initiate litigation relating to advertising claims. 
International Regulation of Our Products 
Our research, development and clinical programs, as well as our manufacturing and marketing operations, are subject to extensive regulation in other countries. For example, in the EEA our devices are required to comply with the Essential Requirements concerning medical devices. Compliance with these requirements entitles us to affix the CE mark to our medical devices, without which they cannot be commercialized in the EEA. 
To demonstrate compliance with the Essential Requirements, we must undergo a conformity assessment procedure, which varies according to the type of medical device and its classification. Except for low risk medical devices (Class I with no measuring function and which are not sterile), where the manufacturer can issue an EC Declaration of Conformity based on a self-assessment of the conformity of its products with the Essential Requirements, a conformity assessment procedure requires the intervention of a Notified Body, which is an organization designated by the competent authorities of a EEA country to conduct conformity assessments. The Notified Body typically audits and examines products’ Technical File and the quality system for the manufacture, design and final inspection of our devices before issuing a CE Certificate of Conformity demonstrating compliance with the relevant Essential Requirements. Following the issuance of this CE Certificate of Conformity, we can draw up an EC Declaration of Conformity and affix the CE mark to the products covered by this CE Certificate of Conformity and the EC Declaration of Conformity. We have successfully completed several Notified Body audits since our original certification in November 2010. Following these audits, our Notified Body issued International Standards Organization Certificates and CE Certificates of Conformity allowing us to draw up an EC Declaration of Conformity and affix the CE mark to certain of our devices. 
After the product has been CE marked and placed on the market in the EEA, we must comply with a number of regulatory requirements relating to: 

• | registration of medical devices in individual EEA countries; 
• | pricing and reimbursement of medical devices; 
• | establishment of post-marketing surveillance and adverse event reporting procedures;
• | Field Safety Corrective Actions, including product recalls and withdrawals; and 
• | interactions with physicians. 

Failure to comply with these requirements may result in enforcement measures being taken against us by the competent authorities of the EEA countries. These can include fines, administrative penalties, compulsory product withdraws, injunctions, and criminal prosecution. Such enforcement measures would have an adverse effect on our capacity to market our products in the EEA and, consequently, on our business and financial position. 
Further, the advertising and promotion of our products in the EEA is subject to the provisions of the Medical Devices Directive, Directive 2006/114/EC concerning misleading and comparative advertising, and Directive 2005/29/EC on unfair commercial practices, as well as other national legislation in the EEA countries governing the advertising and promotion of medical devices. These laws may limit or restrict the advertising and promotion of our products to the general public and may impose limitations on our promotional activities with healthcare professionals. 
Regulatory Status 
In November 2008, we received 510(k) clearance to market our first generation iFuse implant from the FDA. Since 2008, we have received additional FDA 510(k) clearances for new instruments, additional implant sizes and labeling changes. In the United States, the iFuse Implant System is intended for sacroiliac fusion for conditions, including sacroiliac joint dysfunction that is a direct result of sacroiliac joint disruptions and degenerative sacroiliitis. This includes conditions where symptoms began during pregnancy or in the peripartum period and have persisted postpartum for more than six months. Clinical Studies have demonstrated that treatment with the iFuse Implant System improved pain, patient function, and quality of life. In the future, we plan to pursue additional 510(k) clearances for new products and changes to the current indication for iFuse. 
In November 2010, we obtained a CE Certificate of Conformity and affixed a CE mark to our iFuse Implant System to allow commercialization of iFuse in the EEA. In the EEA and Switzerland, iFuse is intended for sacroiliac joint fusion. Since 2010, we have added additional instruments, implant sizes and labeling updates and iFuse-3D, our second generation iFuse implant, to our product offerings in Europe. We plan to continue to work with our Notified Body to incorporate new products and labeling updates in our Technical Files for CE marking in European. 
31

Since July 2013, we have obtained approval for iFuse in regions beyond the United States and the EEA, including Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, Israel, Malaysia, New Zealand, Saudi Arabia, Singapore and Taiwan. We are currently collecting information to determine our regulatory strategy in Japan. 
Healthcare Fraud and Abuse 
Federal and state governmental agencies and equivalent foreign authorities subject the healthcare industry to intense regulatory scrutiny, including heightened civil and criminal enforcement efforts. These laws constrain the sales, marketing and other promotional activities of medical device manufacturers by limiting the kinds of financial arrangements we may have with hospitals, physicians and other potential purchases of our products. Federal healthcare fraud and abuse laws apply to our business when a customer submits a claim for an item or service that is reimbursed under Medicare, Medicaid, or other federally funded healthcare programs. Descriptions of some of the laws and regulations that may affect our ability to operate follows. 
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, items or services for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under federal healthcare programs. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, and the government can establish a violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute without proving that a person or entity had actual knowledge of, or a specific intent to violate, the law. The Anti-Kickback Statute is subject to evolving interpretations and has been applied by government enforcement officials to a number of common business arrangements in the medical device industry. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution; however, those exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and there is no exception or safe harbor for many common business activities. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute, but the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on the totality of the facts and circumstances. A number of states also have anti-kickback laws that establish similar prohibitions that may apply to items or services reimbursed by government programs, as well as by any third-party payors, including commercial payors. 
The civil False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, knowingly presenting or causing the presentation of a false or fraudulent claim for payment of federal funds, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government. A claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the Anti- Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act. Actions under the False Claims Act may be brought by the government or as a qui tam action by a private individual in the name of the government. Qui tam actions are filed under seal and impose a mandatory duty on the U.S. Department of Justice to investigate such allegations. Most private citizen actions are declined by the Department of Justice or dismissed by federal courts. However, the investigation costs for a company can be significant and material even if the allegations are without merit. There are also criminal penalties, including imprisonment and criminal fines, for making or presenting a false or fictitious or fraudulent claim to the federal government. 
False Claims Act liability is potentially significant in the healthcare industry because the statute provides for treble damages and mandatory penalties of $11,181 to $22,363 per claim (adjusted annually for inflation). Because of the potential for large monetary exposure, healthcare companies often resolve allegations without admissions of liability for significant and sometimes material amounts to avoid the uncertainty of treble damages and per claim penalties that may awarded in litigation proceedings. Moreover, to avoid the risk of exclusion from federal healthcare programs as a result of a False Claims Act settlement, companies may enter into corporate integrity agreements with the government, which may impose substantial costs on companies to ensure compliance. 
In addition, HIPAA created federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. 
The federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, implemented by CMS as the Open Payments program, requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program to report annually to CMS information related to payments or other “transfers of value” made to physicians and teaching hospitals, and requires applicable manufacturers to report annually to CMS ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members and payments or other “transfers of value” to such physician owners. 
Certain states also mandate implementation of corporate compliance programs, impose restrictions on device manufacturer marketing practices, and/or require tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation, and other remuneration to healthcare professionals and entities. 
32

The FCPA and similar anti-bribery laws in other countries, such as the UKBA, generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials and/or other persons for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws. 
Violations of these federal and state fraud and abuse laws can subject us to administrative, civil, and criminal penalties, including imprisonment, substantial fines, penalties, damages, and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. 
Data Privacy and Security Laws 
We are also subject to various federal, state and foreign laws that protect the confidentiality of certain patient health information, including patient medical records, and restrict the use and disclosure of patient health information by healthcare providers, such as HIPAA, as amended by HITECH, in the United States. 
HIPAA requires the notification of patients, and other compliance actions, in the event of a breach of unsecured PHI. If notification to patients of a breach is required, such notification must be provided without unreasonable delay and in no event later than 60 calendar days after discovery of the breach. In addition, if the PHI of 500 or more individuals is improperly used or disclosed, we could be required to report the improper use or disclosure to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, which would post the violation on its website, and to the media. Failure to comply with the HIPAA privacy and security standards can result in civil monetary penalties up to $55,910 per violation, not to exceed $1.68 million per calendar year for non-compliance of an identical provision, and, in certain circumstances, criminal penalties with fines up to $250,000 per violation and/or imprisonment. 
In addition, even when HIPAA does not apply, according to the FTC, failing to take appropriate steps to keep consumers’ personal information secure constitutes unfair acts or practices in or affecting commerce in violation of Section 5(a) of the FTCA, 15 U.S.C § 45(a). The FTC expects a company’s data security measures to be reasonable and appropriate in light of the sensitivity and volume of consumer information it holds, the size and complexity of its business, and the cost of available tools to improve security and reduce vulnerabilities. Medical data is considered sensitive data that merits stronger safeguards. The FTC’s guidance for appropriately securing consumers’ personal information is similar to what is required by the HIPAA Security Rule. 
In the European Union, we may be subject to laws relating to our collection, control, processing and other use of personal data (i.e. data relating to an identifiable living individual). We process personal data in relation to our operations. We process data of our employees, consultants and certain individuals who may be affiliated with our customers, including physician users of our products. The personal data may include sensitive personal data including health information. The data privacy regime in the EU includes the EU General Data Protection Regulation, or the GDPR, effective on May 25, 2018 and the E-Privacy Directive 2002/58/EC and national laws implementing each of them. Each EU Member State may adopt additional legislation implementing these regulations into its own national data privacy regime and therefore the laws may differ by jurisdiction, sometimes significantly. We need to ensure compliance with the rules in each jurisdiction where we are established or are otherwise subject to local privacy laws. 
The new EU-wide GDPR became applicable on May 25, 2018, replacing the data protection laws previously issued by each EU member state based on the Directive 95/46/EC. Unlike the Directive (which needed to be transposed at national level), the GDPR text is directly applicable in each EU Member State, resulting in a more uniform application of data privacy laws across the EU. The GDPR imposes onerous accountability obligations requiring data controllers and processors to maintain a record of their data processing and policies. It requires data controllers to be transparent and disclose to data subjects (in a concise, intelligible and easily accessible form) how their personal information is to be used, imposes limitations on retention of information, increases requirements pertaining to pseudonymized (i.e., key-coded) data, introduces mandatory data breach notification requirements and sets higher standards for data controllers to demonstrate that they have obtained valid consent for certain data processing activities. Fines for non-compliance with the GDPR will be significant—the greater of EUR 20 million or 4% of global turnover. The GDPR provides that EU member states may introduce further conditions, including limitations, to the processing of genetic, biometric, or health data, which could limit our ability to collect, use and share personal data, or could cause our compliance costs to increase, ultimately having an adverse impact on our business. 
We are subject to the supervision of local data protection authorities in those jurisdictions where we are established or otherwise subject to applicable law. We depend on a number of third parties in relation to our provision of our services, a number of which process personal data on our behalf. With each such provider we enter into contractual arrangements to ensure that they only process personal data according to our instructions, and that they have sufficient technical and organizational security measures in place. Where we transfer personal data outside the EEA, we do so in compliance with the relevant data export requirements. We take our data protection obligations seriously, as any improper disclosure, particularly with regard to our customers’ sensitive personal data, could negatively impact our business and/or our reputation. 
33

Manufacturing and Supply 
We use third-party manufacturers to produce our instruments and implants. The majority of our instruments have secondary manufacturing suppliers and we continually work with additional manufacturers to establish secondary suppliers. Our iFuse implants are currently provided by a single source, Orchid Bio-Coat, a division of Orchid Orthopedic Solutions LLC. In April 2016, we entered into a Quality and Manufacturing Agreement with Orchid MPS Holdings, LLC, or Orchid, which agreement was amended in March 2017, pursuant to which Orchid manufactures certain of our implants in accordance with our specifications. We purchase product under the agreement pursuant to purchase orders we are required to deliver against a blanket purchase order we provide based on our product forecast. However, while we are required to purchase the amounts forecast in the blanket purchase order, we are not required to purchase product in excess of a specified amount of inventory based on our original forecast. During the first year of the agreement, the prices we pay for products are fixed under the agreement; provided that on an annual basis thereafter we will meet with Orchid to review changes in direct costs beyond certain thresholds and may negotiate changes to prices based on such changes in costs. In addition, the prices we pay for product may be increased with our consent to the extent such products are ordered with delivery timelines shorter than agreed upon order timelines. The initial term of the agreement is three years; provided, however, the agreement may be terminated immediately by (a)(i) either party as the result of the other party’s bankruptcy or insolvency, (ii) in the case of Orchid, our failure to make payments for products purchased under the agreement if such failure continues for a specified period after notice from Orchid, or (iii) either party as the result of a material breach of the agreement and such breaching party fails to cure such breach within a specified period after notice from the non-breaching party, (b) us in the event Orchid fails to remedy any deficiencies we may identify pursuant to our right to inspect Orchid’s facilities under the agreement, and (c) either party with prior written notice as provided under the agreement. To mitigate supply risk, we carry a minimum of two months of reserve stock based on current sales estimates and typically place implant orders with Orchid prior to estimated demand. 
We have also added a second source supplier for machine parts. On February 1, 2017, we entered into a non-exclusive Manufacturing, Quality and Supply Agreement with rms Company, or RMS, pursuant to which RMS manufactures certain of our implants in accordance with our specifications, including both purchased and sterilized iFuse-3D implants, as well as uncoated machined implants which are subsequently coated to become our finished first generation iFuse implants. We amended this agreement on July 7, 2017 to provide for our purchase of product pursuant to purchase orders we must deliver against a blanket purchase order we provide based on our product forecast. While we are required to purchase the amounts forecast in the blanket purchase order, we are not required to purchase product in excess of a specified amount of inventory based on our original forecast. During the initial three-year term of the agreement, the prices we pay for products are fixed under the agreement provided that if order volumes deviate from forecasted amounts beyond certain thresholds we or RMS may request to negotiate further price changes. After the initial term, the agreement automatically renews for successive one-year periods; provided, however, the agreement may be terminated early by either party in the event of a material breach of the agreement by the other party or by the insolvency of the other party. We may terminate the agreement at any time in the event (i) RMS fails to ship conforming product and such failure results in delays as specified in the agreement, (ii) RMS changes its manufacturing site without our prior approval, (iii) of a change of control of RMS, or (iv) RMS breaches a non-solicit covenant with respect to our employees or consultants. With respect to our first generation iFuse implant, the parts manufactured by RMS need to be coated by Orchid to finish the goods. RMS is currently our only supplier of iFuse-3D implants. 
Aside from quality agreements, we do not currently have manufacturing agreements with any of our other manufacturers and orders are controlled through purchase orders. 
We believe that our manufacturing operations, and those of our suppliers, comply with regulations mandated by the FDA, as well as Medical Devices Directive regulations in the EEA. Manufacturing facilities that produce medical devices or component parts intended for distribution world-wide are subject to regulation and periodic planned and unannounced inspection by the FDA and other domestic and international regulatory agencies. 
In the United States, products we sell are required to be manufactured in compliance with the FDA’s QSR, which covers the methods used in, and the facilities used for, the design, testing, control, manufacturing, labeling, quality assurance, packaging, storage, and shipping. In international markets, we are required to obtain and maintain various quality assurance and quality management certifications. We have obtained the following international certifications: Quality Management System ISO13485, Full Quality Assurance Certification for the design and manufacture of iFuse, and a Design Examination certificate for iFuse.

We are required to demonstrate continuing compliance with applicable regulatory requirements to maintain these certifications and will continue to be periodically inspected by international regulatory authorities for certification purposes. Further, we and certain of our suppliers are required to comply with all applicable regulations and current good manufacturing practices. As set forth above, these FDA and international regulations cover, among other things, the methods and documentation of the design, testing, production, control, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, sterilization, storage, and shipping of our products. Compliance with applicable regulatory requirements is subject to continual review and is monitored rigorously through periodic inspections. If we or our manufacturers fail to adhere to current good manufacturing practice requirements, this could delay production of our products and lead to fines, difficulties in obtaining regulatory approvals, recalls, enforcement actions, including injunctive relief or consent decrees, or other consequences, which could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. 
Product Liability and Insurance 
The manufacture and sale of our products subjects us to the risk of financial exposure to product liability claims. Our products are used in situations in which there is a risk of serious injury or death. We carry insurance policies which we believe to be customary for similar companies in our industry. We cannot assure you that these policies will be sufficient to cover all or substantially all losses that we experience. 
We endeavor to maintain executive and organization liability insurance in a form and with aggregate coverage limits that we believe are adequate for our business purposes, but our coverage limits may prove not to be adequate in some circumstances. 
Employees 
As of December 31, 2018, we had 183 employees, including sales and marketing, product development, general administrative and accounting, both domestically and internationally. As of December 31, 2018, we had a direct field sales organization of 83 in the United States and 19 in Europe. In the United States, we sell primarily through our direct field organization, and we have 30 third-party distributors. None of our employees is subject to a collective bargaining agreement, and we consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
