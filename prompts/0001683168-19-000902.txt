Plan of Operation
 
Mobiquity has hired several new sales and sales support individuals in the first quarter of 2019 to help generate additional revenue through the use of the Advangelists platform. Mobiquity’s sales team will focus on Advertising Agencies, Brands and publishers to help increase both supply and demand across the Advangelists platform. The Advangelists platform creates three revenue streams for Mobiquity. The first is licensing the Advangelists platform as a white-label product for use by Advertising Agencies, DSP’s and Brands. Under the White-Label scenario, the user licenses the technology and is responsible for running its own business operations and is billed a percentage of volume run through the platform. The second revenue stream is a managed services model, in which, the user is billed a higher percentage of revenue run through the platform, but all services are managed by the Mobiquity/Advangelists team. The third revenue model is a seat model, whereas the user is billed a percentage of revenue run through the platform and business operations are shared between the user and the Mobiquity/Advangelists team. The goal of the sales team is to inform potential users of the benefits in efficiency and effectiveness of utilizing the end-to-end, fully integrated ATOS created by Advangelists.

We provide accurate and precise location data on approximately fifty (50,000,000) million mobile devices to help marketers and researchers better understand consumer’s real-world behavior and trends.

Strategy
 
Mobiquity Networks derives its revenue utilizing the revenue streams mentioned above. All the products used to derive revenue for the Company are reliant on the collection of data. To achieve management’s revenue goals moving forward, we have developed a strategy to increase the two main driving forces behind our data collection. One strategy is to increase the total number of users we see on a monthly basis (“MAU”), and the second strategy is to increase the total number of locations (Places) available to see our MAU’s over the same time period. We are currently seeing over 50,000,000 unique mobile devices on a monthly basis. To continue to grow the total number of unique devices we can see on a monthly basis, we need to increase our partnerships. We believe our unique offering to potential partners gives us a competitive advantage over others in the industry. The task of partnering to increase MAU’s is handled internally by our business development team.

As of April 2019, we had approximately 5,000,000 Places in our proprietary Places database. We have been able to steadily increase the number of locations available in our Places database through the use of both open source and proprietary technologies. The task of growing our Places database is handled by our internal technology team. The Company currently utilizes both internal and outsourced resources to market and sell its product offerings.
 
Agreements with Developers
 
Due to the evolution of the Mobiquity Network’s business model, our agreements with Mall developers are no longer considered essential to our business operations as our Places data base has grown to include these locations making malls a subset within our retail category. This is the major reason why we have allowed our mall developer contracts to expire or be terminated.
Our Proprietary Technology Platform
 
Mobiquity Networks has developed a highly accurate and scalable proprietary cloud-based location platform to allow millions of connected devices to easily and securely log billions of events per day and receive user notifications in real or near real-time.
 
Mobiquity Networks’ platform analyzes a combination of raw location signal when collecting mobile data to identify user patterns in densely populated urban areas, indoor specific locations or desired points of interest. This data is additionally analyzed and enriched with how often users visit specific locations, and how much time they spend at each location. The resulting combined contextual data ensures clients receive highly accurate insights into consumers’ offline behavior.
 
Mobiquity Networks’ platform is hosted and managed on Amazon Web Service (AWS) and takes full advantage of open standards for processing, storage, security and big data technology. Specifically, the Mobiquity Networks platform uses the following AWS services: EC2, Lambda, Kafka, Kinesis, S3, Storm, Spark, Machine Learning, RDS, Redshift, Elastic Map Reduction, CloudWatch, and Elastic Search Service with built-in Kibana integration.
 
Mobiquity Networks’ unique approach to validating mobile device location produces extremely precise and accurate location data.
 
The Mobiquity Networks’ proprietary intelligence provides all the existing location manager functionality plus adds the following benefits:
 

☐ | advanced location technology capabilities (such as always-on location services, enhanced accuracy, lower battery drain, and others);
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


☐ | automatic venue recognition;
--+-----------------------------


☐ | access to physical address and venue map database; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------


☐ | a detailed location analytics.
--+-------------------------------

 
Mobiquity Networks has assembled a comprehensive location database to convert geographical coordinates to a physical address in the real world. This database includes the street level venue storefronts and entrance for businesses in the U.S., addresses, building polygons, venue polygons, and other related points of interest information. Currently this database has over 5 million locations and continues to be populated thereby improving the platforms’ algorithm for user accuracy.
 
Utilizing massively parallel cluster computing and machine learning algorithms and technology, Mobiquity Networks processes user dwell-time and frequency of visitation data within all location signals available to segment highly targetable audiences for marketing and research. This data processing provides valuable, actionable geo-behavioral data for marketers, researchers and application publishers and made available through an automated platform.

Intellectual Property 
 
In March 2013, we formed Mobiquity Networks and Mobiquity Wireless in Spain. Mobiquity Wireless then acquired the assets of our then licensor, FuturLink. These assets include, without limitation, the FuturLink technology which consists of patent applications, source codes and trademark(s). The patent applications acquired related to the hardware and associated process for identifying and acquiring connections to mobile devices and the process for delivering select content to users on an opt-in basis. We believe our acquisition of FuturLink’s technology and corresponding patent applications provided us with the flexibility and autonomy to improve, upgrade and integrate new ideas and cutting-edge technologies into our existing platform. This has allowed us to evolve as new technologies emerge. To date, we have been granted four patents and published several additional patents. We believe that our intellectual property is a valuable asset to us as we move forward with our technology platform.

Integrated Marketing Company
 
Our former subsidiary, Ace Marketing & Promotions, Inc. (or Ace Marketing), which was sold on October 1, 2017 had historically represented substantially all of the operating revenues. Ace Marketing was an integrated marketing company focused on working with clients to grow their business. Ace Marketing’s core business was to provide a wide range of quality promotional products to a wide range of corporate, non-profit and educational clients. In addition, Ace Marketing offered brand analysis and development, website analysis and development, database analysis and building, and integrated marketing campaigns using: direct mail, email marketing, mobile marketing, promotional products and other mediums that helped our clients connect with their customers and acquire new business.

Competition
 
We compete in the location data, marketing and research business and in all other facets of our business against small, medium and large companies throughout the United States. Some examples include companies such as Placed, Factual and Foursquare. Although we can give no assurance that our business will be able to compete against other companies with greater experience and resources, we believe we have a competitive advantage with our proprietary Places Database, software and technology platform.
Employees
 
As of March 30, 2019, we have 19 full time employees, including executive management, technical personnel, salespeople, and support staff employees. We also utilize several additional firms/persons who provide services to us on a non-exclusive basis as independent consultants.
